On March 27, 1912, plaintiff\u2019s intestate was employed by defendant as a laborer in collecting logs and transporting them to defendant\u2019s factory, and while driving a team of horses, attached to a wagon heavily loaded with logs, down a steep incline, at or near Elk Brook, aforesaid, sustained personal injuries, in consequence of which he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">In this action, brought to recover damages for the pecuniary injury resulting therefrom, various grounds of negligence are alleged, the principal of which are supplying decedent with \u201can improper and imperfect brake or means of blocking the wheels of said wagon while passing down said steep incline,\u201d and failure on the part of defendant\u2019s superintendent to properly attach a rope to the said load for the purpose of assisting to lower it down said incline. Defendant answered, denying any negligence upon her part, and affirmatively alleging contributory negligence upon the part of decedent, and the assumption by him of open, obvious and apparent risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-13\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Within nine days after the joining of issue, defendant moved to change the place of trial from Kings county to Delaware c.ounty, upon the ground that the convenience of witnesses would be promoted thereby. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 987. Upon the merits, defendant was \u2022clearly entitled to the relief asked for. The action being transitory in character, the general rule is that the place of trial should be the \u25a0county in which the cause of action arose. Jacobson v. German-American Button Co., 124 App. Div. 251, 108 N. Y. Supp. 795; Pinkus v. United Cloak &amp; Suit Co., 124 App. Div. 535, 108 N. Y. Supp. 932; Neeley v. Erie Railroad Co., 134 App. Div. 781, 119 N. Y. Supp. 953; Studebaker Bros. Co. v. W. N. Y. &amp; P. Traction Co., 140 App. Div. 308, 125 N. Y. Supp. 224; Neiman v. Gardner, 145 App. Div. 197, 129 N. Y. Supp. 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-14\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Defendant names ten material and necessary witnesses whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>she proposes to call upon the trial of the action. All but one of these reside at Elk Brook. He resides at Hazel, Sullivan county. Several of these witnesses, their names being specified in the moving affidavit, defendant alleges will testify that the wagon furnished decedent was in good condition, that the brake shoe was in perfect order, and that decedent himself loosed this brake shoe thereby causing the accident. One or more of the witnesses, also named in the moving affidavit, defendant alleges will testify that the rope was securely fastened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">The only affidavit submitted in opposition to the motion is made' by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and is to the effect that \u201cdeponent is informed and believes that the occurrence which resulted in the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was witnessed by only two. persons besides himself,\u201d and that \u201cit is desired on the part of the plaintiff to produce two or more witnesses in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim who reside in the city of New York, and one, and perhaps two, witnesses who live in. Delaware county, New York.\u201d This affidavit is entirely insufficient, for it fails to state either the names of the witnesses whom plaintiff proposes to call, or to state the substance of the testimony to be given by them, or to show how it is material. McPhail v. Ridout, 83 Hun, 446, 31 N. Y. Supp. 934; Lyman v. Gramercy Club, 28 App. Div. 30, 50 N. Y. Supp. 1004; Lyman v. Corey, 28 App. Div. 623, 51 N. Y. Supp. 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Respondent contends, however, that defendant has waived her right to make this application. Issue was joined on November 18, 1912. On the same day plaintiff noticed the cause for trial for the December term to be held in Kings county, and on the same day, and as defendant now asserts, by inadvertence, a cross-notice of trial was served by her attorney: On November 21st, and before the making of the motion to change the place of trial, defendant served upon plaintiff\u2019s attorney a notice to the effect that she withdrew her cross-notice of trial for the December term, and plaintiff\u2019s attorney indorsed thereon the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-7\">\u201cService of the within notice, withdrawing defendant\u2019s notice, is hereby admitted this 21st day of November, 1912.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">Whether or no this may be a consent upon his part to the withdrawal of defendant\u2019s notice of trial, we think that, under the circumstances here disclosed, it cannot be said'that defendant waived her right to move to change the place of trial for the convenience of witnesses. If she had accepted a benefit, such as an extension of time to plead, under an agreement, express or implied, that she would try the action in the county in which it was originally brought, or had obtained a postponement of the trial when regularly reached upon the call of the calendar, a different question would be presented (Haiz v. Starin, 1 N. Y. St. Rep. 553; Coleman v. Hayes, 92 App. Div. 575, 87 N. Y. Supp. 12; Schaaf v. Denniston, 121 App. Div. 504, 106 N. Y. Supp. 168); but in this case defendant received no benefit, nor has plaintiff\u2019s position in any way changed by an inadvertent service of a notice on defendant\u2019s part, which, before it had been acted upon, and with great promptness, was withdrawn. There is no suggestion that, in\" the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>terval between the service of the notice on the 18th of November and defendant\u2019s withdrawal'thereof on the 21st of November, plaintiff had taken any steps to prepare for the trial of the action in Kings county, or that in any other manner his position had been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">We think that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
