The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was entirely predicated upon this written instrument. The plaintiff offered the instrument in evidence, and, upon the objection of the defendant, it was excluded, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-17\">The reason for its exclusion seems to have been that it was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>scribed in the complaint as a promissory note. The manner in which it was characterized in the complaint is immaterial. It was a written agreement, under the terms of which the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose. As such, it should have been received in evidence. The agreement itself contains all the elements necessary to constitute a promissory note. It follows that the instrument was improperly excluded, and that the court below erred in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
