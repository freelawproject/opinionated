The present action is brought to recover the 'balance of the installments, viz., $1,490, with interest. Annexed to and made a part of the complaint are the pleadings .in the action in the City Court, including the contract there sued on. The answer of the defendant in the City Court, besides denying certain allegations of the complaint, set up facts by way of defense and as a counterclaim for damages alleged to have been sustained, for which judgment was demanded. A reply was served in that action, which put in issue all of the allegations of the counterclaim. The defendant did not appear at the trial in the City Court action, and the plaintiff took judgment for the amount demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> In the present case the defendant interposed an answer, in which he admitted the recovery of the judgment in the City Court, and alleged: That the contract, as pleaded in the complaint, was not the one entered into between the parties. That the contract contained a provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">\u201cThat in case defendant failed to meet any payment within sixty days after the same became due, said failure would cause the total unpaid balance of the full price of said set of books to become due and payable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">And that the recovery of the judgment in the City Court, all of the installments under the contract being due, was a bar to the recovery of the installments here sued on. The answer also set up, by way of counterclaim, substantially the same facts that were pleaded as a counterclaim in the City Court action. After issue had been joined, the plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings, on the ground that the judgment rendered in the City Court action settled in his favor all of the issues sought to be raised by the defendant. The motion was granted, and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">I think the court erred in granting the judgment. If the contract between the defendant and plaintiff\u2019s assignor was as is claimed by the defendant\u2014and for the purposes of the motion it had to be accepted as true\u2014then all of the installments, at the time the action was commenced in the City Court, were due, and the plaintiff had to recover \u00abill of them, if at all. He could not recover four installments and thereafter bring another action to recover the others; and this under vhe well-settled rule that a plaintiff cannot split up an existing cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>of action by suing for some installments and reserving for future action others, which are already due. Kennedy v. City of New York, 196 N. Y. 19, 89 N. E. 360, 25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 847; Pakas v. Hollingshead, 184 N. Y. 211, 77 N. E. 40, 3 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1042, 112 Am. St. Rep. 601, 6 Ann. Cas. 60; Secor v. Sturgis, 16 N. Y. 548; Goldberg v. Eastern Brewing Co., 136 App. Div. 692, 121 N. Y. Supp. 465. Here was an issue which had to be disposed of upon the trial, and it could not be summarily disposed of on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Emanuel v. Walter, 138 App. Div. 818, 123 N. Y. Supp. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> I am also of the opinion that the counterclaim which had been put in issue by a reply had to be disposed of before judgment could be granted. While the facts upon which it is predicated are substantially the same as those pleaded in the City Court, that judgment did not dispose of it, since the defendant defaulted at the trial. Defendant\u2019s default does not, of course, render the former judgment less conclusive as to all matters which were necessarily determined in awarding plaintiff judgment (Brown v. Mayor, 66 N. Y. 390; Reich v. Cochran, 151 N. Y. 122, 45 N. E. 367, 37 L. R. A. 805, .56 Am. St. Rep. 607); but there was no investigation upon the merits of the counterclaim. That was simply dismissed, and such dismissal did not, in and of itself, thereafter prevent defendant from recovering upon it. Honsinger v. Union Carriage &amp; Gear Co., 175 N. Y. 229, 67 N. E. 436; Knickerbocker Trust Co. v. C. C. &amp; R. S. R. Co., 188 N. Y. 38, 80 N. E. 568; Barber v. Ellingwood, 137 App. Div. 704, 122 N. Y. Supp. 369. It was in effect a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Upon both grounds, therefore, I think the motion for judgment on the pleadings should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">It follows the order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for judgment denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
