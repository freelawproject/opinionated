Zeggio, one of the plaintiffs, under a commission heretofore issued for her examination. The action is brought to remove defendants as trustees under the will of Phebe H. Robinson, for the appointment of a receiver, for an accounting, and for other relief. In Wanamaker v. Megraw, 168 N. Y. 125, 61 N. E. 112, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-4\">\u201cThe settlement of the interrogatories is in no sense a decision that they are competent or proper, and the judge has no power to change or amend them, or to reject any of them. The allowance or settlement is required only for the purpose of authenticating the interrogatories as the ones which the commissioner is authorized to propound to the witness. He cannot propound any other than such as are thus allowed and authenticated by the judge, but the allowance has no other effect. This is very clear, since by section 892 \u2018either party must be allowed to insert therein any question, pertinent to the issue, which he proposes.\u2019 It is very plain, therefore, that the judge on the settlement cannot pass upon the competency of any question, and, of course, he cannot then know what answer will be given. Any question proposed by either party must be allowed, if pertinent to the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Applying these principles to the proposed interrogatories, it is sufficient to say that their pertinency is not made to appear by any facts now before us, and so far as the record shows they can have no bearing upon the issues between these parties at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, and the motion granted, to the extent of disallowing the interrogatories numbered 50 to 58, inclusive, with costs to the appellants. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
