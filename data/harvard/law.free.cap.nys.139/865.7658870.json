The order was in writing, upon a printed blank of defendant whi'ch contains the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-19\">\u201cThe said mdse, to be delivered about-190\u2014. We pay no freight or express charges. All goods f. o. b. Boston.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-21\">The defendant claims that the blank for the date contains the words \u201c20 Dec.,\u201d but a careful examination of the order and carbon copy, I think, shows clearly that the date of delivery was \u201c30 Dec.\u201d The goods were shipped from Boston on December 22d and received in New York on December 26th.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-22\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The defendant was permitted to testify that at the time the order was given he told the salesman that the calendars were ,intended for the Christmas trade and must be delivered before December 20th. This evidence was clearly incompetent, and tended to vary the written term that delivery was to be made \u201cabout\u201d December 30th.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-23\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Even if the date of delivery of the order was \u201cabout 20 December,\u201d the contract called for a shipment f. o. b. Boston. The goods were shipped on December 22d, and, unless the word \u201cabout\u201d is to be entirely disregarded, this delivery was in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Judgment should be reversed, with costs, and judgment directed for the plaintiff for the amount demanded in the complaint, with costs..
