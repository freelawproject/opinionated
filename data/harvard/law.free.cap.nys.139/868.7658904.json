The defendant then obtained 120 days within which to.malee and serve a case. No such case having been served, the respondent moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>dismiss the appeal, which by order entered December 27, 1912,^ was granted, unless appellant procured return to be filed and case printed and served and filed, and the cases on the calender for argument, one on January 13, and the-other on January 22, 1913. Up to these dates no case was served, and appellant now moves for additional time to have the cases on the calendar ready for argument. He bases this application on the fact that one of the oEcial stenographers was in Europe during the summer, and that it was therefore impossible to obtain the minutes, and for that reason appellant could not prepare the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In answer to the allegation, it appears that the oEcial stenographer was not in Europe, that the appellant could have obtained the stenographer\u2019s minutes at any time, and that no order was given for the minutes to the stenographer until after January 1, 1913. This would appear to be a deliberate attempt to deceive the court. There is not a particle of excuse for the failure of defendant to file the case within the time allowed by the trial court. There is not a particle of excuse for the failure of defendant to prepare and serve case and papers on appeal within the time allowed by this court. The defendant\u2019s attorney, having failed to comply with the rules requiring him to print and serve case and papers on appeal, to excuse such default, has made an aEdavit which is misleading and could only be intended to deceive. Such practice cannot be too strongly condemned, and it must result in a denial of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Motion to extend time is therefore denied, with $10 costs, and the appeal stands dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
