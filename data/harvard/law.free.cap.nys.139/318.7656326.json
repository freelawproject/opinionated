Brennan v. Joline, 70 Misc. Rep. 537, 127 N. Y. Supp. 676. Disbursements are not taxable, unless so specified in the order. Wilson v. Lange (Sup.) 84 N. Y. Supp. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The omission in the order of this court to grant the plaintiffs $10 costs and disbursements upon the affirmance of the order granting a new trial in the City Court upon the ground of newly discovered evidence was evidently an oversight, and the plaintiffs should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>applied for a resettlement of the order. Unless the defendants will stipulate that the plaintiffs may tax $10 costs and their disbursements, a motion to resettle the .order will be entertained. As the case now stands, however, the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the item of $20 before argument, $40 for argument, and $48.38 disbursements, stricken from the bill of costs allowed in the lower court as appeal costs, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
