With this evidence out of the case, there is no sufficient basis for a recovery. The testimony of the disinterested witnesses merely shows that at some time the decedent retained part of plaintiff\u2019s wages, but it does not show for how long a period the practice continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
