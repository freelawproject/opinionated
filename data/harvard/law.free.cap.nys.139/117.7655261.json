Upon the first trial plaintiff had a judgment, which was affirmed by the Appellate Term, and its determination reversed by this court, and a new trial ordered. 141 App. Div. 475, 126 N. Y. Supp. 430. The second trial also resulted in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Appellate Term, and the defendant appeals from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">The facts are fully set forth in the opinion delivered on the former appeal, so that it is unnecessary to restate them. It was there said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-18\">\u201cThe notice sent by defendant to plaintiff that it had recovered the draft for the latter\u2019s credit was undoubtedly enough to lay the foundation for an estoppel, if it appear that plaintiff, in reliance upon such notification, had done anything, or refrained from doing anything, to its damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>On the second trial proof was offered for the purpose of showing, that the defendant was estopped from asserting that the draft had, in fact, been credited to the plaintiff, The testimony of plaintiff\u2019s cashier was taken by commission, and he testified, in answer to a question whether the plaintiff refrained from doing anything with respect to the indebtedness of the Merchants\u2019 &amp; Farmers\u2019 Bank, in consequence of the receipt of the postal card from the defendant to the effect that the draft had been received for its credit, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201cBut for the receipt of the card from the defendant, the plaintiff would have made a strong effort to collect the $1,000, now in litigation with the .National Reserve Bank, from the Merchants\u2019 &amp; Farmers\u2019 Bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">It is claimed that this additional proof brings the case within our former decision, entitling the plaintiff to recover. This would be so, if the defendant had proved, in addition, that it sustained damage by reason of its not making \u201cthe effort to collect.\u201d It was bound to prove that it not only did \"not do anything, but, if it had, the debt, or some part of it, could have been collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The determination of the Appellate Term is therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">MILLER, J., dissents..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
