Sections 51 and 55 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. In the case of Grocers\u2019 Bank v. Penfield, 69 N. Y. 502, at page 504 (25 Am. Rep. 231), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201cit is universally conceded that the holder o\u00ed an accommodation note, without restriction as to the mode o\u00ed using it, may transfer it, either in payment or <em>as collateral security </em>for an antecedent debt, and the maker will have no defense. The existing debt is a sufficient consideration for the transfer, and no new'consideration need be shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">See, also, Lehrenkrauss v. Bonnell, 199 N. Y. 240, 92 N. E. 637, where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">\u201cA pre-existing debt, without extension or forbearance, is sufficient consideration upon which to hold the accommodation maker of a promissory note, where there has been no restriction placed upon its use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">It follows that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial, ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
