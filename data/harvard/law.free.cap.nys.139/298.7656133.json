The complaint alleges the purchase of the tax lien, the situation of the property, the failure to pay the semiannual interest, the election by the defendant to deem the aggregate amount of said tax lien to be immediately payable, and then follow these two allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-18\">\u201cSeventh. The plaintiff is informed and believes, or has reason to believe, that the defendants and each of them have, claim to have, or may have an interest in or claim upon the real property affected by the said lien, which interest or claim is subject and subordinate to the lien of the plaintiff herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-19\">\u201cEighth. The people of the state of New York is made a party defendant to this action by reason of the fact that the premises in this action may have escheated to said the people of the state of New York upon the death of one John Cotter, the grantee in a certain deed made by Ely Moore and wife, dated November 16, 1827, and recorded in the office of the register of the county of New York on November 14, 1828, in Liber 241 of Conveyances, page 542.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Section 1035 of the Greater New York Charter, as amended by chapter 65 of the Laws of 1911, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-21\">\u201cWhere the people of the state of New York * * * is made a party defendant the complaint shall set forth, in addition to the other matters required to be set forth by law, detailed facts showing the particular nature of the interest in or the lien on the said real property of the people of the state \u00f3f New York * * * and detailed facts showing the particular nature of the interest in or the lien on said real property which plaintiff has reason to believe that the people of the state of New York * * * has or may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>have in the said real property, and the reason for making the people of the state of New York * * * a party defendant. Upon failure to state such facts, the complaint shall be dismissed as to the people of the state. * * * <em>\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Of course, it a fundamental proposition that the state cannot be sued, except by its own permission. When it has provided how it may be sued, and what allegations must appear in the complaint, and distinctly provides for a dismissal of a complaint which does not comply with the law permitting the suit to be brought, there is nothing to do but obey the law and dismiss the complaint. It is obvious that the law has not been complied with, and that the mere statement that the premises may have escheated to the people upon the death of one John Cotter, is not \u201cthe detailed facts showing the particular nature of the interest\u201d and the \u201cdetailed facts showing the particular nature of the interest in or the lien on said real property which plaintiff has reason to believe that the people has or may have in the said real property, and the reason for making the people a party defendant.\u201d In other words, if this allegation satisfies the law, the statute was idle, and we are back just where we were at the time the law was enacted. It was passed for the very purpose of relieving the Attorney General\u2019s office from a horde of cases upon the mere allegation that the state may have a lien, which is all that this complaint does.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Appellant claims that the facts set up in the answering affidavits satisfy the requirements of the statute. It is a sufficient answer that this order was made on the complaint, which cannot be pieced out by subsequent affidavits. The complaint, as framed, fails to comply with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The order of dismissal as against the people should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
