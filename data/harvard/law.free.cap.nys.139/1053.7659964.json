J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApQ\">This proceeding came before the court on the-petition of the respondent for a rehearing of the application to disbar him and for his reinstatement. The opinion of this court in the original disbarment proceeding (58 App. Div. 510, 69 N. Y. Supp. 524)* contains a full statement of the facts. The matter was referred to the-official referee, who has reported in favor of the application, and that: the respondent should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">The facts that have developed since the original application was-heard are fully set forth in the report of the referee, and it is quite-evident that the witnesses before the referee in the original proceeding are thoroughly discredited, and that a finding based upon their evidence should not be allowed to stand; and as the referee is now-satisfied that, as an original proposition, the respondent was not guilty of the charges upon which he was disbarred, and as the representative-of the Bar Association, who appeared before the referee, has approved; the report of the referee, I think that we should, on his report, reinstate the respondent as an attorney and counselor at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">It is so ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
