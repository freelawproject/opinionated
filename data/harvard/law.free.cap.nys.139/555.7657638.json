Laws 1909, c. 33) upon the cow for pasturing and boarding her, entitling him to the possession of the animal, it is evident, from the colloquy between the justice and the jury and the verdict rendered, that the jury charged the defendant with the value of the cow and allowed the same upon the counterclaim for the keeping, fixing the amount of the counterclaim at $5 more than the value of the cow, and rendering a verdict for the excess. The County Court evidently held the allowance excessive, and properly reversed the judgment; but we think a new trial should have been ordered in the justice\u2019s court, as may be done under section 3063 of the Code, where the v\u00e9rdict is against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">Judgment of County Court modified, so as to provide for a reversal of the judgment of the justice\u2019s court without costs, and the granting of a new trial before the same justice, upon the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, with costs in this court to the appellant to abide the event. New trial to be had on the 29th day of January, 1913, at 10 a. m.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
