Nor does the proof establish that the defendant in fact drove the car a distance of one-fourth of a mile in excess of 30 miles an hour. There was no violation of the statute, so far as the information or the testimony discloses, and it was error to hold that the conviction of the Court of Special Sessions was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-17\">The judgment of the County Court of Westchester County should be reversed, and the fine paid by the defendant should be remitted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
