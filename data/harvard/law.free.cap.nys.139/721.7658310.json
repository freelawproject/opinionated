The defendant\u2019s friends assert that the complainant made the first assault with something black in his hand, and that the defendant ran away without returning the-assault; while the complainant and his friends testify that the defendant stepped out away from the girl' with whom he was walking- and cut the complainant as above stated. There was clearly sufficient evidence to justify the verdict of the jury, and, aside from the-fact that a certificate of reasonable doubt has been granted, it would, hardly require any serious discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The learned court granting the certificate appears to have been, in doubt as to \u201cwhether or not the conviction is against the weight of testimony\u201d\u2014a doubt which we do not share, for the defendant took the stand in his own behalf, and nowhere denies that he had a razor,, or that he cut the complainant, which, of itself, would raise a strong, presumption of guilt. Stover v. People, 56 N. Y. 315; People v. Tice, 131 N. Y. 651, 657, 30 N. E. 494, 15 L. R. A. 669, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The point which appears t\u00f3 have had determining weight in the granting of the certificate is the alleged hearsay evidence of one of the assistant district attorneys. The defendant was accused of cutting Connors,. and Officer Manning was called as a witness for the-defense, and testified in substance that Connors told him in the station house he did not know who cut him. Thereafter Assistant District Attorney Ereshman was called as a witness to contradict Manning, by giving a conversation over the telephone with him; and the learned justice says that no foundation for such a contradiction was-laid, as Manning was not asked in the first instance anything about a conversation over the telephone with Freshman, and that this testimony of Ereshman was taken as substantive testimony, clearly hearsay, against the defendant, and not, under the rules of evidence, for the purpose of impeaching Manning. It appears from the record,, however, that Manning had testified that \u201cthe only other informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>tion I got was a telephonic communication from Mr. Warbasse, the assistant district attorney, as to why I didn\u2019t make the arrest,\u201d and the latter part of this testimony was stricken out on motion, and Manning subsequently said that he had a telephonic conversation, but did not know whether it was with Mr. Freshman or Mr. Warbasse, and Mr. Freshman subsequently testified that he called up the officer at the police station, and was told that he was talking with Officer Manning, and that the latter told him that he was looking for Longebodi, the defendant, and that he thought it was a case of self-defense, as Longebodi was attacked by the complainant and his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> We are unable to discover that this was in any sense hearsay testimony. It merely went to the credibility of one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, and was not in itself prejudicial to the defendant, except as it tended to contradict his witness, for the fact that an officer may' have been looking for the defendant did not tend to show that he was guilty of the crime on which the trial was progressing.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
