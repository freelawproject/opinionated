At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground \u201cthat plaintiff has wholly failed to establish any measure of damages\u201d; and this motion was granted, after plaintiff had asked leave to go to the jury on the question of damages sustained by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">[ 1 ] Upon the breach by a manufacturer of a contract to manufacture and deliver merchandise, where the manufacturer is advised at the time when the contract is made that the purchaser has placed orders to resell the merchandise, and the contract was made in view thereof, the measure of damages is the difference between the market price at the time and place of delivery and the price at which the manufacturer agreed to sell and deliver the goods, if the goods are obtainable in the market, and, if not, then the difference between the contract price and the price at which the purchaser had placed his orders for a resale, less his expense in carrying out the contract. Ideal Wrench Co. v. Garvin Machine Co., 92 App. Div. 187, 87 N. Y. Supp. 41, affirmed 181 N. Y. 573, 74 N. E. 1118; Lowenstein v. Hargraves Mills, 141 App. Div. 232, 125 N. Y. Supp. 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> The learned court below excluded testimony offered by plaintiff tending to show that the plaintiff had endeavored to buy goods of the character contracted for in the open market. Even if the plaintiff failed to prove special damage, he was entitled to recover as general damage the difference between the market price at the time and place of delivery and the price at which the defendant agreed to sell and deliver the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">We think that the complaint here contained sufficient allegations of general damage; but, even if it did not, if the complaint stated facts that constituted a cause of action, the evidence should not have been excluded, although plaintiff specified only items of damage to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>he was entitled. As was said in Colrick v. Swinburne, 105 N. Y. 503, at page 507, 12 N. E. 427, at page 428:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cThe complaint was sufficiently specific to authorize the recovery of whatever legal damages were recoverable for the wrong. * * * The complaint averred a legal wrong and a resulting pecuniary injury, and it was competent for the court, under the complaint, to adjust the'recovery upon the true basis.\u201d \u201cIt is not material that the plaintiff did not demand the precise damage to which he was entitled, or that he mistook the true rule of damages in his complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">See, also, Coppola v. Kraushaar, 102 App. Div. 306, 92 N. Y. Supp. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the' event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
