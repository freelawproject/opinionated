The -appellant claims that the territory comprised within that borough was \u25a0erected into a county by chapter 548, Laws 1912, and consequently that the Court of Special Sessions of the city of New York had no jurisdiction of a crime committed after April 19, 1912, when the Bronx County Act was passed. It is not necessary to consider at this time the constitutional objections which have been raised as to the validity of the Bronx County Act. If, for any reason, that act is invalid and void, the Court of Special Sessions has all the jurisdiction it ever had, and the appellant\u2019s contention on that point must fail. Assuming, however, that the act is valid, we are still of opinion that the Court of Special Sessions had jurisdiction to try appellant for the crime of which he was accused. The act of April 19, 1912, created the territory comprised within the borough of the Bronx into a county as of the date on which the act was passed, but, since there could not be instantly evolved a complete county government, provision was made for the subsequent organization of such a gov\u25a0ernment, and, until such organization could be effected, the dct continued the jurisdiction of the county officers and the City and County Courts which they had theretofore possessed. Section 9 of the act makes special provision for the continuance of the jurisdiction of the Courts of Special Sessions and the Magistrates\u2019 Courts in the follow- \u2022 ing language: 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-16\">\u201cWithin the county of Bronx the Courts of Special Sessions and Magistrates\u2019 Courts as now constituted by law shall have jurisdiction of such offenses as may be tried and determined by such Courts of Special Sessions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>by such Magistrates\u2019 Courts as now constituted under and by virtue of chapter three hundred and seventy-eight of the Laws of eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, and all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, the same as if this act had not been passed.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">There can be no question as to the intention of the Legislature upon this subject, which is confirmed by the closing words of the section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u2018\u2022The said courts of the county of New York, and in the First judicial district, shall retain and exercise in all civil and criminal proceedings the same jurisdiction they now have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">We entertain no doubt of the jurisdiction of the Court of Special Sessions of the city of New York to try appellant for the crime whereof he was accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Appellant further claims that, although the crime charged against him is only a misdemeanor, yet that it is in its nature an infamous crime which could be prosecuted only by presentment or indictment of the grand jury under section 6 of article 1 of the State Constitution. This argument overlooks the provisions of section 23 of article 6 of the Constitution, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">\u201cCourts of Special Sessions shall have such jurisdiction of offenses of the grade of misdemeanors as may be prescribed- by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">It has been repeatedly held that, under this provision, any crime graded by law as a misdemeanor may be prosecuted in the Court of Special Sessions. People v. Stein, 80 App. Div. 357, 80 N. Y. Supp. 847; People ex rel. Comaford v. Dutcher, 83 N. Y. 240; People ex rel. Cosgriff v. Craig, 195 N. Y. 190, 88 N. E. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The conviction is affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
