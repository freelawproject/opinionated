Plaintiff also sought to -enjoin Fleitmann &amp; Co. from voting in favor of the proposed issue upon certain common stock held by it, and to compel a cancellation of that 'stock, and for an accounting. The answers of the Buffalo Mills Company and Fleitmann &amp; Co. are! substantially the same. In the second paragraph the defendant \u201cadmits and alleges\u201d (then follow the statement of certain facts), and concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">\u201cExcept as so expressly admitted, said defendants deny the allegations, and each of them, in paragraph 3 of the said amended complaint contained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">This paragraph well illustrates the other paragraphs of the answer. What the plaintiff wants, and to which he claims he is.entitled, is a specific admission or denial of the facts set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">The action is in equity, and the complaint quite voluminous. It is difficult to see what bearing some of the facts set forth in the complaint have upon the issue sought to be tried. After a consideration of both the complaint and answers, I do not see how the defendants could truthfully, or with safety, specifically admit or deny each allegation in the complaint. The complaint is not free from criticism. It does not contain, as required by section 481 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a plain and concise statement of the facts constituting the alleged cause of action; on the contrary, some of the matter pleaded is evidence, or a legal conclusion of the pleader. The result is a long complaint, and this, of itself, necessitates a longer answer than would otherwise be required. Defendants were not required, in answering, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to admit the allegations of the complaint in the precise language there used. \u2022 They could state the facts they admitted to be true, and deny those not admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">This practice is recognized in several well-considered authorities. Thus in Grant v. Pratt &amp; Lambert Co., 52 App. Div. 540, 65 N. Y. Supp. 486, the statement is made that the rule governing the effect of admissions contained in a pleading requires that the matter shall be taken as a whole, and the admission is limited by any statement therein which qualifies or explains. In Griffin v. Long Island R. R. Co., 101 N. Y. 348, 4 N. E. 740, the denial was \u201cof each and every allegation of the complaint not before admitted or controverted.\u201d In Lake Ontario National Bank v. Judson, 122 N. Y. 278, 25 N. E. 367, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cThe denial by the defendant in his answer, except as therein admitted, of each and every allegation of the complaint, put in issue any material allegation of the complaint not distinctly admitted by the answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">See, also, Burley v. German-American Bank, 111 U. S. 216, 4 Sup. Ct. 341, 28 L. Ed. 406; Clark v. Dillon, 97 N. Y. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Neither the complaint nor answer can be said to be a model pleading; but one seems to be as good as the other. Whether this be so or not, I am unable to see any difficulty in determining what the defendants admit and what they deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The orders appealed from, therefore, should be reversed, with $10 costs'and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
