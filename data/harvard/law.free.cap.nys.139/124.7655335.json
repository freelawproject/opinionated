The plaintiffs contend that the trust attempted to be credited is invalid, as suspending the power of alienation for a period not measured by one or two lives in being at the death of the testator; that the contingent limitations over at the end of the trust period of five years to issue or survivors fail for the same reasons; that the contingent limitations to the wife and children cannot stand, because not certain to vest in interest within a life or two lives in being at the time of the death of the testator; and that the contingent limitations to the wife and children, if they survive the five-year term, cannot stand without the estates that precede and follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> If the proper construction to be placed upon the language used by the testator, considered in connection with his intent, which must be gathered from the whole scheme of the distribution of his estate, creates an absolute trust period of five years, and is not measured by any life1 or two lives in being at the time of his death, the trust is invalid, and plaintiffs\u2019 contention must be sustained, unless, as defendant argues, the term during which distribution of the estate is postponed may be disregarded, and the estate distributed immediately in accordance with the provisions of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Under the well-settled law of this state, the will must, if possible, be so construed as to render it valid, and effect must be given to the intention of the testator, when ascertained. I think it was the intention, of the testator' that the income of his residuary estate, and, if subsequent conditions (not foreseen) rendered it necessary, the principal, should, for the full term of five years, be devoted to the support and maintenance of his wife and three children, and that if any of them survived that term the trust should continue; that it should not be terminated before the expiration of five years, unless the wife 'and all of his children should die during that time. There is no specific limitation of the five-year term upon a life or two lives in being at his death; but, upon the contrary, his language and the scheme of distribution establish, I think, that the testator did not intend such a limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The entire residue, both real and personal, is to be kept intact, unless unforeseen conditions rendered it necessary to use principal, the net income paid to the wife during the continuance of the trust, to be used for her support and that of her three children, the survivor or survivors. It is directed that the trust shall cease and determine at the expiration of five years from his death, and it is clear, I think, that -he intended that it should not be terminated until that time, and that in the event of the death of his wife or any of the children the trust is nevertheless to continue for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>It is difficult to conceive of language which would more clearly indicate the testator\u2019s intent that distribution should not be had of his entire estate until the expiration of five years after his death, irrespective of who or how many of his cestui que trusts might die during such trust period. Until the expiration of five years, all of the remainders are contingent only; the survivors of the cestui que trusts then, and not until then, are vested with \u201can indefeasible and absolute estate of inheritance.\u201d The vesting in interest as well as the vesting in possession is postponed until the expiration of the five-year period, and until such time it could not be determined who would be entitled to the residuary estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The contention of defendant that the trust term should be disregarded and the estate distributed immediately cannot be sustained. Such a disposition would cut off the ultimate limitations to surviving children, their' issues, and the widow, contrary to the testator\u2019s clearly expressed intent that neither widow nor child should have any portion of the residuary estate, unless the same should be necessary for their support during the trust period. The contingent limitations cannot survive the failure of the rest of the instrument, and the residuary estate, real and personal, must be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Decedent Estates Law relating to the inheritance of property of persons dying intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Judgment may be entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">HIRSCHBERG, THOMAS, and CARR, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b157-8\">BURR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtM\">I dissent, and think that there is a construction possible which will save this will, and, if so, such construction should be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The purpose of the trust is to pay the income to testator\u2019s wife, Evelyn V. Smith, during the continuance of the trust hereby created, out of which she shall not only support and maintain herself, but also the testator\u2019s three children named. No trust can survive the purpose of its creation. If Mrs. Smith is the sole beneficiary of the income, then it must necessarily terminate at her death; but it may terminate before that time, to wit, at the expiration of five years. A trust for life, which may be terminated at some definite period within that life, is valid. Provost v. Provost, 70 N. Y. 141; Kahn v. Tierney, 135 App. Div. 897, 120 N. Y. Supp. 663, affirmed 201 N. Y. 516, 94 N. E. 1095. It does not seem to me that the trust could be construed as a trust in any sense for the benefit of the children, and that the clause with reference to the children\u2019s support out of the income was simply by way of relieving the mother from her legal obligation to support them out of her own estate. There is no direction that the income shall be divided equally among them, and there is no direction that, in the event of the death of one or more, the remaining income shall be paid to the survivors. I think this view is confirmed by the direction for the distribution of the corpus of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The first disposition provided is, one-third of such corpus to his wife, Evelyn V. Smith, and the remaining two-thirds in equal parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>to each of his three children, specifically named by him; that is, two-ninths each. Although this division is directed to be made at the end of five years, necessarily, to be accurately accomplished, both Mrs. Smith and all of the children must be then living. What happens if Mrs. Smith dies? The will says, in the event of the death of his wife before the period of distribution aforesaid, then (that is, at her death) the share of his estate distributable to her but for her death (that is, one-third thereof) shall go to and be divided among his children, or the survivor of them, in equal parts, share and share alike. What is to become of the other two-thirds ? There is no provision for continuing the trust estate as to that, for there is no direction to pay the income to any one but testator\u2019s wife, and theref\u00f3re, whether the five-year period has expired or not, the remaining two-thirds becomes immediately distributable among the three children, if they are then living. The death of one or more of the children during the five-year period would not terminate the trust, but the income would still be paid to Mrs. Smith during her life, or until the expiration of the five years. As to the corpus of the estate, should one or more of the children die during Mrs. Smith\u2019s life and before the termination of the five-year period, leaving issue, then, at the time of distribution, the share of the one so dying would go to such issue, and if either of such children should die during Mrs. Smith\u2019s life, or before the five-year period of distribution, without leaving lawful issue, then, when the estate was distributed, it would go to the survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The only possible sentence that could cast doubt upon this construction is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201cOr, if only one of my said children, or my wife survive the five-year trust period, then the whole of said estate and property shall vest in and be delivered to such sole survivo,r.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">If testator\u2019s wife were the sole survivor of the five-year trust period, as I have pointed out, the will would be a valid one, since the period of distribution was reached during her life. But, suppose that Mrs. Smith and all but one of the children die during the five-year period, Mrs. Smith being the last one so to die; is the trust estate still continued until the expiration of five years? I think not: First, because there is no provision to pay the income to any one after her death; second, because at least as to one-third part thereof, by express provision of the will, the corpus becomes immediately distributable upon her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">There being no intermediate trust estate as to the remaining two-thirds, the will might be construed as though it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\u201cIf my wife dies during the five-year period, leaving one child only surviving her, then, at the end of five years, I give two-thirds of the estate to such child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">But, there being no intermediate estate, the time for the devise to take effect would be anticipated, and, notwithstanding the five-year period had not expired, the remaining two-thirds of the estate would be immediately distributable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
