The second paragraph is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, both real and personal of every kind and nature, I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Carrie W. Crocker, I have not mentioned any of our children or given to them, any portion of my estate, for the reason that I have the fullest confidence, in my wife, that she will, out of the estate hereby given to her, provide for our said children, supplying their need so far as in her power lies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">At the date of execution of the will, September 16, 1904, the testator had three living daughters, and another daughter was born in March, 1906, prior to testator\u2019s death in February, 1911. The defendant in a contract to purchase la\u2019nd devised refuses to take title upon the ground that the last born takes one-fourth of the same under the statute. Section 26, Decedent Estate Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 13)\u2019. The testator in the gift to his wife states- that he has \u201cnot mentioned any of our children, or given to them, any portion of my estate,\u201d and the reason assigned for the omission is his confidence that his wife will out of.the estate given her \"provide for our said children, supplying their need.\u201d The \"said children\u201d are those earlier described. When he said that he had \"not mentioned any of our children,\u201d he meant that he had not mentioned any\u2019one of the children then possessed by his wife and himself. In this way he individualized each child as a living person, and thereby shows that in his mind he had considered his living children one by one, and concluded that their interests and necessities, joint or several, did not require that he should make any reference to them, or give to them anything. The word \u201cthem\u201d refers to the word \u201cchildren,\u201d and that word defined the class whereof \u201cany one\u201d defined the number. When he said, \u201cI have not mentioned any of our children,\u201d he-could not be deemed to\u2019have said, \u201cI have not mentioned any one of our children unpossessed in present\u00ed and procreable in futuro.\u201d Each child- in his mind was capable of being mentioned by name, and he thought of each one, and \"then confided the group. to the affection and wisdom of his wife. En<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>grossed by consideration of those who were realities in his solicitude, he forgot the possibilities of the future. Of course, if he had mentally forecast the indefinite issue of his marriage, he would have provided for such unknown children nothing beyond committing them to the care of his wife. So that the statute works out this\u2014the living objects of his love take nothing; the child, unborn, unconsidered, takes one quarter of the estate although, if considered then whether born or not, she would have received nothing. For it is beyond reason that the father would have denied a gift to any one of his three daughters and given something to issue that might be born.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The defendant should have judgment that Willette A. Crocker has title in fee to an undivided one-fourth interest in the land as if her father had died intestate, and that the plaintiff cannot convey the same. All concur. \u201e</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
