Lipstein v. Provident Loan Society of New York, 139 N. Y. Supp. 799, decided herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But under the circumstances here disclosed the liability, if any, of defendant for a defect in the condition of the plant arises out of its negligence in not discovering or remedying such defect. Labor Law (Consolidated Laws, c. 31 [Laws of 1909, c. 36]) \u00a7 200, as amended by Laws of 1910, c. 352. While the evidence in this case discloses that the chain tongs were somewhat worn, and the result proved that they were insufficient for.the use to which they were put, we think that the evidence wholly fails to establish that the defect was of such a character that defendant could be charged with negligence in not discovering or remedying it. A thing may be worn, but yet not sufficiently worn to charge an employer with negligence in permitting the same to be used. The plaintiff in this case, with his 18 years of experience, was fully as competent as any other, person to determine whether the worn character of the tongs was such as to make it unsafe to use the same. But his own evidence upon that point is that, although he noticed the worn link, which subsequently broke, he still believed that the tongs were entirely sufficient to do the work for which he employed them.' Why would not the master be justified in supposing the same thing?</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We also think that there was error in the court\u2019s ruling upon a request to charge submitted by defendant. There was a conflict of evidence as to whether it was proper to use chain tongs in the manner in which plaintiff did use them. The defendant requested the court to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">\u201cThat no negligence on defendant\u2019s part may be based upon the worn condition of the tongs which broke, if they were reasonably safe and adequate for use by hand, if the jury find that is the manner in which the tongs were to be used properly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">The court refused to charge in that form, but did charge with the \u2022addition of the words;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">\u201cProvided it was improper or unusual to use them as plaintiff did use them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">If the only way in which the tongs should have been used was by .hand, any other use would be improper, and the mere fact that it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>lave been usual to use them in a different way, and in the way that plaintiff did use them, would not justify this improper use. A, wrong \u25a0thing cannot be made right because it is customary. Certainly this would be so, unless the master knew of the unusual and improper use, .and assented to it; and the modification of the request to charge, which introduced the \u201cusual\u201d element, omitted this necessary qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide \u25a0the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">JENKS, P. J., and WOODWARD, J., concur HIRSCHBERG, J., votes to affirm, upon the opinion of Mr. Justice Benedict at Trial 'Term, with whom RICH, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
