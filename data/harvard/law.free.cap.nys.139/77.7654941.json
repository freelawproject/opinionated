Defendant duly appeared on July 31st. By consent plaintiff\u2019s time to serve a complaint was extended until September 20th. It was not served, and on October 23, 1912, defendant moved to dismiss for lack of prosecution. Plaintiff thereupon moved, on an order to show cause, to open his default and for leave to serve the complaint. Both motions came on to be heard at the same time, with the result that plaintiff\u2019s motion was granted and defendant\u2019s motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The plaintiff served no copy of a proposed complaint, no affidavit-showing' merits, and gave no excuse for his default. His motion should have been denied, and that of defendant granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The order opening plaintiff\u2019s default and permitting him to serve-a complaint is therefore reversed, and the motion denied, with $10' costs, and the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is reversed, and the motion granted, with $10 costs, with $10 costs and disbursements to defendant in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
