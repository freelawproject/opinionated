The complaint alleges a quantum meruit for $335 and interest. Both the owner and the sureties were made defendants, and both of them appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">The answer of the owner denied the material allegations of the complaint and set up a counterclaim of $5,000 for breach of contract. The court found that the reasonable value of the work done and materials furnished was $1,485, of which $1,150 had been paid; also that plaintiff had substantially performed. The pleadings admitted the execution of an incomplete building contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The plaintiff testified to the conclusion that he had done all the work specified in the contract, and had been paid all that was due except $335. He and his witness admitted that several violations had been discovered and ordered by the tenement house department to be removed, some of which had been removed, but one, costing $15 to rectify, had not been removed. Defendant\u2019s architect and others testified to substantial defects and omissions, one of which would cost $100 to $150 to rectify. In rebuttal, plaintiff failed to deny or meet this.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">Plaintiff contends that this is an action on quantum meruit. This contention is erroneous; but, even if it were sound, plaintiff cannot recover on quantum meruit under a written contract without proving substantial performance. Hogg v. Larchmont Yacht Club (Sup.) 134 N. Y. Supp. 1079; Tinley v. Van Wert, 119 App. Div. 738, 104 N. Y. Supp. 3. Excuses are not a substitute for substantial performance, conclusions as to performance are not proof thereof, and the very substantial defects, omissions, and violations proven defeat a recovery. Easthampton Lumber Co. v. Worthington, 186 N. Y. 407, 408, 413, 79 N. E. 323; Id., 186 N. Y. 581, 582, 79 N. E. 325; Fox v. Davidson, 36 App. Div. 159, 161, 162, 55 N.Y. Supp. 524; Smith v. Ruggiero, 52 App. Div. 382, 65 N. Y. Supp. 89, affirmed 173 N. Y. 614, 66 N. E. 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Defendant Walpole also brings up for review the order denying her motion to frame certain issues arising upon the counterclaim and for a jury trial <em>pi </em>said issues. An action to foreclose a mechan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ic\u2019s lien, where an undertaking has been given to discharge the lien, and where the sureties on the undertaking are parties defendant, is triable by the court without a jury. Schillinger Cement Co. v. Arnott, 152 N. Y. 584, 590, 592, 46 N. E. 956; Valett v. Baker, 129 App. Div. 514, 515, 114 N. Y. Supp. 214; Mertz v. Press, 99 App. Div. 444, 91 N. Y. Supp. 264. The right of a trial justice in an equity suit to satisfy his own conscience as to the facts without the aid of a jury is as much of a constitutional right as is the right of jury trial in action at law where the material facts are disputed. Shepard v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 131 N. Y. 215, 223-226, 30 N. E. 187. ,,</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><bracketnum>[3,4]</bracketnum> Where a counterclaim is interposed in an equity action in which defendant demands judgment for a sum of money only, as a \u201ccounterclaim in an equity suit is not a case where the right to a jury trial existed at common law,\u201d a trial of such issue by a jury is discretionary. Mackellar v. Rogers, 109 N. Y. 468, 472, 17 N. E. 350; Bennett v. Edison Ill. Co., 164 N. Y. 131-133, 58 N. E. 7; Smith v. Fleischman, 23 App. Div. 355-359, 48 N. Y. Supp. 234. The privilege of a jury trial of the issue raised by a counterclaim must be-applied for within 10 days after the joinder of issue. Rule 31; Arnot v. Nevins, 44 App. Div. 61, 62, 60 N. Y. Supp. 401. In the case at bar issue was joined December 26, 1911, the motion to frame issues, was delayed until May 31st following, and the motion was therefore properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The defendants Farrel and O\u2019Mally defaulted in the court below and a judgment was entered against them by default. The appeal taken by them must therefore be dismissed, but without prejudice to such action in the lower court as they may be advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Judgment as to defendant Walpole reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
