This is not an interlocutory judgment, nor does it purport to be such. It is a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> The affidavit showing the default of the defendants recited in the judgment is not included in the printed papers on appeal, and is not before us. If the order of October 23, 1912, which recited the prior orders, was not served by the plaintiff upon the defendants, the time within which the defendants were required to withdraw the demurrer and serve an answer had not been limited. That time as stated in the order was \u201cwithin six days after the service of a copy of this order with notice of entry upon their [defendants\u2019] attorneys.\u201d The service of the resettled order by the defendants\u2019 attorney upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney is not sufficient to set the time running. Rohr v. Linch, 78 Misc. Rep. 45, 137 N. Y. Supp. 752. This objection, however,.could properly be urged on a motion to vacate the judgment predicated upon affidavits showing the facts, or, if the affidavit upon which the judgment was entered does not show a service of the order with notice of entry on the defendants\u2019 attorney, the motion might be based upon the papers on which the judgment was entered. We, however, will not review the judgment on an appeal from a \u201cpaper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">.'[5] The appellant claims that the order and judgment should be reversed, for the reason that the court did not make and rile a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>decision, and the imposition of $35 costs as a condition for granting leave to amend is unauthorized, for the reason that $10 costs is all that could be imposed. The attempt^ to simplify the practice with respect to demurrers has led to confusion in the minds of some members of the bar, and calls for a statement of what would seem to be elementary rules of practice. A demurrer may be brought on for trial as an issue of law. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 964, 965, 969. In which case a notice of trial must be served. On the determination of the issue, if the demurrer be sustained or overruled, and leave given to amend or to withdraw the demurrer and plead over, and the privilege is availed of, costs after notice of trial and the trial fee of an issue of law are properly imposed. But if final judgment is directed, or if final judgment is entered because the privilege of amending or pleading over is not accepted, then costs before and after notice of trial and the trial fee of an issue of law are taxable. De Turckheim v. Thomas, 113 App. Div. 123, 99 N. Y. Supp. 104. Or an issue of law may be brought on and tried at any term of court as a contested motion. Section 976. In which case a notice of motion, and not a notice of trial, is served, and on the determination of the motion, if the demurrer is sustained and leave given to amend, or overruled, and leave given to withdraw the demurrer and plead over, only $10 motion costs are allowed. If final judgment is entered, costs before notice of trial and the motion costs are taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Or a motion may be made for judgment on the pleadings (section 547), which, of course, must be brought on by notice of motion, and the court on determining the motion if leave to amend or to withdraw the demurrer and plead over be given has power to impose such terms as may be just. Costs, however, cannot exceed those before notice of trial and $10 motion costs. Singer Mfg. Co. v. Granite Spg. W. Co., 67 Misc. Rep. 575, 124 N. Y. Supp. 750; Framingham Trust Co. v. Villard, 74 Misc. Rep. 204, 210, 133 N. <em>Y. </em>Supp. 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">While the amendments to the Code have provided two methods of disposing of a demurrer, additional to the trial of the issue of law, that method has not been eliminated from the Code, nor have the provisions applicable thereto been superseded. Therefore where, as in the present case, the issue of law is brought on for trial by the service of a notice of trial, the decision of the court in writing must be filed (section 1010), which must direct the final or interlocutory judgment to be entered thereupon, and shall contain no findings of fact but only \u25a0conclusions of law. If leave is given to plead anew or amend, an interlocutory judgment should be directed, and, if no other issue remains to be tried, it should direct final judgment, if the party fails to comply with any of the terms of the interlocutory judgment. Section 1021. Where the matter is brought before the court on notice of motion either under sections 976 or 547, no written decision nor interlocutory judgment need be filed or entered, but an order should be entered. People v. Bleecker St. &amp; Fulton Ferry R. R. Co., 67 Misc. Rep. 582, 124 N. Y. Supp. 786; Nat. Park Bank v. Billings, 144 App. Div. 536, 129 N. Y. Supp. 846, affirmed 203 N. Y. 556, 96 N. E. 1122. It is an anomalous situation that there should be this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>difference in practice, and what are called \u201cantiquated and useless formalities\u201d (Nat. Park Bank v. Billings, supra, 144 App. Div. 539, 129 N. Y. Supp. 848) should still be preserved, when a simpler and more expeditious manner has been devised for the disposition of an issue of law by bringing it on as a contested motion. Relief from this condition can be had, however, only in legislation. Further amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure eliminating the provisions for' the trial of an issue of law otherwise than by motion, and the requirements for a written decision and interlocutory judgment, would simplify the practice and carry into effect the legislative intent by making that which now rests in the discretion of litigants, whether to bring on the demurrer by notice of trial or notice of motion, mandatory, by providing only the simpler and more rational method of motion, but, so long as both procedures are recognized, the court m\u00fast adapt its procedure in compliance with the statutory requirements. It follows that the order must be reversed and all proceedings taken thereunder vacated and set aside, and the case remitted to the City Court for appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> In order that the matter may be finally disposed of in the lower court, we have examined the grounds of demurrer set forth, and have come to the conclusion that the demurrer to the complaint for the reason that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Charles Barth should have been sustained. In the amended complaint there is not a single allegation of fact concerning Charles Barth. It is true that where a party has been named individually, and there is a cause of action stated against him in a representative capacity or vice versa, the courts have held on demurrer that the caption was not controlling, but the entire complaint would be examined, and, if a cause of action was stated against him in either capacity, the demurrer would be overruled. Rowe v. Rowe, 103 App. Div. 100, 92 N. Y. Supp. 491; Soldiers\u2019 Home v. Sage, 11 Misc. Rep. 159, 33 N. Y. Supp. 549; Beers v. Shannon, <em>73 </em>N. Y. 292, 297; First Nat. Bank v. Shuler, 153 N. Y. 163, 173, 47 N. E. 262, 60 Am. St. Rep. 601. These cases cannot be considered as sustaining the contention that where there are two defendants, and a cause of action is only alleged against one, the other defendant cannot demur for insufficiency as to him. The decisions are to the contrary. \u201cWhere there are several defendants some may answer while others demur. A demurrer is in effect a declaration that the party demurring will go no further, because the other has shown nothing against him. And a demurrer will be sustained where the cause of action set forth' in the complaint fails to show any connection between the facts therein alleged and the party defendant by whom the demurrer is interposed.\u201d Webb v. Vanderbilt, 39 N. Y. Super. Ct. 4, 10. See, also, People v. N. Y. City Cent. Underground Ry. Co., 15 N. Y. Supp. 245,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gen. Term Sup. Ct. 1st Dep\u2019t; Polak v. Runkel, 56 App. Div. 365, 67 N. Y. Supp. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> The joint demurrer of the defendants on the ground of a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>feet of parties defendant was properly overruled. A defect of parties as ground of demurrer under subdivision 6 of section 488 of the Code of Civil Procedure means a nonjoinder, and not a misjoinder of parties. A complaint is not demurrable for too many parties defendant. Hall v. Gilman, 77 App. Div. 458, 79 N. Y. Supp. 303; Tew v. Wolfshon, 77 App. Div. 454, 79 N. Y. Supp. 286; Adams v. Slingerland, 87 App. Div. 312, 84 N. Y. Supp. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">In so far as the appeal is taken from \u201ca paper purporting to be an interlocutory judgment,\u201d it is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The order appealed from is reversed, and all proceedings had thereunder are vacated without costs to either party as against the other.
