When the plaintiff consented to the substitution of a new subcontractor in place of Gazley Bros., he was still entitled to these profits, and the promise on the part of the defendant to pay him the 1 cent per thousand, which they saved on the contract price, as a substitute for Gazley Bros.\u2019 promise to pay <em>1% </em>cents per thousand as a commission, was therefore a valid promise. Inasmuch, however, as the plaintiff procured the contract with Gazley Bros, for his own benefit, the loss sustained by Gazley Bros/ imperfect work necessarily reduced the profits to which he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>entitled for his commissions, and must be offset. As the amount of this loss does not appear from the record, a new trial must be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to app\u00e9llant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
