That conclusion must be predicated upon the-finding of such cruel and inhuman treatment on her part as justified his departure. It may not be inferred, from the affirmance of the-judgment, that the defendant is relieved from his duty to make due-provision for the support of his wife. Under the decision in Robinson, v. Robinson, 146 App. Div. 533, 131 N. Y. Supp. 260, it is not within the power of this court to make provision in the judgment constraining' the defendant to furnish such support; but there is the usual remedy,, should he not be moved to fulfill this duty. \u25a0 He did this amply before-the action was begun, and even that did not interrupt a just regard for the welfare of his children. It may be inferred that he will not pursue other course in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">The judgment should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
