This report concluded as follows: \u201cI find on the evidence that the instructions given to its salesmen by the respondent were made in good faith and for the purpose of protecting the rights which they were advised by their attorneys were secured by the letters patent, and were not for the purpose of hindering, embarrassing or otherwise eliminating competition of the Perfection Grate &amp; Supply Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">This report of the examiner was brought up to this court as addendum to the record, and it is contended by the attorneys for the Commission that the report should not be considered for the reason that it is no part of the record in the ease, and they cite the following cases in support of their contention: Raladam Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 42 F.(2d) 430; J. W. Kobi Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 23 F.(2d) 41; Moir et al. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 22; Q. R. S. Music Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 12 F. (2d) 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">While it is difficult to understand just why the report of an examiner, who has taken the testimony, heard and seen the witnesses, and observed their demeanor, shcmld not he included in the record, yet, in view of our conclusion on the other points involved in the case, it is not necessary to decide this question or to give the examiner\u2019s report any consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">As was said by Mr. Justice Sutherland in the case of the Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., 283 U. S. 643, 51 S. Ct. 587, 589, 75 L. Ed. 1324: \u201cBy the plain words of the act, the power of the Commission to take steps looking to the issue of an order to desist depends upon the existence of three distinct prerequisites: (1) That the methods complained of are unfair; (2) that they are methods of competition in commerce; and (3) that a proceeding by the Commission to prevent the use of the methods appears to be in the interest of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number> In considering the first of these requisites, it must be remembered that the Federal Trade Commission Act \u00a7 5 (15 USCA \u00a7 45), provides that \u201cthe findings of the commission as to facts, if supported by testimony, shall be conclusive.\u201d The question of faith, \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d is clearly a finding of fact, and inferences reasonably to be drawn from the facts are \u201cfor the Commission.\u201d Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States, etc., 273 U. S. 52, 47 S. Ct. 255, 71 L. Ed. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">An examination of the record in this ease fails to disclose any testimony to support a finding of bad faith on the part of the petitioner. Good faith is always presumed until the contrary is shown by proof. Here the petitioner, in claiming infringement, did only what its officers undoubtedly- thought they had a perfect right to do and what they had been advised' to do by their attorneys, who were clearly acting in perfect good faith. There was certainly no more wrong involved in petitioner\u2019s threat to sue the Perfection Company for infringement of their patents than there was in the act of the Perfection Company in threatening to sue to enjoin the petitioner and not doing it. A reading of the record leads to the inevitable conclusion that in doing what they did officers of petitioner did only what they thought, and were advised, they had a right to do to protect their legitimate interests. The reason given for the fact that no suit was brought was certainly a logical and, reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">For decisions bearing on what one, who believes his patents are being infringed, may or may not do without being held to be acting in bad faith, the following are cited: Atlas Underwear Co. v. Cooper Underwear Co. (D. C.) 210 F. 347; Price-Hollister Co. v. Warford Corp. (D. C.) 18 F.(2d) 129; Kelley v. Ypsilanti, etc., Co. (C. C.) 44 F. 19, 10 L. R. A. 686; Heuser v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 4 F. (2d) 632; Racine Paper Goods Co. v. Dittgen (C. C. A.) 171 F. 631; Farquhar Co. v. National Harrow Co. (C. C. A.) 102 F. 714, 49 L. R. A. 755; Warren Featherbone Co. v. Landauer et al. (C. C.) 151 F. 130; Electric Renovator Manufacturing Co. v. Vacuum Cleaner Co. et al. (C. C.) 189 F. 754; Adriance, Platt &amp; Co. v. National Harrow Co. (C. C. A.) 121 F. 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">In considering the third requisite we are again confronted with what we consider an error of the Commission, as there was no public interest involved. The testimony shows that the only competitor involved was the Perfection Company. Only five purchasers of stokers were approached by petitioner\u2019s salesmen, and not one of these was prevented from purchasing the Perfection Company\u2019s appliance. There is no evidence, or even contention, that petitioner\u2019s stoker was in any way inferior to the Perfection Company\u2019s stoker, or that any attempt was being made to impose upon the public by the sale .of an inferior article. The courts have uniformly held that parties claiming infringement without suing and in bad faith can be enjoined from continuing such a course. Sun-Maid Raisin Growers v. Avis et al. (D. C.) 25 F.(2d) 303, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The ease here is rather a controversy of a private and personal nature between the petitioner and the Perfection Company, and could have been readily settled in the courts, and if a proper ease were made an injunction would have issued against the petitioner. Certainly Congress never intended that the machinery of the Federal Trade Commission, severe as its operation can be made, should be set in motion for the settlement of private controversies, when the courts can act. The official character of the Commission makes it all the more necessary that it act only when the public interest is involved. It was never intended that the Commission should act the part of a petty traffic officer in the great highways of commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">A discussion of this question will be found in Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, 280 U. S. 19, 50 S. Ct. 1, 3, 74 L. Ed. 138, 68 A. L. R. 838, where Mr. Justice Brandeis, in an able opinion, says:</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">\u201cWhile the Federal Trade Commission exercises under section 5 the functions of both prosecutor and judge, the scope of its authority is strictly limited. A complaint may be filed only \u2018if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public.\u2019 This requirement is not satisfied by proof that there has been misapprehension and confusion on the part of purchasers, or even that they have been deceived \u2014 the evidence commonly adduced by the plaintiff in \u2018passing off\u2019 cases in order to establish the alleged private wrong. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">\u201cIn determining whether a proposed proceeding will be in the public interest the Commission exercises a broad discretion. But the mere fact that it is to the interest of the community that private rights shall be respected is not enough to support a finding of public interest. To justify filing a complaint the pubic interest must be specific and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>stantial. Often it is so, because the unfair method employed threatens the existence of present or potential competition. Sometimes, because the unfair method is being employed under circumstances which involve flagrant oppression of the weak by the strong. Sometimes, because, although the aggregate of the loss entailed may be so serious and widespread as to make the matter one of public consequence, no private suit would be brought to stop the unfair conduct, since the loss to each of the individuals affected is too small to warrant it. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">\u201cThe undisputed facts, established before the Commission, at the hearings on the complaint, showed affirmatively the private character of the controversy. It then beeame clear (if it was not so earlier) that the proceeding was not one in the interest of the public; and that the resolution authorizing the complaint had been improvidently entered. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">A study of the facts in the Klesner Case shows a marked similarity to the facts in the instant ease, and the decision of the Supreme Court there is controlling here. See, also, Raladam Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 42 F.(2d) 430, afterwards affirmed in Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The record shows no basis for the action of the Commission in finding that petitioner had aeted in bad faith, and the order to cease and desist was erroneous. The prayer of the petition is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
