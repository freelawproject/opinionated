And when the said stock shall have heen transferred and delivered to the sellers, the said party of the third part shall thereupon make final settlement under this contract, returning to the various parties of the first part any balance of money or stock due to them, as their interests may appear, and all rights and obligations between the parties of the first part and the parties of the second part under this contract shall thereupon cease, and this contract shall thereupon he terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">\u201c3. It is understood and agreed that promptly after April 1st, 1920, all payments then required from the parties of the second part having heen made, the parties of the first part will furnish to the parties of the second part the voting control of the stock of the said Cherokee Falls Manufacturing Company, by means of proper proxies for not less than Fifty-One (51%) per cent, thereof, to-the said parties of the second part, which proxies, so long as the parties of the second part shall comply with all of the provisions of this contract, and until the stock represented by said proxies shall have been purchased by and transferred on the hooks of the Company to the parties of the second part, shall be irrevocable; that the present officers and Directors of the Company will promptly resign when and as requested by the parties of the second part, and that full management and control of the Company shall be vested in the parties of the second part from the time that all payments required to be made on April 1st, 1920; shall have been made. But it is distinctly understood and agreed that no dividends are to be paid by the said Company after April 1st, 1920, until all the provisions of this contract required of the parlies of the second part shall have heen by them fully complied with, and that no lien or encumbrance shall be placed on any of the property belonging to the Company until the provisions of this contract shall have all been complied with by the parties of the second part, and should the parties of the second part issue any additional stock, all of such additional stock indorsed in blank shall he deposited with the party of the third part, and be subject to all of the provisions of this contract in event of any failure of the parties of the second part to comply with the provisions thereof required of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">The agreement was carried out according to its provisions, and petitioner acquired thereunder 2,000 shares of stock of Cherokee Falls Manufacturing Company; payments being made as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-7\">April 1, 1920, 500 shares at $650, $325,-00\u00d3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-9\">January 15, 1921, 500 shares at $680.-87%, $340,437.50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-10\">January 15, 1922, 500 shares at $719.-87%, $350,937.50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-11\">January 15, 1923, 500 shares at $758.-87%, $379,437.50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">Respondent treated the full amounts of $359,937.50 and $379;437.50, paid January 15, 1922, and January 15, 1923, respectively, as a part of the cost of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">On March 15, 1923, petitioner filed its income-tax return for the- calendar year 1922 and with the permission of the Commissioner, it changed the basis of its return to a fiscal year ending on March 31, and in September, 1924, it filed its income-tax return for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1922, and ending March 31, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1923, was reported by petitioner, and has been computed by respondent, by taking nine-twelfths of the income for the calendar year 1922 and the entire income for the three months\u2019 period, January 1 to March 31, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">The Board sustained the Commissioner\u2019s determination that no part of the amount paid for the stock represented interest paid- or incurred. The petitioner seeks a review of this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">The pertinent provision of the Revenue Act of 1921, e. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 254,-is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">\u201cSee. 234. (a) That in computing the net income of a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 230 there shall be allowed as deductions: * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">\u201c(2) All interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on its indebtedness, except on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities (other than obligations of the United States issued after September 24,1917, and originally subscribed for by the taxpayer) the interest upon which is wholly exempt from taxation under this title. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-20\"> It is contended by the petitioner that the purchase price of all the stock was $650 per share as of April 1, 1920, that the total purchase price was to be paid in four install<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>ments, and that the excess \u00f3\u00a3 the later over the first price amounted to what would have .been 6 per cent, interest and was in fact interest. It is further contended on behalf of the petitioner that to give the contract any other interpretation would be illogical and utterly ridiculous from a business standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">We cannot agree with petitioner\u2019s contention. The courts will not disregard the plain language of a contract or interpolate something not contained in it. Here the language used by the parties is dear and unambiguous, and cannot be ignored however plausible the reasons advanced. The courts will not write contracts for the parties to them nor construe them other than in accordance with the plain and lit.eral meaning of the language used.Van Ness v. City of Washington, 4 Pet. 232, 7 L. Ed. 842; Harrison v. Fortlage, 161 U. S. 57, 16 S. Ct. 488, 40 L. Ed. 616; Robbins v. Rollins, 127 U. S. 622, 8 S. Ct. 1339, 32 L. Ed. 292; Gavinzel v. Crump, 22 Wall. 308, 22 L. Ed. 783; Sheets v. Selden, 7 Wall. 416, 19 L. Ed. 166; Graham v. Business Men\u2019s Assur. Co. of America (C. C. A. 10th) 43 F.(2d) 673; Calderon v. Atlas Steamship Co., 170 U. S. 272, 18 S. Ct. 588, 42 L. Ed. 1033; Hammon Consol. Gold Fields v. Powell (C. C. A. 9th) 32 F.(2d) 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">The fact that the later installments exceeded the first by amounts that equaled 6 per cent, does not of itself prove that the excess was interest. In this transaction there was no element of lending or borrowing, and the excess price paid for the stock later pur- . chased is not to be considered interest but all principal. In re Bibbey (D. C.) 9 F. (2d) 944, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Nor could usury have been pleaded had the amount of the excess paid for the later \u2022purchased stocks exceeded the legal rate of interest. 27 R. C. L. p. 214, and authorities cited under note 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">It is a significant faet that while the purchasers took over control of the company on the making of the first payments it was agreed that no dividends should be paid until all the provisions of the contract were fully complied with. The record is silent as to the amount, of the dividends that would have been expected in due course. The excess of the price of the later over the first stock purchased may have been fixed to care for the dividends that would otherwise have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">Tax liabilities must be determined by what in fact was done.

Ed. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">The action of the Board of Tax Appeals is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
