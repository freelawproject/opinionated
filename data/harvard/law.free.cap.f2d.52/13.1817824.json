The final admission of fact was: \u201cThat the plaintiff corporation offers no evidence\u2019of actual negligence on the part of the defendant corporation, or its servants, and the defendant corporation offers no evidence of lack of negligence on its part, or any evidence explaining said shortage, other than as is incorporated in the foregoing facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The full stipulation of facts is set out in the' margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-15\">On this state of the record, both parties moved for judgment. Tbe court denied de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>fondant's motion and granted plaintiff\u2019s. The gist of defendant\u2019s motion was that it was incumbent on plaintiff, as a prerequisite to recovery, to prove negligence on the part of defendant, and that plaintiff had wholly failed so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Questions relating to pleading and questions relating to burden of proof have been argued at length on this appeal by respective counsel. We do not find it necessary to determine or discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We think the vital question involved in the ease at bar is whether the .court erred in entering judgment for plaintiff upon the admitted facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">1. We start with 'the fact expressly admitted in the contract of carriage that the carrier is liable as at common law except as thereafter provided in the contract. At common law the common carrier was liable as if an insurer, with a few exceptions, such as the act of God, etc.; and with the same exceptions, the carrier was liable', whether negligent or not, if it failed to deliver the goods received for shipment. The presumption was, in ease of failure to deliver, that it was at fault; and the presumption was not rebuttable save as to the few exceptions, and the carrier had to prove itself within the exceptions. 4 Elliott on Railroads (2d Ed.) \u00a7 1454; 10 C.

Collins Produce Co., 249 U. S. 186, 192, 39 S. Ct. 189, 63 L. Ed. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-17\">This common-law presumption exists in the ease at bar by express terms of the contract, and also by express terms some of the common-law exceptions are not available to the carrier; but a new exemption has been added by the contract of carriage to the few which existed at common law. The new exemption is this: That the carrier shall not be liable for variation of weights or shrinkage in shipments of bulk freight except in ease of loss due to negligence on the part of the carrier. This new exemption has been carved out of the old common-law liability. This exemption is a matter of contract, and the contract is in writing and subject to construction. The language is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-18\">\u201cThe carrier and/or its agents in possession of all or any of the property herein described shall be liable as at common law for any loss thereof or damage thereto except as hereinafter provided. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-19\">\u201c(b) The carrier accepts bulk freight without knowledge of quantity or quality. * * No claims for variation of weights or shrinkage will be allowed except in case of loss due to negligence on the part of the carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-21\">The particular exemption clause relied upon by the carrier is as follows:, \u201cNo claims for variation of weights or shrinkage will be allowed except in case of loss due to negligence on the part of the carrier.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The language is not well chosen, and the meaning is not free from doubt. Strictly speaking, there can be no claim for \u201cvariation of weights.\u201d Appellant apparently treats the words \u201cvariation of weights\u201d and the word \u201cshrinkage\u201d as synonymous, so that the exemption clause covers only one thing, viz., \u201cshrinkage.\u201d Appellee apparently treats the words \u201cvariation of weights\u201d as meaning \u201cshortage in weights,\u201d so that the exemption clause would cover two things: Shortage in weights, and shrinkage.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We think the latter construction of the clause is the correct one. \u201cVariation of weights\u201d does not signify shrinkage any more than it signifies theft; and while \u201cvariation of weights\u201d might be evidence of shrinkage, it might also be evidence of numerous other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"> Furthermore, it seems clear from the contract that the carrier is not exempt from liability for all shortage in weight or for all shrinkage, but only for some varieties thereof. Those varieties do not include shortage or shrinkage due to negligence by the carrier. This would seem to be the reasonable construction of the language of the contract; but if the wording leaves the meaning doubtful, the contract, being one limiting the common-law liability of the carrier, must be construed most strongly against the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In order to effectively claim an exemption from liability for shortage, the carrier must show that the exemption claimed is within the terms of the contract. It does not show this when it simply shows a shortage.- It must-also show that the shortage was a nonnegligent one.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">This is not a ease where the common-law liability is abrogated and a new and more restricted liability put in its place, if that could be done. It is a case where the common-law liability remains except as exemptions are carved out of it; and the admitted facts do not show a nonnegligent shortage.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">2. Appellant cites numerous authorities which hold that where the carrier is made exempt by contract from part of its common-law liability and proves that the loss falls within the exemption, the shipper cannot recover unless he proves that the carrier was negligent. The cases upholding this rule are legion in number and cover a great variety of circumstances; they are collected in 10 C. J. p. 377, \u00a7 580. We do not think the rule is applicable to the facts in the case at bar. The cases cited in support of the rule proceed upon the theory that the carrier proves that the loss is within an excepted <em>cause of loss </em>such as the act of God, or such as leakage, breakage, etc. But in the case at'bar the facts do not show that the carrier or anyone else has disclosed the <em>cause of loss. </em>Theofacts stated are that the carrier has not delivered the full amount of grain received; that the losses are computed by plaintiff according to and arise by reason of the variation or difference in the weights of the cargoes of wheat at a point of origin and at destination. These facts disclose a shortage, but the cause is not shown. The variation in weights is not the cause of the shortage. It is simply a method of proof of the shortage. The shortage itself is not a cause but a result of some cause. The facts do not .show any cause of the shortage, and until the cause of the shortage is shown, the facts do -not bring the carrier within the rule above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Our conclusions are that the facts fail to show that the defendant carrier is brought within the shortage clause of the contract of carriage exempting it from liability, because they fail to show nonnegligent shortage ; further, that the facts do not bring the case within the rule that where the carrier has shown the <em>cause of loss </em>and that cause is one for which the carrier is exempt from liability for loss it is incumbent on the shipper to show negligence on the part of the carrier, because the facts fail to show the <em>cause of loss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Under the facts stipulated, the presumption remains intact that the loss was caused by the fault of the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">We think the trial court was right in ordering judgment for the plaintiff, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\"><em> </em>\u201cThe defendant carrier admits that the plaintiff corporation is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Minnesota; that on or about the 17th day of April, 1929, at St. Paul, Minnesota,\u2018the defendant, as a common carrier, by water, received from the plaintiff corporation six hundred thousand pounds of wheat, the property of plaintiff corporation, of the value of $1.16% per bushel, and agreed with plaintiff for a valuable consideration to carry the same to New Orleans, Louisiana, in Inland Waterways Corporation Barge Number 322, and there deliver the same to the plaintiff or its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u201cThat though a reasonable time therefor has elapsed, the defendant carrier has not carried or delivered 1,470 pounds of said grain as agreed, though delivery of the same was duly demanded to plaintiff's damage in the sum of $25.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">\u201cThat on or about September 9, 1927, at St. Paul, Minnesota, the defendant carrier received from the plaintiff corporation, 2,280,000 pounds of wheat the property of the plaintiff corporation, of the value of $1.35% per bushel, and agreed with plaintiff for a valuable consideration to carry the same to New Orleans, Louisiana, in Inland Waterways Corporation Barges 301, 305, 311, 314 and 315 (the cargo in. the last numbered Barge 315 being transferred by defendant\u2019s agent in transit at St. Louis, Missouri, to Barge Number 552), and there deliver the same to plaintiff or its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">\u201cThat though a reasonable time therefor has elapsed, the defendant has not carried or delivered 10,514 pounds of said grain, as agreed, though delivery of the same was duly demanded to plaintiff\u2019s damage in the sum of $221.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">\u201cThat a notice of claim was duly filed by plaintiff on all of said shipments, and on account of all and singular, plaintiff was damaged in the sum of $247.29. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">\u201c * * * The plaintiff corporation admits that the following facts are true: That defendant at all the times mentioned herein was and now is a corporation duly created, incorporated, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the United States, to-wit, the Act of the Congress of the United States approved June S, 1924 (43 Statutes, 360) as amended [49 USCA \u00a7 151 -et seq.], and that the Government of the United States has subscribed for, taken, and at all the times mentioned herein was and now is the owner of all the capital stock of said defendant corporation, and that this controversy is one arising under the laws of the United States of which this Court has original jurisdiction, and that at all the times mentioned herein, the defendant corporation was a common carrier of freight for hire by water between the places herein mentioned. That the 600,-000 pounds of wheat shipped by plaintiff corporation on or about April 17, 1929, in defendant carrier\u2019s Barge Number 322, and the 2,280,000 pounds of wheat shipped by plaintiff corporation on or about September 9, 1927, in defendant carrier\u2019s Barges 301, 305, 311, 314 and 315 (the cargo in the last numbered Barge being transferred by its agent in transit at St. Louis, Missouri, to Barge Number 552), constituted bulk freight and/or bulk grain shipments; that said bulk freight was conveyed by defendant carrier and was covered under and by written contracts of affreightment entered into by and between the defendant carrier and plaintiff corporation on or about the dates aforesaid, which contracts, and each of them, contained, so far as is material here, the following specific contract terms and conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-17\">\u201c \u2018The carrier and/or its agents in possession of all or any of the property herein described shall be liable as at common law for any loss thereof or damage thereto except as hereinafter provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-18\">\u201c \u2018(a) Neither this carrier nor its agent in possession of all or any of the property herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto or delay caused by the authority of law or the act or default of the shipper or owner, or from a defect or vice in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-19\">\u201c\u2018(b) .The carrier accepts bulk freight without knowledge of quantity or quality.
