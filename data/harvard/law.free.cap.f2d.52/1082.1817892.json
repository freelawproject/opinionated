A model of defendant\u2019s frame is now presented, and from this it appears that the court did make the error suggested. It follows that the portion of the opinion above quoted should he modified to conform to the fact, which is, that the negative is carried by clamps upon the inner frame to which it is hermetically sealed by pressure and a rubber strip; and the inner frame is then firmly attached t\u00f3 the outer frame, before use, by pairs of set screws, the opening between the inner and outer frames being sealed <em>by </em>a vertical curtain of flexible rubber cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">The foregoing correction in no way requires a different conclusion than that heretofore reached. The two frames of the defendant\u2019s device must still be considered as operatively and functionally integral, and the manner of operation of the device as substantially different from that of the patent (Koppe, No. 1,396,962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">The petition for a rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
