He was acquitted of two counts of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. For sentencing purposes each count of aggravated assault was merged with a count of attempted murder and the State\u2019s motion for an extended term was granted. A 40-year aggregate custodial sentence with a 20-year parole disqualifier was imposed consecutive to a sentence then being served by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">On this appeal from his conviction and sentence, defendant advances the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">I. THE DEPENDANT\u2019S PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION WAS IMPERMISSIBLY INVADED AS A RESULT OF CROSS-EXAMINATION AS TO THE DEFENDANT\u2019S FAILURE TO INFORM THE POLICE OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS ALIBI DEFENSE UNTIL SHORTLY PRIOR TO TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">II. THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S SUMMATION EXCEEDED THE BOUNDS OF PROPRIETY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">III. THE SENTENCE IMPOSED WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE BY IMPOSING CONSECUTIVE TERMS WITH MAXIMUM PAROLE DISQUALIFIERS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">A complete recitation of the facts giving rise to defendant\u2019s indictment and conviction for the cited offenses is not necessary to our consideration of the issues raised on this appeal. It is sufficient to note that the State\u2019s proofs permitted the jury to find that on October 30,1983, \u201cMischief Night,\u201d two officers of the South Amboy Police Department were shot by defendant, masquerading as a cowboy, as one of the officers attempted to arrest defendant on some outstanding bench warrants for traf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>fic violations. After the shooting, defendant eluded the officers. Several hours later he was found at his brother's apartment in Old Bridge, arrested and transported to police headquarters. At headquarters, when questioned about the events of the evening, defendant indicated he desired to speak to either his girl friend or his mother. However, the police were unable to contact either of them until some time later. With defendant\u2019s consent, a neutron activation test was conducted to determine whether defendant had recently fired a weapon. As the officer began to perform the test on defendant\u2019s right hand, defendant reportedly said \u201cI shot him with my left.\u201d The test was performed on both hands, but the results were inconclusive. Several hours later, defendant allegedly was heard yelling from his cell that he had \u201cblown\u201d two officers away that night and when he got out on bail he would \u201ctake care\u201d of the rest of them. Additionally, later on that morning, after being transferred to a county holding cell, a correction officer overheard defendant telling fellow inmates that he had pulled a gun from under his jacket after being stopped by two police officers and began shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">A gun subsequently found behind one of the buildings in the apartment complex where defendant was found was determined to be the weapon which had discharged the bullet taken from the shoulder of one of the wounded officers. Some live shells for the gun were also found in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Testifying in his own behalf, defendant stated that while he lived in South Amboy, during the time period in question he also maintained an apartment in Newburgh, New York, where he was employed by Conrail. On Saturday, October 29, he had worked from 4:00 p.m. to midnight, and as he prepared to leave in his van he encountered mechanical difficulties involving overheating and a weak battery. He pulled into the railroad yard to check the trouble and eventually was questioned by one of the railroad policemen. Upon learning that defendant\u2019s license had been suspended for a previous drunk driving violation, the police advised him against driving. Accordingly, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>fendant slept in the van until approximately 1:30 p.m. on Sunday and traveled by train and bus to his brother\u2019s apartment in Old Bridge where he stayed on weekends. After taking a shower, defendant watched some football on TV, then ate supper. He later had a telephone conversation with his girl friend during which he told her that he was not going out that evening. It was also his testimony that he never left the apartment that evening and was unaware of what had occurred until his brother came home at approximately 10:30 p.m. and told him that the police were searching for him in connection with the shooting of two officers. After his arrest, defendant stated he continuously denied shooting any police officers and at trial he denied making any of the statements attributed to him by the police. Specifically, he disavowed ever saying he had shot anyone with his left hand or yelling about blowing away two cops or that he was going to blow away the rest of the police force when he was released on bail. Defendant also denied having acknowledged to any fellow inmates that he had shot two police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In cross-examining defendant concerning his defense of being at his brother\u2019s apartment at the time of the crime, the prosecutor focused upon defendant\u2019s failure to have disclosed this defense prior to the preparation of a Notice of Alibi on March 8, 1985.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After having the Notice of Alibi marked for identification <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and establishing that defendant was arrested in October 1983, the prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Q. How many times did you come to court in 1984? You were arraigned in January, isn\u2019t that right? January 11?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">A. I don\u2019t remember the date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">A. You mean arraignment. I was arraigned October 31st.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">Q. Did you tell anybody from the State that it couldn\u2019t be you because you spent the night in your brother\u2019s apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">A. No, and no one asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">Q. No one asked. How about when you came to court for the pretrial hearings that were conducted in March and May and July and were you telling anybody from the State it couldn\u2019t be me, you got the wrong guy. I spent the night at my brother\u2019s apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">THE COURT: Any time that you came to court, did you ever tell anybody, either on behalf of the Court or State, that you were at your brother\u2019s apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\">THE WITNESS: What do you mean? Like my lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-16\">THE COURT: Your lawyer, the Court, anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-17\">THE WITNESS: I told them I wasn\u2019t guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-18\">Q. That\u2019s not my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-19\">THE COURT: Did you ever tell them you were at your brother\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-20\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I told them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-21\">Q. Who did you tell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-22\">A. I told Travis [Travis Francis, defendant\u2019s attorney]. He came down\u2014I first seen him in September of 1984. He was with Jim Heaton. I told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq4\">Q. This is September of 1984. When you came, when we had the court hearings in January, you weren\u2019t present but this wasn\u2019t signed until March of 1985.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-24\">Q. Mr. Aceta, the sum and substance of this is that since October 30th, 1983 you have been facing extremely serious charges, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-25\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-27\">Q. Yet, all through 1984 did anyone interpose that on your behalf, this alibi that you couldn\u2019t be guilty because you weren\u2019t at the scene of the crime when the two officers were shot? Did that ever happen throughout any time in 1983 or 1984?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-28\">A. I don\u2019t know how to say this. We talked about a case, defenses\u2014repeat that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>THE COURT: The question is at any time did, at any time before, couple of weeks ago did you ever sign a statement about your alibi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">THE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">Q. The fact of the matter is that prior to your coming to court on March 8, 1985, the very eve of trial, that nobody from the State ever heard about this alibi defense because you had never signed the alibi notice, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">A. Yes. Wait. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">Q. So, for a year and a half you just sat on this alibi; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmQ\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The State\u2019s offer of the Notice of Alibi into evidence was denied as the trial judge considered its admission might create in the minds of the jurors an \u201cinference or a conclusion that there was a duty upon the defendant ... in the connection with alibi defense to sustain some level of proof.\u201d Similar reasoning prompted the judge to preclude the prosecutor from commenting in his summation as to those named as witnesses in the Notice of Alibi. However, comment was permitted on the timing of the Notice as legitimate argument on credibility or recent fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">In the closing argument, the prosecutor commented in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">Well, next comes the eleventh hour alibi defense. Now, you know in this case the defendant was charged the morning after the shooting in shooting two police officers and you know because the Judge told you that one of the things as proper, I am looking for his things. I am entitled to by the Rules and one of those things is notice of alibi and the Judge told you that I asked the defense for alibi in this case a number of months ago. As a matter of fact, I looked through my records. I asked for it in February of 1984. That is over a year ago and it is also clear from the record in this case, I didn\u2019t get it until March 8th, 1985. And then, I am provided this alibi where the defense says, you know, Prosecutor, I have been in court a lot of times, but I am now telling you you got it all wrong. 1 didn\u2019t shoot these cops. I wasn\u2019t even in South Amboy. I spent the entire night in my brother\u2019s apartment in Old Bridge. Now, and he testifies to that effect. He says I am with my brother, Danny, and I am with Karen, his wife, and their children. Later on they go and I am all alone by myself and what does he present in support of that? Well, he brings in Kathy Pilot to tell about this telephone call that she has supposedly made to Danny\u2019s apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Now, you have heard Mr. Francis comment upon the defendant. He\u2019d like to take the stand. Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you consider yourself a baseball game, it is now the bottom of the ninth. There is two outs and he is way behind. [If] he is going to beat this charge. He\u2019d better get to the plate and start hitting a lot of homeruns because he got a lot of crown [sic ], lot of runs to make up in this ease, so now he is going to get up and he going to tell you he wants you to hear his side of the story, this side of the story which he forgot or neglected or somehow was unable to tell the State for the seventeen months he has had these various serious charges over his head, but now he is going to tell you this side twice____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Following the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant and also upon the completion of the State\u2019s summation, defense counsel moved for a mistrial because of the questions and comments directed to defendant\u2019s failure to mention his alibi defense prior to March 8, 1985. In denying the first application, the trial judge concluded that \u201c[t]he idea of cross examination for late supplied alibies as a matter of recent fabrication is well recognized law.\u201d This rationale was relied upon by the judge in denying defendant\u2019s motion following the prosecutor\u2019s summation. At that time, the judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">In regard to the ruling on the alibi I again indicated that on the issue of recent fabrication that while [there] could be no comment on whether or not other witnesses were brought forward and indeed I wouldn\u2019t even let the notice in simply because it gave rise to the inference that the burden shifted\u2014the characterization and the efforts to see the jury to make a judgment of credibility on the defendant\u2019s testimony, I think is within the ruling and within the law as I understand it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">In contending that harmful error was committed by the trial judge in permitting the cross-examination of defendant with respect to his failure to inform the State of his alibi defense until March 8, 1985, three days before trial, and in allowing the prosecutor to comment on this topic in his summation, defendant argues that such cross-examination and comment \u201cimpermissibly invaded the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, denying to him his right to a fair trial.\u201d While countering with the argument that defendant\u2019s right to remain silent was not violated by the prosecutor\u2019s trial tactics, the State claims, nevertheless, that any error which might have thus been created was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Relying upon <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 338 (1971), it is urged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the error, if any, does not mandate a new trial as, even without the complained of cross-examination and summation, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict. In our view, the prosecutor\u2019s attack upon defendant\u2019s failure to have previously disclosed his exculpatory alibi defense was so flagrant a violation of defendant\u2019s right to remain silent that this conviction cannot stand. A new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>R. </em>3:11-1 mandates that a bill of particulars concerning a proposed alibi defense be provided to the State by a defendant within ten days of the prosecutor\u2019s demand. The Notice of Alibi must be signed by the defendant and set forth \u201cthe specific place or places at which he claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense and the names and addresses of the witnesses upon whom he intended to rely to establish such alibi.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:11-1. Failure to furnish such particulars may result in the exclusion of witnesses at trial as to defendant\u2019s absence from or presence at the scene of the alleged offense or, under appropriate circumstances, limiting the extent of the alibi testimony. <em>R. </em>3:11-2. <em>Cf. State v. Caffee, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34 (App.Div.1987), certif. den., 107 <em>N.J. </em>640 (1987); <em>State v. Francis, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346 (App.Div.1974). The rule is not designed to compel a defendant to say anything. It merely requires the specified pretrial disclosure if, but only if, the defendant plans to assert an alibi. <em>State v. Angeleri, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>382, 384-385 (1968), <em>cert, </em>den., 393 <em>U.S. </em>951, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>372, 21 L.Ed.2d 362 (1968). <em>See also State v. Baldwin, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>379, 388 (1966), <em>cert, </em>den., 385 <em>U.S. </em>980, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>527, 17 L.Ed.2d 442 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Although defendant\u2019s noncompliance with the rule did not give rise to any sanctions, the trial judge deemed it permissible for the prosecutor to pursue this subject by way of cross-examination and argument because of the implication of recent fabrication on the part of defendant. We are constrained to conclude that such determination was contrary to the conclusion in <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100 (1976), that the prosecution may not comment upon or pose questions to a defendant concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>his silence or his failure to disclose exculpatory information to the State at or after the time of his arrest, nor may such silence be used in an attempted impeachment of a defendant\u2019s exculpatory trial testimony. This conclusion was reached \u201cas a matter of state law and policy,\u201d based upon the \u201cprivilege against self-incrimination which is enshrined in the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 113 <em>See also State v. Whitehead, 80 N.J. </em>343, 346-348 (1979); <em>State v. Lyle, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>403 (1977); <em>State v. Alston, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>95 (1976); <em>State v. Micheliche, Jr., </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532 (App.Div.1987); <em>State v. Merola, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>108 (App.Div.1986), certif den., 107 <em>N.J. </em>91 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In <em>Deatore, </em>the reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction was upheld because of the improper questioning of defendant concerning his failure to have disclosed his alibi defense at the time of his arrest or later when he learned of the charges against him. There, when asked on cross-examination whether it was not true that he had refused to voice any exculpatory information to the police when arrested, defendant replied, \u201cnobody asked me.\u201d Such questioning was deemed improper as being violative of defendant\u2019s common law privilege against self-incrimination and right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 114. Not only is a suspect or an accused under no duty to give a statement to the police at or about the time of his arrest, but on the contrary is privileged to say nothing. <em>Ibid. </em>As no inference can be drawn from the exercise of the privilege to remain silent nor may comment thereon be made to the jury, it follows \u201cthat a defendant is under no obligation to volunteer to the authorities at the first opportunity the exculpatory story he later tells at trial and cannot be penalized directly or indirectly if he does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115. The privilege of silence is substantially eroded when used either as substantive proof of guilt or in an attempt to impeach a defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony through cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 115-116. As stated by the court, the rule is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">a defendant is under no obligation to volunteer to the authorities at the first opportunity the exculpatory story he later tells at his trial and cannot be</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>penalized directly or indirectly if he does not. While the situation in <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Ripa </em>[45 <em>N.J. </em>199, (1965)] was that of the State offering evidence of a refusal to answer as substantive proof of guilty on its own case, we think the result should be no different when it is presented by way of attempted impeachment of a defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony through cross-examination, and we so hold as a matter of state law. The privilege of silence is substantially eroded and reliance upon it unjustifiably penalized in either situation. [70 <em>N.J. </em>at 115-116]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The use of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence for the purpose of impeaching an exculpatory defense was recognized in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>610, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) as having federal constitutional implications. That the discrepancy between an exculpatory story at trial and silence at time of arrest gave rise to an inference of recent fabrication was deemed insufficient reason to permit cross-examination for impeachment purposes. Such use of a defendant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> warnings was deemed violative of the Fourteenth Amendment guaranty of due process. <em>Id. </em>at 619, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2245. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">Despite the importance of cross-examination, we have concluded that the Miranda decision compels rejection of the State\u2019s position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">Silence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these Miranda rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested. [Citations omitted.] Moreover, while it is true that the Miranda warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial. [426 <em>U.S. </em>at 617-618, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2244-45]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">While the due process infringement found by the <em>Doyle </em>court was based upon the unfairness of using a post-arrest silence against the defendant in the wake of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, our State law precludes the use of a defendant\u2019s silence irrespective of whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given or under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>stood. <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 117, n. 10. Such impropriety extends to an attack upon the credibility of a defendant\u2019s self-defense theory based upon his prior silence, and, where \u201cthis defense was at the very heart of the case, the prosecutor\u2019s action was \u2018of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result ... \u2019 and hence in the magnitude of plain error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.\u201d [Citations omitted.] <em>State v. Lyle, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 410. <em>See also State v. Whitehead, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 346-348; <em>State v. Alston, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 98; <em>State v. Merola, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 115-120 (App.Div.1986). <em>Cf. State v. Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 530-531 (App.Div.1985). The conclusion reached in <em>Lyle </em>was not dependent upon the assurance implied in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Rather, it was held as a matter of State law that it was manifestly improper for the prosecutor to use defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence to question his self-defense theory as a fabrication. The prosecutor\u2019s broadside attack through his cross-examination and closing argument was considered to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result and hence in the magnitude of plain error. <em>Id. </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">It is clear from the record in the present case the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s persistent inquiry on cross-examination concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to have previously asserted his alibi defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s right was further infringed upon by reference in the prosecutor\u2019s summation to the \u201celeventh hour alibi defense\u201d and the analogizing of defendant\u2019s trial testimony to the \u201chitting [of] a lot of homeruns\u201d during the last inning of a baseball game in which defendant had a \u201clot of runs to make up in this case,\u201d and was doing so by testifying as to his \u201cside of the story which he forgot or neglected or somehow was unable to tell the State for the seventeen months he has had these various serious charges over his head....\u201d The trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>rationale that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was permissible in light of the implication of recent fabrication arising from the lately supplied alibi is unacceptable in view of the established rule that such an inference is an insufficient reason for permitting a defendant\u2019s silence to be used to attack his exculpatory trial testimony as a fabrication. Nor, can the prosecutor\u2019s questioning and remarks be justified on the basis of contradictory post-arrest statements made by the defendant. The alleged utterances made by defendant while in custody were not such inculpatory concessions of involvement in the offense as to constitute a waiver of his right to remain silent and thus permit the attempted impeachment of his alibi defense. The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Lofton v.

Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 444-445, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\"> The violation was compounded by the questioning of the trial judge, in attempting to clarify the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry, as to defendant\u2019s failure to have disclosed his alibi defense during any of his pretrial court appearances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b62-9\">A.M. STEIN, J.S.C., t/a</author>\n<p id=\"AC\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">I reach the same result, but for somewhat different reasons than those advanced in the majority opinion. In my view, the prosecutor had a right to cross-examine defendant about what was accurately portrayed be summation as an eleventh-hour alibi defense. The question was relevant for the purpose of showing that this alibi was a recent fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">It is beyond dispute that reversible error was committed when the prosecutor was permitted to ask defendant on cross-examination why, at any time after his arrest, he never told anybody that he was at his brother\u2019s apartment in Old Bridge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>when two police officers were shot in South Amboy. The error was compounded when, in summation, the prosecutor commented that defendant had either neglected or was unwilling to report this alibi for the entire seventeen months between arrest and trial. As the majority opinion points out, a suspect or an accused is under no duty to give a statement to the police at or about the time of arrest. The privilege against self-incrimination gives a defendant the right to remain silent. No inference can be drawn from such silence, no comment may be made thereon by the prosecutor or the trial judge, and no defendant can be cross-examined about his silence to impeach the exculpatory story which he gives at trial. <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 115-116 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The trial judge enhanced the error by asking the defendant whether he had ever told anybody, including his lawyer, that he was at his brother\u2019s apartment, miles from the crime scene. Not only was this line of questioning prohibited under <em>Deatore, </em>it also was an obvious, impermissible invasion of the attorney-client privilege. <em>Evid.R. </em>26(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">There are reasons why silence at or near the time of arrest may not only be golden, but eminently prudent. As Chief Justice Hughes pointed out in <em>Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 117):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">... There are many reasons why a person in such a situation may choose to say nothing. A likely explanation is conscious reliance on his right to remain silent. Another is a general feeling that it is better not to say anything at all when surrounded by police or officials in a fearful atmosphere. Still another, in the case of an alibi, might be the simple lack of immediate recollection of the defendant as to his whereabouts at the time of the occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">For reasons already expressed by the majority and myself, the right to remain silent immediately following arrest is inviolate. That right, whether viewed as common law in origin or constitutional in dimension, has little, if anything, to do with the inordinately late assertion of an alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">As the majority points out at 28, <em>R. </em>3:11-1 does not compel the defendant to disclose his whereabouts at the time of the commission of the offense for which he stands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>accused. However, when he intends to rely upon an alibi, after demand of the prosecutor, he must disclose his whereabouts and the names of his witnesses. <em>R. </em>3:11-1 requires that this information be provided not later than ten days after the prosecutor\u2019s written demand therefor, or such other time as the trial judge permits in the interest of justice. Failure to furnish such information permits the court to bar the alibi defense <em>(R. </em>3:11-2), even if offered by the testimony of defendant himself. <em>State v. Francis, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 351-352 (App.Div.1974). The constitutionality of notice of alibi rules has been upheld. <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>78, 85, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1893, 1898, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>446, 452 (1970); <em>State v. Angeleri, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>382, 385 (1968), <em>cert. </em>den. 393 <em>U.S. </em>951, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>372, 21 L.Ed.2d 362 (1968). Of course, the informed and realistic prosecutor knows that our courts will rarely invoke the drastic sanction of prohibiting an alibi defense. <em>State v. Caffee, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 37-38 (App.Div.1987), certif. den. 107 <em>N.J. </em>640 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"AAT\">We should not confuse the right to remain silent with the obligation to provide alibi information within a reasonable time after it is demanded by the State. In February 1984, defendant was served with a bill of particulars, pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:11-1. Thirteen months later, on March 8, 1985\u2014just three days before the trial began\u2014defendant provided the prosecutor with the required answers to this bill of particulars. There should be no absolute rule prohibiting the prosecutor from questioning the defendant about the reason for such a long delay, and preventing summation argument to the jury that this delay is evidence of a recent fabrication of the alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Obviously, the late filing of an alibi bill of particulars should not automatically permit the prosecutor to assert the claim of recent fabrication. Each situation should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. A prosecutor who wishes to attack defendant\u2019s late alibi on the grounds that it is of recent fabrication should so advise the trial judge out of the jury\u2019s presence. The dispute as to what, if anything, is admissible, can then be resolved upon an offer of proof. <em>Evid. R. </em>8(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
