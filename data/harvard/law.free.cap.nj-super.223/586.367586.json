He was found guilty of second-degree sexual assault <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(1)), a lesser included offense of first-degree aggravated sexual assault and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of five years. A $25 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty was also assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">On appeal from the judgment of conviction defendant contends that the jury\u2019s finding that he was guilty of second-degree sexual assault was the result of a compromise verdict, made possible because the court erroneously denied his motions for acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case concerning kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">At trial the State presented evidence that on September 5, 1985, at approximately 12:15 a.m., R.M., a ticket agent for the Olympia Trails Bus Company, completed her shift at the Newark Airport and caught the bus to Grove Street and Springfield Avenue in Irvington. She walked down Springfield Avenue, stopped at a bar and called a friend to pick her up. R.M. waited outside the bar knowing that if her friend was not there within the hour, it meant that his car would not start and that he was not coming. While she waited, she saw defendant and a female passenger drive up. They asked her if she wanted a ride. She declined. About 20 to 25 minutes later, defendant\u2019s companion left and defendant again offered R.M. a ride to her home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>More than an hour having passed and her friend not appearing, R.M. accepted defendant\u2019s offer. She said she asked him to \u201cjust drive me down Springfield Avenue.\u201d Defendant gave his name as \u201cT\u201d. He drove two blocks down Springfield before he turned off the main street, suggesting to R.M. that they \u201cride around for awhile.\u201d R.M. said that she \u201cfigured it was okay.\u201d They talked in a conversational, social manner. Defendant told R.M. about his girl friend and his former job. They rode around for hours. After a while, defendant parked the car, got out, and engaged in conversation with people on the street. R.M. said that she did not know where she was. She expressed no fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Defendant returned to the ear. He told R.M. that she could drive the car, but not in the city. He drove the car through winding roads ending up at the South Mountain Reservation, a park in South Orange. R.M. said she did not know the road. R.M. said that at no time prior to arriving at the Reservation was sex a topic of conversation. R.M. said she told defendant that she wanted to go home on three separate occasions during the drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">When they arrived at the park, it was dark and deserted. Defendant shut off the engine and told her that she \u201cwas going to be his woman and he wanted [her], and stuff like that.\u201d He insisted that she get out of the car, telling her that \u201cwhen the car cools off, we are going to leave.\u201d Once out of the car defendant was \u201cgrabbing onto [her] and kissing [her].\u201d R.M. said that she demanded to be taken home, telling defendant that she would walk if necessary. Defendant again promised to take her home, saying, \u201cI hate to see what [those white boys out there] will do to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">R.M. said defendant then told her that \u201che wanted to have sex with [her].\u201d She refused. \u201cThen he told [her] that [she] was going to do it and if she didn\u2019t do it what he was going to do to [her].\u201d R.M. continued to resist and defendant threatened to really give her something to cry for if she didn\u2019t \u201cshut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>up.\u201d R.M. said defendant then put her \u201cup on the car,\u201d pulled off her underwear, and forced sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">R.M. said that prior to sexual intercourse, defendant \u201cmade [her] feel him and get him hard.\u201d He also told her she was going to \u201cgive him some head.\u201d Since she was \u201ccrying real loud,\u201d he covered her mouth, having vaginal sexual intercourse with her twice, once from the front and once from behind. Except for her underwear, R.M. remained fully clothed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Defendant then told R.M. that she \u201chad better not tell or get him into trouble, because he is not going to get in trouble for [her].\u201d He also said, \u201cwell, I know you are going to tell anyway. I might as well get rid of you now.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As he looked in the car, she heard the sound of a hard object. She kicked off her shoes as she ran two blocks to the street. Defendant drove over the grass after her. Reaching the highway, she kept running until she found someone to help. A stranger testified to her distraught, shoeless condition at that time. It was then 6:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Defendant testified that he drove R.M. to. her home, but that she told him that she did not want to go inside her home \u201cright at the moment, because her mother had her child.\u201d They then drove around. Defendant said that he stopped the car at the Hideaway Lounge to talk to his friends. He said that while driving with R.M. he \u201cthought about making out, you know with her because she had been acting like she wanted to make out and whatnot.\u201d Because of his perception that R.M. was willing, he drove to South Mountain Reservation. He said they had intercourse voluntarily following which R.M. asked him for $40. When defendant refused, she \u201cbecame hysterical.\u201d Defendant said he told her that he was leaving and that she was welcome to leave with him, but also reiterated that he was not going to give her the $40. R.M. became \u201creal hysterical.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Defendant testified that he \u201cpanicked, ... got scared and drove off. [He] drove off and left her there.\u201d Defendant denied forcing R.M. to have intercourse, or transporting R.M. with the intention to force her to have intercourse. He said that all of R.M.\u2019s conduct had been consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">At the close of the State\u2019s case defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charges of kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault (aggravated because committed during a kidnapping, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(3)), asserting that the State failed to establish \u201cremoval or confinement,\u201d or that R.M.\u2019s removal or confinement was \u201cunlawful\u201d because \u201caccomplished by force, threat, or deception\u201d as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-1d.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We consider defendant\u2019s challenge to the quantum of evidence adduced to prove the elements of \u201cdeception\u201d and of \u201cremoval or confinement,\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-1d, to have merit. The court ruled,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">[a]s I read the statute, if the defendant by deception got the victim to come into his car, that is kidnapping. Then he removed her a substantial distance from that place for the purpose of committing an aggravating [sic] sexual assault; that is, kidnapping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We agree with the judge\u2019s statement of the law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 13-lb and d provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">b. A person is guilty of kidnapping if he unlawfully removes another from his place of residence or business, or a substantial distance from the vicinity where he is found, or if he unlawfully confines another for a substantial period, with any of the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">(1) To facilitate commission of any crime or flight thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">(2) ... If the actor releases the victim unharmed and in a safe place prior to apprehension, it is a crime of the second degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">d. A removal or confinement is unlawful within the meaning of this section and of sections 2C:13-2 and 3 if it is accomplished by force, threat or deception ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Our disagreement with the court is in its application of the law to the facts which the State adduced in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We first examine the \u201cdeception.\u201d From R.M.\u2019s testimony, there was only one stated purpose when she got in the car which was for defendant to drive her home, as he told her that he would do. If R.M. first entered the car because of that deception, however, the record is clear that this deception did not continue undiminished because R.M. said that defendant later told her that he would let her drive the car away from the city, apparently as an explanation for why she remained in the car while he took her to the park. Obviously that reason for her continuing to drive with him had nothing to do with taking her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Defendant and R.M. were strangers. Neither claimed that R.M. got into the car on the understanding that their mutual purpose was to share each other\u2019s company. Whether that shared purpose developed was a question of fact from the evidence of hours of mutually acceptable driving and agreeable conversation. Based upon R.M.\u2019s testimony we consider the question of whether the State established that defendant continually deceived R.M. debatable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We need not rule, however, on whether the evidence supported a finding of constant deception because we are convinced that the State did not establish that R.M. was \u201cconfined\u201d or \u201cremoved\u201d by the deception. The elements of kidnapping are to be narrowly construed. The following are excerpts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>from the Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, <em>Final Report, </em>Vol. <em>II </em>at 181, sec. 2C:13-1 (1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">Kidnapping which was only a misdemeanor at common law, has become in modern legislation one of the most severely punished offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Overbreadth is now the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u2018The central problem of legislative reform in this field is to devise a proper system of grading to discriminate between simple false imprisonment and the more terrifying and dangerous abductions for ransom or other felonious purpose. In particular, provision for the death penalty must be consistent with general policy in this regard embodied in sections dealing with murder and attempted murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\"><em>\u2018And, it is desirable to restrict the scope of kidnapping, as an alternative or cumulative treatment of behavior whose chief significance is </em>robbery or <em>rape, </em>because the broad scope of this overlapping offense has given rise to the serious injustice____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">\u2018The blame cannot be placed exclusively at the door of the prosecutor for choosing to indict for kidnapping. When an especially outrageous crime is committed there will always be public clamor for the extreme penalty which the laws permit, and it is precisely the obligation of penal legislators to minimize opportunities for such injustice by clearly and rationally restricting discretion to punish.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-14\">\u2018It is necessary, therefore, to define an aggravated offense of kidnapping which shall consist of removal or confinement involving <em>substantial isolation of the victim where the duration of the isolation, </em>the intention of the kidnapper, or other circumstances <em>makes the behavior specially terrifying and dangerous. [Final Report, </em>Vol. II at 181-183, sec. 2C:13-1 (1971), quoting MPC T.D. 11, pp. 11-15 (1960), emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">R.M. specifically testified that she was in no fear until the actual assault. Despite testimony that it was dark and the area unknown, R.M. never said that she was confined when defendant stopped or drove the car. There was no evidence that R.M. could not have left the car at any time if she wished. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>conclude that \u201cremoval\u201d and \u201cconfinement,\u201d whether by deception or otherwise, was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We need not pass upon defendant\u2019s contention that the State seeks to apply the kidnapping label to every instance where a woman who voluntarily enters a man\u2019s car on a date is subsequently sexually assaulted. We agree with the State and the trial judge that where an offender entices a victim into a car by deception, transports the victim to a remote place without opportunity for the victim\u2019s escape and commits sexual assault, all of the elements of kidnapping may be established. We merely conclude that the State\u2019s evidence did not support such a finding in this case and defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal on the kidnapping and first-degree sexual assault should have been granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We are nonetheless convinced that defendant\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to acquit him of kidnapping at the end of the State\u2019s case is without merit. Contrary to <em>State v. Christener, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>55, 69-70 (1976), we do not find that there was a real possibility that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction in <em>State v. Christener, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 73 that \u201cit should be regarded as error for a trial judge to deliver a jury instruction on a criminal charge for which there is no, or insufficient evidence to support the instruction.\u201d However, in <em>State v. Thomas, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>344, 365 (1978) the Court clarified this statement by stating, \u201c[o]ur holding in <em>Christener </em>does not stand for the proposition that reversal is mandated every time a judge charges a jury about a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>crime for which there may be insufficient evidence to support a conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The <em>Christener </em>court was particularly concerned with the harm of overcharging in <em>homicide </em>cases. 71 <em>N.J. </em>at 72. Unlike the facts in Christener; where \u201cthere was a real possibility that the jury could have found the defendant not guilty,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 69, the evidence clearly supported the sexual assault conviction, the elements of which were entirely separate from the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\"> As previously noted, defendant was acquitted of the charge of terroristic threats.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> The State relies upon many out-of-state interpretations of confinement by deception. <em>State v.
