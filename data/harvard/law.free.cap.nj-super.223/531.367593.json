La Bruno and another inmate, Joseph Satkin, were both transported out of the prison on a regular basis for medical treatment. The plan called for defendant, James Fornino, to kill the guards who accompanied the inmates on one of these trips and to free La Bruno and Satkin. La Bruno\u2019s father, codefendant Carmen La Bruno, Sr., also was involved in making arrangements for the escape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">La Bruno discussed these escape plans with Satkin in November and December of 1982 and solicited his participation. La Bruno asked Satkin to arrange for the payment of $10,000 to defendant. However, Satkin informed prison officials of the plans and thereafter cooperated in gathering the evidence on which criminal charges ultimately would be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">The State Police had Satkin tell La Bruno that a friend of his called \u201cLouie K,\u201d (actually an undercover trooper) would deliver the money Satkin had been asked to pay defendant. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>night before the escape was to be committed, the trooper posing as \u201cLouie K\u201d met with defendant and La Bruno, Sr. at a diner in Hoboken. As the three men were leaving the diner, the trooper made the agreed payment to defendant. Shortly thereafter, defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Before the jury which was to try the three defendants was sworn, the prosecutor disclosed that several telephone calls made by La Bruno from Rahway State Prison regarding the planned escape had been monitored by prison officials without a warrant. Defense counsel argued that this telephone monitoring was illegal and might require dismissal of the charges. Anticipating that resolution of the issues raised by the telephone monitoring might consume a substantial amount of time, the trial court declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Several months later, an evidentiary hearing was held on motions by defendant and his eodefendants to suppress the evidence obtained through the telephone calls intercepted without a warrant. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">During the hearing on the motion to suppress, La Bruno and La Bruno, Sr. pled guilty to count I of the indictment (conspiracy to commit the crimes of escape and murder).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, the charges against the La Brunos were severed and only defendant was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">A jury found defendant guilty on all charges. The trial court merged the conspiracy convictions into the convictions for attempted escape and attempted murder. On the conviction for attempted murder, defendant was sentenced to an extended term of 20 years, with 9 years of parole ineligibility. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>conviction for attempted escape, defendant was sentenced to a concurrent term of 10 years, with 5 years of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">On appeal defendant makes the following arguments:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">POINT I: NO RATIONAL TRIER OF FACT COULD HAVE FOUND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED MURDER OR ATTEMPTED ESCAPE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT ON THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE STATE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">POINT II: NO RATIONAL TRIER OF FACT COULD HAVE FOUND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT ON THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE STATE (NOT RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">POINT VIII: THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-13\">POINT X: 'THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY WERE ERRONEOUS (PARTIALLY RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-15\">B. THE CHARGE FAILED TO CLARIFY THAT PREPARATION IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN A CONVICTION FOR AN ATTEMPT (NOT RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-17\">POINT XII: DEFENDANT HAD INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL (NOT RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">We reject all the arguments made by defendant and affirm the judgment of conviction. The only arguments which require discussion are contained in points I, II, VIII, X(B) and XII of defendant\u2019s brief. Defendant\u2019s other arguments are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Defendant\u2019s first point is that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt of attempted murder or attempted escape. His second point is that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt of conspiracy to commit murder. Since defendant entered into a conspiracy with the La Brunos before taking any steps to carry out that conspiracy, it is appropriate to consider defendant\u2019s first two points in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">There is ample evidence from which the jury could conclude that the conspiracy into which defendant entered involved a plan not only for the escape of La Bruno and Satkin but also for the murder of the correction officers guarding them. Satkin testified that La Bruno told him that the plan was for defendant to overpower the guards and kill them. Handguns equipped with silencers were to be used for this purpose. Satkin further testified that La Bruno had told him that La Bruno, Sr. and defendant had surveyed the woods behind the doctor\u2019s office where the escape was to occur in order to find a place to dispose of the guards\u2019 bodies. Some corroboration of Satkin\u2019s testimony was provided by statements made by La Bruno while riding in a van with Satkin on the day of the planned escape, which were surreptitiously recorded by the State Police. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">[Satkin]: Three bullets can\u2019t even hit, knock that motherfucker [referring to one of the guards] out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">[La Bruno]: Your ass, Joe. Are you nuts? They\u2019ll blow him right out of his fucking shoes. Are you wacked out? ;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Defendant also made several statements which provide inferential support for the conclusion that he intended to kill the guards. During the meeting in the diner where he received the payment for his part in the planned escape, defendant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">Problems, problems, you get out of the way. Just get them out of the way. Whatever way you gotta do it you get them out of the way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>You know. Like I said before, you know, if you got an obstacle, you get it out of your way. You know, you ah accomplish your goal and ah you ah get all your obstacles out of your way to accomplish your goal, right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">A reasonable jury, viewing this evidence most favorably to the State, could conclude that defendant and his coconspirators planned to kill the guards in carrying out the escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The more difficult question is whether the evidence was also sufficient for the jury to conclude that defendant took sufficient steps in carrying out the conspiracy to have committed attempted escape and attempted murder. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">a. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">(3) Purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">b. Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under subsection a.(3) of this section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The 1971 report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission which drafted the Code of Criminal Justice indicates that the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5\u20141 was to expand the scope of criminal responsibility for attempts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACo\">New Jersey\u2019s cases adopt a rule which has become known as \u201cthe probable desistance test.\u201d ... It provides that the actor\u2019s conduct constitutes an attempt if, in the ordinary and natural course of events, without interruption from an outside source, it will probably result in the crime intended. The test requires a judgment, in each ease, if an attempt is to be found, that the actor had reached a point where it was unlikely that he would have voluntarily desisted from his efforts to commit the crime. The leading case is <em>State v. Schwarzbach </em>[84 <em>N.J.L. </em>268 (1313)], <em>supra </em>(\u201cThe overt act or acts must be such as will apparently result, in the usual and natural course of events, if not hindered by extraneous causes, in the commission of the crime itself. Mere pre-preparations are not the overt acts required\u201d).... We reject this, as well as several other tests, as the standard for distinguishing preparations from attempts. <em>[1971 New Jersey Penal Code Commentary, </em>Vol. II, at 116-117],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">The Commission\u2019s reformulation of the law of attempt contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1(a)(3) and (b) is taken from the substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>tially similar language of the Model Penal Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s report describes the intent of these provisions by quoting the pertinent part of the report of the drafters of the Model Penal Code as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">First, this formulation shifts the emphasis from what remains to be done\u2014 the chief concern of the proximity tests\u2014to what the actor has already done. The fact that further major steps must be taken before the crime can be completed does not preclude a finding that the steps already undertaken are substantial. It is expected, in the normal case, that this approach will broaden the scope of attempt liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">Second, although it is intended that the requirement of a substantial step will result in the imposition of attempt liability only in those instances in which some firmness of criminal purpose is shown, no finding is required as to whether the actor would probably have desisted prior to completing the crime____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">In addition to assuring firmness of purpose, the requirement of a substantial step will remove very remote preparatory acts from the ambit of attempt liability and the relatively stringent sanctions imposed for attempts. On the other hand, by broadening liability to the extent suggested, apprehension of dangerous persons will be facilitated and law enforcement officials and others will be able to stop the criminal effort at an earlier stage\u2014thereby minimizing the risk of substantive harm\u2014without providing immunity for the offender. [New Jersey Penal Code Commentary, <em>supra, </em>at 117-118],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Under the expanded scope of attempt liability incorporated into the Code, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant had taken substantial steps which were strongly corroborative of the \u201cfirmness of his purpose\u201d to carry out the plan to kill the correction officers assigned to guard La Bruno and to free him from custody. Defendant, in the company of La Bruno, Sr., had visited the doctors\u2019 office where the escape was supposed to occur and had surveyed a wooded area behind the office where the bodies of the murdered guards could be disposed. Furthermore, he arranged a meeting the night before the planned escape with the person he believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>was to pay him for his part in the crime and he in fact accepted the agreed upon payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The conclusion that defendant had gone far enough in carrying out the planned escape to be found guilty of attempted escape and attempted murder is supported by our decision in <em>State v. Jovanovich, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435 (Resent. Panel 1980), affd 181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>97 (App.Div.1981). There we held that an individual could be found guilty of attempted arson for soliciting another person to burn his building and describing to that person the layout and type of construction of the building. We reached this conclusion even though the defendant had not yet obtained the insurance on the premises which it was the object of the planned arson to collect, had not paid the other person for the commission of the crime, and had not planned to go through with the arson if foreclosure proceedings on the premises could be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Additional support for our conclusion is provided by decisions in other jurisdictions which have recognized that the reconnaissance of the planned site of a crime and the payment of money for its commission are substantial steps in a course of conduct planned to culminate in a crime. In <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>775 F.2d 31 (2nd Cir.1985), defendant, an inmate in federal prison, solicited another inmate, who was a government informant, to arrange for the murder of a third inmate in another institution. After the informant told defendant that the murder could be arranged, defendant gave him $350 as \u201can advance\u201d for commission of the crime. Defendant later equivocated as to whether he wanted the crime committed and the informant returned the $350 to him. However, the court determined that the original solicitation of the commission of the crime and payment of the \u201cadvance\u201d constituted attempted murder. In <em>State v. Manchester, </em>213 <em>Neb. </em>670, 331 <em>N.W.2d </em>776 (Sup.Ct.1983), the court affirmed a conviction for attempted murder based upon defendant\u2019s solicitation of a person to commit the crime, arranging for a weapon, setting aside the payment for the crime in a billfold, and showing the killer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>victim, his residence, and his place of work. In <em>United States v. Ivic, </em>700 <em>F.</em>2d 51, 67 (2nd Cir.1983), the court affirmed a conviction for an attempt to use explosives based on discussions of how to plant explosives at the site of the planned crime, the reconnaissance of the crime scene, the acquisition of explosives, and an authorization by the leader of the group to commit the crime, even though no explosives were ever transported to the scene of the planned crime. In <em>United States v. Brown, </em>604 F.2d 347, 350 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. </em>den. 445 <em>U.S. </em>962, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1649, 64 L.Ed.2d 237 (1980), the court upheld a conviction for an attempt to destroy a building based solely on evidence that the defendant had made arrangements for the purchase of explosives and had sent the persons who were to commit the crime to inspect the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In short, both the comments of the Criminal Law Revision Commission which proposed enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1(a)(3) and (b) and the cases which have applied the expanded concept of attempt embodied in these provisions demonstrate that even if further major steps are required before a crime can be completed, or the accused had ample opportunity to desist prior to completing the crime, a jury can still conclude that an attempt has been committed. Thus, even though substantial additional steps were required before the escape of La Bruno could be accomplished and defendant still had the opportunity to change his mind and not to commit the crime or to depart from his plan with La Bruno and not to kill the guards, defendant\u2019s visits to the scene of the planned crime and his receipt of money for its commission could properly be found by the jury to constitute \u201csubstantial steps in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of the crime\u201d which were \u201cstrongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.\u201d Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to find him guilty of attempted murder and attempted escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>For the same reason, we reject the argument made in Point X(B) of defendant\u2019s brief that the trial court committed reversible error by not instructing the jury that \u201cpreparation is insufficient to sustain a conviction for an attempt.\u201d Defendant did not request such an instruction or object to its omission by the trial court. Consequently, the failure to give this instruction would be grounds for reversal only if it were plain error. <em>State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>526, 538 (1969). We find no such error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that, in order to establish defendant\u2019s guilt of an attempt, the State was required to show that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">... did or omitted to do anything which under the circumstances as a reasonable person would believe him <em>[sic </em>] to be is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in the course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">In other words, this element requires that the defendant either purposely performed or failed to perform an act which is a positive step toward the commission of the crime, however, the step taken must be one which is strongly corroborative of the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">This instruction accurately reflected the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5\u20141(a)(3) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">We further note that any statement to the effect that mere preparation for the commission of a crime is not an attempt would be potentially misleading. Under the expanded concept of attempt embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1(a)(3) and (b) \u201c... some preparation may amount to an attempt. It is a question of degree.\u201d <em>State v. Mandujano, </em>499 F.2d 370, 377 (5th Cir.1974), <em>cert. </em>den. 419 <em>U.S. </em>1114, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>792, 42 L.Ed.2d 812 (1975), quoting <em>United States v. Coplon, </em>185 <em>F.</em>2d 629, 633 (2nd Cir.1950). It is only \u201cvery remote preparatory acts\u201d which are excluded from the ambit of attempt liability. <em>New Jersey Penal Code Commentary, supra, </em>at 118. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not commit plain error in not instructing the jury that mere preparation for the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of a crime does not constitute an attempt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Defendant moved to suppress any evidence obtained through the interception of two sets of telephone calls made by La Bruno. The first set of calls were made on January 13 and 14, 1983 on phones belonging to an inmate organization called New Directions. Defendant argued that the warrantless interception of these calls violated the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-1 <em>et seq., </em>Title III of the Federal Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2510 <em>et seq., </em>and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The second set of calls, which were made on January 22, 23 and 24, 1983 from \u201cpublic\u201d phones in the prison located in cell block \u201c2 down,\u201d were intercepted pursuant to wiretap authorizations issued by the court on January 21, 1983. Defendant argued that although the telephone calls on the New Directions phones previously intercepted by the prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>officials were not expressly mentioned in the wiretap application, the application incorporated the information obtained through those interceptions and thus was tainted by the illegality of the warrantless telephone interceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">After a three day hearing, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. It concluded in an oral opinion that the monitoring of the calls made by La Bruno on the New Directions telephone was not an \u201cinterception\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(d)(l) and 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2510(5)(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also concluded that La Bruno had no constitutional right to notice of the monitoring of the New Directions phone installation. Consequently, the trial court upheld the validity of the monitoring of La Bruno\u2019s calls on January 13th and 14th. Moreover, the court concluded that even if the monitoring of those calls had been illegal, that would not require suppression of the telephone calls intercepted on January 22, 23 and 24 pursuant to wiretap authorizations. The court accepted as credible the testimony of the state trooper whose affidavit was submitted in support of the wiretap application that he did not include in that affidavit any information gained from the monitoring of La Bruno\u2019s calls on the New Directions phone. Thus, there was no \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d problem with respect to the affidavit submitted in support of the wiretap authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Title III of the Federal Omnibus Crime Control Act and Safe Streets Act, 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2510 <em>et seq., </em>which was enacted in 1968, <em>P.L. </em>90-351, <em>Title III, </em>\u00a7 802, 82 <em>Slat. </em>212, applies to any interception of a telephone call, regardless of whether parallel state legislation has been enacted. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>726 <em>F.2d </em>852, 860-861 (1st Cir.1984). The New Jersey Wiretap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ping and Electronic Surveillance Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-1 <em>et seq., </em>which was enacted in 1969, <em>L. </em>1968, <em>c. </em>409, was modeled after the federal legislation. <em>See In re Wire Communication, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>255, 262 (1978). The New Jersey act is more restrictive than the federal act in some respects. <em>See State v. Catania, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>418, 436-439 (1981). However, the sections of the federal and state acts relied upon by defendant are substantially similar in language. Therefore, we are satisfied that the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the sections of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act pertinent to this case was simply to follow the federal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-1, <em>et seq. </em>and 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2510, <em>et seq. </em>provide that generally telephone calls and other wire or oral communications may not be \u201cintercepted\u201d except pursuant to court order. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-8; 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2516. At the time of the monitoring of La Bruno\u2019s calls, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(c) and 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2510(4) defined \"intercept\u201d as \u201cthe aural acquisition of any wire or oral communication <em>through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156-2(d) defined the term \u201cintercepting device\u201d as \u201cany device or apparatus ... that can be used to intercept a wire or oral communication.\u201d The term \u201celectronic, mechanical or other device\u201d was defined by 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2510(5) in virtually the same language. However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(d)(1) and 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2510(5) provided an exception from their respective definitions of \u201cintercepting devices\u201d and \u201celectronic, mechanical or other device\u201d for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">any telephone ... equipment ... furnished to the subscriber or user by a communication carrier in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business; ... or being used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>... by an investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We agree with the conclusion reached by Judge Hoffman in his comprehensive oral opinion that the telephone equipment used by the correction officers at Rahway Prison to monitor La Bruno\u2019s calls on January 13 and 14, 1983 fits within this exception. The telephone on which La Bruno\u2019s calls were made was installed in 1978 for the use of New Directions, an inmate group at the prison. At the same time, with the consent of New Directions the telephone company installed equipment to enable prison officials to monitor calls on this telephone. Similar monitoring equipment was installed on the telephones of all other inmate groups. A primary reason for the installation of monitoring equipment of the telephones of inmate groups was the maintenance of prison security, and correction officers used this equipment on a regular basis. Thus, the monitoring equipment was furnished by the telephone company in the ordinary course of its business. <em>Cf. Jandak v. Village of Brookfield, </em>520 <em>F.Supp. </em>815, 822 (N.D.Ill.1981). Likewise, the correctional officers who used the monitoring equipment may be appropriately viewed as law enforcement officers acting \u201cin the ordinary course of their duties.\u201d <em>See Crooker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>497 <em>F.Supp. </em>500, 503 (D.Conn.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">We assign no significance to the fact that La Bruno\u2019s calls on the New Directions telephone were monitored because of information supplied by Satkin regarding the planned escape rather than on a random basis, or that the officers who did the monitoring were not regularly assigned to perform that duty. The exception from the definitions of \u201cintercepting devices\u201d and \u201celectronic, mechanical or other device\u201d provided by <em>N.J.S.A. 2</em>A:156A-2(d)(1) and 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2510(5) apply to telephone equipment used by law enforcement officers in the ordinary course of their duties, regardless of whether the monitoring on a particular occasion is random or is done by an officer who regularly performs that duty. In this case, the monitoring was performed in the normal manner, by activating the monitoring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>equipment in the administrative area of the prison, and the monitoring was done for the same reason as the monitoring of other calls by inmates, that is, to prevent the use of inmate telephones to plan actions which may breach prison security. In our opinion, it would be unreasonable to construe the federal and state acts as requiring court authorization before telephone equipment regularly used to monitor calls on inmate telephones can be activated based on specific information that a telephone will be used for a prohibited purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">This conclusion is supported by <em>United States v. Paul, </em>614 F.2d 115 (6th Cir.1980), which upheld the monitoring of prison calls pursuant to prison policy communicated to prisoners as being within the ordinary course of the correction officers\u2019 duties. The court in <em>Paul </em>distinguished <em>Campiti v. Walonis, </em>453 <em>F.Supp. </em>819 (D.Mass.1978), aff\u2019d 611 F.2d 387 (1st Cir.1979) on the grounds that \u201c[t]here, the monitoring was not shown to be related to prison security and was not done pursuant to a posted prison regulation.\u201d 614 <em>F.2d </em>at 117. In <em>United States v. Vasta, </em>649 <em>F.Supp. </em>974, 989 (S.D.N.Y.1986), the court expressed doubts whether \u201cCongress intended Title III to apply to prisons\u201d but concluded that in any event an \u201cinstitutionalized, ongoing policy\u201d of monitoring calls by correction officers would be \u201cin the course of their duties\u201d as \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officers.\u201d The instant case is similar to. <em>Paul </em>and <em>Vasta </em>and readily distinguishable from <em>Campiti. </em>The telephone equipment was installed to conduct regular monitoring in order to detect threats to prison security. Moreover, the only inmates authorized to use the phone were the members of New Directions, and they expressly authorized installation of the monitoring equipment. La Bruno, whose use of the phone was unauthorized, was not entitled to receive separate notice of the monitoring. Therefore, the monitoring of the calls made by La Bruno on the New Directions telephone was consistent with both the federal and state acts governing wiretapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Defendant\u2019s further contention that the warrantless interception of La Bruno\u2019s calls on the New Directions telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>violated the Fourth Amendment is clearly without merit. <em>See Lanza v. New York, </em>370 <em>U.S. </em>139, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>1218, 8 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>384 (1962); <em>United States v. Hearst, </em>563 F.2d 1331, 1344-1346 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. </em>den. 435 <em>U.S. </em>1000, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1656, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>90 (1978); <em>United States v.

However, a brief discussion is appropriate with respect to defendant\u2019s allegation that his attorney failed to advise him of a plea bargain offered by the State. The only support in the record for this allegation is the following exchange between the trial judge and defendant during sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">THE COURT: I also find the fact that there was a plea bargain is not particularly significant in this case. I think you are right in some cases, Mr. Ferencz, but I don\u2019t think the extended term provision of the Statute is unfairly applied in this ease. There are many reasons why a plea bargain is offered. This was a very long, complex, difficult case with three Defendants, and certainly Mr. Fornino had a right to go to trial, but I also think once you go to trial, not that you should be punished for then going to trial, but once you take your shot at it all bets are off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">THE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, that\u2019s news to me. I didn\u2019t know there was a plea bargain involved here. Nobody ever told me when, where, I never saw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">THE COURT: I think you better take that up with your lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Not only that, if I was guilty I would have ventured to ask about it, but being I wasn\u2019t guilty I took the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">THE COURT: So, you wouldn\u2019t have wanted the plea bargain anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s not the point, the point is that an innocent man doesn\u2019t take a plea bargain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>As far as the record discloses, defendant had not been sworn when he made the foregoing statements. Furthermore, he never made any application to the trial court for relief based upon the alleged failure of his counsel to advise him of the State\u2019s offer of a plea bargain. Hence, defense counsel was not called upon to provide his version of his communications with defendant regarding the offer of a plea bargain, and the trial court never made any pertinent findings of fact. Under these circumstances, defendant\u2019s .claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the alleged failure to advise him of an offer of a plea bargain is not properly before us. <em>See State v.

However, the step taken must be one which is strongly corroborative of the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose. The accused must be shown to have had a firmness of criminal purpose in light of the step(s) the accused has already taken; however, these steps must be substantial and <em>not mere preparation. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">In light of the Code's treatment of the law of attempt discussed in this opinion, we suggest that the Model Criminal Jury Charges Committee should consider modifying the above charge either by eliminating the statement that \"mere preparation\" does not constitute an attempt or by incorporating the language of the Penal Code Commentary that \"very remote preparatory acts\u201d do not constitute an attempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> The stenographic notes of the trial judge\u2019s original oral opinion delivered on April 9, 1984 were lost before being transcribed.
