Cary Edwards, </em>Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney for respondent <em>(Jeanne M.

According to the prosecutor, the plea recommendation was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">The terms of the plea agreement, the Defendant agrees to retract this not guilty plea and plead guilty to Count One of the Accusation for which he is to be sentenced as a crime of the third degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">After sentencing, the State will move to dismiss Count Two of the Accusation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">The State\u2019s recommendation is that a custodial sentence, if any imposed, is not to exceed five years. Presumption of imprisonment does apply in this case; however, the State has no objection to a sentence being served at Essex County Jail for a period of 364 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">As one of the conditions of probation in this case, after the service of a jail term, the Defendant agrees to receive psychiatric counseling and State reserves the right to be heard at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">During the plea colloquy, the following was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">THE COURT: Now, do you understand pleading guilty to this particular crime, you could be sent to jail for a period of time up to 10,000\u201410 years or $100,000 fine and other penalties could be imposed upon you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-16\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">THE COURT: And do you understand also there could be a parole ineligibility period; therefore, five years as I explained it to you before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-19\">THE COURT: You would not be eligible for parole. There is a recommendation through the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Essex County that this, which is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>second degree count\u2014second degree offense, should be treated by the Court as a third degree offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">THE COURT: Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">THE COURT: And all that has been explained to you by counsel what that means and punishment unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">THE COURT: Maximum would be five years, do you understand that, rather than the original ten?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-13\">THE COURT: It is also a statement by the Prosecutor, if I recall the language correctly, she would not object, however, if you were placed on probation and placed in the Essex County Jail for 364 days\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-14\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-15\">THE COURT: \u2014rather than a presumptive sentence that was explained to you of four years. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-16\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">Defendant was sentenced to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (ADTC) at Avenel for three years, and his motion for reduction of sentence was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">On this appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">DEFENDANT\u2019S GUILTY PLEA MUST BE SET ASIDE BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT\u2019S REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS WERE DEFEATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">There is an obvious difference between a commitment to ADTC and other sentences to a State custodial institution, even though the Code of Criminal Justice requires that a specific term sentence be imposed at the time a sex offender is committed to ADTC. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3b. While a sex offender may be eligible for parole upon the recommendation of the Special Classification Review Board, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-5, and may be subject to resentencing when the Commissioner, on recommendation of the Board, concludes that \u201ccontinued confinement is not necessary,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-4c, the reality is that the offender may serve longer in custody than someone who receives the same specific term of three years, particularly because it takes so long to place the offender at Avenel. <em>Cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>State v. Falcone, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>685 (App.Div.1986); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.51. <em>See also Gerald v. Commissioner, N.J. Dept. of Corrections, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438 (App.Div.1985), mod. 102 <em>N.J. </em>435 (1986); <em>Savad v. Department of Corrections, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>386 (App.Div.1981), certif. den. 87 <em>N.J. </em>389 (1981) (work and commutation credits for sex offenders).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Nevertheless, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that defendant must be advised at the time of plea of the parole and \u201creal time\u201d consequences of an ADTC commitment or of the contemplated period of parole ineligibility by virtue of the delay in admission to Avenel. <em>Cf. State v. Kovack, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>476 (1982) (requiring defendant to be advised of possibility of parole ineligibility term before it is imposed).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As noted in <em>Kovack, </em>\u201ca trial court need not explain to a defendant what the parole opportunities are in general,\u201d 91 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, and we cannot conclude that the delay in placing a defendant in the sex offender unit constitutes a <em>\u201closs </em>of parole opportunities that may be a component of the sentence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>[Emphasis in original]. <em>See also State v. Howard, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>587, 589-590 (App.Div.1986), certif. granted 107 <em>N.J. </em>86 (1986). So long as defendant was made aware of his maximum exposure under the negotiated plea and receives a sentence with no greater exposure, the plea remains unassailable. <em>Cf State v. Alevras, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 338-339 (App.Div.1986) (impact of misunderstanding of credits on sentence maximum).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We do not believe that the existing record of the plea and sentencing supports the conclusion that defendant reasonably expected to be sentenced to a custodial sentence of 364 days or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>less or that defendant should be permitted to withdraw his plea, <em>see, e.g., State v. Marzolf, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>167, 183 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Finally, we note that the negotiated disposition, as recorded on the plea form and expressed on the record, indicates that defendant was to be sentenced as a third degree offender. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2). Since sentence was imposed in this case, the Supreme Court made clear that the presumption of imprisonment continues on such negotiated downgrade for sentencing, <em>see State v. O\u2019Connor, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>399, 404-405 (1987); <em>see also State v. Partusch, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473 (App.Div.1987). The Supreme Court also held that the presumption is not satisfied by the custodial aspect of probation. <em>See State v. O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 405-410. In deciding whether a sex offender is to receive in-patient or out-patient treatment, the sentencing judge must consider the impact of the presumption. <em>See State v. Hamm, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>40 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\"> Of course, <em>Kovack </em>would require advising defendant of the possibility of a parole ineligibility term before it could be imposed as part of a sentence to ADTC. <em>See State v. Chapman, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>582, 592-593 (1984). <em>See abo </em>2C:43-2(e); 2C:44-lc(2) (court required to consider parole consequences).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> There is no claim in this case that defendant received improper or wrong advice about credits which would affect his maximum exposure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-12\"> We have no difficulty with the form of the negotiated disposition because its contents involved a mutual agreement of the parties. See <em>R. </em>3:9-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
