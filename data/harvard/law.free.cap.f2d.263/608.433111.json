United States v. Donovan, 2 Cir., 242 F.2d 61. Upon resentencing the judge suspended the sentence of one defendant who was not at the scene of the crime, but left intact the sentences of Donovan and Andrews. On appeal these judgments were affirmed in open court. United States v. Donovan, 2 Cir., 252 F.2d 788, certiorari denied Andrews v. United States, 357 U.S. 940, 78 S.Ct. 1389, 2 L.Ed.2d 1553. So far as any of the contentions now put forward may survive these earlier appeals, we find them without merit, as explained in Judge Palmieri\u2019s lucid opinion below. We affirm on that opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
