Plaintiffs aver that A. S.

The plan or artifice of the scheme was to cause Mansfield Hardwood Lumber Company to falsely notify the minority stockholders that dividend payments would be virtually discontinued for a period of the next 15 to 20 years, this to be the consequence of the company\u2019s entering upon a long range plan of extensive reforestation and improvement of its assets. The company was to negotiate for and purchase the stock at a price approximating its value as reflected by the books of the company, which value the conspirators knew to be grossly understated. The company was to falsely deny any intention of disposing of its assets and liquidating. Plaintiffs aver that the representations made to each of them in the purchase of-their stock were in furtherance of this fraudulent scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The intricate facts are'set out fully in the opinion below at 159 F.Supp. 104, 106-117, and it would be redundant for us to reiterate them here. However, for the purpose of this opinion, we must attempt a brief summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The sole defendant is- a corporation formed in 1901 by two men, the predecessors \u25a0 of the parties in interest here. The corporation engaged in the business of growing timber and sawmilling \u25a0 and by 1955 had acquired extensive holdings \u2014some 93,000 acres of- timberlands, two sawmills, several lumber companies, and a small railroad. Out of the 4,836 shares of stock outstanding in 1953 (par value of $100 per share)-, the defendant\u2019s three officers and their immediate, families owned some 2,751- shares'. These three officers \u2014 A. S. (Bud) Johnson, Brown McCullough,' and T. W. M. Long \u2014 and their families will be referred to as the majority stockholders. The remaining shares were spread out among the plaintiffs and others, the two largest holders being plaintiffs, Mrs. Hattie A. Johnson and Mrs. Jeanette Johnson Jennette. The corporation began purchasing the minority shares in the Spring of 1953 for $350 per share and made its last purchase from Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Jennette in the Fall of 1953 for $400 per share. The defendant purchased a total of 1,567 shares. There was some evidence that the fair market value of the stock, considering all elements, was about $320 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">As early as 1952, the officers of the corporation considered the possibility of liquidating the corporation but testified that this possibility was dismissed because of the large tax consequences. In the Spring of 1954, some negotiations for a liquidation sale were resumed in earnest; and, after receiving word that Sections 331(a)(1) and 337(a) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a) (1), 337(a) would become effective on August 16, 1954, which would abolish the double capital gains tax in liquidation, that is on both the corporation and the stockholders, the officers actively solicited a sale to several purchasers. In July 1955, Robert Gair Company, Inc. had agreed to purchase all the assets of defendant, excepting certain mineral rights, for $9,531,630.34., This agreement was approved by defendant\u2019s remaining stockholders on September 26, 1955, and the sale to Gair was consummated on May 25, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">As the district court found, had the plaintiffs and other minority sellers not sold their stock, it would have been worth about $2,068 per share on liquidation or over five times the amount received. The majority stockholders thus profited by some $3,458,007 from the treasury purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">There are two outstanding facets in this case: (1) the shortness of the time interval between the purchase of the minority shares as treasury stock and the subsequent liquidation of the corporation, and (2) the great difference between the amount paid per share for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>repurchased stock ($350 to $400) and its worth on liquidation ($2,068).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Thirty-four specifications of error are assigned by appellant. Some merit consideration and some are purely frivolous. In discussing only those which we think dispositive of the case, we again refer for a more complete statement of the facts to the opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Great emphasis is placed on the failure to join as indispensable parties the officers as wrongdoers, the liquidators, the stockholders after adoption of liquidation, the court trustee (a local bank) holding the remaining liquidated assets not yet disbursed, and the stockholders as owners of the assets held by the trustee. To join any of these would, of course, defeat diversity jurisdiction. On the prior appeal, from the granting of the temporary injunction, Chief Judge Hutcheson stated for this Court at 242 F.2d 45, 47:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">\u201c * * * and agreeing with the district judge that the case should not have been dismissed for want of indispensable parties,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">\u201c4. Hudson v. Newell, 5 Cir., 172 F.2d 848, at page 850, Id., 5 Cir., 174 F.2d 546; Mackintosh v. Marks, 5 Cir., 225 F.2d 211. Cf. Christian v. Texas Gas Co., D.C., 14 F.R.D. 80, 81.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Without deciding whether this prior adjudication of jurisdiction is the law of the case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we note that, under the circumstances of this case, if the plaintiffs have stated a claim against the defendant corporation upon which relief can be granted, the failure to join the corporate officers and others as party-defendants is not fatal, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\">\u201cThe power of a court of equity so to mold its decree as to do complete justice between the parties without adversely affecting those not before the court is exceedingly broad and elastic.\u201d Mackintosh v. Mark\u2019s Estate, 5 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 211, 215.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">This brings us to consider whether defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been granted for failure to state a claim, which also raises substantially the same question presented in its argument concerning the joinder of defendant\u2019s officers as indispensable parties. In defendant\u2019s brief, it summarizes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-18\">\u201cIn summary, it is submitted that the Court below erred in failing to dismiss this action because the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in three important respects: (1) the complaint affirmatively alleged that the sale of plaintiffs\u2019 stock was induced by the alleged fraud of defendant\u2019s officers who are alleged to have acted without authority and for their own benefit; (2) the complaint fails to state the value of the stock in its then condition, at the time of the sale; and (3) the alleged representations by the officers with reference to future dividends and future liquidation of the corporation were mere indefinite expressions of opinion, relating solely to future prospects of the Corporation, and could not, if made, constitute grounds for an action for rescission for fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-20\">We feel it unnecessary to dwell upon these contentions because, after carefully studying all of the evidence in this cause, we are of the opinion that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that fraud per se of defendant through its officers was established beyond a reasonable doubt<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the extent of \u201cgrasping greed\u201d and \u201cmoral bankruptcy.\u201d We so hold because of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>doubt that the \u201cintent\u201d element necessary as the basis for actual fraud was adequately established. In other words, we doubt that defendant\u2019s officers during the stock purchases from plaintiffs had the necessary <em>mens rea </em>for a predication of actionable fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"> However, the results were correct and are soundly predicated, we think, upon the liability for breach of the fiduciary duty owed by a corporation\u2019s officers to its individual stockholders. Practically all jurisdictions recognize a fiduciary relationship arising from the directors and officers to their corporation and to the stockholders as a whole, while a \u201cgrowing minority\u201d accord this duty to individual stockholders,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> especially concerning the purchase of stock from a shareholder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether this relationship between officers and directors and their stockholders is termed fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary or trust or confidence is immaterial, and, likewise, is it immaterial whether its breach is described as constructive fraud, unjust enrichment, fraudulent breach of trust, breach of fiduciary obligation, gross negligence, or otherwise, and whether the remedy is given by a constructive trust, restitution, or accounting. These are all relative terms describing broad equitable concepts. The standard of a fiduciary\u2019s duty to his beneficiary, depending upon the instant relation and the facts of the particular case, lies somewhere between simple negligence and willful misconduct or fraud with the intent to deceive. The actual intent to deceive is not required where one party is so placed in such an advantageous position to the other. Actual fraud will afford redress in the absence of the special relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\"> Louisiana has long recognized the fiduciary duty owed by corporate directors and officers to their individual stockholders. Her courts have applied it over and over, applying, it seems, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>same standard of care to stockholders as owed by officers and directors to the corporation under LSA-Revised Statutes 12:36:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">\u201cOfficers and directors shall be deemed to stand in a fiduciary relation to the corporation, and shall discharge the duties of their respective positions in good faith, and with that diligence, care, judgment, and skill which ordinarily prudent men would exercise under similar circumstances in like positions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5D\">For brevity, these decisions are discussed in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We feel that these decisions fully answer appellant\u2019s conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>tions that Louisiana\u2019s limited equity jurisprudence will prevent our imposition of a\u2019\u201cconstructive trust\u201d or \u201cequitable lien\u201d or \u201cright of restitution\u201d for the breach of the fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiffs by defendant\u2019s officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We agree with the district court that the fiduciary relationship in this case necessitated a disclpsure of the following facts admittedly not disclosed by defendant\u2019s officers to the plaintiffs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">\u201c1) The $5,000,000 offer, for 55% of defendant\u2019s timberlands, made by R. O. Martin to Bud Johnson in 1952;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">\u201c2) The instructions given to C. L. Brooke, in 1952, to assume that defendant\u2019s assets possessed a value in excess of $9,000,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-8\">\u201c3) The opinion of W. C. Postle, defendant\u2019s Chief Forester, in 1953, that its timberlands then had a market value \u2018in the neighborhood of a hundred dollars an acre\u2019, which the officers knew about;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-9\">\u201c4) The letters containing tax advice, written by Brooke on August 29 and October 14, 1952, wherein contemplated plans for sale of defendant\u2019s assets, liquidation, merger, stock sales, etc., were discussed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">\u201c5) The officers\u2019 secret consideration of various plans of liquidation, reorganization, merger, etc., before the stock-buying program was begun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Johnson v. Mansfield Hardwood Lumber Co., D.C.W.D.La.1958, 159 F.Supp. 104, 118, note 9. Furthermore, the special relationship between defendant\u2019s officers and the plaintiffs demanded that restitution be made to plaintiffs for the difference of price in their sold shares and their value upon the almost immediate liquidation \u2014 especially where the defendant\u2019s officers made promises concerning curtailment of future dividends and disclosed plans for no liquidation in the near future and used economic coercion to secure the sale of the minority shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">As the district court found, defendant\u2019s officers were the corporation. Other than their official\u2019 nature, they were directors and also had in their control over one-half of the voting stock. They knew the intricate workings of the corporation, its total assets, and they knew more than the other stockholders about the value of the stock both for sale and upon liquidation. They used promises and representations as to their intended future running of the corporation which exerted economic influence on the plaintiffs, forcing them to sell, and then immediately began plans to liquidate in contradiction of their representations. Certainly, their fiduciary duty was violated to the plaintiffs-stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">The district court answered appellant\u2019s contention that the officers rather than it or in conjunction with it were the proper parties defendant, as raised in its motion to dismiss, by quoting part of the following from Kohler v. Jacobs, 5 Cir., 1943, 138 F.2d 440, 442-443, which, in our opinion, is good law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-15\">\u201c \" - As' to the Corporation, it is true that it owes the stockholder no duty of disclosure when he trades with others in its stock, and since he has access to the corporate books diligence might well lead him to them when he desires information from the Corporation. But if a corporation (which ordinarily does not deal in its own stock) for its own lawful purposes sets out to buy shares through its- managing officers, and they by intentional misrepresentation and concealment deceive a selling stockholder who is ignorant of the truth, though he be an inactive director who ought to know, so that he is damaged, we see no reason why the corporation is not bound for the consequences. The deceit practiced by the corporation\u2019s high officers in the corporation\u2019s business and for its benefit must be taken to be a corporate act, and not ultra vires. 19 C.J.S., Corporations, \u00a7 1278(a) (b);' 13' Am.Jur., Corporations, \u00a7 1125. If on trial it should appear that the transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>was a deceit committed by Jacobs for the benefit of the Corporation, both the Corporation and himself as an individual might be liable; because the action is not one to rescind a fraudulent transaction, or to recover an unjust enrichment, but for the damages done by a wilful tort for which a perpetrator may be held liable though he realized no benefit from it. United States v. City of Brookhaven, 5 Cir., 134 F.2d 442. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Actually, however, the acts of defendant\u2019s officers in inducing the plaintiffs to sell were in all respects within their authority and not ultra vires \u2014 both Louisiana,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where the acts occurred, and Delaware,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> where defendant is incorporated, allow a corporation to purchase its owp stock after meeting certain requirements (apparently satisfied here), and such acts were well within the implied, if not the express, authority of the officers\u2019 agency. Further, as covered by the trial court, there is no doubt about ratification by the corporation, if necessary at all, for breach of confidence. In fact, here, the corporation was the proper party defendant for satisfying all claims of all plaintiffs in one lawsuit. A stockholder derivative action certainly is not proper for, here, the wrong is to the individual plaintiffs and not to the corporation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And the general rule that \u201ca corporation is not relieved from liability for the fraudulent acts of its officer within the apparent scope of his authority, by the fact that the officer in committing the fraud is acting for his own benefit, and the corporation does not profit from it,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> applies as strongly where a fiduciary breach is substituted for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Appellant earnestly predicates separate defenses to the claims of four plaintiffs, Max Brown, Mrs. Hattie A. Johnson, Mrs. Jeanette Johnson Jennette, and Ben Drew Velvin, Executor, who collectively assert more than eighty-four per cent in value of the claims. As to these first three plaintiffs, discussed by the lower court at 159 F.Supp. at pages 127-131, we must summarily hold that the facts conclusively warrant an affirmance on the basis of the breach of fiduciary relationship existing to them from the corporate officers and especially on the \u201cbusiness duress\u201d practiced on Brqwn. Their special defenses are of no avail. To further elucidate would be repetitious. Ben Drew Velvin, as executor and sole heir of his mother, a party plaintiff having died during this litigation, may pursue the claim which she had asserted. We do not feel that his opinion testimony that there was no fraud would prevent him from pursuing his claim as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">We do hold that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its findings as to the Shreveport Lumber Sales, in commenting on the excessiveness of the officers\u2019 salaries and expense accounts, and in holding \u201cthat the officers probably bought a large amount of timber from outside sources, instead of cutting from defendant\u2019s timberlands, thus maintaining their value for purposes of later liquidation,\u201d all found at 159 F.Supp. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>page 111. In fairness to defendant\u2019s officers, we record our opinion that such findings are clearly erroneous, notwithstanding that our so holding does not change the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AkqP\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">. \u201cArt. 2464.

To go further back, it would seem that the dividing line is whether directors are to be deemed trustees for individual stockholders so far as their stock in the corporation is concerned.\u201d Fletcher, Cyclopedia Corporations, perm.ed., \u00a7 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">\u201cThe older or so-called majority rule laid down by one class of decisions is that \u2018while directors occupy a trust relation to the corporation which they direef, tbeir duty does not apply to the stockholder in the sale and purchase of stock. Dealing in its own stock is not a corporate function. In buying or selling stock, directors may trade like an outsider, provided they do not affirmatively act or speak wrongfully, or intentionally conceal facts with reference to it. There is also the qualification that no other relation of trust exists between the parties.\u2019 The numerical majority of the decided decisions have adopted the rule that courts do not impose upon officers and directors of a corporation any fiduciary duty to its stockholders which precludes them, merely because they are officers and directors, from buying and selling the corporation\u2019s stock.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1168.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">\u201cUnder the minority rule directors are considered trustees for individual stockholders with respect to their stock, and this rule goes to the extreme of holding that they cannot purchase stock from a stockholder without giving him the benefit of any official knowledge they possess which may increase the value of the stock.

The breach of that duty would be a breach of trust; and therefore damages arising therefrom would be governed, not by the prescription of one year, but by that of 10 years. The shareholders elected the members of the board to administer the affairs of the bank, and the shareholders had a beneficiary interest in the bank. From this interest and from the acceptance of the trust by the directors there arose the special duty, due by the latter to the former, to faithfully administer that interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">In Pool v. Pool, 1943, La.App., 16 So.2d 132, 135, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-17\">\u201cDirectors are not liable for mere errors of judgment on their part where they act in good faith. They are only required to exercise reasonable care and diligence and act in good faith. But they are liable for wilful neglect of duty, gross negligence or their fraudulent breach of trust. 19 C.J.S.

The prescription of ten years and not that of one year would apply. Dawkins v. Mitchell, 149 La. 1038, 90 So. 396.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-21\">In Williams v. Fredericks, 1937, 187 La. 987, 175 So. 642, 644-645, the court reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-22\">\u201cThe directors of a corporation occupy a fiduciary relation to the stockholders generally, not only to the stockholders who elect them, but to all of the stockholders; and this fiduciary relation to the stockholders forbids a director to bind himself to use his official authority or prerogative for the personal benefit of any one. The leading case on the subject is West v. Camden, 135 U.S. 507, 10 S.Ct. 838, 34 L.Ed. 254, where the doctrine is stated thus: * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-23\">In Carey v. Dalgarn Const. Co., 1930, 171 La. 246, 130 So. 344, 347, this principle was further expanded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-24\">\u201cThis court has said on numerous occasions, and particularly in McCloskey v. New Orleans Brewing Co., 128 La. 197, 54 So. 738, that courts will not interfere with the acts of a corporation in the absence of a clear showing of fraud or breach of trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-25\">\u201cIn Marcuse v.
