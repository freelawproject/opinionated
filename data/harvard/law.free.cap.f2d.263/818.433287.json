The proof shows also that many jobbers and members of the purchasing public prefer to buy oil refined from crude oil, virgin oil, as opposed to oil such as the petitioners\u2019 which has been re-refined from oil previously used, and that the public buys motor oil largely on the basis of price, believing that higher priced oils will give better service in a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The Commission entered an order requiring the petitioners forthwith to cease and desist \u201cfrom representing * * * that their lubricating oil is refined or processed from other than previously used oil\u201d and from advertising, offering for sale or selling oil which has been \u201creclaimed or in any manner processed from previously used oil, without disclosing such prior use to the purchaser or potential purchaser in advertising, in sales promotion material, and by a clear and conspicuous statement to that effect on the container.\u201d The petition to review followed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">The petitioners attack the opinion and the final order of the Commission as arbitrary and capricious and contend that each lacks substantial supporting evidence. They assert also that the Commission erred as a matter of law in holding that the failure to disclose the source or origin of the petitioners\u2019 finished product was a violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The petitioners contend as well that the Commission committed prejudicial error in excluding from the record the testimony of certain witnesses and exhibits offered by them and in refusing to permit them to examine certain Commission records and correspondence on which, it is alleged, the Commission wrongfully relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">It will be observed that there was a variance between the charge set out in the complaint and the proof in that the Commission charged the petitioners with selling \u201creclaimed\u201d oil, as distinguished from \u201cre-refined\u201d oil. Even were the proceedings before the Commission conducted as strictly as a suit at law this variance would be deemed too insubstantial to be material. The evidence offered by the Commission\u2019s witnesses demonstrated that the petitioners produce their lubricating oil by re-refining and that the factor of reclamation was a minor one. The evidence shows also that without notification to the trade and to the customer that the petitioners\u2019 oil was not manufactured from crude oil, virgin oil, many persons in the trade and individual customers thought that the petitioners\u2019 product was manufactured from crude oil. The record proves further that such persons preferred to distribute and sell and to buy lubricating oil manufactured from crude oil or virgin oil, and not oil re-refined from crankcase oil, and thought that they were doing so. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence upon which the Commission could find that dealers and the purchasing public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>were misled by a mistaken belief that petitioners\u2019 products were derived from crude oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">It is true, as the petitioners point out and as the Commission found, that the petitioners\u2019 oil is as satisfactory for lubricating purposes as lubricating oil produced from crude oil or virgin oil, but this is beside the point. As was said by the Supreme Court through Mr. Justice Cardozo in Federal Trade Commission v. Algoma Lumber Co., 1934, 291 U.S. 67, 77-78, 54 S.Ct. 315, 319, 78 L.Ed. 655: \u201cWe have yet to make it plain that the substitution would be unfair though equivalence were shown. * * * The consumer is prejudiced if upon giving an order for one thing, he is supplied with something else. * * * In such matters, the public is entitled to get what it chooses, though the choice may be dictated by caprice or by fashion or perhaps by ignorance. * * * Dealers and manufacturers are prejudiced when orders that would have come to them if the lumber had been rightfully named, are diverted to others whose methods are less scrupulous.\u201d Moreover, it does not serve to palliate the petitioners\u2019 offense by the fact that their sin was one of omission in failing to label the containers or make known to the purchasers that their oil was not produced from crude oil. Chief Judge Parker put this succinctly in P. Lorillard Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 4 Cir., 1950, 186 F.2d 52, 58, when he said: \u201cTo tell less than the whole truth is a well known method of deception; and he who deceives by resorting to such method cannot excuse the deception by relying upon the truthfulness per se of the partial truth by which it has been accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The petitioners assert as a defense that there was no showing here of a specific and substantial public interest because their products are identical with all other finished motor oils as to composition, quality and utility and hence no harm can come to the purchasers or to the public generally. But as has been indicated the public is entitled to buy what it chooses. A manufacturer may not surreptitiously substitute his judgment for that of the purchaser as to the article to be purchased, even if the manufacturer\u2019s judgment is equal or even superior to that of the dealer or the customer. If this were not so, the substituted judgment of the manufacturer would always prevail over the will of the dealer or customer and the provision of the statute prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices would be emasculated. The public has the right to purchase motor oil manufactured from crude oil, if it desires to do so, and that desire may not be balked by a failure to disclose pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">For the reasons stated the Commission did not err in striking from the record evidence of two expert witnesses of the petitioners who testified that it was not the industry practice to disclose to the trade or to the purchasing public the sources of motor oils and that these are bought and sold on the basis of grades established by the Society of Automotive Engineers and service classifications made by the American Petroleum Institute. These facts are immaterial to the issue raised by the Commission or on the instant appeal. The fact that some dealers and some customers were not misled by the petitioners\u2019 practices, even if such persons were in large numbers, is irrelevant. As we have said the record amply demonstrates a desire on the part of the dealers and purchasing public not to dispense or buy motor oils re-refined from crankcase drainings. Cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted Hosiery Co., 1922, 258 U.S. 483, 42 S.Ct. 384, 66 L.Ed. 729, and Independent Directory Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1951, 188 F.2d 468, 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">The petitioners also contend that the Commission committed error by withholding from them and from the record in the instant case correspondence between the Commission\u2019s staff and witnesses who appeared on behalf of the Commission. They assert that by such correspondence witnesses testifying' on behalf of the Commission on the factual issue as to whether or not the public had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>a preference for motor oils refined from crude oil, virgin oil, as distinguished from motor oils re-refined from crankcase drainings, might have been and were unduly influenced. The petitioners assert also that, being deprived of this correspondence they were limited in their cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The hearings before the Hearing Examiner began on September 20 and were concluded on December 11, 1956, being held on six different days. The fourth day of hearing was November 20. It then appeared, apparently for the first time, that witnesses appearing on behalf of the Commission had received the letters referred to. On that day petitioners\u2019 counsel moved orally that the Hearing Examiner require the Commissioner to produce all the correspondence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Hearing Examiner stated that though he felt that the correspondence should be produced that he could not require the Commission to produce it. It was not until April 26, 1957 that the petitioners filed a motion with the Hearing Examiner that the correspondence should be produced and incorporated in the record. The matter was referred to the Commission. The Commission, by an administrative order dated May 10, 1957, denied the motion, stating that the information sought was confidential and the correspondence could be released only pursuant to the provisions of the Commission\u2019s Rules, Section 1.134(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">We cannot say that \u201cgood cause\u201d was shown as to why the correspondence should have been produced. Petitioners\u2019 assertion that there was actual influence exerted by the Commission through the correspondence is not supported by the record. Petitioners\u2019 reference to testimony of witnesses who had received questionnaires establishes no more than that the witnesses were made aware through the questionnaires of re-refined, reprocessed, or reclaimed oil as distinguished from crude, virgin, oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Moreover, the formal motion for production and incorporation in the record was not made to the Hearing Examiner until more than four months after the termination of the hearings and nearly one month after the petitioners had submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the Trial Examiner. The validity of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice is not questioned by petitioners and in view of the delay it was not error for the Commission, relying upon Section 1.134(b), to deny the motion. Cf. N. L. R. B. v. General Armature &amp; Mfg. Co., 3 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 316; N. L. R. B. v. Adhesive Products Corp., 2 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 403, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">We can perceive no error in the Commission\u2019s decision. Consequently, it will be affirmed. An appropriate judgment will be entered in this court requiring the petitioners to comply with the order of the Commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-13\">. Both witnesses and counsel, the Hearing Examiner and the Commission, on occasion have used the term \u201cnew oil\u201d to refer to lubricating motor oil refined from virgin oil, crude oil and have employed the term \u201cused oil\u201d to refer to lubricating motor oil re-refined from used crankcase oil.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-5\">.

It is in the form of a questionnaire and dealt in substance with the issue of whether or not the motor oil was invoiced to Topline as re-refined oil and whether it was represented by Topline to its customers as re-refined oil and similar questions, with Topline\u2019s answers thereto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\">. 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.134 (Supp.1958) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a0p-dedup-0\">\u201c\u00a7 1.134 <em>Release of confidential information. </em>(a) Upon good cause shown, the Commission may by order direct that certain records, files, papers, or information be disclosed to a particular applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-12\">\u201c(b) Application by a member of the public for such disclosure shall be in writing, under oath, setting forth the interest of the applicant in the subject matter; a description of the specific information, files, documents, or other material inspection of which is requested; whether copies are desired; and the purpose for which the information or material, or copies, will be used if the application is granted.
