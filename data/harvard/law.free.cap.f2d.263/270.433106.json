After passing safely through the building from front to back, on his return trip he slipped and fell while descending a ramp which led from the higher rear to the lower front of the first floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-26\">Greco sought to recover damages from Federal Engineering Company on the theory that the ramp was so constructed that it did not comply with Article 602-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>06 of the Building Code of the District of Columbia, which provides that \u201cRamps shall have a slope not greater than 1 foot in 10 feet.\u201d Holding the quoted section of the Building Code inapplicable to a ramp designed, as this one was, for movement of heavy materials instead of for use by pedestrians in lieu of an adjacent stairway, the District Court directed a verdict for Federal, and Greco appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
