Opposer-appel-lant relied on use since March of 1951 of its unregistered mark \u201cInvisible Beauty Strap,\u201d for a vanishing liquid cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-27\">The record indicates no question as to priority of use, the opposer appearing to be the prior user herein. Therefore, the sole issue before us is whether concurrent use of the marks on the goods in question is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-28\">The Examiner found no confusing similarity between the two marks since, when \u201ctaken in their entireties, * * * the differences between \u2018Invisible Veil\u2019 and \u2018Invisible Beauty Strap\u2019 in sound, appearance and meaning are such that they may be contemporaneously used on the specified goods without reasonable likelihood of confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d The commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>sioner affirmed the examiner\u2019s decision, further taking judicial notice of the fact that cosmetic manufacturers feature their house marks on their products, and concluding that there was no likelihood of confusion of source since \u201cpurchasers are most likely to buy by house brand and to use the secondary mark to differentiate between the various products of a single producer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Although the advertisements of the two litigants feature their respective house marks in conjunction with the marks in issue, there is no evidence in the record to support the contention that purchasers of cosmetics identify the products by the house marks of the manufacturers, and there is no basis upon which this court can take judicial notice of this proposition. Moreover, we agree with appellant\u2019s statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASj\">\u201c * * * applicant is seeking to register the notation Invisible Veil and not Ardena Invisible Veil. The issue therefore is not between the notations Ardena Invisible Veil and Frances Denney Invisible Beauty Strap, but rather between Invisible Veil and Invisible Beauty Strap.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In determining the applicant\u2019s right to registration, only the mark as set forth in the application may be considered; whether or not the mark is used with an associated house mark is not controlling. Bellbrook Dairies, Inc. v. Hawthorn-Mellody Farms Dairy, Inc., 253 F.2d 431, 45 C.C.P.A. 842; Hat Corp. of America v. John B. Stetson Co., 223 F.2d 485, 42 C.C.P.A. 1001. Therefore the likelihood of confusion must be determined by a comparison of the marks themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The word \u201cInvisible,\u201d when employed in relation to either the powder of the applicant or the vanishing cream of the opposer is suggestive of the desired reaction when the substances are applied to the skin, and the word would be descriptive of that reaction if it actually occurs. In neither situation is its use arbitrary. Insofar as \u201cVeil\u201d and \u201cBeauty Strap\u201d are concerned there is no similarity of sound, appearance or meaning. The use of \u201cInvisible\u201d in conjunction with each of these terms does-not make the phrases confusingly similar. Furthermore, even though both products come within the category of' cosmetics, they are applied to the skin, for entirely different purposes. The-cumulative differences between the-marks and the respective products herein lead to the conclusion that there is no-likelihood of confusion of prospective-purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Appellant has cited a number of cases in support of its contention that the-marks in issue are confusingly similar. Unfortunately, the determination of the likelihood of confusion depends upon the facts in each case, and prior decisions are usually of little assistance in such determination because different marks, and products are involved. In this instance, in considering both marks in their entireties, we are of the opinion that they are not confusingly similar either in sound, appearance or meaning. We therefore affirm the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
