The opposition is based on the conceded prior use and registration of \u201cLux\u201d as a trademark for soap flakes, toilet soap and liquid detergents.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-19\">The mark of applicant-appellee is a double-bordered oval across which in block letters is the word mark \u201cThrift-D-Lux\u201d under which in script appears the word \u201cCleaners.\u201d At the top of the oval in the border in smaller block letters than said word mark is the slogan \u201cThrifty In Price\u201d and in the bottom of the border in matching type is the slogan \u201cDe Luxe In Quality,\u201d said slogans being in quotation marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-20\">The record shows the following pertinent facts. \u201cLux\u201d was adopted by appellant\u2019s predecessor in the year 1900 and continuously since that date has been used as a trademark for soaps. Appellant has spent over $150,000,000 in advertising the products sold under the trademark \u201cLux\u201d and to date more than two billion packages of \u201cLux\u201d flakes and more than three billion cakes of \u201cLux\u201d toilet soap, and more than forty-five million cans of \u201cLux\u201d liquid detergent have been sold. Appellant markets its product through retail and wholesale grocery and drug channels, and serves markets in many foreign countries. In addition \u201cLux\u201d flakes are sold in bulk to laundries. As a part of this latter program appellant operates a so-called \u201cLux Laundry Plan\u201d which is designed to stimulate the sale of \u201cLux\u201d flakes in bulk. In accordance with this program laundries, under agreement with appellant, call themselves a \u201cLux Laundry\u201d in their promotional advertising. To date approximately six hundred laundries located throughout the United States have entered into such agreements with appellant. Of the six hundred \u201cLux Laun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>dries\u201d approximately four hundred seventy take in dry cleaning as well as laundering.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Appellee, Thrift-D-Lux Cleaners, Inc., is in the business of dry cleaning and pressing garments. \u201cThrift-D-Lux,\u201d a principal feature of the mark in question, is, according to appellee, a coined expression suggesting \u201cthrifty in price, de luxe in quality.\u201d The issue is whether the mark of appellee so nearly resembles \u201cLux\u201d as to be likely, when used in connection with appellee\u2019s services, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers under the circumstances above set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Appellant contends that \u201cLux\u201d and \u201cThrift-D-Lux\u201d are confusingly similar because the verbal impact of \u201cThrift-D\u201d is \u201cthrifty,\u201d meaning economical, leaving \u201cLux\u201d as the dominant portion of the mark, conveying to the purchasers the meaning \u201cThrifty Lux.\u201d In our opinion, though \u201cLux\u201d in itself may be quite arbitrary and unique, the import of \u201cThrift-D-Lux\u201d is not \u201cThrifty Lux,\u201d but rather thrift coupled with <em>de luxe, </em>meaning economy combined with special elegance. The well-known term \u201cde luxe,\u201d as the record indicates, is obviously suggestive and is in common use in a great variety of trademarks and trade names. To hold for appellant in this case would be tantamount to restricting the use of a term well established in the public domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Appellant cites the case of American Throwing Company, Inc. v. Famous Bathrobe Co., Inc., 250 F.2d 377, 45 C.C.P.A. 737, in which an opposition to the registration of \u201cKnit-Kins\u201d for infants and children\u2019s underwear was sustained, based on the registration of \u201cWiper-Kins\u201d for children\u2019s bibs. This case is distinguishable upon the fact, inter alia, that the suffix in both marks was the same, where as here we regard them as different because the meaning of the end of appellee\u2019s mark is de luxe (D-Lux) and appellant\u2019s mark is generally understood to be the Latin word meaning light (Lux).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Appellant also cites Lever Brothers Company v. Sitroux Company, Inc., 109 F.2d 445, 27 C.C.P.A. 858, wherein the applicant sought to register \u201cSit-Ru-Lux\u201d for toilet tissue and was opposed by appellant herein, basing the opposition on the trademark \u201cLux.\u201d Upon careful consideration, we feel that this case is not controlling here for the reason that a descriptive word such as <em>de luxe </em>is not involved. Also, toilet tissue and toilet soap are goods belonging to the same class, i.e., both are ordinary household articles for personal use sold in small packages through the same channels of distribution. In the instant case one of the marks is not for goods at all but for services. Though under particular circumstances a service mark may be confusingly similar to a mark for goods, we feel the relationship here is tenuous. Appellant contends, however, that confusion is likely because appellee\u2019s business is not confined to dry cleaning and pressing services, but also includes the laundering of garments and other material. Thus it is likely, appellant contends, there would be an association in the public mind between \u201cLux Laundries\u201d and appellee\u2019s \u201cThrift-D-Lux\u201d stores. In view of the common use of the term \u201cde luxe\u201d in describing services or goods offered to the public, and in the absence of evidence to support appellant\u2019s contention of confusion between \u201cLux Laundries\u201d and \u201cThrift-D-Lux\u201d stores, we feel that appellant has failed to show that it will be damaged by registration of appellee\u2019s mark for the services enumerated in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
