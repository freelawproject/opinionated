The defendant waived a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">Both counts were under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174. The date of the alleged event was March 24, 1957, and the place of it on Ilona Street near Beverly Glen Boulevard. (A nearby thoroughfare better known than Ilona is Pico Boulevard.) The first count charged that Stein did \u201creceive, conceal and transport, and facilitate the concealment and transportation\u201d of about one ounce and 253 grains of heroin. The second count charged that he did \u201csell and facilitate the sale\u201d of the same heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-25\">One of the defendant\u2019s main points on appeal is that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the charge (the first count) of receiving, concealing and transporting or facilitating the accomplishment thereof. We disagree, but do not discuss the point in detail because it is now established in federal jurisprudence beyond cavil that if the conviction is good on either count, when identical concurrent sentences are imposed, then the appellate court is not to concern it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>self with the alleged weaknesses on one count, if the other count is good. And, here there is unquestionably adequate evidence to sustain the second count: the sale count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Chin Bick Wah v. United States, 9 Cir., 245 F.2d 274, cer-tiorari denied 355 U.S. 870, 78 S.Ct. 120, 2 L.Ed.2d 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Defendant-appellant also assigns as error the admission in evidence of an oral statement allegedly made to narcotics officer Feldman. The statement was: \u201cYou see I help an S.O.B. and I get in trouble.\u201d The claim is that the statement was not free and voluntary. It is claimed that the statement was made under a virtual promise of immunity. The incident involving the remark was a conference between agent Feld-man and Stein which was arranged to be held in the office of Stein\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stein met Feldman at the designated office and then the two went elsewhere. We note several infirmities in the merits of this specification of error. First, the remark in context doesn\u2019t mean very much. It is not plausible that the able trial judge gave it much weight or that it tipped the scales in the slightest. It was just a case of whether the trial judge believed the prosecution version of what happened on March 24 or whether he believed the defense story of innocence. Second, no objection to the receipt of the testimony was made until it was in the record and had been well \u201cbatted around.\u201d Third, we do not find from an examination of the record that it was necessarily made under any promise of immunity. And it certainly was made under no compulsion. Fourth, if we should consider the point, it would be in a curious posture. Stein says the remark did not actually mean anything harmful to him in fact. And the record is positive that the defendant has never admitted, but has always denied, he had anything to do with heroin or any narcotic on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> Stein for his third point here pleads entrapment. Here again we pass over the anomaly of the position of \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, but if I did, I was entrapped.\u201d During the course of receipt of the evidence no claim of entrapment was made. However, it was made at the conclusion of the case. The evidence does not compel a conclusion of entrapment. And, by the judgment of the trial court, this claim of entrapment becomes an issue found against defendant. The law is well settled that if all the government agents or their agents do is to take advantage of the defendant\u2019s predisposition and willingness it does not amount to entrapment. Bloch v. United States, 9 Cir., 226 F.2d 185, certiorari denied 350 U.S. 948, 76 S.Ct. 323, 100 L.Ed. 826, and Sherman v. United States, 9 Cir., 241 F.2d 329, certiorari denied 354 U.S. 911, 77 S.Ct. 1299, 1 L.Ed.2d 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\"> The last specification involves-the refusal of the trial court to grant a postponement of the trial because of Stein\u2019s claimed ill health. This is a mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ter in the sound discretion of the trial court and the record here would not permit this court to say the discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\">. The government offered no evidence showing that Stein ever had the heroin in his own hands. It offered evidence of Browning, another previously convicted narcotics peddler, that on the third of three visits he made to Stein on March 24, Stein, (who, Browning said, had already been paid on the second visit to Stein) to a place on Ilona Street, where the heroin lay in a package wrapped in foil in or near the gutter, and pointed it out to him. Stein did not physically deliver the package. (This \u201cdelivery\u201d without touching was confirmed by agent Feldman.) This \u201chead in sand\u201d form of \u201cdrop\u201d or sale seems to be a common recent method of handling narcotics transactions. It reminds this court of the sequence often found in the Mann Act cases when the defendants have attempted to insulate themselves by having the transported women walk (or ride in a separate car) across the border. See Bennett v. United States, 9 Cir., 234 F.2d 675.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-12\">. Stein was not arrested for some months after March 24, 1957, and the grand jury indictment was not returned until January 22, 1958. Apparently the occasion of the conference of Stein and Feldman, was after Stein had been arrested and admitted to bail, but before indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
