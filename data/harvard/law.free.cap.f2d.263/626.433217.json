Federal Power Commission, 5 Cir., 263 F.2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The only substantial difference between the eases is that the petitioners here did not make a motion before the Commission before the final order, as was done in Forest Oil Corporation, for further opportunity to produce the financial type of evidence which was indicated by the Commission\u2019s order in Bel Oil v. F. P. C., No. 300, would be required. On oral argument before this Court, counsel for petitioner requested that this opportunity be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">As we said in Gulf Oil Corporation v. Federal Power Commission, 5 Cir., 255 F.2d 556, 557:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">\u201cWe think justice requires that the matter be referred back to the Commission for the taking of additional testimony, especially in light of the Pan American opinion [Opinion 310].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">The petition is granted to the extent that the Commission is directed to reopen these proceedings to afford petitioner reasonable opportunity to adduce such evidence as they may be advised is relevant to the inquiry whether the proposed rate is just and reasonable. In all other respects the petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
