See: Booker v. State of Tennessee Board of Education, 6 Cir., 240 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>F.2d 689] certiorari denied 1957, 353 U.S. 965, 77 S.Ct. 1050, 1 L.Ed.2d 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The record does not show, as asserted by petitioners, that the respondent Judge has refused to hear petitioners\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. In fact, it shows the contrary. Before the petition here was filed, the respondent Judge had set defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for hearing on February 20th next; and the return and answer made by the respondent Judge to the order to show cause issued pursuant to our Rule 29, 28 U.S. C.A. [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(b)] declares that: \u201cRespondent expects to hear and act on said motion at that time. As soon thereafter as possible, respondent intends to hear and act on the motion for the temporary injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">It appears from what was said at the hearing before us on February 10th that what petitioners desire by writ of mandamus from this Court is to compel a hearing and determination of their motion for a preliminary injunction in advance of the hearing and determination of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on February 20th.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The record discloses that one of the grounds advanced in the District Court in support of the motion to dismiss is that: \u201cThe statutes of Tennessee provide for the review of the action of the State Board of Education by writ of certiorari in a proceeding which is administrative or legislative in character, and the plaintiffs should be required to exhaust this [State] remedy before invoking the injunctive powers of * * [the Federal] Court\u201d [See: Sections 27-901 to 27-906 T.C.A.; Odle v. McCormack, 1947, 185 Tenn. 439, 206 S.W.2d 416; Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 1908, 211 U.S. 210, 229-230, 29 S.Ct. 67, 53 L.Ed. 150; Bacon v. Rutland R. Co., 1914, 232 U.S. 134, 137, 34 S.Ct. 283, 58 L.Ed. 538; Hawks v. Hamill, 1933, 288 U.S. 52, 60-61, 53 S.Ct. 240, 77 L.Ed. 610; Natural Gas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 1937, 302 U.S. 300, 310-311, 58 S.Ct. 199, 82 L.Ed. 276; Lane v. Wilson, 1939, 307 U.S. 268, 274, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 L.Ed. 1281; Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 1941, 312 U.S. 496, 500-501, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971.]</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Of course the motion to dismiss is not before us and we intend no intimation as to the merits of the motion. The material just cited on the subject is merely to indicate the scope of the problem presented to the respondent Judge upon that motion and the possible basis for his discretionary decision to hear it in advance of the motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">There can be no doubt that mandamus will lie to compel a District Court having jurisdiction to proceed in the due exercise thereof. La Buy v. Homes Leather Co., 1957, 352 U.S. 249, 77 S.Ct. 309, 1 L.Ed.2d 290; Ex Parte Parker, 1887, 120 U.S. 737, 743, 7 S.Ct. 767, 30 L.Ed. 818. But, as we observed in Black v. Boyd, 6 Cir., 1957, 248 F.2d 156, the power to issue the writ is discretionary and is \u201csparingly exercised.\u201d [248 F.2d at page 159.]</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has admonished that use of the writ of mandamus against a judge is a \u201cdrastic and extraordinary\u201d remedy [Ex Parte Fahey, 1947, 332 U.S. 258, 259, 67 S.Ct. 1558, 1559, 91 L.Ed. 2041] which is \u201cmeant to be used only in the exceptional case where there is clear abuse of discretion * * * \u201d Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, 1953, 346 U.S. 379, 383, 74 S.Ct. 145, 148, 98 L.Ed. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">Here the respondent Judge is proceeding in the exercise of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction, and we cannot say there has been any abuse of discretion in his determination to hear the motion to dismiss on February 20th, in advance of the application for a preliminary injunction. Indeed the questions raised by the motion to dismiss point to the desirability of hearing and determining the motions in the order stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">The order to show cause is discharged and the petition is dismissed with costs in this Court to respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
