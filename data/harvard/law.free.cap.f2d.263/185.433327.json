He alleges that after the case went to the jury, with the consent of the court he and his counsel left the courthouse; thereafter the jury twice returned and received instructions while relator and his attorney allegedly were not present. On a petition for <em>coram nobis </em>in the New York state courts, relator was granted a hearing before Justice Joyce of the Kings County Court, who disbelieved the testimony of relator and his witnesses that he was not present when the incident occurred. N.Y.L.J., Jan. 25, 1957, affirmed People v. Blank, 4 A.D.2d 755, 165 N.Y.S.2d 700, certiorari denied Blank v. New York, 355 U.S. 963, 78 S.Ct. 551, 2 L. Ed.2d 537. As no impropriety is alleged as to this hearing, relator has no right to a renewed opportunity to test these same facts. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 463-464, 506, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
