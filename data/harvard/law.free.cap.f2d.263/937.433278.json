He also testified that he did not know whether Mrs. Baston\u2019s car was stopped or moving when it was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-16\">The defense was a denial that Mrs. Bast\u00f3n was guilty of any negligence and a claim that the collision resulted solely by and through the negligence of plaintiff, and that if there was negligence on her part, the collision was due to his contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-17\">Tried to the jury, the evidence for plaintiff consisted of plaintiff\u2019s testimony in substance as above stated, while that of the defendant, Mrs. Bast\u00f3n, who was taking several children to school that morning and one of the children who was waiting to get into her car, was that she was not on the highway but was stopped in the driveway waiting for the truck to pass, and that the truck went off of the blacktop and onto the shoulder and struck her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-18\">The court deferring decision on the motion until after the verdict, the case went to the jury, and there was a verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-19\">Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment in accordance with its motion for a directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>verdict and, in the alternative, for a new trial denied, a judgment for plaintiff was entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">Appealing therefrom, defendant is here insisting that, as matter of law, upon plaintiff\u2019s own testimony and under the controlling cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (a) no actionable negligence on the part of defendant was shown, and (b) if there was, plaintiff was guilty of such negligence as barred his recovery, and a verdict should have been directed for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\"> Agreeing that this is so, we accept for the purpose of the demonstration that the jury found that the matter occurred just as plaintiff said that it did, though the speaking facts of the collision seem strongly to support the testimony of Mrs. Bast\u00f3n, that her car was stopped in the driveway, and that the truck came off the blacktop and onto the shoulder and struck it.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">In plaintiff\u2019s statement, set out in substance hereinabove, it appears that, though he had 1000 feet of clear road with nothing in front of him or behind him, which interfered with his driving or prevented him from seeing what lay ahead, he, for a reason not stated, instead of paying attention to the road and where he was going, looked off to the side and, when he turned his attention to the road, he suddenly noticed that fifteen or twenty feet in front of him the car was coming out \u201cin slow motion down to the highway\u201d, and, undertaking to dodge it, he collided with it. Assuming as correct that his testimony that, at the time he dodged, Mrs. Baston\u2019s bumper and headlight had, coming out in slow motion, reached the highway and that this was negligence on her part, this would not avail him. For, under settled law in Louisiana and elsewhere, a motorist is held to have seen an object which, by the use of ordinary care and prudence, he should have seen in time to avoid running into it and under ordinary circumstances, such as prevailed here, the plaintiff, in driving at such a rate of speed that he could not stop and avoid a collision within the range of his vision, was guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">In Smith v. Fidelity Mutual Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 206 F.2d 549, 550, a case very much in point here, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-10\">\u201cThere have been a great many cases in which this and other courts have considered and discussed facts similar to those which are here present, and in all of them it has been held that it is negligence as a matter of law for motorists to drive an automobile along the highway at such a speed that it cannot be stopped in time to avoid an obstruction discernible within the range of vision ahead.

Home Indemnity Co., 5 Cir., 244 F.2d 568 and other similar cases the same principle has been reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-7\">.
