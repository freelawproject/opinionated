Code, may he also be charged in another subsequent count of the indictment with having violated the same statute during the same period by having sold a chance in the same lottery.\u201d The Government, on the other hand, contends that operating a lottery and the sale of numbers are separate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-25\">However, concurrent sentences were imposed in these cases; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, under well settled rules, even if there were merit in this claim of error (which we by no means hold), appellant cannot complain, as any such error would be cured by the concurrent sentences.
