UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b881-9\">No. 17363.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b881-10\">United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b881-11\">Feb. 18, 1959.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b881-17\">John C. Tyler, Atlanta, Ga., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b881-18\">John W. Stokes, Jr., Asst. U. S. Atty., James W. Dorsey, U. S. Atty., Atlanta, Ga., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b881-19\">Before HUTCHESON, Chief Judge, and BROWN and WISDOM, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b881-20\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b881-21\">Appellant was convicted of the possession of 132 gallons of non-tax-paid whiskey in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5008.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-22\">At 5:15 a. m., March 5, 1958, Furman White, a Government informant, followed appellant through the streets of Atlanta, Georgia, to the alley where the liquor was stored. He had spoken to appellant on prior occasions, and had arranged to purchase five cases this morning. There, with five others (three convicted, one acquitted, one unknown), appellant directed White to back his car towards the supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-23\">Unknown to appellant, however, White\u2019s trunk was already full \u2014 with Inspector Corbin of the Federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division and Police Officer Gibby of the Atlanta Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-24\">In Police Officer Gibby\u2019s words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-25\">\u201cHe [White] backed the car in\u2014 I didn\u2019t have the trunk all the way closed \u2014 and somebody reached, got hold of the handle of the trunk and said, \u2018All right, boys, put five eases in the trunk of this one,\u2019 and as he did he opened up the trunk and I grabbed him, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-27\">That \u201csomebody,\u201d it turned out, was the appellant Jasper Bryant.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-28\">The present dispute turns on the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. White testified appellant was going to sell him some of the whiskey and that appellant actually handled some of the cartons. But, as appellant\u2019s brief replies, \u201cit is the contention of this appellant that that testimony is negatived by the other evidence in this case.\u201d Appellant, of course, testified that he in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>tended personally to buy some whiskey, never touched it, and only took White along to let him get some, too. The jury thought otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">We are clear there is adequate evidence in the record to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden of showing \u201cpossession,\u201d and to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
