He has exhausted the state legal remedies. From an order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia discharging a writ of habeas corpus, after a hearing, the case has been brought here on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-18\">It is manifest that the basic factual issue in this case has not been sufficiently ' explored. The claim is that the appellant has been \u2022 denied due process of law in that, although he was insane at the time of the commission of the offense and endeavored to have the defense raised, neither the attorneys employed for him by his father, nor his court-appointed attorneys have heretofore properly raised the issue or presented the facts in any of the lengthy legal proceedings. In the circumstances of this case the claimed denial of due process through the attorneys\u2019 action or inaction is intertwined with the state of the appellant\u2019s mental condition. Before undertaking to pass on the legal issue raised, we think that the actual facts as to the mental condition of the appellant should be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">The hearing in the District Court did provide the appellant\u2019s present lawyer with the opportunity he was seeking, to offer pertinent evidence of the client\u2019s mental condition; but the opportunity went unrecognized. To the end that full \u00a1justice may be done in this case of utmost gravity, we are of the opinion that the case should be remanded. Without passing on the District Court\u2019s action in dismissing the writ of habeas corpus on the record before it, the case will be remanded with directions to arrange for a mental examination, preferably with the cooperation of the Commonwealth of Virginia in a state hospital, to determine the appellant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offense' charged, if possible, and now. With the report of such exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ination before it, the District Court may take such action upon the writ as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
