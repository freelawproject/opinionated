Twelve acres of the Appellants\u2019 land were taken in fee; 46.74 acres were encumbered by safety easements; and 6.96 acres were encumbered toy access road easement. No part of Appellants\u2019 land that was taken was to be used for the actual ammunition storage. The land of the defendants was taken for a buffer and safety zone in much of which only a safety easement was taken. The actual ammunition storage was to be had on land lying northerly of the Appellants\u2019 land. The reading of the record indicates that this was marginal farm land, much of it swampy.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Appellants claim the highest and best use of the condemned land of the defendants was for real estate development. Appellants also claim severance damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Trial Court found the highest and best use of the condemned land of the Appellants to be for limited agricultural purposes. There is ample evidence to support this finding by the Trial Judge. To say the least, he was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Since the doctrine of severance damage does not include damage to one owner which may result or flow from the use to which the Government may put other lands in the same project, Boyd v. The United States of America, 8 Cir., 222 F.2d 493, 494, the Trial Court was clearly right in denying Appellants severance damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
