Appellant was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, had a jury trial and was found guilty as charged. Appellant moved for a new trial. The District Court denied that motion and, on July 30, 1957, entered a judgment sentencing appellant to be imprisoned for nine years. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-28\">Nine alleged errors are specified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specification 1 is that the District-Court erred in denying a motion for a mistrial said to have been made by appellant after the prosecutrix \u201canswered to the effect that she had taken a lie-de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>tector test.\u201d Actually, the prosecutrix did not so answer. She testified that she was born on May 14, 1942, that appellant was her father, and that she had sexual intercourse with him on a Saturday night in the 1956 moose hunting season.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After so testifying, she was asked the following question: \u201cWhen did you first tell anybody all the details about this?\u201d To this question she made the following answer: \u201cThe lie detective man.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereupon appellant\u2019s counsel<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> made two motions \u2014 a motion to strike the answer <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a motion for a mistrial. The motion to strike was granted, and the jury was instructed not to consider the answer. The motion for a mistrial was denied. That motion was based on two assumptions \u2014 (1) that the answer was to the effect that the prosecutrix had taken a \u201clie-detector test,\u201d and (2) that the answer made it impossible for appellant to have a fair trial, even if the answer was stricken (as it was) and even if the jury was instructed (as it was) not to consider the answer. These assumptions were unwarranted. Hence the motion for a mistrial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Specification 2 reads as follows: \u201cThe [District] Court erred in allowing the case to go to the jury on the ground that in a trial involving a sex offense, the complaining witness should bo examined by a doctor and a psychiatrist.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The question thus attempted to be raised was not raised in the District Court. There was no motion for a judgment of acquittal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor any basis for such a motion. Submission of the case to the jury was amply warranted by the evidence. Examination of the prosecutrix by a doctor or psychiatrist was not a prerequisite to such submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">Specifications 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 relate to the District Court\u2019s charge to the jury. In specifications 3, 4 and 5, portions of the charge are specified as error. In specifications 6 and 7, omissions from the charge are specified as error. Appellant did not, before the jury retired to consider its verdict, object to any portion of the charge or to any omission therefrom. In short, he failed to comply with Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. Hence we are not required to consider these specifications.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are not here confronted with an extraordinary situation such as would justify a disregard of Rule 30.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore decline to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">Specification 8 is that \u201cThe [District] Court erred in denying the motion for a new trial on the grounds mentioned therein.\u201d That motion was addressed to the District Court\u2019s discretion, the exercise of which, in the absence of abuse, is not reviewable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record shows no abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">Specification 9 is, in substance, that the District Court erred in not de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>daring a mistrial or ordering a new trial on two grounds \u2014 (1) that \u201cNo judge should ever allow a sex-offense charge to go to the jury unless the female complainant\u2019s social history and mental makeup have been examined and testified to by a qualified physician;\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (2) that appellant\u2019s counsel apparently lacked familiarity with, or neglected or failed to avail appellant of, the rules of evidence pertaining to the cross-examination of the prosecutrix. Appellant never moved for a mistrial or a new trial on either of these grounds. Hence this specification presents nothing for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-15\">.
