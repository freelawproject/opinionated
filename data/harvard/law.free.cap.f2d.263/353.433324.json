A two count indictment charging him with violations 0f statute was filed on January 9, 1957. 0n May 16, 1957; tlie district COUrt, sitting without a jury, found appellant guilty of the second count and acquitted him on the first count. Judgment was rendered on June 3, 1957, sentencing appellant to three years in prison. Jurisdiction of the district court was based on 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3231. This Court has jurisdiction on appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"ATs\">Section 1001 of 18 U.S.C. provides in material part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3V\">\u201cWhoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>or covers up * * * a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations * * * shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJcr\">The indictment\u2019s second count, of which appellant was found guilty, charged Pitts with knowingly making false and fraudulent statements and representations on a Personnel Security Questionnaire obtained for the Atomic Energy Commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the AEC) by appellant\u2019s employer, Litton Industries, a corporation (hereinafter sometimes called Litton or the company).</p>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">On December 20, 1954, appellant was hired by Litton Industries in Los An-geles County, California, as a junior physicist under the name of Jack Lang, Although he was a radiobiologist, \u201cLang\u201d apparently was given the job classification of junior physicist since Litton had no such jeb classification. During the time that he was employed by Litton, under a Dr. Clark who was his department head, his duties concerned work on and with a machine called the \u201cIso-X\u201d, which was a portable X-ray machine being developed by Litton for possible military and medical usage. All the work which appellant did was of a non-classified nature.</p>\n<p id=\"AvS\">Litton had a policy and practice of having all new employees complete an ong-inal Personnel Security Questionnaire at the time of employment or hiring, w ic was then kept in the employee s file un i such time as it was needed. When needed, the original would be taken ou , ve or six copies would be typed, and the employee would then verify each one before a witness. The portion which the company was to complete (concerning \u201cneed to know\u201d or justification for the requested clearance) was filled in, and the company then forwarded the document to the proper governmental agency. In appellant\u2019s case, the five or six copies were made up when he was hired and put in his file for later use.</p>\n<p id=\"ado-dedup-0\">Since Litton wag constantly negotiating for various government contracts, it had a uniform policy of clearing all its technical personnel as soon as possible after they joined the company. This was so with junior physicists. The company apparently felt that they were aided in their negotiations with the government fey having a \u201cpool\u201d of cleared personnel, Mr. Gray who was the administrative head of Department 24 in which Pitts worked in 1955, discovered that Pitts (known to him as Lang) did not have a security clearance, and directed that steps be taken to have him cleared. _ He determined that within the meaning of the various security regulations governing ^ke classified projects on which Litton was working, that Pitts (using the name of Lang) was one of their \u201ckey personnel,\u201d and should be cleared. At the time that tMs occurred and during that same year, Litton was engaged in various projects for the Department of Defense which were classified. ^ Also during that year, Gray engaged in various negotiations with certain government agencies includin\u00ae the Atomic Energy Commission, on subject matters which were of a classified nature. In August of 1955, Litton appHed for an access permit which would have allowed Pitts\u2019 superior, Dr. Clark, to work jn the AEC facilities in order that the company might obtain advance information concerning atomic energy matters which would have application in the fields in which Litton was interested jn the event such classified information should be declassified and released to private industry for its use.</p>\n<p id=\"AmA\">In October 1955, a Personnel Security Questionnaire bearing the heading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>AEC was filled out and certified to by appellant and submitted to the AEC. The AEC screened the application. A representative of the AEC appeared at the Litton Industries and was shown by appellant what his duties were with regard to radioactive isotopes.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Mc\">On this Personnel Security Questionnaire, appellant stated that he had never been arrested, charged or convicted of any criminal offense except certain minor traffic violations. As a matter of truth he had been convicted on three prior occasions in the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At least two of these convictions appear to be felonies,</p>\n<p id=\"Ak1C\">Likewise, on the application, appellant stated as a brief description of his duties, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abd-dedup-0\">\u201cPhysicist-Nuclear Electronics Department. Engaged in research, development and design of electronic items in the nuclear field.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArS\">In response to the question: \u201cWill person have access to restricted data?\u201d, the box opposite \u201cYes\u201d was checked \u201cx\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>Jt </em>At no time was a clearance .of any type /issued by the AEC for the appellant. .,</p>\n<p id=\"aka-dedup-0\">, Appellant presents five questions .an this appeal. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"AEa\">(1) Did the trial court properly acquit the appellant of count one of the indictment? (This was conceded by the government, and need not here be consid-er\u00e9d.) . .</p>\n<p id=\"A5N\">(2) Was the statement of appellant, albeit false, a'matter \u201cwithin the jurisdiction\u201d of the AEC within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001?</p>\n<p id=\"amv-dedup-0\">(3) Does the voluntary 'act of completing a government form by an individual or the fact that it is a \u201cgovernment form\u201d constitute a \u201cmatter\u201d within-the jurisdiction of the AEC within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 ? \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AGZ\"><em>n </em>, (4) Can an employee go behind a- representation made by his employer, to a government agency, on a government form, to establish,'in fact, whether, employer\u2019s representation had substance or was a \u201csham\u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"AR2\">(5) Did the trial court correctly interpret the law applicable to the violation alleged against appellant in count two of the indictment?</p>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">, . , . , , , , We think the issue can be reduced to one major contention: Can the admittedly false statements of appellant be considered a violation of \u00a7 1001 <em>as matters within the jurisdiction of a government agency </em>when the position of appellant, and his work, never required that he deal with classified material, and in order for him to have been in classified work the following events would have had to happen: (1) the company would have had to find some area- in which t.o negotiate with the AEC concerning obtaining information looking toward a contract; (2) such negotiations would have had to materialize into a contract; (3) a contract would have had to be awarded; and (4) the contract would have had to have been such as to furnish classified information to the company and by it, to appellant. Appellant contends, since all this would have had to happen before any classified matter came into his hands, his application for clearance was not a matter within the jurisdiction of the AEC, especially since the company falsely or mistakenly indicated that he would be working on .the AEC projects and might need to know about some of this classified material, In other words, appellant\u2019s counsel urges a <em>subjective </em>test must be applied here to determine if the matter of his application security clearance was one within the jurisdiction of the AEC. If the employee would not conceivably in the near future have gained access to AEC classified mat-_tlien he could not be within the jurisdiction of the AEC, under appellant\u2019s vjew</p>\n<p id=\"AgcX\">Appellant\u2019s counsel states his theory in this manner: \u201cOur theory is that the appellant was not within the prohibition of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 in December of 1954, or at a.ny other tim\u00e9, because he wa\u00ae no^ an individual performing acts which Congress sought to control through the Department of Defense\u201d as to. count one, or through the Atomic Energy Commission as to count two.</p>\n<p id=\"AM_L\">Upon oral argument, appellant further crystalized his position by stating that if the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 2011 et seq., and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, permit an employer to clear a <em>pool </em>of technical personnel and give them all security clearances, irrespective pf whether their skills will ever be used in classified work, then and only then, could appellant\u2019s conviction be justified. It was appellant\u2019s position that such \u201cpool clearance\u201d did not bring members of that pool into contact with an agency of the United States, and thus within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States, until the pool member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>was actually assigned to work on classi-fled information.</p>\n<p id=\"aav-dedup-0\">We cannot agree. It is undisputed that a false statement was made. It seems equally obvious that the statement was made knowingly and wilfully.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was not made inadvertently.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor can there be any serious question as to the <em>materiahty </em>of a failure to pel\u00f3se a previous arrest for a felony. United States v. De Lorenzo, 2 Cir., 1945, 151 F.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"A-g\">, . ,, Was the statement made m a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency or department of the United States?</p>\n<p id=\"Afp\">The form on which the wilfully false statement was made was an Atomic Energy Commission Personnel Security Questionnaire form (commonly called an AEC-PSQ). It was marked as such at the top of its first page. Clearance was sought to enable the applicant to secure classified information concerning atomic energy. There would be no purpose in ^ application were it not a preliminary <em>^ </em>^ divul of classified information ... \u201e , concerning atomic energy, for nonclassi-fied information on that subject would \u00a1re nQ clearancc.</p>\n<p id=\"AIL\">The AEC has been created as a governmental agency authorized to act on behalf of the government of the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Litton Industries, on July 13,1955, had applied for \u201cAccess to Information on Nuclear Reactor Technology\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and had agreed, on August 10, 1955, \u201cto obtain agreements from all individuals who will have access under the Access Permit,\u201d to obey and conform to all applicable regulations and requirements of the Commission. In this application it had been represented that \u201cAll employees\u201d of Litton Industries were cleared to a minimum degree of \u201cConfidential.\u201d Access Permit No. 361 granted Litton Industries access to \u201cConfidential\u201d restricted data, <em>provided </em>the individual employee receiving the data obtained appropriate personnel security clearance. It was in the perform-anee of this obligation, on the part of Litton Industries to see that personnel security clearance was obtained, that the AEC-PSQ was submitted to and answered by Pitts</p>\n<p id=\"ALTq\">Pitts\u2019 work at Litton may well have been directed solely at the medical or health aspects of nuclear physics. But that fact does not determine whether the data with which he worked was, or was not, an integral part of \u201ca matter within the jurisdiction of an * * * agency of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alo\">Appellant urges that his duties did not require access to restricted data. How could he know this without knowing what the restricted data was ? As the government brief points out, the appellant had no knowledge of the contents of the Access Permit, the nature of the contemplated contracts, the work necessary under negotiations then under way. But he did know, when he signed, that he was asking clearance of a governmental agency which would permit him to work on classified projects.</p>\n<p id=\"APM\">We have heretofore stated that \u00a7 1001 cannot apply only to those persons who are required by some statute or regulation to make an application for clearance, Cohen v. United States, 9 Cir., 1953, 201 F.2d 386. There we held that the giving of false statements voluntarily to agents of the Treasury Department, regarding declarant\u2019s financial affairs, was a violation of \u00a7 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayd4\">It is clear that the congressional intent in using the broad language found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (formerly 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 80) was to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversions which might result from the deceptive practices proscribed. Its provision should not, and cannot, be construed narrowly to apply only to matters in which the government has some financial or proprietary interest. United States v. Gilliland, 1941, 312 U.S. 86, 61 S.Ct. 518, 85 L.Ed. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"ALk\">.. Terry v. United States, 8 Cir., 1942, 45, holds that the determination of whether the matter was within the jurisdiction of a government agency is a question for the courts to decide, on the basis of the legislative history of the agency and the terms of the statute creating the agency\u2019s powers. In the instant case the district court held that the regulation of the clearances was a matter within the jurisdiction of the AEC. We agree with that holding,</p>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-0\">This same Problem was considered by the district court in the Eastern District of New York in United States v. Giarraputo) 1956, 140 F.Supp. 831, 832. Although the facts are not identical, they closely resemble those found herein. The defendant there was indicted for a violation of the same statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001; he answered the same question with a \u00abno\u00bb when the truth was he had a crjminal record. The questionnaire was addressed to the Department of Defense who had contracted with Fairchild Engine &amp; Airplane Corporation, employer 0\u00a3 Giarraputo. The latter did not deny the criminal record, but contended there was no direct relationship between him and the government or any governmental agency; that he submitted the questionnaire only to his employer and that consequently his signing was not a matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The district court judge disagreed with this contention and found Giarraputo guilty, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXD\">. , ... ,, Fairc lid a con ra^ s W1 \u00ae Government for the development and manufacture of \u2018classified military or naval arms. Executive Order 10104, issued February 1, 1950, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 795 note, pursuant to sections 795 and 797 of Title 18 U.S. Code, defined military and naval installations which required protection against the dissemination of information relative thereto. Section 1(f) of that Executive Order included \u2018any commercial establishment engaged in the development or manufacture of classified military or naval arms, * * * aircraft, or vessels for the United States Army, Navy, or Air Force\u2019. Clearly Fairchild was included in that category and, as such, was bound by the Industrial Security Regulations promulgated by the Department of Defense. (Government\u2019s Exhibit 4). It was pursuant to those regulations that the defendant was required to have security clearance if he were to be permitted to work on secret matters. The Government, in engaging contractors to manufacture guided missiles and other secret weapons for it, makes every possible effort to prevent access to them by employees who fail to meet its rigid requirements as to character and integrity. To do less would make a mockery of security clearance. There is no doubt as to the materiality of the falsification here charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aig\">.. ,, \u201cThe questionnaire itself was headed \u2018Department of Defense, Personnel Security Questionnaire\u2019. It contained a reference to Title 18 Section 1001, and a resume thereof, warning the employee of the consequences of a false statement therein. I believe that the defendant knew that the questionnaire was to be submitted to a governmental agency for investigation, and that the statement that he had never been arrested was false. I believed Special Agent Murphy\u2019s testimony to the effect that the defendant admitted that he had falsified his answers because he had been refused employment on previous occasions when he had disclosed his criminal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amg-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARU\">\u201cIn the instant case the regulations required Fairchild\u2019s employees to have security clearance in order to be permitted to work on secret material, and the Naval Inspector of Ordnance, Ford Instrument Company, Long Island City, New York, was given security jurisdiction over Fair-child. (See Government\u2019s Exhibit 3.) That agency of the Government, through Naval Intelligence, had jurisdiction over security clearance for Fairchild\u2019s employees. Fairchild could not grant such clearance. It could be granted only by an agency \u00b0f the Government. As hereinabove stated, the questionnaire was headed \u2018Department of Defense Personnel Security Questionnaire\u2019 and the def endant must have known that it was to be submitted to the Government for action. While it is true, as defendant contends, that the Navy Department could not have <em>required </em>the defendant to answer the questions, it could have refused to per-him t\u00b0 work on secret material if had failed to do so. His criminal liability arose when he voluntarily submitted the questionnaire, containing the false answers, f\u00b0 his employer, for submission to the appropriate governmental agency, in order to obtain clearance for work on and access to secret material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxO_\">\"It is not necessary, m order to support the charge herein, that the defendant present the questionnaire directly to the agency involved.

There is considerable conflict between the government brief and appellant\u2019s brief as to whether appellant could ever have actually participated in any AEC program since he was not really a physicist but a radiobiologist. The government contends that it was \u201ccontemplated that he [appellant] would assume some of the duties of the senior physicist by engaging in reactor technology work\u201d under the terms of the application of the Access Permit made to the AEC, and that it was contemplated that he \u201cmay be promoted to senior physicist.\u201d On the other hand, appellant contends that he was never qualified to be a senior physicist, could not by training have done work on the AEC reactor program and never intended to do so. In fact, his superior Dr. Clark testified that he could \u201cby no means\u201d ever be classified as a senior physicist on the AEC program since he did not have the training. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>!that lie could not have materially contributed to any AEO program since he lacked the training for it.
