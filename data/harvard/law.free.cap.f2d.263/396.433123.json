The Commission found that petitioners had used and disseminated advertising materials which represented that their \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d perfume regularly sold for \u201c$18.50 the ounce at better shops,\u201d when in truth that never was the usual and customary retail price. The Commission also found that although petitioners imported from France only the perfume concentrate to be mixed here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>with domestic alcohol, they used the French tricolor and French words and phrases on their package labels, together with the English words \u201cPerfume Essence \u2014 Compounded in France.\u201d These findings are supported by substantial evidence and therefore are binding upon us, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(c); Federal Trade Commission v. Sewell, 1957, 353 U.S. 969, 77 S.Ct. 1055, 1 L.Ed.2d 1133; Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Education Society, 1937, 302 U.S. 112, 58 S.Ct. 113, 82 L.Ed. 141; Federal Trade Commission v. Algoma Co., 1934, 291 U.S. 67, 54 S.Ct. 315, 78 L.Ed. 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">False price representations such as those found to have been made by petitioners are unfair practices that the Commission is empowered to prevent. Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Education Society, supra; Thomas v. Federal Trade Commission, 10 Cir., 1940, 116 F.2d 347. And we have held on more than one occasion that one cannot, within the scope of the Federal Trade Commission Act, sell as an imported perfume a foreign concentrate combined in this country with domestic alcohol. Houbigant, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1944, 139 F.2d 1019, certiorari denied 1944, 323 U.S. 763, 65 S.Ct. 116, 89 L.Ed. 611; Etablissements Rigaud, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1942, 125 F.2d 590; Parfums Corday, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1941,120 F.2d 808; Fioret Sales Co., Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1938, 100 F.2d 358. The Commission\u2019s determination that petitioners represented their product as an imported perfume is a reasonable one. \u201cPerfume Essence \u2014Compounded in France\u201d might well disclose to those familiar with the manufacturing of perfume that only the \u201cessence\u201d of the packaged article offered for sale was represented as being wholly compounded in France; but such specialized knowledge of the difference between essences and perfumes cannot be imputed to the average purchaser, C. Howard Hunt Pen Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 3 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 273, and the Act \u201cwas not \u2018made for the protection of experts, but for the public \u2014 that vast multitude which includes the ignorant, the unthinking and the credulous,\u2019 Florence Mfg. Co. v. J. C. Dowd &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 178 F. 73, 75,\u201d Charles of the Ritz Distributors Corporation v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1944, 143 F.2d 676, 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The petition to set aside the order of the Commission is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
