The Government\u2019s testimony on the issue of insanity was offered by a number of lay witnesses and a qualified psychiatrist. On the part of appellant, there was opposing testimony, both lay and psychiatric. The issue was clearly one for the jury, whose verdict was decisive following instructions which we find were proper, fair and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">We have examined the other points raised on the appeal and find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-25\">.
