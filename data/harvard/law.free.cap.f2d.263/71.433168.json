Mrs. Nelms was killed. Later that same day, Robert Lee Goldsby and several other Negroes in an automobile with him were apprehended and lodged in jail. There was evidence to the effect that a .32 caliber bullet was removed from the body of Mrs. Nelms; that a pistol was obtained by the sheriff from appellant\u2019s possession when he was arrested; that the two were sent to the F.B.I. Laboratory in Washington, D. C.; and that there a ballistics examination identified the bullet as having been fired from appellant\u2019s pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-23\">On his preliminary trial, the appellant was represented by Messrs. Tighe and Tighe, a law firm of Jackson, Mississippi. On November 8, 1954, a Grand Jury of the Second Judicial Circuit of Carroll County, Mississippi, indicted the appellant for the murder of Mrs. Nelms. By that time, an aunt who lived in Gary, Indiana, had employed George N. Leigh-ton, Esquire, a Negro attorney of Chicago, Illinois, to defend the appellant. Mr. Leighton appeared with him on his arraignment, the same day that the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>dictment was returned. A plea of not. guilty was entered. The attorney requested and the court granted time for the preparation of motions necessary to raise certain constitutional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u25a0 November 10th, allowing a lapse of two days, was set as the date of trial. Before that time the attorney had ready for filing a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that Negroes had been systematically excluded from the grand jury, a motion for change of venue, and a petition for removal of the case to the federal court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before they could be filed, however, appellant\u2019s brother and -a different aunt had employed John W. Prewitt, Esquire, a white attorney of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Mr. Prewitt told these relatives of appellant that he could not work with the Negro attorney, Mr. Leighton. They informed Leighton of their employment of Prewitt and requested Leighton\u2019s withdrawal. Leighton promptly advised the District Attorney and thereafter the court that he was withdrawing from the case. The-motions which he had prepared were never filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The court then appointed Luther Ring-gold, Esquire, a white attorney of Wino-na, Mississippi, to defend the appellant.. Mr. Ringgold informed the court that relatives had employed Mr. Prewitt, and both Ringgold and Prewitt defended the appellant skillfully and ably, with the possible exception that they failed to raise the points that Negroes were,systematically excluded from the grand jury and from the petit j\u00fcry. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death.' On appeal to the Supreme Court of Mississippi, his conviction was affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">Attorneys Ringgold and Prewitt took no further action and have not since appeared in the case. Attorney Leighton re-entered the case and applied for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, actually urging for the first time the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury and from the petit jury. Certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Mississippi then fixed the date of appellant\u2019s execution for February 24, 1956.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">Three days theretofore, on February 21, 1956, Mr. Leighton filed for the appellant in the Supreme Court of Mississippi <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a petition for writ of error coram nobis, or, in the alternative, habeas corpus, asserting for the first time in the State courts the systematic exclusion of \u00d1egroes from the jury lists. The Supreme Court of Mississippi held that the denial of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court was res judicata of the question,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the application came too late since no objection to the validity of the juries had been made at the time of trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">Attorney Leighton again petitioned for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Clerk of the Supreme Court requested the Attorney General of Mississippi to file a response, stating, \u201cThe response should discuss particularly the issues of systematic exclusion of negroes from the grand and-petit jury panel and the state procedure for raising this question in a post convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tion proceeding.\u201d Such a response was of course filed. The Supreme Court denied certiorari.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Mississippi again set a date for execution, this time for February 12, 1957.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On January 29, 1957, Attorney Leigh-ton filed for the appellant a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, Greenville Division. Honorable Allen Cox, United States District Judge, after hearing argument but without waiting for an answer, denied the petition on the same day that it was filed and also denied a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On February 8, 1957, a motion for stay of execution was denied by Honorable Wayne G. Borah, a Judge of this Court. On February 11, 1957, the Honorable Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States, granted a stay of execution \u201cuntil petitioner has had an opportunity to exhaust his federal rights in this proceeding.\u201d This Court thereafter heard the appeal from the decision of Judge Cox and reversed and remanded the cause for a hearing of the evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Upon remand the case was heard at a special session of the court before Honorable Claude F. Clayton, United States District Judge. At the conclusion of the evidence and after hearing argument, Judge Clayton denied the petition, expressing his views in an oral opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">\u201cMr. Court Reporter, take this:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201cThe issues of fact, as I understand them in this proceeding, are very much as I stated at the beginning of this hearing. For the benefit of counsel in any further proceeding that may arise, I will state my findings of fact and conclusions of law separately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">\u201cFirst: The proof shows, as I indicated to counsel for petitioner before he made his argument, that the grand jury which returned the indictment against this petitioner had no Negroes on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">\u201cSecond: The proof shows that the petit jury which tried the petitioner had no Negroes on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">\u201cThird: The proof fails to meet the burden, as I understand it, of showing a \u2018systematic and willful\u2019 exclusion of any member of the Negro race from jury service in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-14\">\u201cFourth: As a matter of fact, it is rather difficult for the Court to distinguish between fact and law in the twilight zone that arises between the two, but as a matter of fact the Court finds that the petitioner has, and had, at the time of his indictment and trial a high school education, and finds as a fact that he was twenty-eight years old at the time; and finds as a fact that he was represented at the preliminary aspect of the matter by counsel, who were chosen for him by some means not shown by testimony in this record \u2014 they being the firm of Tighe &amp; Tighe of Jackson, Mississippi ; next, that he was represented by counsel, as the record shows, of his family\u2019s selection, Mr. Leighton, at his arraignment; that he was represented by able and competent counsel of his family\u2019s selection and employment throughout the trial and in the Supreme Court of Mississippi on appeal, and that in addition he was represented by able counsel appointed by the Circuit Court of Carroll County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-15\">\u201cWith these factual findings, the Court could not do otherwise than conclude, as a matter of law, that ample opportunity was afforded this petition to raise in the courts of the State of Mississippi, the constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tional question involved in this hearing, and undoubtedly if the question \u25a0of the absence of Negroes from the .grand jury and the absence of Ne.groes from the petit jury had been presented in the Circuit Court of 'Carroll County by a proper motion to quash, such a motion would have been sustained. That is borne out by the case I cited to counsel, Farrow v. State, 91 Mississippi 509, 45 \u25a0Southern 619, decided in 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201cThe opportunity was there, the decision was made by competent counsel of the family\u2019s employment and of the Court\u2019s appointment not to raise that question and not to invoke that issue in the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201cUnder these circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that the petitioner understandingly, in connection with his counsel, waived whatever right he may have had to present any question with respect to the composition of the jury, and that he, therefore, is barred from raising the question here or prevailing on that question being raised in this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe Court is further of the opinion that the motion for taking of \u25a0depositions in Chicago is not only untimely, having been filed too late, but from statement of counsel as to the purpose of taking the testimony \u25a0of those witnesses, in the light of the Court\u2019s findings that I have given you, the testimony would not be of any help here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Judge Clayton refused to issue a certificate of probable cause, and the Supreme Court of Mississippi again set a \u2022date for execution, this time for May 29, 1958.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On May 27, 1958, the Chief Justice of the United States again granted a \u25a0stay of execution \u201cuntil the petitioner has had an opportunity to exhaust his federal rights in this habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d Upon consideration, we now .grant a certificate of probable cause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The present appeal is from Judge Clayton\u2019s decision and presents the questions of whether Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand jury and from the petit jury, and whether those objections were waived as to both the grand jury and the petit jury, when not taken on the trial. In so far as it pertains to those issues, the documentary evidence and the testimony of each of the witnesses are summarized at some length in an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Were Negroes Systematically Excluded from the Grand Jury and the Petit Jury or from Either.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">No question is or can be raised as to the validity of the constitutional principle here involved. In Norris v. State of Alabama, 1935, 294 U.S. 587, 589, 55 S.Ct. 579, 580, 79 L.Ed. 1074, Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for a unanimous Court, expressed it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-13\">\u201c * * * Summing up precisely the effect of earlier decisions, this Court thus stated the principle in Carter v. State of Texas, 177 U.S. 442, 447, 20 S.Ct. 687, 44 L.Ed. 839, in relation to exclusion from service on grand juries: \u2018Whenever by any action of a state, whether through its Legislature, through its courts, or through its executive or administrative officers, all persons of the African race are excluded, solely because of their race or color, from serving as grand jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of the African race, the equal protection of the laws is denied to him, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Strauder v. State of West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664; Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370, 397, 26 L.Ed. 567; Gibson v. State of Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, 16 S.Ct. 904, 40 L.Ed. 1075.\u2019 This statement was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>peated in <em>the same </em>terms in Rogers v. State of Alabama, 192 U.S. 226, 231, 24 S.Ct. 257, 48 L.Ed. 417, and again in Martin v. State of Texas, 200 U.S. 316, 319, 26 S.Ct. 338, 50 L.Ed. 497. The principle is equally applicable to a similar exclusion of negroes from service on petit juries. Strauder v. State of West Virginia, supra; Martin v. State of Texas, supra.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Many of the pertinent Supreme Court cases are collected in annotations in 94 L.Ed. 856 and 97 L.Ed. 1249. The later cases have been no less positive in sustaining the principle.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The right is protected also by statute. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 243 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFS\">\u201cExclusion of jurors on account of race or color</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cNo citizen possessing all other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law shall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any court of the United States, or of any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude; and whoever, being an officer or other person charged with any duty in the selection or summoning of jurors, excludes or fails to summon any citizen for such cause, shall be fined not more than $5,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Addressing itself particularly to the manner of selection of juries from lists of qualified electors prevailing in Mississippi,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a unanimous Supreme Court declared in Patton v. State of Mississippi, 1947, 332 U.S. 463, 469, 68 S.Ct. 184, 187, 92 L.Ed. 76;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u201c* * \u2022\u00bb When a jury selection plan, whatever it is, operates in such way as always to result in the complete and long-continued exclusion of any representative at all from a large group of Negroes, or any other racial group, indictments and verdicts returned against them by juries thus selected cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">In Eubanks v. State of Louisiana, 1958, 356 U.S. 584, 587, 78 S.Ct. 970, 973, 2 L.Ed.2d 991, again by a unanimous Court, the foregoing statement from the Patton case, supra, was quoted with approval, to which the Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">\u201c* * \u2022\u00bb This is essentially the situation here. True, the judges now serving on the local court testified generally that they had not discriminated against Negroes in choosing grand juries, and had only tried to pick the best available jurors. But as Chief Justice Hughes said for the Court in Norris v. State of Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 598, 55 S.Ct. 579, 584, 79 L.Ed. 1074, \u2018If, in the presence of such testimony as defendant adduced, the mere general assertions by officials of their performance of duty were to be accepted as an adequate justification for the complete exclusion of negroes from jury service, the [Equal Protection Clause] \u2014 adopted with special reference to their protection\u2014 would be but a vain and illusory requirement. Compare Reece v. State of Georgia, 350 U.S. 85, 88, 76 S.Ct. 167, 169, 100 L.Ed. 77; Hernandez v. State of Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 481, 74 S.Ct. 667, 671, 98 L.Ed. 866.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">It can no longer be doubted that proof of long-continued exclusion of Negroes from jury service makes a \u201cstrong prima facie case.\u201d Norris v. State of Alabama, supra, 294 U.S. at page 598, 55 S.Ct. at page 584.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In Hernandez v. State of Texas, 1954, 347 U.S. 475, 480, 74 S.Ct. 667, 671, the holding was that persons of Mexican descent were syste<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>matically excluded from jury service. As to the proof necessary to sustain the charge of discrimination, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqg-dedup-0\">\u201cHaving established the existence of a class, petitioner was then charged with the burden of proving discrimination. To do so, he relied on the pattern of proof established by Norris v. State of Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 55 S.Ct. 579, 584, 79 L.Ed. 1074. In that case, proof that Negroes constituted a substantial segment of the population of the jurisdiction, that some Negroes were qualified to serve as jurors, and that none had been called for jury service over an extended period of time, was held to constitute prima facie proof of the systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service. This holding, sometimes called the \u2018rule of exclusion,\u2019 has been applied in other cases, and it is available in supplying proof of discrimination against any delineated class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In the present case, the naked figures prove startling enough. According to the 1950 United States Census, Carroll County, Mississippi, had a population of 15,448 persons, of which 8,836 or more than fifty-seven per cent were nonwhite, predominantly Negroes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Of the nonwhite population, 1,949 were males twenty-one years of age and over.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The median school years completed by the nonwhite population of Carroll County, twenty-five years of age and over, were 5.2 years. Yet none of the officials called as witnesses \u2014 the Circuit Clerk, the Chancery Clerk, the Sheriff, the ex-Sheriff who had served for twenty years, the District Attorney, or the Circuit Judge \u2014could remember any instance of a Negro having been on a jury list of any kind in Carroll County.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">We cannot assume that Negroes, the majority class in Carroll County, had en masse, or in any substantial numbers, voluntarily abstained from registering as electors <footnotemark>18a</footnotemark> and, by such action, had rendered themselves ineligible for jury duty. If the registration officials freely and fairly registered qualified Negroes as electors, that fact rested more in the knowledge of the State. The burden was on appellee, as the State\u2019s representative, to refute the strong prima facie case developed by the appellant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The only Negroes ever proved registered as electors in Carroll County were two who had died before 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">We have called the figures startling, but we do not feign surprise because we have long known that there are counties not only in Mississippi, but in the writer's own home State of Alabama,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in which Negroes constitute the majority of the residents but take no part in government either as voters or as jurors. Familiarity with such a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>dition thus prevents shock, but it all the more increases our concern over its existence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> When, in a proper case such as this, there is added to our common knowledge proof that some of the Negro citizens are qualified educationally and by other legal standards but are excluded from serving as jurors solely because of their race or color, the courts must declare the maintenance of such a condition violative of the Constitution and must not tolerate its longer continued existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In our opinion, the appellant proved a strong prima facie case that Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand jury and from the petit jury, and that case was not refuted by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Were Objections to Systematic Exclusion of Negroes Effectively Waived?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The more serious questions are whether objections to the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury and to a like exclusion from the petit jury were waived when they were not made at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">In deciding those questions, we should understand exactly the nature of the right under consideration. Usually the discrimination has been condemned as a denial of the equal protection of the laws. It has been indicated, however, that under certain circumstances it may constitute also a denial of due process of law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-20\">The denial of the equal protection of the laws is especially marked when the defendant is a Negro and the victim is a white person; that is when the right is viewed narrowly and strictly from the viewpoint of the accused. Looking at it more broadly from the interest of the public in the administration of justice, systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries can result in inadequate protection of law-abiding Negroes against the criminal elements of their own race. The necessity for protection may not be brought close enough home to white jurors to prevent them from being too lenient with Negroes who commit crimes against other Negroes. The Constitution provides to law-abiding Negroes also the safeguard that members of their race shall not be systematically excluded from juries. The denial of the equal protection of the laws extends also to civil cases in which the lists of jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>are drawn from a jury box from which the names of Negroes have been systematically excluded. Thus, the right is one of broad significance closely and vitally connected with the proper administration of justice in both civil and criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Mr. Justice Jackson dissenting in Cas-sell v. State of Texas, 1950, 339 U.S. 282, 301, 70 S.Ct. 629, 638, 94 L.Ed. 839, commented that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">\u201c * * * in the earlier cases where convictions were set aside, the discrimination condemned was present in selecting <em>both grand and trial jury </em>and, while the argument was chiefly based on the latter, the language of the opinions made no differentiation, nor for their purpose did they need to. Cf. Strauder v. State of West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664; Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370, 26 L.Ed. 567; see also Bush v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 107 U.S. 110, 1 S.Ct. 625, 27 L.Ed. 354; Gibson v. State of Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, 16 S.Ct. 904, 40 L.Ed. 1075; Hale v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 303 U.S. 613, 58 S.Ct. 753, 82 L.Ed. 1050.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Continuing, Mr. Justice Jackson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALT\">\u201cIt is obvious that discriminatory exclusion of Negroes from a trial jury does, or at least may, prejudice a Negro\u2019s right to a fair trial, and that a conviction so obtained should not stand. The trial jury hears the evidence of both sides and chooses what it will believe. In so deciding, it is influenced by imponderables\u2014 unconscious and conscious prejudices and preferences \u2014 and a thousand things we cannot detect or isolate in its verdict and whose influence we cannot weigh. A single juror\u2019s dissent is generally enough to prevent conviction. A trial jury on which one of the defendant\u2019s race has no chance to sit may not have the substance, and cannot have the appearance, of impartiality, especially when the accused is a Negro and the alleged victim is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">\u201cThe grand jury is a very different institution. The States are not required to use it at all. Hurtado v. People of State of California, 110 U.S. 516, 4 S.Ct. 111, 292, 28 L.Ed. 232. Its power is only to accuse, not to convict. Its indictment does not even create a presumption of guilt; all that it charges must later be proved before the trial jury, and then beyond a reasonable doubt. The grand jury need not be unanimous. It does not hear both sides but only the prosecution\u2019s evidence, and does not face the problem of a choice between two adversaries. Its duty is to indict if the prosecution\u2019s evidence, unexplained, uncontradicted and unsupplemented, would warrant a conviction. If so, its indictment merely puts the accused to trial. The difference between the function of the trial jury and the function of the grand jury is all the difference between deciding a case and merely deciding that a case should be tried.\u201d Cassell v. State of Texas, supra, 339 U.S. at pages 301, 302, 70 S.Ct. at pages 638, 639.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">Mr. Justice Jackson\u2019s dissenting opinion is, of course, entitled to no weight as a precedent. We think, however, that the quoted reasoning is sound* Further, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in language not less forceful, has also pointed out how much more important to an accused is the right to a fair andl nondiscriminatory jury in the case of a trial jury than in that of a grand jury. Hall v. State, 1909, 7 Ga.App. 115, 66 S.E. 390, 392. It may be significant that in Michel v. State of Louisiana, 1955, 350 U.S. 91, 76 S.Ct. 158, 100 L.Ed. 83, attention was called three times (350 U.S. at pages 93, 96, and 99, 76 S.Ct. at pages 160, 161, and 163) to the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>there no attack was made on the composition of the petit jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Usually it is clear, and in the present case especially so, that, regardless of its composition, any grand jury would insist that the accused be brought to trial. When it comes to the actual trial, however, the decision of whether to submit to trial before a jury in the selection of which the defendant\u2019s race has been systematically excluded presents a problem fraught with far more serious consequences. The apprehended existence of prejudice was one inducement which led to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Systematic exclusion of members of a defendant\u2019s race from a trial jury would, we think, be violative both of the equal protection clause and of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Such positive discrimination is more serious and damaging than the mere negative absence of one of the twelve jurors considered in Patton v. United States, 1930, 281 U.S. 276, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854. In that case, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">\u201c * * * Not only must the right of the accused to a trial by a constitutional jury be jealously preserved, but the maintenance of the jury as a fact finding body in criminal cases is of such importance and has such a place in our traditions, that, before any waiver can become effective, the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be had, in addition to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant. And the duty of the trial court in that regard is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote, but with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or from any of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.\u201d 281 U.S. at pages 312, 313, 50 S.Ct. at page 263.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The United States Constitution does not guarantee to a defendant in a State court a trial before a jury in which his race is proportionately represented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>nor a trial before a jury composed in any part of members of his race,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> nor even to a jury trial at all, if other defendants are not accorded a jury trial.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It does assure him of equal treatment under the law and that, so long as the State elects to accord jury trials, it must not systematically exclude from jury service qualified persons of his race. \u201cAn accused is entitled to have charges against him considered by a jury in the selection of which there has been neither inclusion nor exclusion because of race.\u201d Cassell v. State of Texas, supra, 339 U.S. at page 287, 70 S.Ct. at page 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The fact that the prohibition is aimed at a system often makes it practically inadvisable for a defendant in a particular case to raise the issue. If Negroes were placed upon the list or venire, their names might easily be stricken before the particular jury was selected and impaneled. To a single defendant, then, the principle involved is often of doubtful or no value and he may forego seeking its protection, though it cannot be denied that from a broader, overall consideration, the long-continued, systematic and arbitrary exclusion of qualified Negro citizens from service on juries solely because of their race or color deprives every Negro of the equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"AFW\">Moreover, the very prejudice which causes the dominant race to exclude members of what it may assume to be an inferior race from jury service operates with multiplied intensity against one who resists such exclusion. Conscientious southern lawyers often reason that the prejudicial effects on their client of raising the issue far outweigh any practical protection in the particular case. Many entertain the view expressed by Mr. Justice Jackson concurring in the result in Shepherd v. State of Florida, 1951, 341 U.S. 50, 55, 71 S.Ct. 549, 551, 95 L.Ed. 740 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">\u201c * * * I do not see, as a practical matter, how any Negro on the jury would have dared to cause a disagreement or acquittal. The only chance these Negroes had of acquittal would have been in the courage and decency of some sturdy and forthright white person of sufficient standing to face and live down the odium among his white neighbors that such a vote, if required, would have brought. To me, the technical question of discrimination in the jury selection has only theoretical importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Such courageous and unselfish lawyers as find it essential for their clients\u2019 protection to fight against the systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries sometimes do so at the risk of personal sacrifice which may extend to loss of practice and social ostracism.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">As Judges of a Circuit comprising six states of the deep South, we think that it is our duty to take judicial notice that lawyers residing in many southern jurisdictions rarely, almost to the point of never, raise the issue of systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries. The Supreme Court of Mississippi has said that, \u201cWe have the right to make use of knowledge of the popular and general customs of the people of this State, and public conditions therein.\u201d Moore v. Grillis, 1949, 205 Miss. 865, 39 So.2d 505, 508, 10 A.L.R.2d 1425. A like authority and duty is vested in this Court.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The evidence in this case (see appendix) fairly considered shows no waiver by the appellant himself but-at most by his counsel without his express authority. In ordinary procedural matters, the defendant in a criminal case is bound by the acts or nonaction of his counsel.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> That might extend to the waiver of the objection that Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand jury. In noncapital cases, it might extend to a like waiver as to the petit jury. <em>It </em>might extend to such a waiver even in capital cases, where the record affirmatively shows that the particular jury was desired by defendant\u2019s counsel after conscientious consideration of that course of action which would be best for the client\u2019s cause.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In this case, neither of the petitioner\u2019s trial attorneys has appeared or has been called to testify to any reason for waiving his client\u2019s constitutional right to a legally constituted trial jury, and no good reason appears otherwise from the record. The very heinousness of the crime and the weight of the physical evidence<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> made it all the more necessary that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights be not lightly or unadvisedly surrendered. The State trial judge testified that, \u201chad such a motion been made and proved, that would have been sustained.\u201d As Judge Clayton commented, that is borne out by the case of Farrow v. State, 1908, 91 Miss. 509, 45 So. 619. However strong might be the evidence of guilt, there was a possibility that a nondiscriminatory jury might not impose capital punishment. That chance was waived by defendant\u2019s counsel, so the District Court held.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">If for any reason beyond the defendant\u2019s control, upon his trial for murder, the defendant did not have the effective representation of counsel at the time of a purported waiver by such counsel without consulting the client of the right to be tried before a legally constituted jury, such waiver can be given no effect.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Even in handling civil litigation, there are limitations upon the implied authority of an attorney to make decisions for his client.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Few, if any, would argue that, without consulting his client, an attorney has implied authority to submit his cause to arbitration, or to any but a legally constituted tribunal. When not merely the client\u2019s property but his life is at stake, it is all the more essential that an attorney should advise with his client before waiving objections to a trial jury unconstitutionally and discriminatorily constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">The Negro lawyer was ready and willing to raise the issue of systematic exclusion of Negroes from the juries. The white lawyer, who was retained, refused to join with the Negro lawyer in the defense of appellant. When, upon request of the appellant\u2019s relatives, the Negro lawyer had left the case, the white lawyers failed to raise the issue. When the white lawyers had finished with the trial of the case, that issue was left as the only one that could save the appellant\u2019s life. The Negro lawyer then took over and raised the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">In Johnson v. Zerbst, 1938, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461, the Supreme Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">\u201c -x- * * jjag <em>been </em>pointed out that \u2018courts indulge every rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>sonable presumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional rights and that we \u2018do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u2019 A waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. The determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The conditions giving rise to serious doubt as to whether the failure to make the objection at the trial constituted a voluntary and intelligent waiver of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights are all matters for which the State of Mississippi must bear responsibility. It is in a poor position to insist upon waiver.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Upon this record, we hold that the appellant\u2019s constitutional right to be tried before a petit jury from which Negroes have not been systematically excluded has not been effectively waived by counsel authorized to make such waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We have considered remanding this cause again for the development of a more full and adequate record. No record was developed originally, and our previous decision (249 F.2d 417) remanded the case so that the evidence might be heard and considered. The appellant has been confined to jail or in the penitentiary for more than four years, and has not yet been tried before a legally constituted petit jury, nor has his right to such a trial been effectively waived. Inevitably, more months must elapse before he can be tried in conformity with the Constitution. We have concluded that to remand the case again for development of the record is not consistent with the promptness of disposition so essential in habeas corpus proceedings, nor with the right of the appellant to a speedy as well as a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Upon the present record, therefore, we make definitive holdings as follows: that Negroes were systematically excluded both from the grand jury which indicted the appellant and from the petit jury which convicted him; that the objection as to the petit jury was not effectively waived and, hence, that the judgment of conviction is unconstitutional, subject to collateral attack, and is declared to be void and of no effect; that the objection as to the grand jury was waived, and the appellant is now legally detained upon his indictment for murder, but that he is entitled to be tried within a reasonable time; that this Court retains jurisdiction for the entry of such further orders and judgments as may be necessary or proper.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">The Court expresses its present opinion that a period of eight months from and after the entry of this judgment or its final test by certiorari or otherwise will be sufficient to afford the State of Mississippi an opportunity to take the necessary steps to re-try the appellant, either upon the present indictment or upon a subsequent legal presentment for the same offense, as the State may elect. If the appellant has not been re-tried within such period, this Court will consider and decide whether or not he should be discharged upon this petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">Any such re-trial must of course be before a jury from which Negroes have not been systematically excluded, or before some court or tribunal so constituted as not to violate his constitutional rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>For the guidance of the parties, the Court expresses the further present opinion that if the appellant is re-tried, and if any question should arise as to the legality or constitutionality of such trial, that should be decided not upon the present petition but in the regular course by the Courts of the State of Mississippi, subject to possible review by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and judgment here rendered in accordance with the holdings of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Summary of Extracts from Evidence in District Court on Issues of Systematic Exclusion of Negroes from Grand Jury and Petit Jury and on Whether Such Objections Were Waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Claude Hatcher, called as a witness by the petitioner:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Direct Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">By Mr. Leighton.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">\u201cQ.

Prejudice in a local community is held to be a reason for a change of venue. The framers of the constitutional amendment must have known full well the existence of such prejudice and its likelihood to continue against the manumitted slaves and their race, and that knowledge was doubtless a motive that led to the amendment. By their manumission and citizenship the colored race became entitled to the equal protection of the laws of the States in which they resided; and the apprehension that through prejudice they might be denied that equal protection, that is, that there might be discrimination against them, was the inducement to bestow upon the national government the power to enforce the provision that no State shall deny to them the equal protection of the laws. Without the apprehended existence of prejudice that portion of the amendment would have &gt; been unnecessary, and it might have been left to the States to extend equality of pz-otection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">\u201cIn view of these considerations, it is hard to see why the statute of West Virginia should not be regarded as discriminating against a colored man when he is put upon trial for an alleged criminal offence against the State.
