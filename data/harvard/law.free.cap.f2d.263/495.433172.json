We think this was correct as to the husband because he set forth no cause of action against the employer in which there was any genuine issue of material fact bearing upon a claim for damages other than amounts due under the compensation statute. And it follows as to the wife, under our decision in Smither &amp; Company, Inc. v. Coles, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 242 F.2d 220, certiorari denied 354 U.S. 914, 77 S.Ct. 1299,1 L.Ed.2d 1129, that summary judgment was properly granted against her as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\">. 44 Stat. 1420, 1427, as amended, 33 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 906-907, as amended, D.C.Code 1951, \u00a7\u00a7 36-501, 36-502, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903 note.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
