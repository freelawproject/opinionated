S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-824], makes no provision for the situation where the designated beneficiary kills, the insured [cf. Wissner v. Wissner, 1950, 338 U.S. 655, 70 S.Ct. 398, 94 L.Ed. 424], public policy founded upon the equitable principle that no person should be permitted to profit from his' own wrong intervenes to prevent such a beneficiary from taking the proceeds of the insurance, unless the beneficiary was insane at the time, or the killing was accidental, or was committed in self-defense. 'See Restatement, Restitution \u00a7\u00a7 .187, 189 (1937); Burns v. United States, 4 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 106; United States v. Leverett, 5 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 30; United States v. Kwasniewski, D.C.E.D.Mich.1950, 91 F. Supp. 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Appellant alleged at the trial and urges here \u201cthat said gunshot wounds were inflicted upon her deceased husband in her own necessary self-defense.\u201d But there was conflicting evidence on that issue, and the District Judge found that appellant\u2019s act of taking the life of her husband \u201cwas not done in self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., directs that: \u201cFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d After reviewing the record and considering the briefs we cannot say that the finding here challenged is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
