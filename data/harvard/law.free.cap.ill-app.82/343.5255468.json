It is also complained that the verdict is excessive in amount.</p> <p id=\"b341-11\" pgmap=\"341\">The evidence as to the usual and customary fees of physicians for like services was sufficient. The evidence first presented in this behalf was in response to questions as to \u201c reasonable\u201d or \u201c fair\u201d charges. But appellee in his later testimony stated that \u201c the usual charge in cases of this kind for a visit is $5\u201d and \u201c I am giving $100 as an average charge for a surgeon.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b341-12\" pgmap=\"341(31) 342(35)\">It is objected that answers were excluded to questions put ,to Dr. Bidlon as to the probable effect upon the patient, of such treatment as was followed by appellee. But there was no prejudice resulting from such exclusion, for afterward Dr. Ridlon was permitted to testify, \u201c the treatmen t described by Dr. Stewart would have no effect upon the real cause of the difficulty.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b342-5\" pgmap=\"342\">\u25a0 Without going into needless discussion of the instructions, it is sufficient to say that we find no error iq the rulings of the court in that behalf.</p> <p id=\"b342-6\" pgmap=\"342\">The evid\u00e9nc\u00e9 was conflicting as to the value of the services rendered by appellee.</p> <p id=\"b342-7\" pgmap=\"342\">We can not say that the verdict is not sustained by the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b342-8\" pgmap=\"342\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
