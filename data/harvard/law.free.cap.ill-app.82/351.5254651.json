The last payment of dues and assessments made by Warczak was on September 13, 1896, which, it is claimed, and is proven, was returned to him. The society paid for him in April and May, 1896. Appellant received no money for his dues after June 16, 1896, at which date, it is claimed, he was suspended from the St. Adelbert Society for non-payment of assessments, but there is no record shown of any action by the society suspending him. It appears, however, that a vote of the society was taken that he be suspended for non-payment of assessments, but what assessments, does not appear. When dues and assessments were payable by a member does not appear from the abstract. Each branch, or subordinate society, was required to pay to appellant monthly assessments; but, as we have seen, appellant had no transactions with members, but did its business only through the societies to which they belonged. It follows, from this fact, and the further fact that there appears to be no provision in appellant\u2019s constitution under which a member forfeits or loses his rights to the mortuary fund, that, in determining the rights of a member of his beneficiary thereto, resort must be had to his relations to the branch or subordinate society.</p> <p id=\"b358-5\" pgmap=\"358\">The appellant union being made up of branch or subordinate societies, the constitution of the St. Adelbert Society, of which Warczak was a member, became a part of his contract of insurance with appellant, in so far, at least, as his rights are based on his membership in the St. Adelbert Society. Bacon on Benefit Soc., Sec. 161 a, and 236; Mas., etc., Ben. Soc. v. Burkhart, 110 Ind. 192; Alexander v. Parker, 144 Ill. 355.</p> <p id=\"b358-6\" pgmap=\"358(157) 359(26)\">It follows from what has been stated as to the relations of appellant to Warczak and the branch society, and the provisions of appellant\u2019s constitution, that appellee made a prima facie case, entitling her to a recovery, and it was incumbent on appellant, in order to meet this case, to show that Warczak had, in some way, forfeited his rights under the certificate of insurance, or because of some provision in the constitution of appellant or the St. Adelbert Society. It is not shown that any money was due from Warczak which he did not pay or offer to pay, and, that being the case, any effort by the St. Adelbert Society to forfeit his rights or suspend him was wrongful and of no effect. Until he was in default he could not be suspended or his rights forfeited. It was incumbent on appellant to prove that assessments were made and due, in accordance with the constitution of the branch society before he could be rightfully suspended. Order of Chosen Friends v. Austerlitz, 75 Ill. App. 74-8, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b359-4\" pgmap=\"359\">No such proof was made. Moreover, it is uncontroverted that in April and May, 1896, the St. Adelbert Society paid all dues and assessments for Warczak. Par. 9 of Art. 17 of the society provides only that his name shall be stricken from the roll of membership when a member is in arrears longer than six months. So that, if there were dues and assessments due for each month after May (which is not shown) Warczak would only have been in arrears, at the time of his death, five months.</p> <p id=\"b359-5\" pgmap=\"359\">We are therefore of opinion that the evidence on behalf of appellant presented no defense, and, instead of submitting the case to the jury, the learned trial judge should have directed a verdict for appellee. It follows that, if we are correct in this conclusion, there is no reversible error in the refusal of any of appellant\u2019s instructions, and the judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
