Meg.

This counter proposal is made by the following letter sent by Anderson, salesman of appellant, to appellee :</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-17\" pgmap=\"55\">\u201cWe advised our factory just what your Mr. Keenan told us over the telephone, that you would cancel the order if the machine was not here in a week from the time you gave the order, at which time we thought it would be possible to deliver you a machine.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-18\" pgmap=\"55\">We have received a letter from our president, Mr. P. B. Yates, dated Beloit, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-19\" pgmap=\"55(60) 56(137)\">\u2018 In relation to Keenan Bros., would say that we care very little for the business, and if we lose it, it will be no great loss. We have been rushed almost to death, and we can not ship their machine inside of ten days or two weeks, unless we would rush it through and give them a poor machine. It would be well enough to so advise them, and if they wish to cancel the order and bu3 elsewhere, it is just as well if they do it, for I understand we are not only to pay the freight on the machine to Chicago, but to deliver it to their mill, and are obliged to raise it to the second or third story, and the expense will be no less than $50, which will net us a price at which no other concern in America can net any profit at all. \u00a5e want their business just for the sake of. shutting out competition, but with the most superhuman efforts, we could not get this machine out any sooner. It will be at the utmost a week from next ThurscDy before we can deliver them the machine.\u2019</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\" pgmap=\"56\">You will note b3r the above, that, owing to the press of business, they can not get you a machine at the present time in less than ten days or two weeks. It might be sooner, but they do not want to guarantee any quicker delivery.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\" pgmap=\"56\">They are making you a machine carefully, but have a great deal of work, and do not want to promise before they can .really ship.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\" pgmap=\"56\">This ends our side of the question, and if it is not agreeable to you, and you wish to cancel the order, which we hope you will not, we will have to abide by the'consequences.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\" pgmap=\"56\">As soon as the machine is delivered in Chicago, we think it will be, within twelve hours, in running condition.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-9\" pgmap=\"56\">Drop us a postal as to your decision in the matter, and oblige.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-10\" pgmap=\"56\">There was evidence tending to show that this counter proposal of appellant was accepted by appellee.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-11\" pgmap=\"56\">Afterward appellant refused to carry out the contract, basing its refusal upon insulting language claimed to have been used by one of appellee\u2019s agents in conversation with an agent of appellant, and also upon the fact that the original order had never been accepted by appellant. For breach of the contract appellee brought this suit.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-12\" pgmap=\"56\">The jury found the issues for appellee, and assessed the damages at $450.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-13\" pgmap=\"56\">From judgment upon the verdict this appeal is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-14\" pgmap=\"56\">Farson &amp; Greenfield and Cratty, Jaevis &amp; Cleveland, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-3\" pgmap=\"57\">Steele &amp; Roberts, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b57-4\" pgmap=\"57\">Mr. Justice Sears</author> <p id=\"ATgW\" pgmap=\"57\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b57-5\" pgmap=\"57\">The original written order was not formally accepted by appellant. But there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding that a counter proposition made by appellant, by which the machine in question was to be delivered by November 19, 1896, was accepted by appellee. The evidence as to a breach of the contract is uncontradicted. The only questions, therefore, which we have to consider are such as relate to the measure of damages and matters of procedure.</p> <p id=\"b57-6\" pgmap=\"57\">The testimony showed that appellee was, by reason of the breach of the contract, deprived of the use of a sander, the machine in question, for two weeks. It is also claimed as an element of damage, that appellee was obliged to purchase a machine in the market at a price higher than the price agreed upon in the contract with appellant.</p> <p id=\"b57-7\" pgmap=\"57(207) 58(33)\">No competent evidence was presented by appellee to show the rental value of such a machine for the period of two weeks. But appellant did present evidence in this behalf, and while it is perhaps questionable if it disclosed the true rental value, disconnected with the element of a conditional sale, yet appellant can not complain if the evidence presented by itself be taken as the basis of value. The damages for deprivation of use, measured by this, the only evidence in the case upon this point, could not exceed $25 for the two weeks. Nor was there any competent evidence offered by appellee as to the market price of machines like the one in question at the time of the purchase. It merely sought to show what it had paid; not what it was compelled to pay. Upon this question of value, appellant presented evidence. From such evidence it would appear that the highest valuation would fix the measure of damages in this behalf at $75. There is no evidence in the case which warranted the jury in assessing appellee\u2019s damages at more than the aggregate of these two sums, viz., $100. No special contract of appellee with other's, or probable damage which might result therefrom upon a failure on the part of appellant to carry out its contract, can be said to have been considered by the parties in the making of this contract.</p> <p id=\"b58-5\" pgmap=\"58\">If there was error in refusing to give the instruction asked by appellant as to the right of appellee to recover upon any agreement other than an acceptance of the written order, because of the pleadings, such error was waived by the tender of another instruction by appellant, which the court gave, and by which the right to recover upon such later agreement was recognized, if the jury found such an agreement to exist.</p> <p id=\"b58-6\" pgmap=\"58\">If the appellee shall, within ten days, remit $350 of the amount of the judgment, then the judgment will be affirmed as to the remainder, viz., $L00; otherwise it will be reversed and the cause remanded. In either event, appellant will recover costs.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
