Interpleader\u2014Requisites of the Remedy.\u2014The equitable remedy of interpleader depends upon and requires the existence of the four following elements : First, the same thing, debt or duty, must be claimed by both or all the parties against whom the relief is sought. Second, all the adverse titles or claims must be dependent on or be derived from a common source. Third, the person asking the relief must not have, nor claim, any interest in the subject-matter. Fourth, he must have incurred no independent liability to either of the claimants; that is, he must stand perfectly indifferent between them, in the position of a mere stakeholder.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b408-9\" pgmap=\"408\">2. Same\u2014Office of Complainant.\u2014In an interpleader suit, the complainant\u2019s office is widely different from that of a complainant in an ordinary suit in equity, seeking to avoid a liability, or to enforce some right against the defendant. He comes into court with the money in his hand to discharge an acknowledged debt, which he is prevented, by conflicting claims, from paying to either of the claimants with safety to himself. His duty is at an end when he has brought the rival claimants to interplead by filing them answers and putting the suit at issue.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-10\" pgmap=\"408\">Bill of Interpleader.\u2014Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook County; the Hon.

W. McCulloch, alleging, in substance, the issuing by it of two life insurance policies, each for the sum of $2,500, on the life of James R. Murdoch, for the benefit of Anna M. Murdoch, his wife, her executors, administrators or assigns; the first policy numbered 63,523, and dated May 23, 1389, and the second numbered 65,949, and dated November 8, 1889; that May 30, 1S97, James R. Murdoch died; that proper proofs of death were made and accepted by the complainant; that Charles A. Morrill claimed that at the time of James R. Murdoch\u2019s death, he held and still holds an assignment of the proceeds of said policies executed by Anna M. Murdoch, as required by complainant\u2019s rules, and has instituted two suits on said policies in the Circuit Court of Cook County, one in the name of said Morrill, and the other in the name of Anna M. Murdoch, for his use, which suits are pending and have been noticed for trial on the short cause calendar; that July 2, 1897, appellees McCulloch and Murdoch made known and claimed, and still insist, that at the time of James E. Murdoch\u2019s death, they were entitled to the entire proceeds of said policies, the former by reason of an assignment to him of a portion thereof, and the latter as beneficiary therein, and that Morrill was not entitled to said proceeds; and that they would resist all claim of his thereto, and notified complainant not to pay the proceeds of said policies to said Morrill; and the said Murdoch and McCulloch are still claiming said fund, and are threatening to bring suit against complainant on said policies.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-4\" pgmap=\"409\">Complainant has now the sum of $5,000, the proceeds of said policies, and has always been willing to- pay said amount to the person lawfully entitled thereto, and offers to bring the same into court, as the court shall direct. Complainant denies all collusion; avers that the bill is exhibited of its own free will, to avoid vexation and harassment, and because it does not know to which of said claimants said money should be paid; prays that the defendants may answer, but not under oath, that they may interplead, etc., and that Morrill may be restrained from preceding with said actions at law, and the other appellees from commencing actions at law, etc.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\" pgmap=\"409\">Annexed to the bill is the usual affidavit denying collusion.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\" pgmap=\"409(89) 410(188)\">December 24, 1897, appellees Murdoch and McCulloch filed their joint and several answer, admitting the issuance of the policies, the death of James E. Murdoch, the furnishing of satisfactory proofs of death, and that Morrill claimed to hold an assignment of the policies, and had caused suits to be instituted on them, as averred in the bill. The answer alleges that no valid assignment of said policies was made to Morrill, for the reason that when said Anna \u00a5, Murdoch signed and delivered the same to Morrill, James E. Murdoch, her husband, was alive and not present, and. did not consent to her acts in the premises; that James E. Murdoch, the husband of said Anna M. Murdoch, was for a long space of time in the employ of the defendant Charles A. Morrill; that during the course of said employment the said Murdoch, from time to time, became indebted' to said Morrill; that at the close of the month of November, 1895, the said indebtedness was considerable; that on the 2d day of December, 1895, the said Morrill gave to the said Anna M\u2019 Murdoch a statement of his account against her husband, James E. Murdoch; that said account showed a balance of $1,757.09 in favor of said Morrill, which amount he represented as the entire indebtedness of said James E. Murdoch to him at that time, and that said assignment was made to secure the indebtedness then due to Morrill, and any future indebtedness which she or her husband might incur to him; which said Morrill well knew, and that, December 2, 1895, he wrote to said Anna M. Murdoch the following letter:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\" pgmap=\"410\">\u201c Chicago, III., Dec. 2, 1897.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\" pgmap=\"410\">Mrs. J. E. Murdoch, City.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-7\" pgmap=\"410\">Dear Madam : I this day received from you policies No. 63,523 in the Manhattan Life Insurance Company of New York for twenty-five hundred ($2,500) dollars each on the life of J. E. Murdoch, in which you are named as beneficiary, being duly assigned to me. On payment by you or your husband of the balance due me, and also any further indebtedness that may be incurred by you or your husband from time to time, I will reassign these policies to you. I will also see that the premiums on these policies are paid, when due and not allow them to lapse for non-payment during the time that I remain beneficiary, the amount, however, so paid to be charged to the account of J. E. Murdoch. I will also pay you fifty ($50) dollars per month, payable weekly, during the time that J. E. Murdoch is in my employ; this amount also to be charged to his account. In case of these polices becoming payable from any cause whatsoever during the time that I am beneficiary, whatever amount may be due me from said J. E. Murdoch or yourself shall be deducted from the amount received on these policies and the balance paid over to you.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\" pgmap=\"410\">Yours very truly,</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\" pgmap=\"410\">Charles A. Morrill.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-3\" pgmap=\"411\">The answer further alleges that defendants are not informed of the amount of indebtedness which Morrill claims, and reserve the right to dispute the same, if necessary; that Morrill, before the death of James E. Murdoch, became indebted to him in the sum of $340.14, which is a set-off against any amount which may be found due to Morrill, and that, May 4, 1897, Anna M. Murdoch assigned to appellee McCulloch her interest in said policies by an assignment written on the reverse side of said letter from Morrill to said Anna M. Murdoch, which assignment is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\" pgmap=\"411\">\u201c Owensboro, Ky., May 4, 1897.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\" pgmap=\"411\">For value received, I hereby assign my interest in policies Nos. 63,523 and 65,949, Manhattan Life Insurance Co., $2,500 each, mentioned on reverse side of this sheet, to J. W. McCulloch.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\" pgmap=\"411\">Mrs.- Anna M. Murdoch.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\" pgmap=\"411\">Defendants claim the entire amount of $5,000, due from said insurance company. December 27, 1897, Morrill answered, admitting, among other things, that at the time of the death of the insured, he claimed to hold and still holds assignments of the proceeds of said policies, executed as required by complainant\u2019s rules, by Anna M. Murdoch; that, December 3, 1895, each of said policies numbered, respectively, 63,523 and 65,949, were duly assigned, as required by complainant\u2019s rules, to defendant Morrill by Anna M. Murdoch, and said policies were by her delivered to said defendant, and have ever since remained, and now are in his possession, said assignments being the same in form, and one of them, with the acknowledgment thereof, being as follows:</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-8\" pgmap=\"411(88) 412(18)\">\u201c In consideration of one dollar and other valuable considerations, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, I hereby sell and assign the annexed policy No. 63,523 on the life of James E. Murdoch, of Minneapolis, Minn., issued by the Manhattan Life Insurance Company of New York unto Charles A Morrill of No. 21. Lake street, city of Chicago, county of Cook, State of Illinois, and I do also for myself, my executors and administrators, guarantee the validity and sufficiency of the foregoing assignment to the above named assignee, his executors, administrators and assigns, and their title to the said policy will forever warrant and defend.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\" pgmap=\"412\">Dated in Chicago this 3d, day of December, 1895.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\" pgmap=\"412\">Anna M.

Murdoch, to me known to be the individual described in, and who executed, the foregoing instrument, and acknowledged that she executed the same.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-12\" pgmap=\"412\">George H. Smith,</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-13\" pgmap=\"412\">(Notabtal Seal.) Notary Public.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-14\" pgmap=\"412\">That December 4, 1895, said assignments were duly forwarded to said complainant, and, December 6, 1S95, complainant acknowledged the receipt thereof, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-15\" pgmap=\"412\">\u201cYour favor of the 4th inst., inclosing assignments of policies number 63,523 and 65,949, is received, and the. same have been placed on file.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-16\" pgmap=\"412(193) 413(200)\">The answer further avers that complainant has never questioned the validity of, or made any objections to, said assignments, and that Anna M. Murdoch has, at all times, both before and since the filing of the bill, admitted their validity, and that they were made with the written consent of James R, Murdoch. Defendant admits that he has instituted suits on the policies, as alleged in the bill, and avers that the policies were assigned to him to secure indebtedness from J ames R. Murdoch to him, existing at the time of the assignments and advances, which might thereafter be made by him to said Murdoch, and that there is equitably due him on account of indebtedness due him from Murdoch at the date of the assignments and indebtedness since incurred by said James R. and Anna M. Murdoch, the sum of $5,183.17. Avers that he is not informed, save by the bill, whether appellees McCulloch and Murdoch, July 2, 1897, claimed that they were entitled to the proceeds of the policies, and, therefore, denies the same and calls for strict proof. Denies that said appellees ever claimed that defendant was not entitled to the proceeds of the policies, or notified complainant in writing not to pay the same to defendant. Denies that Anna M. Murdoch has any interest in the policies, superior to defendant\u2019s right, or any right to interfere with the payment to defendant of the full amount thereof. Denies that there was any valid assignment to McCulloch, and avers that if there was any assignment to him, it was without consideration. Denies that complainant has at all times been willing to pay to the person entitled, and avers that complainant has, at all times, known, that defendant was the only person entitled to the proceeds of the policies, and that the claims of the other defendants were such that said proceeds could be paid to this defendant with perfect safety. Alleges that he has never refused to account to Anna M. Murdoch as to indebtedness incurred by the said Anna M. and James E. Murdoch, and has, at all times, been willing to pay to said Anna M. Murdoch, any sum which might remain, after payment to defendant of the indebtedness to him of said Anna M. and James E. Murdoch, etc.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-4\" pgmap=\"413\">October 18,1897, before entry of appearance of the defendant to the bill, the court entered a temporary restraining order, restraining Morrill from the prosecution of the suits at law mentioned in the pleadings. Febuary 7, 1898, the following decree was entered :</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\" pgmap=\"413\">\u201c This cause coming on to be heard this February 7,1898, upon the bill of complaint, the joint and several answer of the defendants Anna M. Murdoch and J. W. McCulloch, and the separate answer of defendant Charles A. Morrill, and upon the face of the pleadings, after argument of counsel, it is</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\" pgmap=\"413(91) 414(67)\">Ordered and adjudged that the bill of interpleader is properly brought by the complainant; that the complainant be paid the costs of this action, to be allowed from the funds in the bill mentioned, and that the complainant thereupon by consent of counsel retain the amount of the residue of said fund, said consent being without prejudice of the defendant or the defendant\u2019s right to appeal, as hereinafter prayed, for the benefit of such defendant or defendants as shall be found to be entitled thereto, and that the complainant be dismissed from the further prosecution of this action, released, acquitted and discharged from all claims to either of the defendants by reason of said fund, except as hereinafter directed by the court, that the temporary restraining order restraining said Morrill from prosecuting the suits at law now pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, be and the same is made a perpetual injunction.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\" pgmap=\"414\">It is further ordered and decreed that the said defendants do interplead, settle and adjust their separate claims and matters in controversy between themselves.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\" pgmap=\"414\">The appellant excepted to the decree and prayed an appeal, but it does not appear that any objection was made to a hearing on the pleadings.</p><attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-7\" pgmap=\"414\">Crattv, Jarvis &amp; Cleveland, attorneys \"for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-8\" pgmap=\"414\">Peokham &amp; Brown, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b414-9\" pgmap=\"414\">Mr. Justice Adams</author> <p id=\"AYD\" pgmap=\"414\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b414-10\" pgmap=\"414\">Appellant\u2019s counsel claim that the bill of interpleader is insufficient. In Platte Valley Bank v. Nat. Bank, 155 Ill. 250, the court say:</p> <p id=\"b414-11\" pgmap=\"414\">\u201c It is laid down in 3 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, Sec. 1322, that the equitable remedy of interpleader depends upon and requires the existence of the four following elements : \u2018 First, the same thing, debt or duty, must be claimed by both or all the parties against whom the relief is demanded. Second, all the adverse titles or claims must be dependent on or be derived from a common source. Third, the person asking the relief, the plaintiff, must not have, nor claim, any interest in the subject-matter. Fourth, he must have incurred no independent liability to either of the claimants; that is, he must stand perfectly indifferent between them, in the position, merely, of stakeholder.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p id=\"b414-13\" pgmap=\"414(71) 415(47)\">These elements co-exist in the bill in question. It is averred that the defendant Morrill claims the insurance money, and that Anna M. Murdoch and J. W. McCulloch also claim it; the titles of Morrill and McCulloch are both alleged to be claimed through Anna M. Murdoch, the beneficiary in the policies, and the ultimate, common source of all the titles claimed is shown by the bill to the insurance company; the complainant disclaims all interest in the fund, and evidently has none beyond seeing that payment is made to the person or persons entitled to receive it; complainant has incurred no independent liability to any one of the claimants, and alleges perfect indifferenee as between them.</p> <p id=\"b415-4\" pgmap=\"415\">Counsel further contend that it was error to hear the cause on the bill and answers for the reason that the allegations of the bill that the defendants McCulloch and Murdoch made claim to the fund; that the complainant did not know to whom to pay it; and that it has always been willing to pay to the person entitled, are all denied by the answer of appellant Morrill, and therefore, required proof.</p> <p id=\"b415-5\" pgmap=\"415(265) 416(13)\">McCulloch and Anna M. Murdoch both claim the fund by their answer, but counsel for appellant insist that their answer could not be read as against appellant. The contrary doctrine was announced in Balchen v. Crawford, 1 Sanf. Ch. R. 380. In that case the court says: \u201cThe general rule is well established that the answer of one defendant can not be read in evidence against another defendant. There are, however, many exceptions to the rule.\u201d The court, after mentioning certain exceptions, proceeds as follows : \u201c In an interpleader suit the complainant\u2019s office is widely different from that of a complainant in an ordinary suit in equity, seeking to avoid a liability, or to enforce some right against the defendant. Here the complainant comes into court with the money in his hand to discharge an acknowledged debt, which he is prevented, by conflict-, ing claims, from paying to either of the claimants with safety to himself. His duty appears to be at an end when he has brought the rival claimants to interplead, by filing their answers and putting the suit at issue. It is true, he must show by his bill that each of the parties claims a right, \u2022 else he makes out no case. But that is his whole case and when the court sees by the respective answers that such defendant has made such claim, I can perceive no well, grounded reason for putting the complainant to other proof-of that fact, against the opposing defendants respectively. That proof, if made by testimony, would consist almost entirely of the declarations and admissions of the respect- ' ive defendants,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b416-5\" pgmap=\"416\">The objection made in the case cited was the same as made here. A defendant who did not by his answer admit that a co-defendant had made claim to the fund in dispute, insisted that' proof that such claim was made was necessary.</p> <p id=\"AqK\" pgmap=\"416\">\u00bfWe are of opinion that no proof was necessary of the allegations that the complainant did not know to whom to pay the insurance money, and that it had always been ready to pay it to the person entitled to receive it.</p> <p id=\"b416-7\" pgmap=\"416\">We do not agree with the contention of counsel that the written receipt by the insurance company of the assignments to Morrill operated as. an acknowledgment of liabilityr to him. We are of opinion that the facts alleged in the bill were sufficient to create a reasonable apprehension on the part of the complainant that it would be harassed by several suits in respect to the insurance money. We find no reversible error in the record, and the decree will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
