He brought suit, charging appellee with negligence in loading the ore so that in the movement of the cars it fell off and struck him; also that a push car which was negligently loaded and in a bad state of repair and condition, ran off .the tracks; that he was commanded by his foreman to leave .the work he was employed to do and assist in putting the car on the tracks; that he refused, and was again commanded- by the'foreman to so assist, and through fear of -losing his employment, he did assist in putting the car on the tracks, and while so engaged, and in the exercise of reasonable care, the car being in an unsafe condition, dumped the ore, which threw appellee to the ground, injuring him, etc.</p><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\" pgmap=\"308\">The general issue being pleaded, a trial was had before the court and a jury. At the close of all the evidence offered by both parties, the court instructed the jurj^ to find the defendant not guilty, when appellant asked that the jury be polled; but the court refused, and directed the clerk to enter a verdict of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d which was done, and after overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, entered judgment on the verdict, from which the appeal is taken.</p><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-6\" pgmap=\"308\">Worth E.

Counsel for appellant, in oral-argument, stated that he supposed these words were stricken -out by him.</p> <p id=\"b308-11\" pgmap=\"308\">In this state of the record, we are bound to presume there was sufficient evidence before the court to justify its direction to the jury, to find the defendant not guilty, and also to sustain its judgment. Miner v. Phillips, 42 Ill. 129; Schmidt v. Ry. Co., 83 Ill. 412; Cogshall v. Beesley, 76 Ill. 445; Culliner v. Nash, Id. 515.</p> <p id=\"b308-12\" pgmap=\"308(18) 309(24)\">We had, however, before reaching the above conclusion, made a careful examination of the evidence, guided by the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel, and are unable to say from such examination that the evidence was sufficient to justify its submission to the jury.</p> <p id=\"b309-4\" pgmap=\"309\">A model of the push cart, the dumping of which it is alleged caused appellant\u2019s injury, was exhibited to the court and jury during the examination of the witnesses as to the cause and circumstances of the accident. The witnesses were examined with reference to the working and m\u00e9chanism of the ear, and in answer to questions it appears that by certain indications and illustrations, the nature of which do not appear in the record, the witnesses explained to the court and jury, by the use of the model, the working and mechanism of the car, and how the accident was caused. This model was not offered in evidence, though appellant\u2019s counsel stated he so intended, and not having it before us, we are unable-to determine from the statements of the witnesses, whether there was sufficient proof of appellee\u2019s negligence to justify the submission of the case to the jury. For all that we can tell, an examination of the model in the light of the testimony of the witnesses, their explanations and illustrations, may have convinced the learned trial judge that the accident could not have been caused for the reasons alleged by appellant.</p> <p id=\"b309-5\" pgmap=\"309\">For both the reasons stated the judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
