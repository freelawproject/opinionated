Following public hearings, the commissioner of environmental protection (the commissioner) granted the defendants\u2019 applications for a solid waste construction permit and an air emissions permit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed the appeal on its merits. The plaintiffs thereafter appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the trial court should have concluded that the commissioner improperly granted the defendants\u2019 applications for a solid waste construction permit and an air emissions permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court should have concluded that the defendants\u2019 application for a solid waste construction permit was improperly granted by the commissioner. According to the plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>because the application was incomplete, the commissioner was prohibited from granting it. The plaintiffs also argue that because the defendants failed to demonstrate that a parent company of the defendant Ref-Fuel, Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. (BFI), had not repeatedly violated pertinent statutes, the application should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the defendants\u2019 application for a solid waste construction permit was incomplete and that, therefore, the commissioner was precluded from granting it. According to the plaintiffs, \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requires that specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>information be included in every application for a solid waste construction permit and that, therefore, the absence of certain of this information from the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>ants\u2019 application rendered the application incomplete and precluded issuance of a solid waste permit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Section 22a-209-4 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe information required to be in an application for a permit to construct shall depend upon the type of solid waste facility proposed. . . . An application will not be deemed complete until all information required by statutes or regulations or otherwise requested by the Commissioner have [sic] been submitted in proper form. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>(1) Application for each solid waste facility permit to construct . . . <em>shall include but not be limited to the following as the Commissioner deems necessary . . . </em>(Emphasis added.) This language is followed by a comprehensive list of items that relate to all solid waste facilities. Section 22a-209-4 (b) thereafter provides: \u201c(2) A facility plan, including engineering studies and proposals, shall accompany the application . . . and <em>shall include but not be limited to the following information and supporting materials as the Commissioner deems necessary . . . </em>(Emphasis added.) This language is followed by two specific lists of items. The first applies to \u201csolid and special waste disposal areas,\u201d while the second applies to \u201ctransfer stations, resources recovery facilities or other volume reduction plants, and biomedical waste treatment facilities.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) (2) (A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The plaintiffs argue that use of the phrase \u201cshall include\u201d in the prefatory language of \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) (1) and (2) requires that every application for a solid waste construction permit include each item set forth in \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) (1) and, if applicable, each item set forth in \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) (2) (A) or (B). It is quite plausible, however, that the phrase \u201cas the Commissioner deems necessary\u201d modifies \u201cshall include\u201d and that, therefore, an application for a solid waste construction permit \u201cshall include\u201d the information set forth only if the commissioner deems it necessary. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs maintain that the phrase \u201cas the Commissioner deems necessary\u201d modifies only the phrase \u201cbut not be limited to the following\u201d and that, therefore, any discretion that the phrase imparts to the commissioner is restricted to determining whether an application will be limited to the information set forth in the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Because \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) is subject to two plausible interpretations, it requires our construction. As is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>in every case involving the construction of a statute, our starting point must be the language employed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324, 332, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987); <em>Verdon </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 363, 366, 446 A.2d 3 (1982). \u201cThe test for determining whether the use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 is mandatory or directory is \u2018whether the prescribed mode of action is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished.\u2019 <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 360, 472 A.2d 336 (1984). That test must be applied with reference to the purpose of the statute. See id.\u201d <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 710, 579 A.2d 1 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (a), part of the legislative scheme that \u00a7 22a-209-4 was designed to implement; see General Statutes \u00a7 22a-209; provides: \u201cThe commissioner of environmental protection may issue, deny, modify, renew, suspend, revoke or transfer a permit, under such conditions as he may prescribe and <em>upon submission of such information as he may require, </em>for the construction, alteration and operation of solid waste facilities, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislature intended, therefore, that the decision of what information must be included in a solid waste construction permit application is, ultimately, a matter within the commissioner\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Furthermore, by rendering a decision on the defendants\u2019 application, despite the fact that the application did not include every item of information set forth in the regulation, the commissioner implicitly interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>\u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) as requiring the application for a solid waste construction permit to include only the information that he deemed necessary. We accord great deference to the construction of a provision given by the administrative agency charged with the provision\u2019s enforcement. <em>Trumbull </em>v. <em>State, </em>206 Conn. 65, 77, 537 A.2d 431 (1988); <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 128-29, 527 A.2d 672 (1987). \u201cThis principle applies with even greater force to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own duly adopted regulations.\u201d <em>Griffin Hospital v. Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 497, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Considering the comprehensiveness of the lists set forth in \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b), construction of the section as the plaintiffs suggest would elevate form over substance by requiring the inclusion of information in an application in cases where the commissioner, in his discretion, deems such information either unnecessary or superfluous. \u201c \u2018[Wjhere a statute is capable of two constructions, one that is rational and effective in accomplishing the evident legislative object, and the other leading to \u201cbizarre results\u201d destructive of that purpose, the former should prevail.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>206 Conn. 203, 210, 536 A.2d 583 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Uretek, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 706, 719, 543 A.2d 709 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">We conclude that, because the purpose of \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) is to ensure that the commissioner has an adequate basis upon which to render a decision on a solid waste construction permit application and because both the legislature and the commissioner have determined that the commissioner is in the best position to decide what information is necessary under the circumstances of each case, the more reasonable inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>pretation of \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) is that an application thereunder must include only those items set forth that the commissioner deems necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The plaintiffs next assert that because the defendants failed to demonstrate that BFI, a parent company of Ref-Fuel, had not repeatedly violated pertinent statutes, their application for a solid waste construction permit should have been denied. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Section 22a-209-4 (d) (1) (D) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in pertinent part: \u201c(1) The Commissioner shall issue a permit to construct or to operate upon receipt of satisfactory evidence from the applicant that . . . (D) the owner or operator of the facility or, if the owner or operator is a business entity, a parent or subsidiary corporation . . . has not repeatedly violated pertinent statutes, regulations, orders or permit terms or conditions at any solid waste facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">In support of their position, the plaintiffs assert that, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-209-4 (d) (1) (D), evidence of the following precluded the commissioner from issuing a solid waste construction permit to the defendants: BFI had been ordered to cease operations and alter its methods of operation at various waste disposal sites. BFI had been the subject of investigation in connection with enforcement actions involving hazardous waste disposal. Administrative proceedings involving the discharge of materials into the environment were pending against BFI. BFI was a named defendant in a pending civil action that alleged price fixing for waste services. After considering this evidence, the commissioner determined that BFI\u2019s compliance history did not warrant denial of the defendants\u2019 application for a solid waste construction permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>In reviewing a decision of an administrative agency, we will reverse the decision upon a showing that the agency acted illegally, arbitrarily or in abuse of its discretion or that the decision is unsupported by the evidence. <em>Connecticut Humane Society </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>218 Conn. 757, 762, 591 A.2d 395 (1991); <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 605, 590 A.2d 447 (1991). The determination of whether an applicant has \u201crepeatedly violated pertinent statutes, regulations, orders or permit terms or conditions at any solid waste facility\u201d is a question of fact. We conclude that nothing in the record indicates an abuse of discretion by the commissioner in refusing to find that BFI\u2019s violations had been repeated. We further conclude that the commissioner reasonably determined that evidence of investigations, <em>alleged </em>violations of pertinent statutes and <em>pending </em>proceedings involving BFI, did not require denial of the defendants\u2019 application for a solid waste construction permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court should have concluded that the defendants\u2019 application for an air emissions permit was improperly granted. According to the plaintiffs, because the defendants failed to analyze the particulate matter measuring less than ten microns in diameter that will be emitted by the facility and because they failed properly to analyze the impact that the facility will have on the prevention of significant deterioration of the ambient air quality, then-application should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The plaintiffs first assert that the defendants\u2019 failure to analyze the particulate matter measuring less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>than ten microns in diameter (PMi0)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that will be emitted by the facility required denial of their application for an air emissions permit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Title 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (i) (1990) provides in pertinent part: \u201c(1) No stationary source ... to which the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section apply shall begin actual construction without a permit which states that the stationary source . . . would meet those requirements.\u201d Title 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (j) (2) (1990) provides: \u201cA new major stationary source shall apply best available control technology for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act that it would have the potential to emit in significant amounts.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that, pursuant to \u00a7 52.21 (i), the defendants\u2019 application was required to include an analysis showing that the facility would apply the best available control technology with respect to limiting PM10 emissions and, therefore, meet the requirement of \u00a7 52.21 (j) (2). We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Title 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (i) (4) (1990) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section shall not apply to a particular major stationary source ... if . . . (x) The source . . . was subject to 40 CFR 52.21, with respect to particulate matter, as in effect before July 31,1987 and the owner or operator submitted an application for a permit under this section before that date, and the Administrator [of the environmental protection agency] subsequently determines that the application as submitted was complete with respect to the particulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>matter requirements then in effect in this section. Instead, the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section that were in effect before July 31,1987 shall apply to such source or modification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">It is undisputed that the facility was subject to 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21, with respect to particulate matter, as in effect before July 31, 1987. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (1986). The plaintiffs assert, however, that the defendants failed to submit a complete application for an air emissions permit under \u00a7 52.21 prior to July 31,1987. The plaintiffs first argue that because the defendants submitted their application for a permit to the commissioner, rather than to the administrator of the environmental protection agency (the administrator), they failed to submit an application under \u00a7 52.21. Because the administrator has delegated authority to enforce the standards of performance for new stationary sources to the commissioner; see Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-174-3 (a) (2) (commissioner has been delegated authority to enforce 40 C.F.R. Part 60 by the administrator); 40 C.F.R. Part 60 (1990) (standards of performance for new stationary sources); this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The plaintiffs next assert that the defendants\u2019 application was not complete until September 16,1987, and that, therefore, the exemption set forth in \u00a7 52.21 (i) (4) (x) does not apply. The commissioner determined that a complete application for an air emissions permit was submitted by the defendants before July 31, 1987. The plaintiffs\u2019 second assertion, therefore, is equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Because the defendants submitted a complete application for an air emissions permit prior to July 31,1987, the requirements of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (i) and (j) (1990) do not apply to their application for an air emissions permit. Instead, the requirements of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (1986), which were the regulations in effect prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>July 31, 1987, govern the defendants\u2019 application. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (i) (4) (x) (1990). PM10 is not a pollutant subject to regulation under the 1986 regulations. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (b) (23) (i) (1986). We conclude, therefore, that the defendants were not required to conduct an analysis of PM10 emissions in order to obtain an air emissions permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The plaintiffs next assert that because the defendants failed to analyze properly the effect that the facility will have on the prevention of significant deterioration of the ambient air quality (PSD),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> their application for an air emissions permit should have been denied. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Title 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.21 (m) (1) (1990) provides in pertinent part: \u201c(i) Any application for a permit under this section shall contain an analysis of ambient air quality in the area that the major stationary source . . . would affect for each of the following pollutants: <em>(a) </em>For the source, each pollutant that it would have the potential to omit in a significant amount . . . .\u2019\u2019The plaintiffs do not dispute that the defendants submitted an analysis of PSD with their application. They assert, however, that, because the defendants\u2019 analysis did not contain all essential data and because some of the data that it included was outdated, inaccurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>or unverified, the analysis was inadequate. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs have not challenged the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he [fjacility will meet all applicable state and federal regulations governing the issuance of permits for a new source of air emissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We conclude that, despite the alleged inadequacy of the defendants\u2019 PSD analysis, because the plaintiffs do not challenge the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the facility will comply with applicable federal and state regulations governing new stationary sources of air emissions, including regulations designed to ensure PSD, the commissioner properly granted the defendants\u2019 application for an air emissions permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-9\"> The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) is a body established to implement the Solid Waste Management Services Act.
