Killen, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, was <em>John J.

The basis for the petitioner\u2019s claim that the jury pool was not representative of the Fairfield county population was that black people were not included in proportion to their number in the county. Because he is white, and thus is not a member of the underrepresented minority group, the petitioner has not claimed a violation of his federal fourteenth amendment right to \u201cthe equal protection of the laws.\u201d <em>Fay </em>v. <em>New York, </em>332 U.S. 261, 287, 67 S. Ct. 1613, 91 L. Ed. 2043, reh. denied, 332 U.S. 784, 68 S. Ct. 27, 92 L. Ed. 367 (1947).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was eligible, however, to assert a fair cross section claim upon the ground that discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>nation against any significant minority group would render the jury array not fairly representative of the \u201cdistrict wherein the crime [was] committed.\u201d <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Kiff, </em>407 U.S. 493, 504, 92 S. Ct. 2163, 33 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">After concluding that the petitioner had not deliberately bypassed his opportunity to challenge the array in the trial court, the habeas court rejected both his claim of a fair cross section violation and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. It rendered judgment dismissing the petition. The petitioner\u2019s appeal from that judgment was argued in this court as a companion case to the appeals of thirty-one other petitioners who had raised equal protection claims based upon underrepresentation of black or Hispanic people on jury arrays in Fairfield county resulting from the town quota system of jury pool composition established by General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 51-220, which was in effect while their cases were pending in the trial court. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>218 Conn. 403, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991). Without addressing the merits of the equal protection claims, we affirmed the judgments dismissing those petitions. Id. For reasons similar to those expressed in <em>Johnson, </em>we affirm the dismissal of the petition in this case without considering the merits of the petitioner\u2019s fair cross section claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In <em>Johnson </em>we held that the procedural default of the petitioners in failing to challenge the array of jurors before trial, as required by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 810 and 811, barred habeas review of the merits of the petitioners\u2019 equal protection claims. For the same reason, we conclude that the failure of this petitioner before trial to challenge the array available for selection of a petit jury for his trial precludes habeas review of his fair cross section claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>In <em>Johnson </em>we also held that the failure of trial counsel for each petitioner to challenge the array of jurors available for selection on grand or petit juries did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel under the standard for performance of defense counsel established in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). For the reasons given in <em>Johnson, </em>as well as the further consideration that competent counsel would not ordinarily have any reason to believe that a jury array including more black people would be more favorably disposed toward a white defendant, we reject this petitioner\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failure to challenge the array of jurors in his case. Accordingly, we agree with the habeas court that the petition should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\"> The United States Supreme Court has recently extended to a white criminal defendant standing to attack the use of peremptory challenges of black jurors by the prosecution as racially discriminatory and violative of the right to equal protection of the laws. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1364, 113 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1991); see <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986). Our disposition of the present case would not be affected if this defendant had asserted an equal protection challenge rather than a fair cross section challenge to the composition of the jury that found him guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
