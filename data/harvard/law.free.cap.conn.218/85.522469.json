The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of felony mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>der in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied his motion to suppress certain evidence gathered as a result of a search and seizure of certain personal property located under the bridge abutment where he had been living; (2) denied his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial; (3) admitted into evidence certain testimony about a larceny he allegedly committed subsequent to the murder and robbery; and (4) denied him access to the mental health records of a state\u2019s witness. We conclude that the trial court should have granted the motion to suppress, and we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant owed money to Mark Allen<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>drugs. On July 30,1987, the defendant, who was driving the car of the victim, a male homosexual, took Allen to the victim\u2019s condominium in Branford in order to pay his debt to Allen by stealing the victim\u2019s video cassette recorder and other items. The defendant told Allen that he and the victim had a homosexual relationship, and that Allen should pretend that he was interested in engaging in sex with the victim and the defendant. At the condominium, the three men had drinks and thereafter went upstairs, where the defendant and the victim took a shower together. After kissing and fondling the victim, the defendant began beating him. Allen, who had declined to become involved in the sexual activity, pulled the defendant off the victim, who was bleeding from his nose and mouth and had stopped moving. Allen then left the bedroom to search for items to steal. The defendant remained in the bedroom, where he strangled the victim with a cord. Allen left the condominium with a quantity of coins, the victim\u2019s video cassette recorder, and some other items. He stole the victim\u2019s car, leaving the defendant in the condominium with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On July 31, 1987, the victim\u2019s body was discovered on the floor of his bedroom, which was in disarray, with bloodstains in various locations throughout the room. The victim had been beaten, and had been strangled to death with a ligature.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">On August 5,1987, the police arrested Allen in connection with the murder and robbery. Allen gave several statements in which, although he denied involvement in the victim\u2019s death, he admitted being in the victim\u2019s condominium that day and stealing his video cassette recorder, his car, and other items. In his statements, Allen implicated the defendant in the murder of the victim. On the basis of this information, the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>secured an arrest warrant for the defendant and arrested him on the night of August 5, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress certain evidence that the Branford police had seized from an area under a highway bridge abutment where the defendant had been living at the time of his arrest. This claim, divided into two parts, is that: (1) under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the police violated his rights by invading his \u201chome\u201d under the bridge abutment without a warrant; and (2) the police violated those rights when, without a warrant, they seized his belongings, including a closed duffel bag and a closed cardboard box containing personal items, and searched them. We conclude that, on the facts presented here, the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his duffel bag and cardboard box. Accordingly, the warrantless search of his duffel bag and cardboard box by the police violated his fourth amendment rights and the evidence yielded by that search should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The evidence produced at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress disclosed the following facts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Shortly after midnight on the morning of August 6, 1987, while the defendant was in custody, Detective Anthony Morro of the Branford police department met the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Linda Spencer, at Friendly\u2019s Restaurant in West Haven, where she was employed. At Morro\u2019s request, Spencer told him that she would take him to the place where the defendant had been living at the time of the murder. Spencer directed Morro to a bridge abutment underneath the highway overpass by the State Street entrance ramp to route 1-91 in New Haven. The abutment was separated from the entrance ramp roadway by a steep embankment that was covered by crushed stone and heavy underbrush. The state department of transportation owns the property involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Morro climbed up the embankment and, using a flashlight to illuminate the area, saw several items, including a blanket used as a mattress, a rolled-up sleeping bag, a closed cardboard box, a suitcase, a small closed duffel bag, and paper trash bearing the Friendly\u2019s Restaurant insignia. The defendant, using the metal and cement beams of the highway support structure as shelves, had placed all of his belongings on the beams, with the exception of the duffel bag, the blanket, and the trash, which were left on the ground. Morro opened the duffel bag and found therein a paper bag containing a large quantity of quarters. He did not open the other items at that time. Morro then called the Bran-ford police department evidence officer to the scene. They photographed and tagged all of the items and brought them to the police department, where they were opened and \u201cinventoried\u201d by Sergeant William Carroll.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The cardboard box contained a size 38 belt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and the duffel bag contained approximately $700 in coins, mostly quarters, a pair of white pants stained with what was later determined to be blood, and several pieces of jewelry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The defendant asserted ownership of all the items taken by the police and their contents, except for the belt, which he claimed to have acquired when it had been left on a park bench by a woman with whom he had been drinking. Although the defendant had been living under the bridge abutment for about one month, he previously had been living in an apartment on Chapel Street in New Haven until the second or third week in June, 1987, when he moved out after an argument with his roommate. For approximately two weeks thereafter he lived beside a fence near the Trumbull Street entrance to 1-91. He left that location when another homeless man started camping nearby, and moved to the State Street abutment area. He was still living under the bridge when he was arrested on August 5, 1987. While he was living there he had no other home.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>During the one month period of time that the defendant lived there, he was the only person occupying that space. Although he would leave the area every day, he would secure his belongings so that they could not be seen from the bottom of the embankment because he was worried about theft. At night, he slept there behind a bush. The defendant knew that the area was state property and that there was no reason why someone else could not enter or live in the area where he was living. In fact, the defendant acknowledged that, while he was living there, a highway worker clearing brush came upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The trial court found that the defendant had manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the items seized, but, because of their location, that his expectation was not reasonable. It also found, moreover, that \u201cit would be reasonable to assume that someone could look at the items and assume that everything had been abandoned\u201d and that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the items because \u201c[t]hey were left there for anyone to observe and for anyone to open.\u201d The court accordingly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">At trial, several items found underneath the bridge abutment were presented to connect the defendant to the robbery and murder of the victim. The state introduced the white bloodstained pants and the size 38 belt into evidence. The pants linked the defendant directly to the death of the victim because Allen identified them as those worn by the defendant during the crimes. Evidence was also presented that the victim had a size 38 waist, thereby connecting the belt found in the defendant\u2019s cardboard box to the victim. The coins, the jewelry, the dagger and the bayonet; see footnote 7, supra; were introduced into evidence in order to link the defendant with a subsequent larceny from Charles C, another homosexual, who testified that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ant had stolen the items from him six days after the murder and robbery of the victim. The evidence regarding that larceny forms the basis of the defendant\u2019s third claim in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The defendant first makes the broad claim that the police violated his rights under the fourth amendment when, without a search warrant, they \u201cinvaded his home\u201d under the abutment and seized items found there. The defendant argues that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area where he was living that was protected from a warrantless search. Relying solely on his homelessness, he argues that he treated the space as his home, that he had exclusive possession since he was living there alone, and that he was no less entitled to privacy under the fourth amendment because he was homeless than are the more fortunate members of society.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The state responds that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area in question. It argues that the area in question was not protected by the fourth amendment because: (1) it was in effect an open field; (2) the defendant was not legitimately residing there, but was an interloper on public land; and (3) it was an area accessible to the public at large, and thus was by its nature \u201cincapable of sheltering a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>We need not decide in this case whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bridge abutment area. We assume for purposes of this decision that the state is correct that the defendant\u2019s broad claim of fourth amendment protection in the area involved must fail.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude, nonetheless, that the defendant\u2019s alternate, more narrow claim\u2014that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his duffel bag and cardboard box located there\u2014has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The application of the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures requires the defendant to establish that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded area. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>207 Conn. 323, 330, 541 A.2d 1209 (1988). \u201cAbsent such an expectation, the subsequent police action has no constitutional ramifications.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>198 Conn. 348, 355, 503 A.2d 566 (1986). The determination of whether such an expectation exists is to be made on a case by case basis; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 331; and requires a two-part inquiry: \u201cfirst, whether the individual has exhibited an actual subjective expectation of privacy, and second, whether that expectation is one society recognizes as reasonable.\u201d Id. Whether a defendant\u2019s actual expectation of privacy in a particular place is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable involves \u201ca fact-specific inquiry into all the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 356. Although \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places\u201d; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); the place searched is highly relevant to the fourth amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>analysis because \u201cexpectations of privacy in some places are afforded greater constitutional legitimacy than in others.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruckman, </em>806 F.2d 1471, 1473 (10th Cir. 1986) (determination of protection of fourth amendment requires, in given case, reference to place; defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in cave, located on public land, where he lived); see also <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S. Ct. 421, 58 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1978), reh. denied, 439 U.S. 1122, 99 S. Ct. 1035, 59 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1979) (capacity to claim protection of fourth amendment depends \u201cupon whether the person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place\u201d). Indeed, some places, such as the open fields, afford no legitimate expectation of privacy. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 176, 104 S. Ct. 1735, 80 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The determination that a particular place is protected under the fourth amendment requires that it be one \u201cin which society is prepared, because of its code of values and its notions of custom and civility, to give deference to a manifested expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taborda, </em>635 F.2d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1980). It must be \u201cone that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 361 (Harlan, J., concurring). Legitimate expectations of privacy derive from \u201cconcepts of real or personal property law or [from] understandings that are recognized and permitted by society. One of the main rights attaching to property is the right to exclude others, see W. Blackstone, Commentaries, Book 2, ch. 1, and one who owns or lawfully possesses or controls property will in all likelihood have a legitimate expectation of privacy by virtue of this right to exclude.\u201d <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 144 n.12. Of course, one need not have an \u201cuntrammeled power to admit and exclude\u201d in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>to claim the protection of the fourth amendment, so long as the place involved is one affording an expectation of privacy that society regards as reasonable. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 99-100, 110 S. Ct. 1684, 109 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1990) (overnight guest has reasonable expectation of privacy in host\u2019s home). Under some circumstances, the determination of whether an expectation of privacy is reasonable involves a balancing of interests. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 527, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in prison cell because society\u2019s interest in security of penal institutions outweighs prisoner\u2019s interest in privacy within his cell).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The courts have identified a number of factors indicating that a person\u2019s expectation of privacy in a particular place is one that society is not prepared to recognize as reasonable. Where the person occupying the property is a trespasser, ordinarily he has no reasonable expectation of privacy in that place. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruckman, </em>supra; <em>Amezquita </em>v. <em>Hernandez-Colon, </em>518 F.2d 8,11 (1st Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 916, 96 S. Ct. 1117, 47 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1976); see also <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 143-44 n.12 (wrongful presence on property gives rise to no reasonable expectation of privacy). Furthermore, leaving one\u2019s property in an area \u201creadily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public\u201d may render one\u2019s expectation of privacy less than reasonable. <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 40, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage bags, or their contents, left for collection outside curtilage of home). \u201cHence, \u2018[wjhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u2019 \u201d Id., 41, quoting <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 351. The rationale for this factor is that when a person leaves his property within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>reach of the public generally, it is pointless to exclude the police alone, for that \u201cwould impede effective law enforcement while adding little to the individual\u2019s interest in privacy.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Most, </em>876 F.2d 191, 198 (D.C. Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">We acknowledge, however, as stated by the dissent in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruckman, </em>supra, that factors such as whether the defendant was a trespasser and whether the place involved was public \u201care, of course, relevant as helpful guides, but should not be undertaken mechanistically. They are not ends in themselves; they merely aid in evaluating the ultimate question in all fourth amendment cases\u2014whether the defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy, in the eyes of our society, in the area searched.\u201d Id., 1476 (McKay, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">With these guidelines in mind, we turn, then, to the defendant\u2019s alternate claim, namely, that the police violated his fourth amendment rights when they searched his duffel bag and cardboard box at the scene and subsequently at the police station. The defendant relies principally on the well established propositions that, absent certain exceptions not applicable here, an individual, by placing his personal effects inside luggage or other appropriate closed containers,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> manifests an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>expectation of privacy that the contents will remain free from public inspection, and that police intrusion into such containers ordinarily requires a warrant. See <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>442 U.S. 753, 765, 99 S. Ct. 2586, 61 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 11, 97 S. Ct. 2476, 53 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1977). The defendant also argues that the trial court misapplied the doctrine of abandonment in ruling that the police were not required to obtain a warrant before searching his belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The state argues, however, that the defendant did not retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in his luggage that he left under the bridge abutment. It asserts that the trial court properly determined that he abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy in those goods by leaving them in a place accessible to the public, and that he \u201ccould not reasonably expect that his possessions would remain shielded from the curiosity of passersby or from the scrutiny of the police.\u201d The state also contends that, since the police would have been entitled to search the articles when they were found, their removal to the police station for a more thorough search was equally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">We conclude that, although this claim presents a close question, the defendant did have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his duffel bag and box that was violated by their warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">We first note that this narrow claim of the defendant, unlike his broad claim to a protected expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of privacy in the bridge abutment area, rests on an understanding that is generally recognized and permitted by society; <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 144 n.12; namely, the general understanding that the contents of luggage and other closed containers are entitled to remain private. We also note that, unlike the defendant\u2019s first claim, this claim does not rest solely on his homelessness. That is but one factor among several, the principal ones being the nature of the containers searched and the circumstances surrounding their search.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">This claim requires us to confront a tension in the reasonable expectation of privacy jurisprudence of the fourth amendment that is not easily resolved. That tension is between, on one hand, the deference ordinarily afforded to expectations of privacy in luggage and other appropriate closed containers and, on the other hand, the proposition that property left by persons in open fields or public places may not command fourth amendment protection. We conclude that, under the facts of this case, that tension must be resolved in favor of the deference afforded to closed containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">It is useful to note at the outset of this discussion the precise contours of what this claim does not involve, and what we do not decide with respect to it. We are not concerned with a claim of a reasonable expectation of privacy in any goods or effects of the defendant other than his duffel bag and his cardboard box, because only the search of those closed containers yielded evidence that was introduced against the defendant in this case. We are not concerned, moreover, with the legitimate expectation of privacy that a homeless person living out of doors has with respect to his goods and effects that he has with him or under his immediate control. Indeed, <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 179 n.10, makes clear that even one who enters an open field retains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the protection of the fourth amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures of such goods and effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We do not decide, moreover, whether the fourth amendment protects the goods and effects of all homeless persons, regardless of their particular circumstances. Those claims will have to await their assertion in light of their own factual contexts. Furthermore, we assume that the police were entitled to <em>seize </em>the defendant\u2019s duffel bag and cardboard box upon probable cause to believe that they contained evidence,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and to preserve them while a proper search warrant was secured. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 115, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>supra. We also do not decide under what circumstances the police may open a closed container that they come upon in a public place for purposes other than searching for evidence, such as preserving its safety or determining its ownership. See <em>Unites States </em>v. <em>Sumlin, </em>909 F.2d 1218 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 559, 112 L. Ed. 2d 566 (1990) (defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in stolen handbag not violated when police opened bag to determine its ownership).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">What this claim does involve, however, is whether the fourth amendment applies to the unique factual circumstances of this case, where the closed containers were found by the police in a secluded place that they knew the defendant regarded as his home,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>defendant\u2019s absence from that place at the time of the search was due to his arrest and custody by the police, and where the purpose of the search was to obtain evidence of the crimes for which he was in custody.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>We begin with an analysis of the so-called luggage or closed container cases. Traditionally, great deference has been afforded under the fourth amendment to the expectation of privacy in luggage or closed containers. By placing personal effects inside a piece of luggage, one \u201cmanifest[s] an expectation that the contents would remain free from public examination. No less than one who locks the doors of his home against intruders, one who safeguards his personal possessions in this manner is due the protection of the Fourth Amendment Warrant Clause.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>supra, 11. \u201cLuggage contents are not open to public view, except as a condition to a border entry or common carrier travel; nor is luggage subject to regular inspections and official scrutiny on a continuing basis .... [Ljuggage is intended as a repository of personal effects.\u201d Id., 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The <em>Chadwick </em>decision also made clear that it is the contents or interior of luggage or closed containers in which a reasonable expectation of privacy may inhere, not the visible exterior or location of the containers. \u201cRespondents\u2019 principal privacy interest in the footlocker was, of course, not in the container itself, which was exposed to public view, but in its contents. A search of the interior was therefore a far greater intrusion into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Fourth Amendment values than the impoundment of the footlocker. Though surely a substantial infringement of respondents\u2019 use and possession, the seizure did not diminish respondents\u2019 legitimate expectation that the footlocker\u2019s contents would remain private.\u201d Id., 13-14 n.8. In a different but closely related context the United States Supreme Court has stated: \u201cA container which can support a reasonable expectation of privacy may not be searched, even on probable cause, without a warrant. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. [793, 809-12, 102 S. Ct. 2157, 72 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1982)]; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>California, </em>453 U.S. [420, 426-27, 101 S. Ct. 2841, 69 L. Ed. 2d 744 (1981)] (plurality opinion); <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>442 U.S., at 764-765; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1 (1977).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra, 120 n.17 (package entrusted to possession of private carrier). \u201cLetters and other sealed packages are in the general class of effects in which the public at large has a legitimate expectation of privacy; warrantless searches of such effects are presumptively unreasonable. Even when government agents may lawfully seize such a package to prevent loss or destruction of suspected contraband, the Fourth Amendment requires that they obtain a warrant before examining the contents of such a package.\u201d Id., 114. Moreover, \u201c[t]he reasonableness of an official invasion of the citizen\u2019s privacy must be appraised on the basis of the facts as they existed at the time that invasion occurred.\u201d Id., 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">This case law leads us to conclude that, although the United States Supreme Court has not specifically articulated the principle as such, the fourth amendment focus on the place invaded, when applied to luggage or other appropriate closed containers, refers to their interior or contents. Thus, although the inquiry in determining whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy involves an inquiry into the particular place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>invaded, when the search is of a piece of luggage the principal \u201cplace\u201d for fourth amendment purposes is the interior of the luggage and its contents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The genesis of the closed container cases lies in <em>Ex Parte </em>Jackson, 96 U.S. 727, 24 L. Ed. 877 (1878), in which the United States Supreme Court held that sealed packages in the mail cannot be opened without a warrant. See <em>Walter </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U.S. 649, 653, 100 S. Ct. 2395, 65 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1980). The court reaffirmed <em>Jackson </em>in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Leeuwen, </em>397 U.S. 249, 90 S. Ct. 1029, 25 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1970). Then, in <em>Chadwick, </em>the court struck down a warrant-less search of a locked footlocker that was seized from an automobile contemporaneously with the arrest of the defendants, as they were in the process of loading the footlocker into their automobile. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>supra, 4. The court held that although the police may have been justified in seizing the footlocker upon probable cause to believe that it contained contraband, the defendants\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents rendered invalid the warrant-less search of it one hour later while it was in the exclusive control of the police. Id., 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Subsequently, in <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>supra, the court reaffirmed <em>Chadwick </em>and invalidated a warrant-less search of a suitcase that the defendant had placed in the trunk of the taxi in which he was the passenger. The court stated: \u201cWhere\u2014as in the present case\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the police, without endangering themselves or risking loss of the evidence, lawfully have detained one suspected of criminal activity and secured his suitcase, they should delay the search thereof until after judicial approval has been obtained.\u201d Id., 766. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>214 Conn. 57, 570 A.2d 193 (1990), this court held that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his backpack that was located in an apartment where he was temporarily residing, and that the consent of the lessee of the apartment to search the apartment could not vitiate that expectation. We held that it is not necessary \u201c \u2018that a person assertively clutch an object in order to retain the protection of the fourth amendment\u2019 id., 75, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>864 F.2d 843, 846 (D.C. Cir. 1989); and that the defendant had a justifiable expectation of privacy that his personal effects inside his backpack would remain private. <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Although the closed container cases in which a right of privacy had been found could be read broadly in conclusive support of the defendant\u2019s position in this case, and although they have on occasion been cited for the broad proposition that where \u201cthe automobile exception is inapplicable, police may not conduct a warrant-less search of any container that conceals its contents\u201d; <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 47 n.1 (Brennan and Marshall, Js., dissenting); a close reading of those cases indicates that they do not resolve the issues in this case. Rather, that line of cases involves situations where the owner or possessor of the container, at the time of his arrest, was carrying or was accompanied by the container; see, e.g., <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>supra (suitcase in trunk of defendant\u2019s taxi); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>supra (defendants loading footlocker in trunk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>car);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> where the owner or possessor had entrusted them to someone else for safekeeping or for a particular purpose; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra (private freight carrier); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Leeuwen, </em>supra (United States mail); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>853 F.2d 1479 (8th Cir. 1988) (locked suitcase held by airport bailee); or where the owner or possessor had left the container in a place where he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra (backpack located in apartment where defendant was temporarily residing).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Thus, the closed container cases do not compel a conclusion that the defendant in this case had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his duffel bag or cardboard box. These cases do not, however, preclude such a conclusion, because none involved the unique factual circumstances of this case. They strongly suggest, however, that the weighty interest in the expectation of privacy in the contents of luggage may be recognized by society under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">We turn, therefore, to a different line of authority, namely, those cases, often gathered under the fourth amendment rubric of \u201cabandonment,\u201d where luggage and other closed containers have been left by their owners or possessors in open fields or areas accessible to the public. Although we have, in a fourth amendment context, used the term \u201cabandonment\u201d in its common law sense of a voluntary and intentional renunciation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>of ownership; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 240, 456 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984); it is clear that the proper \u201ctest for abandonment in the search and seizure context is distinct from the property law notion of abandonment: it is possible for a person to retain a property interest in an item, but nonetheless to relinquish his or her reasonable expectation of privacy in the object.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The abandonment inquiry returns us, therefore, to the original threshold inquiry for fourth amendment purposes. \u201cWhether property has been \u2018abandoned,\u2019 in this sense, does not depend on where legal title rests, or whether one asserting a Fourth Amendment right has a legally enforceable possessory interest in the property; the question, rather, is whether the person claiming the protection of the Fourth Amendment \u2018has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place.\u2019 <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>[supra, 143].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oswald, </em>783 F.2d 663, 666 (6th Cir. 1986). \u201cIn essence, what is abandoned is not necessarily the defendant\u2019s property, but his reasonable expectation of privacy therein.\u201d <em>St. Paul </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>306 Minn. 337, 346, 237 N.W.2d 365 (1975); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Most, </em>supra, 198. Furthermore, although the fourth amendment notion of abandonment is not congruent with its common law counterpart, it is relevant although not necessary to the fourth amendment abandonment inquiry whether the defendant manifested by his conduct an intent to shed, albeit temporarily, his expectation of privacy in the item or container involved. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 845; see also <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 39-40 (intent to discard relevant to whether defendant had reasonable expectation of privacy in closed, opaque garbage bags).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Thus, when the trial court applied the abandonment doctrine by deciding that a reasonable person would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>have considered the defendant\u2019s property to have been abandoned, it employed an incomplete test. Although whether a reasonable person would view property to have been abandoned may be relevant to whether the owner or possessor had abandoned his expectation of privacy therein, that is not the end of the inquiry for fourth amendment purposes. The test is whether, under all the facts, the owner or possessor may fairly be deemed as a matter of law to have relinquished his expectation of privacy in the object in question, and, where the object is a piece of luggage, in the contents thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The abandonment cases tend to point in a direction favorable to the state\u2019s position. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, the defendant placed his gym bag in the hallway of an apartment building and began to walk down the stairway. The court held that the warrant-less search and seizure of the bag was valid because the defendant had \u201cleft it behind in a public place where he retained no reasonable expectation of privacy in it.\u201d Id., 846. The court also held that it was irrelevant that he intended to return for the bag. Id. Similarly, in <em>United States </em>v. Brown, 473 F.2d 952 (5th Cir. 1973), the defendant had buried a suitcase under a chicken coop on an abandoned farm. The court held that the warrantless search and seizure of the suitcase was valid because it came within the open fields doctrine, and because the defendant had voluntarily \u201c \u2018discarded, <em>left behind, </em>or otherwise relinquished his interest in the property in question so that he could no longer retain a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to it at the time of the search.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 954 n.5, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>474 F.2d 174, 176 (5th Cir. 1973); see also <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 39-40 (homeowner has no reasonable expectation of privacy in closed, opaque trash bags left for collection at curb outside curtilage of home); <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>v. <em>Oswald, </em>supra (defendant retained no reasonable expectation of privacy in luggage left in unlocked, burned-out car at side of highway).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Like the luggage cases, however, these cases do not compel the conclusion that the defendant in this case retained no reasonable expectation of privacy in his duffel bag and cardboard box. Like the luggage cases, these cases are distinguishable because none of them involved the search of luggage of a homeless defendant living in a secluded area that the police knew he regarded as his home, where the search took place shortly after the arrest of the defendant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, unlike this case, there is no indication in those cases that the defendant raised or the court considered the defendant\u2019s independent privacy interest in the interior of the closed containers. Finally, unlike most of the abandonment cases, there is in this case no element of conduct manifesting a temporary intent to relinquish an expectation of privacy in the contents of the luggage. Indeed, the defendant in this case intended to shield those contents from the gaze of others when he left them in the bridge abutment area during the day, and, of course, no contrary intent can be inferred from the fact that the police arrested him and thus prevented him from returning to his goods and effects that night. Thus, these cases do not require a rejection of the defendant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Neither <em>Oliver </em>nor <em>Greenwood, </em>moreover, controls this case. In <em>Oliver, </em>the court\u2019s textual fourth amendment rationale for the open fields doctrine was that \u201copen fields [are not] \u2018effects\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>supra, 176. By contrast, one\u2019s luggage is an \u201ceffect\u201d within the meaning of the fourth amendment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra, 114; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>supra, 12. In <em>Oliver, </em>furthermore, unlike this case, the court was concerned with marihuana growing openly in the field, and not the search of closed containers. Thus, the tension that we earlier articulated between the closed container cases and the open fields or abandoned property cases was not present in <em>Oliver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In <em>Greenwood, </em>the court relied not only on the fact that the garbage bags in question were available to members of the public but also on the fact that the defendants \u201cplaced their refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have sorted through the [defendants\u2019] trash or permitted others, such as the police, to do so.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 40. The court therefore concluded that the defendants \u201chad no reasonable expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items that they discarded.\u201d Id., 40-41. No such purpose to leave for collection by a third party or to discard in any sense is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We return, therefore, to first principles in order to resolve the question of whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his duffel bag and cardboard box at the time of the search. In considering whether an expectation of privacy in a particular place is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable, we ask whether it is one \u201cin which society is prepared, because of its code of values and its notions of custom and civility, to give deference to a manifested expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tahorda, </em>635 F.2d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1980). That is necessarily a fact-specific inquiry. In this regard, we again acknowledge that it is pertinent, but not determinative, that the location of the luggage involved was public land, and that the defendant was in effect a trespasser thereon. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>factors, although relevant and helpful, must not be applied mechanically. \u201cThey are not ends in themselves; they merely aid in evaluating the ultimate question in all fourth amendment cases\u2014whether the defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy, in the eyes of our society, in the area searched.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruckman, </em>supra, 1476 (McKay, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Applying these first principles to the facts of this case, we conclude that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his duffel bag and cardboard box. First, the \u201cplace\u201d searched in this case was the interior of his closed duffel bag and box. Our society has traditionally afforded a high degree of deference to expectations of privacy in closed containers because such an area is normally intended as a repository of personal effects. Second, these containers were located in a place that, as the police knew when they searched them, the defendant regarded as his home, and that he maintained as such, however roughly. Third, the defendant, because he was under arrest and in police custody, could not be at the place he regarded as his home when the search occurred, and thus was rendered unable to assert his fourth amendment rights in the luggage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Fourth, the purpose of the search was not to safeguard the luggage or identify its owner, but to gather evidence of the very crimes for which the defendant was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We believe that under these particular circumstances, society\u2019s code of values and its notions of custom and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>civility would cause it to recognize as reasonable the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in his duffel bag and cardboard box. The interior of those two items represented, in effect, the defendant\u2019s last shred of privacy from the prying eyes of outsiders, including the police. Our notions of custom and civility, and our code of values, would include some measure of respect for that shred of privacy, and would recognize its assertion as reasonable under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Furthermore, employing a balancing test\u2014-in this case, balancing society\u2019s interest in law enforcement against the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in his luggage\u2014we conclude that there would not be a significant impairment of the interest in law enforcement by the recognition of that significant privacy interest. Just as it was deemed necessary and reasonable for the police in <em>Chadwick </em>and <em>Sanders </em>to secure warrants before searching the luggage involved there, in order to preserve an individual\u2019s significant interest in the privacy of the contents of luggage, we perceive no significant impairment of society\u2019s interest in law enforcement by requiring the police in this case to have secured a warrant before searching the defendant\u2019s luggage, in order to preserve the same privacy interest. To conclude otherwise under the facts of this case would mean that this defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy against police intrusion was limited to the contents of only those closed containers that he had with him, and did not extend to those contents that he could not protect from invasion because he had been taken into custody. Such a result under the facts of this case would come dangerously close to bringing to fruition the famous ironic reference of Anatole France to \u201cthe majestic equality of the laws which forbid rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.\u201d A. France, The Red Lily (Stephens trans. 1925) p. 91. We decline so to hold, because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>do not believe that our code of values or our notions of civility are so cramped.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In sum, the defendant retained his reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his duffel bag and cardboard box. Absent the applicability of a legitimate exception to the warrant requirement, the warrantless search of those items was invalid, and the evidence yielded by that search should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The defendant next claims that both his statutory and his constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated by an eighteen month delay before trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">On August 5,1987, the defendant was arrested, and remained in custody thereafter. On September 23, 1987, the state filed its first of five informations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On October 5, 1987, the defendant filed his first motion for a speedy trial, which the trial court, <em>Ronan, J., </em>denied on December 29,1987. On March 30,1988, the defendant filed his second motion for a speedy trial, which the trial court, <em>Ronan, J., </em>granted, ordering that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the defendant be tried immediately upon the disposition of the trial of Mark Allen, an essential witness for the state.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">On May 17,1988, the defendant, claiming denial of his speedy trial rights, moved to dismiss the charges against him. On May 18,1988, Allen was convicted, and the state announced that it was ready to proceed with the trial of the defendant. At that time, however, the defendant was not prepared to begin the trial, and, on May 25,1988, he moved for a continuance, which was granted indefinitely, leaving a date for trial to be determined later at a pretrial conference. On May 26,1988, the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. On June 11,1988, the court assigned the case for trial on September 6, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The trial did not proceed on September 6, 1988, as scheduled, and, on September 14,1988, the defendant\u2019s attorney withdrew as counsel due to a conflict of interest. On October 7, 1988, the defendant moved for appointment of a special public defender, which the court granted on October 20, 1988. The trial of the defendant began on February 6, 1989, before Judge Purtill.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The defendant first asserts that his statutory right to a speedy trial, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> was violated. The defendant notes that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>was arrested on August 5, 1987, that he remained in custody thereafter, and that he made two motions for a speedy trial, but that his trial did not begin until February 6, 1989, eighteen months later, in violation of the statute which prohibits the delay of trial longer than eight months for persons incarcerated in state correctional institutions. Because the defendant\u2019s argument fails to consider periods of time properly excluded from the calculation, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m provides in pertinent part: \u201c(1) . . . when such defendant is incarcerated in a correctional institution of this state pending such trial . . . the trial of such defendant shall commence <em>within eight months </em>from the filing date of the information or indictment or from the date of arrest, whichever is later; and (2) if a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit set forth in subdivision (1) and a trial is not commenced within thirty days of a motion for a speedy trial made by the defendant at any time after such time limit has passed, the information or indictment shall be dismissed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In calculating the eight month period within which an incarcerated defendant must be tried, however, Practice Book \u00a7 956C (b) provides for the exclusion of \u201c[a]ny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>period of delay resulting from the absence or unavailability of the defendant, his counsel, or any essential witness for the prosecution or defense. For purposes of this paragraph, a defendant or any essential witness shall be considered unavailable whenever his whereabouts are known but his presence for trial cannot be obtained by due diligence or he resists appearing at or being returned for trial.\u201d Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 956C (g) provides that \u201c[t]he period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the judicial authority at the personal request of the defendant\u201d is excluded in calculating the eight month period. In sum, the state was required to try the defendant within eight months of the filing of the first information, excluding the time periods set forth by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The defendant\u2019s statutory claim is flawed first by his error in setting the date on which to begin the calculation of the statutory period. The eight month period does not begin to run until the \u201cfiling date of the information or indictment or from the date of arrest, whichever is later.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m. Because the defendant was arrested on August 5, 1987, which preceded the filing of the first information on September 23,1987, the latter date is used to calculate the time frame within which trial was required to begin. General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The defendant also fails to subtract from his delay calculation two periods of time that are excluded from the computation by the Practice Book rules that supplement the statute. First, any period of delay resulting from the absence of an essential witness is not included in determining whether the eight month time period has run. Practice Book \u00a7 956C (b). The trial court, in granting the defendant\u2019s second motion for a speedy trial, ordered that the defendant\u2019s trial commence upon the conclusion of Allen\u2019s trial. The defendant, while admitting that Allen was an essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>witness, nevertheless fails to deduct from his calculation the eight month period from September 23,1987, through May 18, 1988, when Allen was not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Second, the defendant asserts that the state should be held accountable for the remaining nine month delay between the conclusion of Allen\u2019s trial and the start of his trial because the state filed five different informations against the defendant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This claim, however, ignores Practice Book \u00a7 956C (g), which excludes from the calculation of the eight month period \u201c[t]he period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the judicial authority at the personal request of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It was the defendant who was not prepared to proceed after Allen\u2019s trial was completed, who requested a continuance, and who required new counsel, delaying the date upon which trial could begin. The state is not accountable for those periods of time when it was prepared to proceed to trial but was hindered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The defendant also claims that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated. See U.S. Const., amend. VI; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8. This claim likewise fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">The sixth amendment guarantee of a speedy trial is a fundamental right applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213, 223, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1967). This right is also guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8. \u201cAlthough the right to a speedy trial is fundamental, it is necessarily relative, since a requirement of unreasonable speed would have an adverse impact both on the accused and on society. <em>United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>Ewell, </em>383 U.S. 116, 120, 86 S. Ct. 773, 15 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 91, 384 A.2d 326 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>190 Conn. 541, 544, 461 A.2d 981 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States and this court have identified four factors which form the matrix of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy adjudication: [ljength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>185 Conn. 199, 208, 440 A.2d 867 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>180 Conn. 589, 591, 430 A.2d 1306 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 544-45. \u201c[NJone of the factors standing alone would demand a set disposition; rather it is the total mix which determines whether the defendant\u2019s right was violated.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>supra, 592. In light of our consideration of the four <em>Barker </em>factors, we conclude that the defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">There was an eighteen month time interval between the defendant\u2019s arrest and his trial. While the defendant blames the state for the whole of this delay, it was in fact caused by the initial trial of the defendant\u2019s accomplice, a continuance requested by the defendant, and the withdrawal of the defendant\u2019s counsel and appointment of new counsel. The state was prepared to proceed to trial immediately after Allen\u2019s trial was completed, within ten months from the arrest of the defendant. The defendant asserts, however, that the delay resulting from the requested continuance and the appointment of new. counsel should be attributed to the state because the state, by filing five different informations<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> against him, impeded the work of his attorney. The record does not support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The defendant was aware that Allen was being tried as an accomplice to the murder of the victim, and that Allen was to be the state\u2019s primary witness against him in his trial. While the first information against the defendant charged him with first degree manslaughter, the second<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and subsequent informations filed against the defendant were all based upon charges of felony murder, first degree burglary,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and first degree robbery, the identical charges of which Allen, the defendant\u2019s accomplice, was tried and convicted on May 18, 1988. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>216 Conn. 367, 579 A.2d 1066 (1990). In light of the defense counsel\u2019s awareness of Allen\u2019s trial as the defendant\u2019s accomplice, and her reported attendance at that trial and possession of the transcripts of that trial, we conclude that the changes made in the substitute informations filed seven months after the original information neither surprised defense counsel nor rendered her previous work ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The defendant\u2019s additional claim, namely, that the changes in the time of the crimes alleged rendered his attempts at providing alibi testimony futile, is insupportable. The time periods of the crime cited in the five informations range from \u201con or about\u201d July 29,1987, in the evening hours through \u201con or about\u201d July 30, 1987. This discrepancy in the informations \u201cdoes not present such a strong case for the defendant that he is excused from the requirement of showing prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. L\u2019Heureux, </em>166 Conn. 312, 320, 348 A.2d 578 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The discrepancies among the dates and times of the crimes alleged in the different informations were not substantial enough to prejudice the defendant\u2019s abil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ity to procure alibi testimony. The defendant does not claim that he would have produced additional or different witnesses depending on whether the date was July 29,1987, as opposed to July 30,1987. Because the filing of the substitute informations did not hamper the defendant\u2019s ability adequately to prepare his defense; id.; we conclude that the delays in the trial caused by the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance and for an appointment of new counsel cannot be attributed to the state. <em>See State v. Antrum, </em>185 Conn. 118, 122-23, 440 A.2d 839 (1981) (where state was prepared for trial and defendant requested continuances and requested new counsel, court tolled periods of time delay attributable to defendant); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. 302, 306, 106 S. Ct. 648, 88 L. Ed. 2d 640, reh. denied, 475 U.S. 1061, 106 S. Ct. 1289, 89 L. Ed. 2d 596 (1986) (time consumed by defendant pursuing interlocutory appeal not weighed in support of his speedy trial claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The second factor under the <em>Barker </em>matrix concerns the reasons for the delay of trial. As previously discussed, the first nine months of the eighteen month postponement was the result of the state\u2019s need to try an accomplice to the crime in order to secure the testimony of a necessary witness. While this delay cannot be attributed to the defendant, it will not be weighed heavily against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The third <em>Barker </em>factor is the assertion of the right to a speedy trial. On October 5, 1987, the defendant first moved for a speedy trial. The court denied this motion on December 29, 1987. He again moved for a speedy trial on March 30,1988. The court granted this motion on April 6,1988, and ordered the trial to commence upon the conclusion of Allen\u2019s trial. While it is apparent that the defendant initially strongly asserted his right, \u201c[t]he record indicates, however, that the defendant himself contributed substantially to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>delay.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 591-92, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986). Because the state was prepared to try the defendant at the end of Allen\u2019s trial on May 18, 1988, and because the defendant was responsible for the remaining nine months of delay, his early assertion of his right to a speedy trial is afforded little weight in the <em>Barker </em>balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The final factor is the prejudice to the defendant; <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, 532; which is \u201cthe linchpin of the speedy trial claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>185 Conn. 199, 209, 440 A.2d 867 (1981). \u201cWhile it is possible that the other factors together might make a showing of prejudice unnecessary in any given case; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>414 U.S. 25, 26, 94 S. Ct. 188, 38 L. Ed. 2d 183 (1973); we do not find that situation here. Nor where such a showing is needed will it be presumed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 526, 498 A.2d 76 (1985). \u201cThree interests have been identified as those which the right to a speedy trial was designed to protect and which therefore may be prejudiced by the deprivation of that right.\u201d Id. Those interests are: \u201c(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired. Of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\u201d <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, 532. The defendant argues that he suffered actual prejudice resulting from the impairment in the memories of several witnesses due to the delay between the alleged crime and the trial. A claim of general weakening of witnesses\u2019 memories, relying on the simple passage of time, \u201ccannot, without a more specific showing, be said to prejudice the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, 527-28. The defendant does, however, cite specific instances of witnesses\u2019 forgetfulness. We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>examine these instances to determine whether the defendant has made a sufficient showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The defendant initially claims that on cross-examination a state\u2019s witness, Charles C., could not remember numerous facts relating to a larceny allegedly committed against him by the defendant six days after the murder of the victim in this case. Specifically, the defendant claims that, due to the delay before trial, Charles C. could not recall: (1) the quantity or nature of the alcohol that he was consuming on the day of the alleged larceny; (2) the value of the coins allegedly stolen from him by the defendant; (3) what he told the police immediately after he discovered the items were missing; and (4) whether the defendant was carrying a shopping bag or any other type of container when Charles C. picked up the defendant at the park or when the defendant left his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that Charles C.\u2019s failing memory prejudiced him is misplaced. The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, 532, stated that \u201c[t]here is also prejudice if <em>defense witnesses </em>are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Charles C., however, appeared as a witness for the state, and, as we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, 528, \u201c \u2018[i]f the witnesses [with a failing memory] support the prosecution, <em>[the prosecu</em>tion\u2019s] <em>case </em>will be weakened, sometimes seriously so. And it is the prosecution which carries the burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u201c[WJhile memory lapses by <em>prosecution </em>witnesses may under some circumstances prejudice the defense, such as where memory loss is egregious and the defendant is \u2018convicted on failing memories\u2019 \u201d; (emphasis in original) <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Perrin, </em>659 F.2d 279, 284 (1st Cir. 1981); the memory losses here are relatively minor. The relevance of the witness\u2019 testimony regarding (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>quantity and nature of the alcohol consumed on the day of the alleged larceny, (2) the value of the coins taken from him, (3) the information that he gave the police after discovering the missing items, and (4) whether the defendant had been carrying a shopping bag on the day of the incident, is weakened by the fact that \u201c[tjhe defendant points to nothing in the transcripts which indicates that the testimony of [Charles C.j would have been more favorable to him if [his memory] had been fresher.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gasparro, </em>194 Conn. 96, 102, 480 A.2d 509 (1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 828, 106 S. Ct. 90, 88 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1985). Indeed, it is clear from this record that any memory loss by Charles C. resulting from the lapse of time inured to the defendant\u2019s favor, not to his prejudice, since the defendant was able to impeach Charles C.\u2019s testimony by eliciting that loss on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The defendant next contends that he was prejudiced by the failing memories of two defense witnesses, Gerald Lasalle and Linda Spencer, regarding an alleged mugging of the defendant that served to explain the presence of blood on the defendant\u2019s pants found in his belongings. The defendant claims that, as a result of the delay in trial, Lasalle was unable to recall the date when the defendant was mugged and its proximity to the murder, details of the mugging as reported by the defendant, or the amount of blood on the defendant\u2019s pants due to the mugging, and that Linda Spencer was not able to recall the date of the mugging.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The transcript reveals that Lasalle was able to state that the mugging occurred sometime in June, that it could have been late June, but that it was not in early July. Spencer testified that the mugging occurred sometime in June, or in late June, early July.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Although Lasalle and Spencer were unable to pinpoint the exact date of the mugging, the defendant has not demonstrated that the precise date was a material issue in his defense. \u201cAlthough faded memory may result in prejudice . . . in order to prejudice the defense to the extent necessary to constitute a speedy trial violation, the faded memory must substantially relate to a material fact in issue.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>577 F.2d 883, 889 (5th Cir. 1978). Clearly, the testimony of both Lasalle and Spencer tended to establish that the defendant had been mugged previous to the crimes in question and that the mugging had resulted in the defendant\u2019s white pants becoming bloodied. The defendant appears to contend that the unidentifiable blood<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> found on his pants, therefore, was his from the mugging and not that of the victim. Since the relevant issue behind this testimony was whether the blood belonged to the victim, the inability of the witnesses to recall the exact date of the mugging was not prejudicial.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The defendant next claims that the delay in trial caused Lasalle to forget the \u201cdetails\u201d of the mugging as reported to him by the defendant. Lasalle testified that the defendant told him that he had been mugged by two men and beaten with a stick in the Long Wharf section of New Haven. The only details that Lasalle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>could not remember, as demonstrated by the transcript, were whether the defendant had described to Lasalle the race of the assailants and, if he had, what that race was. Again, the defendant has made no showing as to the materiality of this evidence to the outcome of the trial, and, therefore, has not established substantial prejudice. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra, 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The defendant also argues that he was prejudiced by Lasalle\u2019s inability to recall the amount of blood found on the defendant\u2019s white pants as a result of the mugging. Although Lasalle testified that he knew of the pants in question, that he had seen the blood on them that came from a mugging, that he had observed the defendant wearing the pants on a number of occasions after the mugging incident, and that on those occasions the pants appeared to be clean and without spots, the witness was never asked to quantify the amount of blood he observed on the pants. The defendant has not, therefore, made a showing of substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted certain \u201cother misconduct\u201d evidence, namely, evidence of a larceny by the defendant from Charles C.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The relevant facts are as follows. At trial, the state called Charles C., a male homosexual, who testified that six days after the crimes charged herein he was the victim of a larceny by the defendant. Charles C. testified that, looking for sex, he \u201cpicked up\u201d the defendant in a park. The two men returned to Charles C.\u2019s apartment, where the defendant took a shower and then flirted with Charles C. Prior to engaging in sexual relations, Charles C. went to the liquor store to pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>chase alcohol for the two men. On returning to his apartment, he found the defendant dressed and agitated, anxious to leave the apartment and to be taken to New Haven. After driving the defendant to his desired destination, Charles C. returned to his apartment and discovered that $600 to $800 in change, a bayonet, jewelry, and a Nazi-type dagger were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The trial court admitted this testimony as evidence corroborative of the state\u2019s main witness, Mark Allen, whose testimony had been severely impeached by defense counsel on cross-examination, and as evidence of a system of criminal activity and of the defendant\u2019s intent in stealing from homosexuals. The defendant objected to the admission of the evidence and excepted to the trial court\u2019s ruling. In its instructions to the jury, the court gave an appropriate limiting instruction regarding this evidence.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u201cThe rules governing the admissibility of evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior [or subsequent] misconduct are well established.\" <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>213 Conn. 422, 428, 568 A.2d 457 (1990). Although as a general rule such evidence is inadmissible as proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime charged based on his propensity to commit crimes, it is admissible for many other purposes, such as proof of intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity, or an element of the crime. Id., 428-29. Such evidence may also be used \u201cto corroborate crucial prosecution testimony.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>825 F.2d 658, 660 (2d Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>To be admitted under one of these exceptions, the evidence must be relevant and material to the exception claimed, and the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra. \u201cWe recognize that this balancing process is an inherently difficult one, and will reverse the trial court\u2019s decision only when it is manifest that an abuse of discretion or an injustice has occurred.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>215 Conn. 716, 738, 579 A.2d 9 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">With these general principles in mind, we first consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence concerning the subsequent larceny as corroborative of the state\u2019s main witness, Allen. We conclude that the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The defendant severely impeached Allen, the only witness who placed the defendant at the scene of the crime. On cross-examination, the defendant brought out that Allen had lied in his statements to the police and at his own trial. The defendant also demonstrated many instances of inconsistent testimony at the probable cause hearing and during the course of his testimony at the trial. By this impeachment, the defendant was able to imply that Allen was implicating the defendant in order to shift the blame onto him, and in hopes of obtaining a more lenient sentence for his own conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Although this court has never directly addressed the issue of the admissibility of evidence of other misconduct of a criminal defendant to corroborate the testimony of a crucial prosecution witness, we touched upon that question in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>198 Conn. 147, 157, 502 A.2d 874 (1985). In <em>Smith, </em>we held that the trial court properly admitted the evidence of a subsequent arrest of the defendant for a breach of the peace that occurred within hours after the rape for which the defendant was on trial, because the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>arrested while in the possession of a knife and a gun that the victim of the first crime had identified. Id. We held that the evidence derived from the arrest for the subsequent breach of the peace \u201cwas certainly corroborative of the victim\u2019s testimony at trial\u201d and \u201cwas also relevant to establish the identity of the defendant.\u201d Id. While <em>Smith </em>demonstrates the acceptance of corroboration as a theory to admit evidence of other misconduct, we have yet to establish the scope and permissible use of such corroborative evidence as an independent exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We find guidance in the approach taken by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on this issue. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>supra, 660, the court determined that pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404 (b),<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which is similar to Connecticut case law on the admission of other misconduct evidence,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u201cevidence of \u2018other crimes\u2019 has been consistently held admissible to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mohel, </em>604 F.2d 748, 754 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>580 F.2d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>577 F.2d 188, 192 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 868, 99 S. Ct. 196, 58 L. Ed. 2d 179 (1978).\u201d The court noted, however, that \u201cthe prosecution is not permitted to wholesale proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>into evidence under the guise of \u2018corroboration purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>supra. \u201cTo avoid potential prosecutorial abuse, we have required the proponent of the evidence to demonstrate a close relationship between the proffered evidence and the evidence to be corroborated. Other crimes evidence, therefore, is only admissible for corroborative purposes, if the corroboration is \u2018direct and the matter corroborated is significant.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mohel, </em>supra, 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Under this test, significant evidence is defined as important, as opposed to trivial, evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>supra. Direct corroborating evidence is that which \u201cis not wholly disconnected, remote, or collateral to the matter corroborated.\u201d Id. The requirement that the corroborating evidence be direct is necessary in order to ensure that the link between the corroborative evidence and the facts to be inferred therefrom is not too attenuated or nonprobative; otherwise, the evidence might unfairly reflect upon the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit crimes. Id., 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Charles C.\u2019s testimony qualified as significant because Allen was the only witness placing the defendant at the scene of the crime. Because Allen\u2019s testimony was weakened as a result of cross-examination, which brought out his prior inconsistent and untruthful statements, the state offered Charles C.\u2019s testimony to the subsequent larceny in order to strengthen Allen\u2019s testimony regarding the manner and reason the defendant perpetrated the crimes. This evidence provided important details of a course of conduct of the defendant, and reinforced the testimony of a critical state\u2019s witness. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Charles C.\u2019s testimony likewise satisfied the requirement that the corroborating evidence be direct. Charles C.\u2019s testimony was not \u201cwholly disconnected, remote, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>or collateral to the matter corroborated\u201d; id., 660; because the testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s meretricious relationships with homosexuals reinforced Allen\u2019s testimony that the defendant brought him to the victim\u2019s residence with the intent to steal from the victim, thereby linking the defendant to the ultimate facts to be proven, namely, his presence and participation in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Moreover, the record reflects that the trial court carefully balanced the probative value of the evidence against the prejudicial effect and determined that the prejudice to the defendant did not outweigh its probative value. The evidence of the subsequent larceny was probative because it tended to dispel an innocent explanation for the defendant\u2019s relationship with the victim and to show that the defendant had a system of \u201chustling\u201d homosexual males in order to engage in larcenous conduct. The evidence also tended to establish that, on at least one occasion very close in time to the crimes in issue, the defendant had been picked up by another homosexual man, returned to his apartment, showered and engaged in flirtatious conduct, and eventually stole items belonging to him. Larceny was an element of the crimes in issue in this case. This evidence thereby tended to show a system of criminal activity and allowed the inference that the defendant intended, at the least, to steal from the victim on the occasion in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">We cannot say, moreover, that the prejudicial effect of the evidence was overwhelming. There was other evidence before the jury that the defendant had engaged in sex with homosexuals for money.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It is not likely, therefore, that the evidence in question shocked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>or inflamed the jury. Additionally, the seriousness of the subsequent crime, a larceny, pales in comparison to the robbery and felony murder charges for which the defendant was standing trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Because we recognize the difficulty in this balancing process, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only where there is abuse of discretion or where an injustice has occurred; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 738; and we will indulge in every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 435. There was no such abuse of discretion or injustice in this case, especially in light of the limiting instruction given to the jury on this issue. See footnote 31, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">This conclusion also disposes in large part of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence under the exceptions for evidence of a system of criminal activity and for evidence showing intent. The evidence tended to establish the defendant\u2019s intent and also tended to establish his system of stealing from homosexual men whom he visited for the purpose of engaging in sex for pay. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in exercising its balancing function and it gave an appropriate limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The defendant argues, however, that the evidence was improperly admitted because the state failed to demonstrate sufficient similarities between the alleged larceny of Charles C. and the crimes in question. The defendant claims that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he [other crimes or misconduct] must be <em>so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u201d </em>McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 157.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 677, 469 A.2d 760 (1983), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 354, 446 A.2d 382 (1982). The defendant\u2019s argument, however, is based upon a misinterpretation of the case law. As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>195 Conn. 128, 135, 486 A.2d 637 (1985), where <em>identity </em>is in issue, the device used must be distinctive, similar to a signature. But where the evidence is admitted under a different theory, such as to establish a continuing system of criminal activity or to show intent, the same degree of similarity is not required.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court, by denying him access to certain mental health records of Charles C., denied him his constitutional rights to due process and to confront the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The defendant subpoenaed certain records regarding treatment of Charles C. at the Connecticut Mental Health Center (the center), and requested access to them for purposes of cross-examination. Charles C. gave the trial court permission to examine the records in camera. The trial court did so and denied the defendant\u2019s request for access to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The defendant\u2019s subsequent cross-examination of Charles C. elicited the following facts, inter alia. Charles C., who was forty-seven years old, had been an alcoholic since age eighteen, and had been treated for his alcoholism. He had been under psychiatric care at various times, including a hospitalization in the 1970s. The cross-examination also disclosed that in 1987 Charles C. had been treated at the center for alcoholism and depression. Furthermore, his alcoholism was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>active in 1987, and on the day of his encounter with the defendant he had drunk a half pint of liquor before meeting the defendant and a pint after the encounter ended. Charles C. also testified that he blacked out after drinking the pint of liquor. In addition, the defendant cross-examined Charles C. about certain inconsistencies between his testimony and his statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The defendant does not dispute that the records in question are privileged pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-146d and 52-146e.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In reconciling such a privilege with the defendant\u2019s right to confront a state\u2019s witness by gaining access to the witness\u2019 mental health records, the linchpin is whether the records contain material \u201c \u2018 \u201cespecially probative of the ability to \u2018comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lindstrom, </em>698 F.2d 1154, 1165-66 (11th Cir. 1983); so as to justify breach of their confidentiality and disclosing them to the defendant in order to protect his right of confrontation. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 379-80, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 459, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). The determination of access is left to the discretion of the trial court in weighing the probative value of the evidence against the interest in confidentiality of the records. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 380. That determination is to be made on a case-by-case basis. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Our own careful examination of the records in question leads us to conclude that they do not contain material especially probative of Charles C.\u2019s ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>to justify breach of their confidentiality by disclosing them to the defendant. Moreover, there is nothing in them that would have added significantly to the extensive cross-examination of Charles C. by the defendant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request for access to the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

The trial court so concluded, and the state does not seriously contend otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> The cases referring to those closed containers protected by the fourth amendment clearly indicate that both the duffel bag and the cardboard box in this case qualify for such protection. In <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>California, </em>453 U.S. 420, 426-27, 101 S. Ct. 2841, 69 L. Ed. 2d 744 (1981), a plurality of the court stated that \u201c[o]nee placed within a [closed, opaque] container, a diary and a dishpan are equally protected by the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and that \u201cno court, no constable, no citizen, can sensibly be asked to distinguish the relative \u2018privacy interests\u2019 in a closed suitcase, briefcase, portfolio, duffel bag, or box.\u201d The fourth amendment does not distinguish between such containers, because \u201c[w]hat one person may put into a suitcase, another may put into a paper bag.\u201d Id., 426. The only exceptions to this were, in the plurality\u2019s view, those containers that could not support a reasonable expectation of privacy because their contents could be inferred from their outward appearance, or because the container was transparent \u201cor other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>wise clearly revealed its contents.\u201d Id., 427. Thereafter, a majority of the court explicitly rejected \u201ca constitutional distinction between \u2018worthy\u2019 and \u2018unworthy\u2019 containers\u201d because \u201cthe central purpose of the Fourth Amendment forecloses such a distinction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 822, 102 S.

Similarly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>same facts inform the issue of whether such luggage may fairly be regarded as \u201cabandoned\u201d for purposes of the fourth amendment.

Ed. 2d 739 (1987); teach that under some circumstances the purpose of a search is relevant to the degree of protection afforded by the fourth amendment. More specifically, the balancing test employed in the jail cell case; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 527, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984); teaches that under appropriate circumstances the purpose of a search is relevant to the question of whether a defendant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy is reasonable under the fourth amendment. See also <em>Amezquita </em>v. <em>Hernandez-Colon, </em>518 F.2d 8, 12 n.7 (1st Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 916, 96 S. Ct. 1117, 47 L.

Thus, the purpose of the police invasion may shape the determination of the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">We disagree with the dissent\u2019s suggestion that <em>California </em>v. <em>Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 106 S.

Ed. 2d 1150 (1978), have completely foreclosed any inquiry into the purpose of a search in determining whether a defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in luggage is reasonable. In <em>Ciraolo, </em>the court held that, in determining whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the marijuana growing in his fenced-in back yard, it was irrelevant that the police who flew over his yard and observed the contraband did so for criminal investigative purposes rather than as part of a routine patrol. <em>California </em>v. <em>Ciraolo, </em>supra, 213-14. The court did not decide, however, that, had the defendant\u2019s closed backpack also been observed in the yard from the police airplane, the police would have been likewise entitled to seize and search it\u2014a question more analogous to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">In <em>Scott, </em>the court did hold that, in determining the reasonableness of a search under the fourth amendment, the officer\u2019s actions must be viewed objectively. That case did not involve, however, the issue in this case, namely, whether the defendant retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>interior of his luggage. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 137-38. We believe that the inventory and jail cell search cases noted above, where the purpose of the search <em>was </em>considered, have limited to some extent the sweep of <em>Scott. </em>See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sumlin, </em>909 F.2d 1220 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S.

Ed. 2d 576 (1967); the place searched is relevant for fourth amendment purposes. Thus, even closed containers, like the trash bags involved in <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988), may not carry a reasonable expectation of privacy when placed outside the curtilage for collection.

As the majority opinion clearly demonstrates, a common thread that unifies the intricate and often confusing legal patchwork of fourth amendment case law is that \u201c[wjhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 40-41, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L.

Ed. 2d 55 (1983) (warrantless use of monitoring \u201cbeeper\u201d to trace movement of container of chemicals did not violate any legitimate expectation of privacy because movement over public roads can be viewed by anyone).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">It is clear that the area under the bridge abutment was one \u201creadily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 40. In fact, every person present in the state of Connecticut had, with or without a legitimate reason, as much right to be there as did the defendant. In addition to the highway worker who actually came upon the defendant, other persons who might have explored this area include bridge inspectors, police officers, other homeless persons and people seeking out the homeless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s status as a trespasser on state property is also a significant factor leading to the conclusion that he could not have had a reasonable expectation of privacy in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>area. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruckman, </em>806 F.2d 1471 (10th Cir. 1986) (defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a natural cave on federal land despite his having lived in the cave for eight months); <em>Amezquita </em>v. <em>Hernandez-Colon, </em>518 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 916, 96 S. Ct. 1117, 47 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1976) (squatters on public land had no reasonable expectation of privacy in area they occupied). I would conclude that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area under the bridge abutment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s asserted privacy interest in the duffel bag and the cardboard box, I find the majority\u2019s decision well intentioned but irreconcilable with existing fourth amendment doctrine. As the abandonment cases cited by the majority indicate, the threshold issue of whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area under the abutment is closely linked to the question of whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the duffel bag and box when he left those containers there. Unlike the majority, I cannot divorce the analysis of the container issue from my conclusion on that threshold issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">As noted above, the common theme underlying the abandonment cases cited by the majority is that it is unlikely that a person can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a closed container left unattended in a place that is readily accessible to members of the public. See <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra (garbage bags left at curb);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>864 F.2d 843 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>(D.C. Cir. 1989) (gym bag left in public hallway of apartment building); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oswald, </em>783 F.2d 663 (6th Cir. 1986) (suitcase left in burned-out automobile on side of highway); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>473 F.2d 952 (5th Cir. 1973) (suitcase buried under chicken coop on abandoned farm); <em>St. Paul </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>306 Minn. 337, 237 N.W.2d 365 (1975) (eyeglass case hidden under a counter in a dry cleaning establishment). My conclusion that the defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the area under the abutment leads me to conclude that he also could not have reasonably expected that the contents of his containers would remain inviolate if left there unattended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I therefore agree with the trial court that the defendant had abandoned these containers for the purposes of fourth amendment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">To avoid this result, the majority relies on three factors to distinguish the present case from the abandonment cases: (1) none of the abandonment cases involve the search of a container left by a homeless person in a place that the police knew he regarded as his home; (2) none of those courts considered the defendant\u2019s independent privacy interest in the interior of the closed containers; and (3) in <em>most </em>of the abandonment cases the owner of the container manifested an intent to relin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>quish temporarily an expectation of privacy in the contents of the container. I do not find these factors persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The fact that the police knew that the defendant was homeless and that he considered the area they searched to be his home is not relevant to the determination of whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the containers. The upshot of the majority\u2019s reliance on this fact is that a homeless person who leaves his belongings in containers under an abutment receives greater protection under the fourth amendment than would a person who had a home but who placed articles there for other reasons. Though the intent of the majority in providing heightened fourth amendment protection for the homeless because of their unfortunate circumstances may be admirable, I find no support in the existing case law for the addition of a \u201ccircumstances of the searched\u201d prong to the analysis of whether an expectation of privacy is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The majority relies on two other factual considerations in its application of \u201cfirst principles\u201d to the container issue. The majority places great emphasis on the fact that the purpose of the search was to obtain evidence of a crime. In <em>California </em>v. <em>Ciraolo, </em>supra, 213, however, the United States Supreme Court expressly rejected the defendant\u2019s analogous claim that the purpose of the police in conducting aerial surveillance of his backyard was relevant to the issue of whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy that protected him from such surveillance. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S. Ct. 2778, 86 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1985) (existence of fourth amendment seizure does not turn on subjective intent of police); cf. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 137-38, 98 S. Ct. 1717, 56 L. Ed. 2d 168, reh. denied, 438 U.S. 908, 98 S. Ct. 3127, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1150 (1978) (police motive irrelevant in determination of whether a search or seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>is reasonable because an objective standard is employed). In addition, although the issue of police motive was not discussed in <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, it would seem that if the court were inclined to be concerned about the motive of the police, it would certainly have expressed some reservations in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In support of its assertion that the motive of the police is relevant in determining whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the containers, the majority relies on <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984) (prisoner has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his cell), and the \u201cinventory search\u201d cases. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>495 U.S. 1, 110 S. Ct. 1632, 109 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1990) (search of locked suitcase found in trunk of car impounded when driver arrested for driving under the influence); <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 107 S. Ct. 738, 93 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1987) (search of a backpack found in impounded van). These cases, however, are inapposite. In the inventory search cases, the court has carved out an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Bertine, </em>supra, 371. The police conduct in those cases clearly constituted a search under the fourth amendment, and therefore the issue was not whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy (i.e., was it a search for fourth amendment purposes), but rather whether the search was reasonable within the meaning of the fourth amendment even though it was conducted without a warrant. In contrast, the issue in the present case is whether the inspection of the contents of the duffle bag and box was a search subject to the limitations of the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, 525-30, the court concluded that a search of a prison cell is not a search under the fourth amendment, but it reached that conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>not because the prisoner himself had left his personal effects generally open to the inspection of everyone, but rather because the policy of maintaining order in prisons mandates that a cell be subject to random inspections. The majority cites no cases in which courts have deemed police motive relevant to the question of whether police conduct constitutes a search when a privacy interest has been asserted in an area that is readily accessible to members of the public or in a container left in such an area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the circumstances of this case, I would reject the attempt to employ a <em>subjective </em>test focused on police motive in the analysis of whether the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy was <em>objectively </em>reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The majority also expresses concern that the defendant\u2019s arrest rendered him unable to assert his fourth amendment rights in the containers. I first note that there is no indication in the record either that the arrest of the defendant was made without probable cause or that it was a pretextual arrest motivated solely by a desire to effect a search of the abutment area. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s concern about the possibility of a pretextual arrest suffers from the same liability as its reliance on the investigatory purpose of the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>of the police, namely, that police motive is irrelevant to the question of whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the cardboard box and duffel bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The typical pretextual arrest scenario involves a police officer who arrests a person for crime A hoping to discover evidence of crime B during the course of a search incident to the arrest or an inventory search. See W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 1.4 (e), pp. 92-93, and cases cited therein. The pretextual arrest cases, however, are simply inapposite if opening the duffel bag and cardboard box did not, in the first place, constitute a search under the fourth amendment. Pretextual arrest doctrine addresses the issue of whether police conduct constituting a search violated the \u201creasonable search\u201d provisions of the fourth amendment, not whether the police conduct in question was a search to which the fourth amendment applies. See id. Therefore, by invoking a concern about pretextual arrests, the majority leapfrogs the very issue it purports to address, i.e., whether the fourth amendment applies to this case at all.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">I find the majority\u2019s reliance on the defendant\u2019s privacy interest in the <em>interior </em>of the containers singularly puzzling. The majority states that in none of the abandonment cases did the courts consider the defendant\u2019s independent privacy interest in the interior of the containers. It appears that the majority is presuming that because the analysis in the abandonment cases focused on whether the owner of the container had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area where the container was left, that those courts therefore ignored the privacy interest in the contents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of the containers. It seems axiomatic that the privacy-interest in the interior of the containers is precisely what those cases, or any container case for that matter, are all about. The emphasis placed on the area where the containers were located does not mean that those courts did not consider the privacy interest in the containers\u2019 contents; rather, the location of the containers was important because it played a major role in determining whether the containers were likely to be disturbed by members of the public, and therefore whether the asserted privacy interest in the contents of the containers was objectively reasonable. See <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 40-41; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 845-46 n.5; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oswald, </em>supra, 667; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 954; <em>St. Paul </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>supra, 346; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 822-23, 102 S. Ct. 2157, 72 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1982) (degree of protection provided to containers by fourth amendment \u201cvaries in different settings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The third factor cited by the majority in distinguishing the abandonment cases is the existence in most of those cases of conduct indicating an intent to relinquish temporarily an expectation of privacy in the container. While it is certainly true that the existence of such conduct by the owner of the container makes it less likely that a court would deem any subjective expectation of privacy reasonable, the majority acknowledges that this conduct is simply a relevant factor, rather than a necessary condition for concluding that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy. I also note that in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra (suitcase buried under chicken coop), and in <em>St. Paul </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>supra (eyeglass case hidden under counter in dry cleaning establishment), the conduct, of the owners of the containers demonstrated no such intent. <em>Brown </em>and <em>Vaughn </em>demonstrate that the mere act of \u201chiding\u201d a container in an area readily accessible to the public is insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>to support a claim that the owner had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The predominant factor in determining whether the defendant relinquished a privacy interest in the duffel bag and cardboard box is whether, in light of the nature of the abutment area where these containers were left, a reasonable person would have expected that their contents would be safe from \u201canimals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>supra, 40.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This objective inquiry is not dependent on whether one might find it offensive that the defendant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy was violated; rather, it must solely reflect a realistic assessment of the likelihood that his privacy interest might be invaded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">I believe that the majority has allowed the current publicity and concern for the plight of the homeless to create an empathy that in turn has created bad fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>amendment law. I would conclude that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the duffel bag and cardboard box and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> The homeless may be sought out by persons wishing to provide them with aid or shelter. In addition, the Hartford Courant recently featured a story on an anthropology student who investigates the makeshift living arrangements and belongings of the homeless in Hartford.

App. 1988) (defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in backpack attached to bicycle and left unattended for ten minutes in a parking lot near a group of persons, one of whom knew the defendant). Implicit in the trial court\u2019s ruling on the issue of abandonment here, however, is the conclusion that this is not such a case, and we must accord deference to the factual aspects of that determination. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>864 F.2d 843, 846 (D.C.
