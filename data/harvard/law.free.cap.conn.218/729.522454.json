J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">This administrative appeal, by way of reservation, concerns the continued eligibility of a retired state employee to receive his state pension after his appointment as a per diem Superior Court magistrate. The plaintiff, Ralph G. Murphy, filed a petition for a declaratory ruling with the defendant, the state employees retirement commission (commission), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>order to clarify his eligibility to continue to receive retirement benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 5-162.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The commission ruled that the plaintiff had reentered state employment by accepting the appointment as a magistrate, and that his pension would therefore be suspended, under General Statutes \u00a7 5-164a (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>worked as a magistrate for more than ninety days during any calendar year. In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-183,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff appealed the commission\u2019s ruling to the trial court, which granted the parties\u2019 joint motion for reservation of a question of law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal here in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023. Contrary to the ruling of the commission, we answer the reserved question \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The record establishes that the plaintiff began to receive retirement benefits as a member of the state employees retirement system after his retirement as an assistant attorney general on March 1, 1986. He became a Superior Court magistrate<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>on September 1, 1987, as the result of an appointment by the chief court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>administrator, which appointment has since been renewed annually. Magistrates serve the judicial department upon departmental determination of the need for their services, which may exceed ninety days per annum, and are compensated per diem on a basis other than the submission of a payroll to the comptroller. The plaintiff has not made retirement contributions with respect to the fees he has earned as a magistrate. In the state comptroller\u2019s filings with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year 1987, the plaintiff\u2019s retirement benefits were reported on Form W-2P, while his magistrate\u2019s income was reported on Form 1099 Misc. as nonemployee compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s continued eligibility for retirement benefits turns on the statutory provisions governing the state employees retirement system. The determinative statutory language is contained in General Statutes \u00a7 5-164a (c), which provides that \u201c[n]o member . . . reentering state service shall receive a retirement income during his reemployment . . . except (1) if his services as an employee are rendered for not more than ninety working days in any one calendar year . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The commission ruled that the plaintiff had reentered state service by accepting appointment as a magistrate. The administrative hearing focused primarily on the question of whether a magistrate was an \u201cemployee\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 5-164a (c). On this issue, which the commission considered a mixed question of fact and law, it rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he was an independent contractor and concluded instead that he was an employee. The commission noticed, but did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>not consider in depth, the light that the statutory definition of \u201cstate service\u201d might shed on the plaintiffs pension eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In the plaintiffs appeal to the Superior Court, the plaintiff challenged not only the administrative determination that his service as a magistrate made him an employee but also the underlying administrative assumption that his judicial employment was \u201cstate service\u201d for which a salary is paid. Both of these contentions have been renewed in the appeal in this court. We agree with the plaintiffs second contention, that his appointment was not a \u201creentry\u201d into state service as that term is statutorily defined in the State Employees Retirement Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-152 through 5-192x; and therefore need not consider his first contention. Under the governing statutes, the plaintiff is entitled to continue to receive pension payments because he is not, at the present, in \u201cstate service\u201d for the reason that he is not now receiving a \u201csalary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Our determination of whether the plaintiff\u2019s employment as a state magistrate constitutes \u201creentering state service\u201d in \u00a7 5-164a (c) must be informed by the definitions for the State Employees Retirement Act that are set out in General Statutes \u00a7 5-154. Subsection (m) of \u00a7 5-154 defines the term \u201cstate service\u201d as \u201cservice with the state, either appointive or elective, for which a <em>salary </em>is paid.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subsection (h) of \u00a7 5-154<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in turn defines the term \u201csalary\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>as \u201c(1) any payment . . . for state service made from a payroll submitted to the comptroller . . . and (3) fees received from the state in whole or in part in lieu of or in addition to item (1) above and established to the satisfaction of the retirement commission, to the extent that the employee has made retirement contributions on such fees . . . .\u201d For a person not on a state payroll, and not otherwise receiving a \u201csalary,\u201d subsection (h) (3) establishes the <em>making </em>of retirement contributions as the basis for determining whether the receipt of per diem fees is to be characterized as \u201csalary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The plain language of these definitional provisions supports the plaintiff\u2019s continued eligibility to draw his retirement benefits regardless of his service as a magistrate for more than ninety days in any calendar year. The plaintiff\u2019s per diem fees concededly are not paid from a \u201cpayroll submitted to the comptroller.\u201d It is also the fact that the plaintiff has not \u201cmade retirement contributions on such fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The commission maintains, however, that the plaintiff had the right to elect to make retirement contributions under \u00a7 5-164a (a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the existence of this option qualifies the fees received by the plaintiff as \u201csalary.\u201d We disagree. We reject the commission\u2019s premise that a state employee\u2019s elective right to make retirement contributions is the statutory equivalent of the employee\u2019s having made retirement contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The legislature might well have defined \u201csalary\u201d in \u00a7 5-154 (h) (3) to include fees with respect to which the employee \u201chas made or was entitled to make retirement contributions.\u201d To date, it has not done so. The legislature has determined instead to include fees within \u201csalary\u201d only when the employee has in fact made such retirement contributions. As the plaintiff suggests, the legislature\u2019s choice may reflect its awareness of the fact that the calculation of retirement income, under \u00a7 5-162, depends in large part upon a state employee\u2019s three highest paid years of state service. To the limited extent that case law preceding the current act has relevance, it supports the legitimacy of a legislative distinction, for retirement income purposes, between the receipt of a \u201csalary\u201d for \u201cservice with the state\u201d and the receipt of fees for more irregular, part-time governmental services. <em>State ex rel. Hyde </em>v. <em>Dowe, </em>129 Conn. 266, 271, 28 A.2d 12 (1942). Whatever the reasons for the legislature\u2019s decision, it had plenary authority to exercise its policy choice about continued eligibility for state retirement benefits. Cf. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 681-82, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991). We have no warrant to override that choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">To the reserved question: \u201cDoes the appointment of a retired state employee, receiving benefits from the State Employees Retirement System pursuant to Chap. 66 of the Conn. Gen. Stat., as a Superior Court Magistrate pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 51-193\u00cd constitute reentering state service, as defined in Conn. Gen.
