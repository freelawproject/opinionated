The ZBA determined that the plaintiffs did not have the authority to operate a used car dealership in a rural RU-40 zone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue presented is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was factually and legally sufficient to support their claimed right to such a use based upon: (1) two prior variances granted to the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor in title; or (2) a preexisting nonconforming use of the property. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision that concluded that the ZBA correctly determined that such a use was not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The record discloses that the plaintiffs are the owners of a forty-five acre parcel at 100 Pond Hill Road also known as Clintonville Road, Wallingford. The property is in a rural RU-40 zone where used car dealerships are not permitted. On December 8,1971, Robert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Fritz, the Wallingford zoning officer, executed a certificate of approval for the operation of a used car dealership on the Clintonville Road premises.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The certificate stated: \u201c[Public] hearing was waived because the local authority had previously approved such use for this location.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 7,1972, the commissioner of motor vehicles issued a used car dealer\u2019s license for the Clintonville Road premises to Hillview Equipment Sales, Inc., the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hillview Equipment Sales, Inc., renewed the license annually thereafter through 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">On October 6,1988, the Wallingford zoning enforcement officer issued an opinion that \u201ca valid dealer\u2019s and repairer\u2019s [license] does not exist on property at 100 Pond Hill Road because the property has always been zoned residential . . . .\u201d On December 19,1988, the plaintiffs having appealed, the Wallingford zoning board of appeals confirmed the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s decision. The plaintiffs thereafter appealed to Superior Court which, in turn, affirmed the ZBA\u2019s action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Appellate Court thereafter granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification limited to the question of whether the use of the premises for the business of an automobile dealer and repairer was authorized pursuant to previously granted zoning variances or as a valid nonconforming use. We transferred the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The plaintiffs first claim that the ZBA and the trial court improperly determined that two earlier variances had not authorized the automobile dealer\u2019s use on the Clintonville Road premises. The first application, dated February 28, 1968, sought a variance to \u201cbuild additions to present bldgs [sic] and continue uses on property which include as per recorded on plot plan.\u201d The ZBA granted the application \u201cas per plot plan on file. To include the additional uses and expansions of the property as listed on the reverse side of the plot plan.\u201d The reverse side of the plot plan stated: \u201cAlso for the expansion or continued use of the property for the following purposes: sales &amp; services of fruit, vegetable, poultry &amp; dairy food products; retail business or rental service occupation buildings; freezer <em>&amp; </em>cold storage warehousing\u2014wholesale &amp; retail; warehousing of trucks &amp; machinery; sale of loam or nursery products; processing and bottling or packaging of beverages\u2014 mainly apples &amp; other fruits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The second application, dated February 19, 1971, sought permission \u201cto repair and sell travel trailers and boats.\u201d The ZBA granted the application subject to the following: \u201cStipulation. All work, equipment and displays must be in one building under cover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>On December 15, 1986, the ZBA conducted a public hearing on an appeal from a cease and desist order entered by the Wallingford zoning enforcement officer that terminated the use of the Clintonville Road premises \u201cfor rented commercial warehouse and/or storage space.\u201d Following an exhaustive examination of the history of the uses on the property, the ZBA voted: \u201cTo deny the cease and desist order with the following stipulations: (1) That the continuing uses as specified in the 1968 variance are valid subject to proper inspection and permits by the Planning and Zoning Department. (2) That an inspection of square footage must be undertaken by the Town Planner\u2019s office for future control of the property. (3) No addition shall take place without proper application. (4) The 1968 variance applies only to the 6 plus or minus acres specified on the original variance, and any commercial use on the remainder of the property shall be discontinued as called for by the cease and desist order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The plaintiffs argue that within the totality of all of the foregoing there is a sufficient factual basis to support their contention that the ZBA had granted a variance to operate a used car dealership and that the ZBA and the trial court improperly failed to conclude that this was the case. The plaintiffs claim that even though there is no express language authorizing a used car dealership, the broad, general language contained in the 1968 variance constitutes sufficient authority to warrant the establishment of such a dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In reviewing the actions of a zoning board of appeals we note that such a board is \u201c \u2018endowed with a liberal discretion, and its [actions are] subject to review by the courts only to determine whether [they were] unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 146, 152, 543 A.2d 1339 (1988). \u201c \u2018The burden of proof to demonstrate that the board acted improperly\u2019 \u201d is upon the party seek<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ing to overturn the board\u2019s decision. <em>Adolphson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>205 Conn. 703, 707, 535 A.2d 799 (1988), quoting <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>179 Conn. 650, 654, 427 A.2d 1346 (1980). In an appeal from the decision of a zoning board, we therefore review the record to determine whether there is factual support for the board\u2019s decision, not for the contentions of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">While the 1968 variance contains a general authority to use the property for \u201cRetail business or Rental Service . . . [and] warehousing of Trucks &amp; Machinery,\u201d we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that this language is simply inadequate to support the conclusion that the ZB A intended to grant a wide-ranging variance that included within it the authority to operate a used car dealership. Both the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor and the ZBA seemingly shared this view as borne out by the 1971 application for a variance to repair and sell travel trailers and boats. Had the 1968 variance actually granted a broad, general authority to conduct retail sales of whatever sort, such an authority would have embraced the sale of travel trailers and boats. Thus, there would have been no necessity for the 1971 variance. A general authority to conduct unspecified retail sales would also be inconsistent with the oft-stated proposition that \u201cthe power to grant variances from the strict application of zoning ordinances should be carefully and sparingly exercised. <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>136 Conn. 584, 587, 73 A.2d 101 [1950]; <em>Kamerman </em>v. <em>LeRoy, </em>133 Conn. 232, 235, 50 A.2d 175 [1946].\u201d <em>Plumb </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>141 Conn. 595, 599, 108 A.2d 899 (1954). \u201c[U]nless great caution is used and variances are granted only in proper cases, the whole fabric of town- and city-wide zoning will be worn through in spots and raveled at the edges until its purpose in protecting the property values and securing the orderly development of the commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>nity is completely thwarted.\u201d <em>Gregorio </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 422, 427, 232 A.2d 330 (1967). The power to authorize a variance \u201cis only granted for relief in specific and exceptional instances.\u201d <em>DeFelice </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>130 Conn. 156, 164, 32 A.2d 635 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">We note further that the use of a general authority to establish an unspecified retail use in a rural district, in which retail sales are limited to farm stands,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> would constitute an unauthorized usurpation of the legislative function to determine land use, a function that is customarily committed to zoning commissions. A variance \u201cshould not be used to accomplish what is in effect a substantial change in the uses permitted in a [rural] zone. . . . <em>Greenwich Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Tuthill, </em>113 Conn. 684, 694, 155 A. 850 [1931].\u201d <em>Heady </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>139 Conn. 463, 468, 94 A.2d 789 (1953). \u201cArguments concerning the general unsuitability [or suitability] of a neighborhood to the zoning classification in which it has been placed are properly addressed to the promulgators of the ordinance and not to those who have been empowered to grant variances.\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>153 Conn. 141, 145, 215 A.2d 104 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The plaintiffs alternatively claim to have proven the existence of a valid nonconforming use through continuous operation of a used car dealership on the Clintonville Road premises from a time that predated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>1958 enactment of the Wallingford zoning regulations and the creation of the rural RU-40 zone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><em>\u201cA </em>non-conforming use is merely an \u2018existing use\u2019 the continuance of which is authorized by the zoning regulations.\u201d <em>Melody </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 516, 519, 264 A.2d 572 (1969). \u201cIn the determination whether a particular use is permitted or nonconforming, the question is one of expressed intent as stated in the zoning regulations, which are basically legislative enactments, and such intent must be found from the intent expressed in the regulations construed as a whole.\u201d <em>Melody </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 519. Section 6.13 of the Wallingford zoning regulations, adopted on November 7, 1958, specifically defines a nonconforming use as \u201cone which existed lawfully, whether by variance or otherwise, on the date these zoning regulations . . . became effective.\u201d See footnote 7, supra. In the absence of a finding that variances sanctioned the plaintiffs\u2019 use of their property as a used car dealership, the only alternative factual predicate to a claim of a valid nonconforming use in this instance, would be a finding that a used car dealership was operating on the Clintonville Road premises prior to November 7,1958. The plaintiffs bear the burden of proving the existence of such a nonconforming use. <em>Friedson </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>181 Conn. 230, 234, 435 A.2d 17 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In this connection, the record discloses that Hillview Equipment Sales, Inc., had conducted business on an uninterrupted basis with a valid used car dealer\u2019s or repairer\u2019s license since September 30,1972. The license had been issued presumably upon the basis of Fritz\u2019 December 8, 1971 certificate that stated: \u201cthe local authority had previously approved such use for this location.\u201d We have earlier determined that the previous approvals did not include the used car dealership. Despite the number and variety of uses claimed for the property, there is nothing in the record to establish a link to a use that predates November 7,1958, the effective date of the current version of the Wallingford zoning regulations. Since there was no such proof, and the defendant neither admitted nor conceded that this was the case, neither the ZBA nor the trial court improperly concluded that a valid nonconforming use did not exist.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) provides in part: \u201cAny person . . . aggrieved by any decision of said [zoning board of appeals] . . . may, within fifteen days from the date when notice of such decision was published in a newspaper . . . take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which such municipality is located. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-54 provides in part: \u201cAny person who desires to obtain a license for dealing in . . . motor vehicles shall first obtain and present to the commissioner [of motor vehicles] a certificate of approval of the location for which such license is desired from . . . the [zoning] board of appeals.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-55 provides in part: \u201c[T]he local authorities . . . shall . . . upon receipt of an application for a certificate of approval . . . assign the same for hearing within sixty-five days of the receipt of such application. ...
