The defendants appeal from the denial of their motion to dissolve a prejudgment attachment of real estate, while the plaintiff appeals from the granting of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The principal issue in both appeals is whether a real estate listing agreement satisfied the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that those requirements were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The material facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff, McCutcheon and Burr, Inc., is a licensed real estate broker. On or about October 3, 1989, the plaintiff entered into an open listing agreement to sell certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>real property, known as the Cromwell West Office Park, the record owners of which were the defendants William W. Berman, Edward Silverman and Loreto G. Marocchini. The defendant Washington Ridge Associates is a Connecticut partnership whose general partners are Berman, Silverman and Marocchini.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the bottom of the listing agreement next to the preprinted term \u201cOWNER(S)\u201d appears the typed name \u201cWASHINGTON RIDGE ASSOCIATES, PTNSHP.\u201d Under this name is the signature of Berman, and typed below his signature is \u201cWILLIAM BERMAN, PARTNER\u201d and a post office box address.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">On October 10, 1989, Anchor Companies (Anchor) addressed a letter of intent to the plaintiff broker setting forth its proposal to purchase the property in question for $3,950,000. The letter was signed by Berman on October 11,1989, indicating his assent to enter into negotiations to draw up a purchase contract at that price. On October 24,1989, the defendants and Anchor executed a purchase contract that identified Berman, Silverman and Marocchini as the sellers of the property. The contract was signed by each of the sellers and listed a post office box as their address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contract was contingent upon Anchor obtaining financing under certain stated terms. Anchor subsequently requested the return of its deposit when it was unable to obtain financing according to those terms. In its complaint the plaintiff claimed that the reason the sale did not go through was its refusal to acquiesce in the defendants\u2019 alleged request that it compromise its commission. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The plaintiff brought this action in three counts: (1) a breach of contract claim on the basis of its alleged right to a commission under the listing agreement; (2) a claim for the value of its services under the theory of quantum meruit; and (3) a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. On January 23, 1990, the trial court, <em>R. O\u2019Connell, J., </em>granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for a prejudgment attachment of real estate owned by the defendants. On February 13,1990, the defendants filed a motion to dissolve the prejudgment attachment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a hearing, the trial court, <em>Hon. Harry W. Edelberg, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>state trial referee, denied that motion. The court concluded that although the listing agreement did not include the names, addresses or signatures of Silver-man and Marocchini, the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) were satisfied because Berman had signed the agreement on behalf of the partnership. The court reasoned that a strict interpretation of \u00a7 20-325a (b) would conflict with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 34-47<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concerning the authority of a partner to bind the partnership. The defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 142,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the trial court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>granted the motion on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In so doing, the trial court concluded that Berman\u2019s signature alone did not satisfy \u00a7 20-325a (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>because title to the property was in the names of the three individual sellers, rather than in the name of the partnership. The court concluded that \u00a7 20-325a (b) required the names, addresses and signatures of Silverman and Marocchini to be included in the listing agreement in order for it to be binding. Both parties filed an appeal in the Appellate Court, and that court granted the plaintiffs motion to consolidate the appeals. We transferred the cases to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In the first appeal, Docket No. 14113, the defendants challenge the denial of their motion to dissolve the prejudgment attachment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the second appeal, Docket No. 14114, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was properly dismissed, although we reach our conclusion by a different procedural route than that traveled by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In its challenge to the dismissal of the complaint (Docket No. 14114), the plaintiff asserts that: (1) the trial court incorrectly concluded that the requirements for an enforceable listing agreement set forth in \u00a7 20-325a (b) were not met; (2) under the law of the case, the trial court was bound by the earlier ruling by the state trial referee that the provisions of \u00a7 20-325a (b) were satisfied; and (3) even if the trial court was correct in concluding that the listing agreement did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b), it should not have dismissed the CUTPA count in the complaint because the plaintiff\u2019s CUTPA claim was not subject to those requirements. We find none of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The right of a real estate broker to recover a commission is dependent upon whether the listing agreement meets the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b). <em>New England Land Co. </em>v. <em>DeMarkey, </em>213 Conn. 612, 621, 569 A.2d 1098 (1990); <em>Revere Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carato, </em>186 Conn. 74, 77, 438 A.2d 1202 (1982). Section 20-325a (b) requires that the listing agreement: \u201c(1) be in writing, (2) contain the names and addresses of all the parties thereto, (3) show the date on which such contract was entered into or such authorization given, (4) contain the conditions of such contract or authorization and (5) be signed by the owner or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner only by a written document executed in the manner provided for conveyances in section 47-5, and by the real estate broker or his authorized agent.\u201d In addition, the broker ordinarily must prove that it has found a buyer that is ready, willing and able to purchase the property on terms agreed to by the seller. <em>Storm Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baumgold, </em>186 Conn. 237, 242, 440 A.2d 306 (1982); <em>Revere Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cerato, </em>supra, 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The defendants contend that the trial court properly concluded that \u201cowner,\u201d as used in \u00a7 20-325a (b), means \u201crecord owner\u201d and that the listing agreement is therefore unenforceable because it does not include the names, addresses or signatures of Silverman and Marocchini.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that when construing the term \u201cowner\u201d in \u00a7 20-325a (b), this court must read that statute in light of \u00a7 34-47, which states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u201c[ejvery partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business.\u201d The plaintiff asserts, therefore, that the signature of Berman under the name of the partnership on the listing agreement was sufficient to meet the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b). In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that it has satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) if the listing agreement, trade name certificate, letter of intent from Anchor Companies, purchase contract and parol evidence are considered together. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">It is well established that the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) are mandatory rather than permissive and that the statute is to be strictly construed. <em>New England Land Co. </em>v. <em>DeMarkey, </em>supra, 623 (listing agreement must include sale price of property); <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>189 Conn. 52, 54, 453 A.2d 771 (1983) (listing agreement lacking addresses of both parties unenforceable); <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>184 Conn. 228, 230-31, 439 A.2d 946 (1981) (brokerage contract signed by owner\u2019s agent unenforceable under the statute as then worded); <em>Hossan </em>v. <em>Hudiakoff, </em>178 Conn. 381, 383, 423 A.2d 108 (1979) (failure to include broker\u2019s address fatal to listing agreement); <em>Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>17 Conn. App. 294, 305-307, 552 A.2d 827 (1989) (omission of rate of broker\u2019s commission fatal); <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Schweir, </em>7 Conn. App. 709, 713-15, 510 A.2d 215 (1986) (commission not recoverable where broker could not prove he produced a buyer during effective term of listing agreement); <em>Arruda Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Doyon, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 617, 620, 401 A.2d 625, cert. denied, 176 Conn. 763, 394 A.2d 201 (1978) (owner\u2019s address requirement not satisfied even though the listing agreement included the address of the subject property, which was the same as the owner\u2019s address). <em>\u201cA </em>broker who does not follow the mandate of [\u00a7 20-325a (b)] does so at his peril.\u201d <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>supra, 230-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The plaintiff first claims that the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) were satisfied because Berman ostensibly signed the listing agreement on behalf of the partnership. The dispositive issue concerning this claim is whether the purported partnership signature satisfies the statute or whether, as the defendants assert, the term \u201cowner\u201d in \u00a7 20-325a (b) means \u201crecord owner.\u201d As previously noted, the record title to Cromwell West Office Park was vested in Berman, Silverman and Marocchini, and nowhere does the deed by which they took title refer to their partnership.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The plaintiff contends that \u201cowner\u201d should not be interpreted to mean \u201crecord owner\u201d because \u00a7 20-325a (b) should be read in conjunction with \u00a7 34-47. In other words, the plaintiff asserts that Berman had the authority to bind the partnership under \u00a7 34-47 and that his signature, appearing as it did below the name of the partnership, obviated the need for including the names, addresses and signatures of the other two record owners on the listing agreement. The plaintiffs argument, however, ignores the principle that \u201c[a] statutory provision that articulates with greater specificity the resolution of a particular controversy is presumed to prevail over a more general provision.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 393, 542 A.2d 306 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 359, 538 A.2d 185 (1988); <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 623-24, 441 A.2d 600 (1981). Section 34-47 is a general provision that governs the authority of partners to bind the partnership when carrying on the partnership business. Section 20-325a (b), however, includes specific provisions that dictate when the signature of an owner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>agent satisfies the requirements of the statute. Under those provisions the agent must be authorized to act on behalf of the owner pursuant to \u201ca written document executed in the manner provided for conveyances in section 47-5.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b). It is clear that Berman did not sign the listing agreement as an agent for Silverman or Marocchini as provided for in \u00a7 20-325a (b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We conclude that \u201cowner,\u201d as used in \u00a7 20-325a (b), means the record owner or owners as displayed on the land records. The listing agreement in issue, therefore, is not in compliance with the statute because the names, addresses and signatures of Silverman and Marocchini, both record owners, were omitted. Although we might reach a different result if title to the property had been held in the name of the partnership, under the facts of this case we cannot apply the general provisions of \u00a7 34-47 when the legislature has specifically addressed in \u00a7 20-325a (b) the conditions under which an agent will be allowed to sign a listing agreement on behalf of an owner.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The plaintiff next claims that even if we construe \u201cowner\u201d to mean \u201crecord owner,\u201d it has satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) if the listing agreement, trade name certificate, letter of intent, purchase contract and parol evidence are considered together. The plaintiff relies in particular on the fact that the purchase contract includes a provision concerning the brokerage fee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[S]eparate documents will be deemed to constitute a valid contract under \u00a7 20-325a (b) if they collectively satisfy the statutory requirements <em>and relate to the same agreement. [Good </em>v. <em>Paine Furniture Co., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 24, 27, 391 A.2d 741 (1978)]. It is not within the power of courts to create new and different agreements. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>164 Conn. 369, 375, 321 A.2d 444 (1973).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>supra, 55. The burden of establishing a valid listing agreement in this manner \u201cis great, however, and must consist of more than a reference to the [listing] contract in the sales agreement.\u201d <em>Del Greco Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Lamoureux, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 95, 97-98, 469 A.2d 1232 (1983). \u201cParol evidence will be considered if it con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>vincingly shows that the signed and unsigned writings are connected to one another and have been assented to by the parties.\u201d <em>Good </em>v. <em>Paine Furniture Co., </em>supra, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The focus of our inquiry on this issue, therefore, is whether either the listing agreement or the purchase contract \u201cpoints <em>unquestionably </em>to the other document so as to create a consistent contract.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>supra, 56; <em>Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 306. The plaintiff is unable to satisfy this strict standard. The only reference in the listing agreement to a purchase contract is a provision stating that the broker will not earn a commission if the owner enters into a purchase contract with a buyer procured by the owner. The clause in the purchase contract concerning brokerage makes no mention whatsoever of the listing agreement. Nor does the purchase contract provide any indication of the rate of commission or when a commission would be deemed earned. Finally, the parol evidence offered by the plaintiff does not establish the necessary linkage between the two documents. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs attempt to combine these two documents for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The plaintiff also argues that because the state trial referee had concluded that \u00a7 20-325a (b) was satisfied when it denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dissolve the prejudgment attachment, the subsequent granting by the trial court of the motion to dismiss on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>that the plaintiff had not complied with that statute violated the principle of the law of the case. The defendants contend that the law of the case is not applicable here because a trial court ruling on a motion to dissolve a prejudgment remedy employs a different legal standard than a trial court deciding a motion to dismiss. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201cThe law of the case is not written in stone but is a flexible principle of many facets adaptable to the exigencies of the different situations in which it may be invoked. See 18 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction \u00a7 4478. In essence it expresses the practice of judges generally to refuse to reopen <em>what has been decided </em>and is not a limitation on their power. <em>Messenger </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>225 U.S. 436, 444, 32 S. Ct. 739, 56 L. Ed. 1152 (1912).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>186 Conn. 86, 99, 439 A.2d 1066 (1982); <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>215 Conn. 14, 29, 574 A.2d 194, cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 513, 112 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1990); <em>Rosenblit </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>206 Conn. 125, 132, 537 A.2d 145 (1988). \u201cFrom the vantage point of an appellate court it would hardly be sensible to reverse a correct ruling by a second judge on the simplistic ground that it departed from the law of the case established by an earlier ruling.\u201d <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>supra, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">When a defendant moves to dissolve an ex parte prejudgment remedy, the trial court must determine whether \u201cthere is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (c). It is well established that a probable cause hearing is not intended to be a full scale trial on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>New England Land Co. </em>v. <em>DeMarkey, </em>supra, 620; <em>Three S Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>193 Conn. 174, 175, 474 A.2d 795 (1984); <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C.F. Wooding Co., </em>173 Conn. 426, 429, 378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>A.2d 538 (1977). The court\u2019s role in such a hearing is to determine the probability of success by evaluating the arguments and evidence presented by both parties, and its ruling is not intended to be a final resolution on the merits. <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C.F. Wooding Co., </em>supra. This limited weighing process applies to both factual and legal issues. Id.; <em>Babiarz </em>v. <em>Hartford Special, Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 388, 393, 480 A.2d 561 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In contrast, the ruling of the trial court on the motion to dismiss necessitated a full review of the merits of the underlying issue, namely, whether the listing agreement satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b). Because this ruling involved the application of a different legal standard than that employed in ruling on the motion to dissolve the prejudgment attachment, the law of the case is simply inapposite in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">It is necessary to note, however, that the proper procedural mechanism for addressing whether \u00a7 20-325a (b) was satisfied would have been a motion to strike under Practice Book \u00a7 152,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> rather than a motion to dismiss under Practice Book \u00a7 142. See <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Kasper, </em>41 Conn. Sup. 225, 565 A.2d 18 (1989); <em>Del Greco Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Lamoureux, </em>supra. The defendants argued, and the trial court agreed, that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s claim because the listing agreement did not comply with \u00a7 20-325a (b). None of the cases in which we have addressed a failure to comply with \u00a7 20-325a (b), however, has involved a motion to dismiss because of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>New England Land Co. </em>v. <em>DeMarkey, </em>supra (motion to dissolve prejudgment rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>edy); <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>supra (summary judgment); <em>Hossan </em>v. <em>Hudiakoff, </em>supra (summary judgment). Furthermore, we are unaware of any cases in which the failure of a listing agreement to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) was found to create a jurisdictional bar to an action based on that agreement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> An action to enforce a listing agreement is essentially a breach of contract claim, and the trial court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction over such a claim. See Conn. Const., amend. XX; <em>Walkinshaw </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>130 Conn. 122, 127, 32 A.2d 547 (1943); see generally <em>Demar </em>v. <em>Open Space &amp; Conservation Commission, </em>211 Conn. 416, 423-25, 559 A.2d 1103 (1989). We therefore conclude that a motion to strike was the proper means to abate the plaintiffs action. See <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 369, 372, 439 A.2d 396 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Although the trial court should have treated the motion to dismiss as a motion to strike, this procedural anomaly does not affect our decision. In another case involving an issue of compliance with \u00a7 20-325a (b), we noted that \u201cwhere the pleadings and exhibits are the only evidentiary concerns, the dictates of judicial economy instruct us to resolve the legal validity of a particular agreement under an applicable statute at the earliest time practicable.\u201d <em>New England Land Co. </em>v. <em>DeMarkey, </em>supra, 623. For the purposes of the present case, the primary difference between the granting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the granting of a <em>motion to </em>strike is that <em>only </em>in the latter case does the plaintiff have the opportunity to amend its complaint. See Practice Book \u00a7 157.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The ability to amend after a motion to strike would be unavailing to the plaintiff here, however, because the plaintiff was unable to demonstrate that it could add anything to its complaint by way of amendment that would avoid the deficiencies in the original complaint.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Therefore, although the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was procedurally incorrect, the resulting foreclosure of the plaintiff\u2019s ability to amend was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The plaintiff further contends that, even if the trial court properly concluded that the listing agreement did not satisfy \u00a7 20-325a (b), its CUTPA count should not have been dismissed. In support of this claim the plaintiff relies primarily on <em>Dow &amp; Condon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>203 Conn. 475, 525 A.2d 935 (1987). That case, however, is readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The plaintiff in <em>Dow, </em>a real estate brokerage corporation, was serving as co-broker for the sale of property owned by a limited partnership. Id., 476-77. The named defendant was both a general partner in the limited partnership and the owner of the defendant corporation, a real estate brokerage company that served as primary broker for the property. Id. After the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>tiff had found a buyer, the named defendant induced the limited partnership to enter into a purchase agreement with a different party under terms that benefited the named defendant and his brokerage company. Id., 477. The plaintiff filed, inter alia, a CUTPA claim, and we concluded that the trial court reasonably could have found probable cause to believe that the plaintiff had a valid cause of action under CUTPA. Id., 481-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Dow </em>is misplaced, however, because the CUTPA claim in Dow, unlike the CUTPA count in the present case, did not arise solely from the listing agreement. We specifically noted in that case that the CUTPA claim was not brought simply as a means of enforcing its listing agreement, but rather was an attempt by the plaintiff to recover for the deceptive practices of the defendants. Id., 483-84. In contrast, in this case the plaintiffs CUTPA claim simply states an alternative means for attempting to collect the commission provided for in the listing agreement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In further support of its CUTPA claim, the plaintiff argues that even if it was not entitled to collect a commission as a result of the deficiencies of the listing agreement, the defendants\u2019 refusal to pay a commission constituted a CUTPA violation because it was equitably entitled to that commission. Assuming, as the plaintiff contends, that it did in fact produce a ready, willing and able buyer and that the defendants asked the plaintiff to compromise its commission as a condition for going through with the sale, we do not agree that such conduct would provide a basis for a CUTPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>violation. Because the listing agreement did not comply with \u00a7 20-325a (b), the defendants were legally entitled to refuse to pay a commission and their reliance on the statute cannot translate into a CUTPA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The plaintiffs invocation of equitable principles in support of its CUTPA claim is an attempt to effect an end run around the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b). \u201cListing contracts are governed exclusively by \u00a7 20-325a . . . .\u201d <em>William Pitt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>186 Conn. 82, 84, 438 A.2d 1206 (1982). In <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Marano, </em>13 Conn. App. 527, 530-33, 537 A.2d 1036, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 809, 541 A.2d 1238 (1988), the Appellate Court rejected an analogous claim. In that case, a broker whose listing agreement did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) argued that he was still entitled to his commission because the defendant was equitably estopped from asserting the statute as a defense and because the defendant had been unjustly enriched. Id., 530-32. The court noted that to allow the plaintiff to recover under these theories \u201cwould nullify \u00a7 20-325a and emasculate the state\u2019s real estate sales licensing system.\u201d Id., 531; see also <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>215 Conn. 316, 331-32, 576 A.2d 455 (1990) <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting); <em>Goldblatt Associates </em>v. <em>Panda, </em>24 Conn.

The plaintiffs attempt to circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) by filing a CUTPA claim must therefore be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In light of our conclusion that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint, the issues in the defendants\u2019 appeal of the denial of their motion to dissolve the prejudgment attachment in Docket No. 14113 need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The judgment in Docket No. 14114 is affirmed; the appeal in Docket No. 14113 is dismissed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to order the release of the plaintiff\u2019s prejudgment attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b) provides: \u201cNo person, licensed under the provisions of this chapter, shall commence or bring any action in respect of any acts done or services rendered after October 1, 1971, as set forth in subsection (a), unless such acts or services were rendered pursuant to a contract or authorization from the person for whom such acts were done or services rendered.

Although the legislative history does not address specifically the issue in the present case, it is clear that the overarching purpose of the amendment was to clarify the statutory language in order to make the statute effective and workable. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra. Interpreting the word \u201cowner\u201d to mean \u201crecord owner\u201d advances this purpose because a broker can determine who must sign a listing agreement through the simple expedient of examining the land records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> The purchase contract provides in pertinent part: <em>\u201cBrokerage. </em>Purchaser and Seller represent to each other that they have dealt with no real estate broker, agent or finder, other than McCutcheon &amp; Burr, Incorporated, in connection with this transaction and each agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from claims arising from its actions.
