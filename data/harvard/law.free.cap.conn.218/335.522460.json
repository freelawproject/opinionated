We affirm the judgment of dismissal on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the action, and therefore, we do not reach the exhaustion issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The plaintiffs are the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, Inc. (CBIA), which represents employers who provide health insurance to their employees, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc. (BCBS), an insurer that provides health insurance to those insured under the policies it has issued, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the Insurance Association of Connecticut (IAC), a trade association whose members are domestic insurers that provide health insurance to their policy holders. The defendants are the commission on hospitals and health care (CHHC), and thirty-two Connecticut hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In August and September, 1988, CHHC issued orders establishing the rates to be charged by the hospitals during the 1989 fiscal year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These rates were established in accordance with formulae set forth in the statutes and regulations as applied to the data concerning its past financial operations that each hospital is required to submit to CHHC in order to implement the prospective payment system adopted in 1984 for hospitals in this state. <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>214 Conn. 726, 728, 573 A.2d 736 (1990) (CBIA I); see General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7\u00a7 19a-165 through 19a-165v. Each hospital subsequently filed a request for reconsideration of its rate orders as provided for under \u00a7 19a-165q-45 (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>icut State Agencies. The CHHC granted the requests, opened dockets for all of the hospitals and scheduled public reconsideration hearings for each matter to be held in October, 1988. In addition, CHHC notified the hospitals that it had \u201cscheduled a time to informally discuss each hospital\u2019s . . . rate order should your hospital feel it is necessary.\u201d The informal discussions were held at the hospitals\u2019 requests throughout September, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On September 30, and October 3, 1988, BCBS filed petitions pursuant to \u00a7 19a-165q-45 (b) (4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies for party status in the reconsideration hearings scheduled for six of the hospitals, and CBIA and IAC filed letters requesting \u201cblanket\u201d party status in the hearings scheduled for all of the hospitals. In the meantime, however, the informal discussions had resulted in \u201cagreed settlements\u201d between all of the hospitals and CHHC, which revised the original rate orders by increasing them. On October 6,1988, CHHC temporarily stayed the original rate orders and implemented the revised rate orders pending formal approval of the settlements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The reconsideration hearings accordingly were canceled, and on October 12,1988, CHHC denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petitions for party status in those hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Thereafter, on October 27, 1988, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a declaratory ruling pursuant to \u00a7 4-176<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> referenced to all of the hospital dockets and requesting rulings on twenty-eight issues pertaining to the procedures employed by CHHC in conducting the informal discussions, temporarily staying the original rate orders and reaching the agreed settlements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The basic allegation in the petition was that the procedures were improper and unauthorized by statute or regulation, and therefore, any alteration of the original rate orders should be declared void. On December 6,1988, CHHC issued a \u201cNotice of Declaratory Ruling Hearing\u201d stating that it would rule on fifteen listed issues \u201cwhich appear to be of key concern to the [plaintiffs]\u201d after a hearing scheduled for January 17,1989. CHHC further stated that \u201cthis declaratory ruling proceeding is separate and independent from any proceedings related to the . . . rate orders for specific hospitals.\u201d Before the hearing date arrived, however, the plaintiffs learned that CHHC had issued formal decisions approving the agreed settlements on December 20, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The plaintiffs then pursued two courses of action. First, they filed thirty-two administrative appeals in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from CHHC\u2019s decisions revising the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>nal rate orders. Those appeals were dismissed by the court for lack of aggrievement, and we upheld the judgment of dismissal in <em>CBIA I, </em>supra. Second, the plaintiffs notified CHHC that they would not participate in the declaratory ruling proceeding due to its modification of the issues on which they had requested rulings in their petition, and due to its refusal to permit the disposition of those issues in the context of the hospital rate reconsideration proceedings. The plaintiffs additionally informed CHHC that its \u201crewriting\u201d and \u201cdisembodiment\u201d of their petition \u201cconstitute^] a final and adverse ruling\u201d on the petition, and, \u201cbecause [CHHC] issued its final decision on the Requested Rulings without first conducting a public fact-finding hearing, the [plaintiffs] have the right, pursuant to [\u00a7\u00a7] 4-175 and 4-176, to seek a Declaratory Judgment in the Superior Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Thereafter, in accordance with their stated intentions, the plaintiffs challenged CHHC\u2019s decisions revising the original rate orders by filing this action for a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4-175, 4-176, 52-29 (a), and pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 388 through 394. The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint, among other things, that CHHC\u2019s \u201cfailure to follow proper rate reconsideration procedures, its negotiation and entry of Agreed Settlements, and its adverse ruling or refusal to rule on the Petition for Declaratory Rulings, as amended, all constitute the application of regulations and implementation of certain orders which interfere with or impair, or which threaten to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the plaintiffs.\u201d Subsequently, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 action on the ground that they had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies because they had circumvented the scheduled declaratory ruling proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The court, concluding that the plaintiffs had indeed failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction on January 30, 1990.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Although several issues have been raised for our consideration, both parties have briefed the issue of whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring the declaratory judgment action in the first instance. Our conclusion that the plaintiffs lacked the requisite standing and our affirmance of the judgment of dismissal on this ground obviates the necessity to consider the other issues raised.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The defendants contend that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the declaratory judgment action for the reasons set forth in our recent decision in <em>CBIA I. </em>That case, as noted above, involved an administrative appeal under \u00a7 4-183 (a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> taken by the plaintiffs in this case from the same decisions of CHHC revising the original rate orders that are the subject of this case. We held in <em>CBIA I </em>that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved by the decisions, as is necessary for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>administrative appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a), because they had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a legal interest in the subject matter of the decisions approving the settlement agreements that can be distinguished from the interest of the general public in hospital rate increases.\u201d <em>CBIA I, </em>supra, 734. In reaching that conclusion, we noted: \u201cThe fact that [the plaintiffs] are obligated contractually to pay the rates established by CHHC in these decisions gives them no more standing than their policyholders or other contractual beneficiaries would have to challenge the decision. These beneficiaries, in turn, have no greater interest than those members of the general public who have no health insurance and must pay the rates established. The financial impact of an increase in hospital rates is borne by all members of the public when they require hospitalization and are presented with bills for the services rendered. The agreements the plaintiffs have made to bear or share these hospitalization expenses with their policyholders or other contractual obligees do not create aggrievement for the purpose of an appeal unless those who pay directly for their hospitalization would be similarly aggrieved.\u201d Id., 730-31.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In response to the defendants\u2019 contention, the plaintiffs argue that the principles set forth in <em>CBIA I </em>are limited in application to administrative appeals filed pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a). They maintain, further, that by virtue of our decision in <em>Connecticut Assn. of Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>Care Facilities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worrell, </em>199 Conn. 609, 508 A.2d 743 (1986), the criteria for standing to bring a declaratory judgment action pursuant to \u00a7 4-175<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201care significantly more liberal than those of \u00a7 4-183 (a).\u201d Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that \u201c[tjhere is no requirement in the standing test applied ... in <em>Worrell </em>under \u00a7 4-175 that [the] plaintiffs\u2019 rights must differ from those of the general public as set forth under the . . . test that governs \u00a7 4-183 [a].\u201d This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">While <em>Worrell </em>involved a declaratory judgment action brought under \u00a7\u00a7 4-175 and 52-29 (a) by two associations that had suffered adverse administrative rulings on petitions for declaratory rulings filed pursuant to \u00a7 4-176, that procedural happenstance played little or no role in the decision reached in <em>Worrell. </em>It was not stated or intimated in <em>Worrell </em>that the decision was intended to liberalize the doctrine of standing for purposes of declaratory judgment actions under \u00a7 4-175 as opposed to administrative appeals under \u00a7 4-183 (a). Subsequent cases applying the principles set forth in <em>Worrell </em>in a variety of procedural settings lend additional support to the proposition that <em>Worrell </em>was not designed for, nor confined to, cases involving similar procedural underpinnings. See <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 Conn. 646, 650, 556 A.2d 1020 (1989) (administrative appeal pursuant to General Statutes [Rev. to 1985] \u00a7\u00a7 1-21i [d], 4-183); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 304-305, 524 A.2d 636 (1987) (administrative appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176 and 4-183); <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386, 389, 512 A.2d 152 (1986) (action for injunction); see also <em>Paucatuck Eastern Pequot Indians </em>v. <em>Indian Affairs </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>Council, </em>18 Conn. App. 4, 10, 555 A.2d 1003 (1989) (administrative appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Furthermore, <em>Worrell </em>did not abandon the traditional standing requirement that a party bringing suit must \u201cdemonstrate a legal interest in the subject matter of [a controversy] that can be distinguished from the interest of the general public . . . .\u201d <em>CBIAI, </em>supra. <em>Worrell </em>broke new ground only to the extent that it overruled an earlier precedent holding that an association was without standing to bring suit on behalf of its members \u201cunless it has a right, in itself, in the subject matter of the controversy which a decree will affect\u201d; <em>Connecticut Society of Architects, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bank Building &amp; Equipment Corporation, </em>151 Conn. 68, 74, 193 A.2d 493 (1963); and \u201cadopted the federal standard for representational standing as delineated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, </em>432 U.S. 333, 97 S. Ct. 2434, 53 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1977).\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 304, 524 A.2d 636 (1987); see <em>Connecticut Assn. of Health Care Facilities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worrell, </em>supra, 615-17. Although <em>Worrell </em>disavowed the prior requirement that an association must demonstrate a personal interest in a controversy; <em>Connecticut Assn. of Health Care Facilities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worrell, </em>supra, 614-16; the assurance of a justiciable controversy inherent in that requirement was preserved by adjusting the focus of the typical standing inquiry to scrutinize the nature of the interests of the association\u2019s members. The association accordingly was required to establish, as one of three prerequisites to representational standing, that its \u201c \u2018members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right ....\u2019\u201d Id., 616. The association involved in <em>Worrell </em>satisfied this prerequisite since its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201cmembers would . . . have standing to seek declaratory judgments because they allege direct, personal injury\u201d resulting from the conduct challenged by the association. Id., 617. While it was not explicitly stated in <em>Worrell, </em>therefore, it was implicit that the members had a legal interest in the controversy distinguishable from the interest of the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Consequently, the plaintiffs cannot disentangle themselves from the standing criteria applied in <em>CBIA I </em>on the basis of an illusory distinction in <em>Worrell </em>between standing for purposes of \u00a7 4-175 as opposed to \u00a7 4-183 (a). In the event of their failure to prevail on this claim, however, the plaintiffs raise the alternative, though analogous, contention that the declaratory judgment provisions of \u00a7 52-29 (a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 390<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> are more lenient as to standing than \u00a7 4-183 (a), and of course, they maintain that they satisfy those provisions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201c \u2018It is a basic principle of our law . . . that the plaintiffs must have standing in order for a court to have jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment.\u2019 <em>Connecticut Assn. of Boards of Education, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>197 Conn. 554, 558, 499 A.2d 797 (1985).\u201d <em>Connecticut Assn. of Health Care Facilities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worrell, </em>supra, 613. Our rules of practice, mirroring the fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>eral constitutional \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement; <em>see Flast </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 95, 88 S. Ct. 1942, 20 L. Ed. 2d 947 (1968); accordingly provide that no court will render a declaratory judgment on the complaint of a person \u201cunless he has an interest, legal or equitable, by reason of danger of loss or of uncertainty as to his rights or other jural relations which requires settlement between the parties.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 390 (a). The plaintiffs claim that they have an \u201cinterest\u201d in the rate order decisions that falls within the ambit of this provision because they are contractually obligated to pay the hospitals in accordance with the revised rate orders, and since they are \u201cuncertain whether they must allow the Hospitals payment only in accordance with the initial 1989 Rate Orders, and whether they can seek reimbursement or take credits for the additional moneys paid\u201d in compliance with the orders. We are unpersuaded that an interest of this nature is sufficient to invoke the declaratory judgment jurisdiction of our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u201cAn action for a declaratory judgment, valuable as it has become in modern practice, is not a procedural panacea for use on all occasions.\u201d <em>Liebeskind </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>142 Conn. 155, 158, 112 A.2d 208 (1955). In providing statutory authority for courts to grant declaratory relief, the legislature did not intend \u201c \u2018to broaden their function so as to include issues which would not be such as could be determined by the courts in ordinary actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Dunnigan, </em>138 Conn. 263, 267, 83 A.2d 491 (1951), quoting Board <em>of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Finance, </em>127 Conn. 345, 347, 16 A.2d 601 (1940). The declaratory judgment procedure consequently may be employed only to resolve \u201ca justiciable controversy where the interests are adverse, where there is an actual bona fide and substantial question or issue in dispute or substantial uncertainty of legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>relations which requires settlement.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 627, 376 A.2d 359 (1977). A party pursuing declaratory relief must therefore demonstrate, as in ordinary actions, a \u201cjusticiable right\u201d in the controversy sought to be resolved, that is, \u201ccontract, property or personal rights ... as such will be affected by the [court\u2019s] decision . . . .\u201d <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Dunnigan, </em>supra, quoting <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Finance, </em>supra, 348. A party without a justiciable right in the matter sought to be adjudicated lacks standing to raise the matter in a declaratory judgment action. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We recently held that a party who was \u201csimply a member of the general public who has not demonstrated how she was harmed in a unique fashion\u201d by the conduct she had challenged in a declaratory judgment action had failed to establish \u201ca colorable claim of <em>direct </em>injury,\u201d and accordingly lacked standing to maintain the action. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Horwitch, </em>215 Conn. 469, 473, 576 A.2d 1280 (1990). For the reasons set forth in <em>CBIA I, </em>neither the plaintiffs in this case nor their members have an interest in CHHC\u2019s decisions revising the original rate orders that is distinguishable from that of the general public. Consequently, the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the decisions in a declaratory judgment action, and the action was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1989)] Sec. 4-175. declaratory judgment ACTION TO DETERMINE VALIDITY OR APPLICABILITY OF A REGULATION OR order.
