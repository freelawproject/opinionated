On September 2, 1986, the victim was working alone on the 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. shift at her place of employment. Around 6:30 a.m. on September 3, a coworker found her dead, lying face down in an office, the victim of a massive blow to the head. In September, 1987, John Card and Marilu Flaler gave statements to the police that included unpublished details of the crime and implicated the defendant, Kenneth F. Ireland, Jr., Lee Magoon, and a third person known only as \u201cMoe.\u201d In their statements, Card and Flaler claimed that the defendant and Magoon had made incriminating remarks indicating their involvement in the crime during a conversation that occurred in the home shared by Card and Flaler on a Sunday afternoon shortly after the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The defendant was tried before a jury on November 27, 1989, which returned a verdict of guilty on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>counts. On January 12,1990, the trial court sentenced the defendant to three terms of imprisonment: fifty years for felony murder; twenty years for first degree sexual assault; and five years for third degree burglary. The sentences were to run concurrently for a total effective sentence of fifty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly restricted his cross-examination of Card and Flaler, the state\u2019s primary witnesses, in violation of his rights under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that court-imposed limitations on his cross-examination of these crucial witnesses prevented him from proving the couple\u2019s motive for incriminating the defendant, all in violation of his constitutionally protected right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that Card and Flaler lied in an effort to protect Edmond Card, John Card\u2019s brother, either because they believed that he was a suspect in the case or because he actually was involved in the murder. The defendant further theorized that the source of John Card and Flaler\u2019s detailed information concerning the crime was not Magoon, but Edmond Card. In his cross-examination of John Card, the defendant\u2019s attorney sought to establish that, at the time he gave incriminating evidence to the police, Card was aware that his brother was a suspect in the case. The state objected and out of the presence of the jury, Card denied knowing that his brother was a suspect. The trial court then sustained the state\u2019s objection to this question being asked in the presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>jury. It is this ruling that the defendant claims constituted the first impermissible limitation upon his right to confront the witnesses against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cA defendant may give evidence concerning a third party\u2019s involvement with the crime, as long as there is some evidence which directly connects the third party with the crime.\u201d <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 555, 440 A.2d 210 (1981). \u201c[I]t is within the sound discretion of the trial court to refuse to admit such evidence when it simply affords a possible ground of possible suspicion against another person.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>184 Conn. 400, 405, 439 A.2d 1040 (1981). Implicit in the attack on John Card\u2019s alleged motive for implicating the defendant is the inference that Edmond Card was in fact involved in the crime. The defendant\u2019s claim that Edmond Card was a suspect, or that John Card thought so, was never removed from the realm of counsel\u2019s speculation, however, by the introduction of competent evidence or an offer of proof. To the contrary, a police detective testified, without contradiction, that Edmond Card was not a suspect at the time John Card provided his statement to the police. Furthermore, John Card testified that he was unaware that his brother was a suspect at that time. There was no other evidence brought to the trial court\u2019s attention that remotely suggested that Edmond Card was involved in the murder or that John Card thought that was the case. Because there was no offer of proof to connect Edmond Card with the murder, or that John Card thought so, the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">During cross-examination, Flaler acknowledged that she had given the police a statement in which she claimed that Magoon had talked to Edmond Card about the crime. The defendant\u2019s counsel attempted to question Flaler as to the substance of the alleged conversation between Edmond Card and Magoon. The state objected to the line of questioning as being beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>scope of direct examination. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objections. It is this ruling that forms the basis for the second part of the defendant\u2019s claim that his right to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses was impermissibly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that our rule restricts cross-examination to matters covered in the direct examination, except as they involve credibility alone. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>173 Conn. 189, 195, 377 A.2d 275 (1977) .... Restrictions on the scope of cross-examination are within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 657, 491 A.2d 345 (1985). A review of the transcript reveals that the subject matter of the questions on cross-examination did indeed exceed the scope of the direct examination of Flaler. Furthermore, what Magoon may have told Edmond Card was, at best, remote to this witness and, as the trial court pointed out, was more properly the subject of questions to be directed to Edmond Card who, in fact, did testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u201cThe trial court has broad discretion to determine both the relevancy and remoteness of evidence. . . . Only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion will this court set aside on appeal rulings on evidentiary matters.\u201d <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 324, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987). Further, any statement by Flaler as to what Magoon told Edmond Card would have involved two levels of hearsay, i.e., what Magoon told Card and then what Card thereafter told Flaler. While the statements made by Magoon would likely have qualified as statements against penal interest and, therefore, arguably would have been within an exception to the rule against hearsay, defendant\u2019s counsel offered no hearsay exception or nonhearsay use for the statement from Edmond Card to Flaler.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s decision to limit his direct examination of Edmond Card restricted his right \u201c \u2018to present a defense ... to the jury so that it may decide where the truth lies.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 375, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988), quoting <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The defendant called Edmond Card as a defense witness. The state then filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude Edmond Card\u2019s impeachment through use of two inconsistent statements that he had earlier given to the Wallingford police. In the first statement, given on September 4, 1987, Edmond Card claimed that Magoon had told him that he (Magoon), the defendant and a third person raped and murdered the victim. After a polygraph test indicated that the first statement was untrue, Edmond Card gave a second statement on September 9,1987, in which he disavowed the earlier statement and stated that Magoon had not said anything about the crime. He also stated that he had been with Magoon and the defendant on the night of the murder. Defense counsel claimed that proof of the two inconsistent statements bore on the issue of John Card\u2019s and Flaler\u2019s motives for testifying against the defendant, i.e., that they thought that Edmond Card was a suspect in the murder. The trial court granted the motion in limine in part and precluded the introduction of the two written statements as they were irrelevant to the issue of whether John Card and Flaler had motives for testifying. The trial court did, however, allow the defendant to question Edmond Card as to his whereabouts on the night of the murder and his relationship with Magoon and others. Edmond Card also testified that he gave two statements to the police and that there were inconsistencies between his first and second statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The defendant now argues that <em>Edmond </em>Card\u2019s inconsistent statements should have been introduced as evidence of his consciousness of guilt as well as a basis for John Card\u2019s and Flaler\u2019s motivation for testifying. Consciousness of guilt was never advanced to the trial court as a reason for admitting the contradictory statements. It is fundamental that \u201ccounsel had the duty to state to the court the proper grounds for the admission of this evidence; Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 288, [4065 (d) (3)]; <em>Acampora </em>v. <em>Ledewitz, </em>159 Conn. 377, 381, 269 A.2d 288 (1970). . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 469, 476, 481 A.2d 1077 (1984). Having failed to do so, a challenge to the trial court\u2019s ruling based upon its failure to consider that reason, cannot be sustained. <em>Acampora </em>v. <em>Ledewitz, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u201cA trial judge may properly exclude questions, the relevancy of which appears to be slight and inconsequential and which would distract the jury from the main issues in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>214 Conn. 89, 96, 570 A.2d 209 (1990). The trial court found, and an examination of the transcript reveals, that none of Edmond Card\u2019s statements in any way indicated that he was involved in the crime. In fact, his first statement to the police implicated the <em>defendant, </em>not himself. Since neither of the statements implicated Edmond Card, there was no possible linkage between Flaler\u2019s and John Card\u2019s motives for testifying. The trial court, therefore, correctly ruled that the statements were irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s comments to the jury had the effect of denying him his due process right to a fair trial. Following the November 15, 1989 proceedings, a juror overheard John Card tell Flaler that she had been \u201cbrilliant on the stand.\u201d The juror communicated this remark to others on the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The defendant moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion. Pointing out that John Card had not been present during Flaler\u2019s testimony, the trial court instructed the jury \u201cto ignore what was said and just remove it completely from your mind. ... I specifically instruct you to disregard the comment completely.\u201d The defendant now claims that these remarks impermissibly supported John Card\u2019s and Flaler\u2019s integrity, bolstered their credibility and cast the trial court in the role of an advocate for the state\u2019s position. Other than the bald assertion that this was the case, the defendant offers no reason, and we are unable to discern one, as to why a cautionary instruction to disregard a remark made by a witness somehow bolstered the credibility of that witness in the eyes of the jury and placed the trial court in the impermissible role of an advocate. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly allowed the testimony of Lisa Cozikowski to stand. The defendant argues that Cozikowski\u2019s testimony was unreliable, irrelevant and highly prejudicial and should have been excluded because it did not tend \u201cto establish the existence of a material fact or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 659, 491 A.2d 345 (1985). Cozikowski testified that, approximately eighteen months after the murder, the defendant stated \u201cYeah, I did rape her\u201d and \u201cI killed her too.\u201d Cozikowski testified that she was drunk at the time and may have imagined the statements. She testified further that she was unsure if the defendant was awake when he made the statements. The defendant moved to stike the testimony as being irrelevant. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>301, 309, 579 A.2d 515 (1990). \u201cEvidence is admissible if it has \u2018 \u201ca reasonable tendency to prove or disprove a material fact in issue or shed some light upon some material inquiry. Note, 73 A.L.R.2d 769, 787.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>[194 Conn. 376, 381, 481 A.2d 1068 (1984)].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>200 Conn. 642, 649, 513 A.2d 58 (1986). There is no requirement that potentially inflammatory evidence be absolutely essential to the state\u2019s case and otherwise unobtainable in order that it be admissible; rather, \u2018 \u201cthe test for determining the admissibility of challenged evidence is relevancy and not necessity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 701, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 453, 450 A.2d 828 (1982) [cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1084, 107 S. Ct. 1285, 94 L. Ed. 2d 143 (1987)].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>supra, 649.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 603, 583 A.2d 896 (1990). We have never held that evidence is irrelevant simply because, standing on its own, it is insufficient to prove or disprove guilt. \u201cEvidence is not rendered inadmissible simply because it is not conclusive. It is admissible if it tends to support a relevant fact even in a slight degree . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 548, 498 A.2d 76 (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The defendant was on trial for a murder and sexual assault. The statements Cozikowski allegedly overheard described the defendant\u2019s involvement in such acts. The trial court therefore reasonably could have concluded that the statements \u201cYeah, I did rape her\u201d and \u201cI killed her too\u201d allegedly made by the defendant had a \u201ctendency to prove ... a material fact in issue or shed some light upon\u201d the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The trial court was therefore well within its discretion in determining that the evidence was relevant and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>its probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. The defendant\u2019s concerns as to the intoxication of the witness and the general circumstances in which the statements were made go to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, 548-49. In this regard, the trial court properly gave a thorough instruction to the jury regarding the weight of evidence and the credibility of witnesses which instruction was not challenged by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt unconstitutionally diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. The trial court instructed the jury: \u201cIf, however, there is something in the evidence or lack of evidence which leaves in the minds of the jurors as reasonable men and women a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused as to any of these charges, a doubt for which if necessary you can give an explanation of to your fellow jurors in the jury deliberation room, then the defendant must be given the benefit of the doubt and found not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">We recently addressed a jury instruction claim similar to this one in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 571 A.2d 79 (1990), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 554 A.2d 713 (1989). In <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Smith, </em>\u201cwe disapproved of the instruction here at issue, but concluded that, according to federal precedent, it does not \u2018constitute reversible error, let alone constitutional error in an otherwise adequate charge upon reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 179, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 150. Since the instruction is not constitutionally defective, and since any other alleged error was not preserved at trial, we conclude that this claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides: \u201cfelony murder.
