The sole issue presented is whether an employer, who has properly intervened in an action by an injured employee against a third party, may set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>off future compensation claims against the net proceeds that the employee thereafter recovers from the third party tortfeasor. We conclude that such a set off is permitted and therefore reverse the decision of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Examination of the record discloses the following: On February 27,1979, the plaintiff crushed the thumb of his left hand while working on a machine at his place of employment. On June 11, 1980, the plaintiff began a third party action against Burndy Corporation, the manufacturer of the machine. On July 7, 1980, the defendant, General Datacom, the plaintiffs employer, filed an intervening complaint in the third party action. On October 23, 1981, the plaintiff and General Data-com signed a voluntary workers\u2019 compensation agreement awarding the plaintiff 20.3 weeks as a specific injury award resulting from a 25 percent loss of use of the nonmaster thumb.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September, 1984, the plaintiff and Burndy Corporation settled the third party action for $30,000, of which $2500 was paid to satisfy General Datacom\u2019s lien. The plaintiff realized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>$16,556.50 from the settlement after payment of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed for additional compensation from General Datacom based upon a subsequent increase in the percentage of disability to his thumb. The compensation commissioner, with whom the compensation review division thereafter agreed, concluded that General Datacom, as employer, had a continuing, offsetting lien against the $16,250 net proceeds paid to the plaintiff from the settlement of the third party action. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the decision of the compensation review division. <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>21 Conn. App. 270, 572 A.2d 1048 (1990). We thereafter granted certification limited to the issue of whether an employer is entitled to a credit against future workers\u2019 compensation benefits in an amount equal to the employee\u2019s net recovery from a personal injury claim made against a third party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Although the workers\u2019 compensation statute does not specifically address reimbursement for as yet unknown future benefits, an employer\u2019s future liability to pay compensation benefits following recovery from a third party tortfeasor has historically been linked to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a) and its predecessors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[This stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ute] provides, in substance, that an employee who sustains an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, by reason of the fault and neglect of a third party, may claim compensation under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act without prejudice to his common-law right to sue the tort-feasor; that an employer who has paid, or by award become obligated to pay, compensation, may sue the tort-feasor in his own name, with a view to reimbursement; and that, if either sue, the other is entitled to notice and an opportunity to join in the action.\u201d <em>Rosenbaum </em>v. <em>Hartford News Co., </em>92 Conn. 398, 400-401, 103 A. 120 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Section 31-293 (a) farther provides for the apportionment between the injured employee and the employer of any recovery from a third party. The \u201cclaim of the employer ... [to the net proceeds from the recovery] shall take precedence over that of the injured employee . . . .\u201d The statute further provides: \u201cIf the damages . . . are more than sufficient to reimburse the employer . . . the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In 1951, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 31-293 (a), then General Statutes (Sup. 1951) \u00a7 1311b, to add the following language: \u201cThe rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against such party <em>shall not terminate the employer\u2019s obligation to make further compensation, including medical expenses, which the compensation commissioner shall thereafter deem payable to such injured employee.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>added.) This new provision was a response to our earlier holdings to the effect that a recovery against a third party that exceeded the compensation benefits paid, terminated absolutely an employer\u2019s obligation to make further compensation payments. See <em>Stavola </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>136 Conn. 670, 73 A.2d 831 (1950); <em>Mickel </em>v. <em>New England Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>132 Conn. 671, 47 A.2d 187 (1946); <em>Rosenbaum </em>v. <em>Hartford News Co., </em>supra. As a further addendum, however, the legislature provided that \u201cthe <em>employer\u2019s claim </em>shall consist of (1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit, and (2) <em>an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of such injury.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It is noteworthy that under the amended statute, it is th <em>e\u201c claim of the employer . . . </em>[that] shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of such recovery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further, the reenactment provided that \u201c[i]f the damages, after deducting the employee\u2019s expenses as provided above, shall be more than sufficient to reimburse the employer, damages shall be assessed in his favor in a sum sufficient <em>to reimburse [the </em>employer] <em>for </em>* * * <em>his claim, </em>and the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the 1951 amendment of \u00a7 31-293 (a), in an apparent tradeoff, made the employer liable for future compensation benefits, but gave the employer the right to immediate reimbursement for the present worth of future compensation payments to the extent that the future payments were known and formalized by a commissioner\u2019s \u201caward\u201d prior to the disposition of the third party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">What \u00a7 31-293 (a) does not address is the employer\u2019s right to obtain reimbursement for compensation obligations unknown at the disposition of the third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>action. While the 1951 amendment of \u00a7 31-293 (a) establishes that the employer is liable to pay future compensation payments and is entitled to the immediate reimbursement of future payments known at the disposition of the third party action, it is silent as to the employer\u2019s right to a credit for unknown future benefits against the net proceeds of the third party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Prior to its 1951 amendment, this court held that the predecessor of \u00a7 31-293 (a) required that \u201cif the employer has become obligated to pay compensation, but has not paid it, and the damages recovered [from a third party action] are greater than the amount of compensation the employer has become obligated to pay . . . the entire excess is directed to be assessed in favor of the injured employee, with the consequence of discharging the employer from his ascertained liability under the award. . . . [Section 31-293] either reimburses or discharges the employer out of the first moneys available for the payment of damages.\u201d <em>Rosenbaum </em>v. <em>Hartford News Co., </em>supra, 401-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In its 1951 amendment, the legislature provided that an employer had a continuing obligation to provide compensation. The General Assembly, however, made no attempt to alter our earlier construction of the statute, as set forth in <em>Rosenbaum, </em>that an employer was discharged from his obligations to the extent of the excess moneys available from a third party recovery. In the absence of any express statutory language or legislative history suggesting that our precedent was to be overruled, we decline to read the 1951 amendment of this statute as eliminating an employer\u2019s right to a credit to the extent that there are excess proceeds from a third party recovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>We note that other states have enacted workers\u2019 compensation statutes establishing precise mechanisms that address an employer\u2019s right to reimbursement for unknown future benefits from the proceeds of third party actions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The General Assembly could have adopted one of these statutory mechanisms but elected not to do so despite our existing precedent that implicates a continuing credit against any excess proceeds from the third party action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Finally, our conclusion that an employer is entitled to a credit for unknown future benefits against the net proceeds of a third party recovery comports with other well established principles of workers\u2019 compensation law. One of the purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation statute is \u201cthe avoidance of two independent compensations for the injury\u201d; <em>Uva </em>v. <em>Alonzy, </em>116 Conn. 91, 98, 163 A. 612 (1933); a proposition that we have recently reaffirmed. See <em>Paternostro </em>v. <em>Edward Coon Co., </em>217 Conn. 42, 47-49, 583 A.2d 1293 (1991).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the plaintiff\u2019s argument were to prevail, a claim made subsequent to the disposition of a third party action would result in the employee receiving compensation from both the third party wrongdoer and the employer. In the absence of explicit statutory language mandating such a result, we decline to adopt such a construction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the matter is remanded to that court with direction to render judgment affirming the decision of the compensation review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., and Borden, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-5\"> At the time of the commissioner\u2019s award General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (b) provided in relevant part: \u201cWith respect to the following-described injuries the compensation, in addition to the usual compensation for total incapacity but in lieu of all other payments for compensation, shall be sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average weekly earnings of the injured employee, but in no case more than the maximum weekly benefit rate set forth in section 31-309, or less than twenty dollars weekly ... (8) for the complete and permanent loss of, or loss of the use of the thumb on the master hand, ninety-five weeks, for the thumb on the other hand, eighty-one weeks .... If the injury consists of the loss of a substantial part of a member resulting in a permanent partial loss of the use of a member, or if the injury results in a permanent partial loss of function, the commissioner may, in his discretion, in lieu of other compensation, award to the injured person such a proportion of the sum herein provided for the total loss of, or the loss of the use of, such member or for incapacity or both as represents the proportion of total loss or loss of use found to exist, and any voluntary agreement submitted in which the basis of settlement is such proportionate payment may, if otherwise conformable to the provisions of this chapter, be approved by the commissioner in his discretion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any injury for which compensation is payable under . . . this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in some other person than the employer a legal liability to pay damages . . . the injured employee may proceed at law against such person to recover damages for such injury .... If . . . any damages are recovered, such damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer . . . shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of such recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred by the employee in effecting such recovery. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against such party shall not terminate the employer\u2019s obligation to make further compensation, including medical expenses, which the compensation commissioner thereafter deems payable to such injured employee. If the damages, after deducting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>employee\u2019s expenses . . . are more than sufficient to reimburse the employer, damages shall be assessed in his favor in a sum sufficient to reimburse him for his claim, and the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee. For the purposes of this section the employer\u2019s claim shall consist of (1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit and (2) an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of such injury. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\"> The legislative history indicates that the General Assembly specifically addressed the effect of Supreme Court precedent on other areas of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act but nowhere indicates an intent to alter the employer\u2019s right to a credit against the proceeds of third party recoveries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\"> See, e.g., New York Worker\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> \u201cIf the statute does not take pains to deal explicitly with the problem of future benefits, but merely credits the carrier for compensation paid, or compensation for which the carrier is liable, the correct holding is still that the excess of third party recovery over past compensation actually paid stands as a credit against future liability of the carrier.\u201d 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 74.31 (e), p. 14-471.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b52-9\"> \u201cThe policy of avoiding a double recovery is a strong one, and has on occasion been invoked to override a result that might be thought required by a literal or technical interpretation of statutes . . . .\u201d 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 71.21, p. 14-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b52-10\"> The practical construction placed on General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 since the 1951 amendment lends further support to our .conclusion. We recognize that workers\u2019 compensation law is practiced to a large extent by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>specialized bar\u2014both claimants\u2019 and insurers\u2019. Legislative changes are often made at the behest of the principal economic constituencies which are the principal participants in the system\u2014labor unions and the business and insurance community. Moreover, the commissioners, both at the hearing and appellate levels, who adjudicate workers\u2019 compensation disputes have, by virtue of their day-to-day experience, a large measure of legal expertise in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">It does not appear to be disputed that, until now, none of these actors understood the 1951 amendment to have altered the long-standing meaning of \u00a7 31-293 in the way suggested by the plaintiff. That understanding is reflected in the published commentary by a practitioner in the field: \u201cIf the employer is already obligated to make future payments and the present worth of those payments were used to calculate the employer\u2019s reimbursement claim, such payments must continue. If there is not a present obligation to make future payments, the employer is generally held to be released, <em>pro tanto </em>up to the amount that the injured employee actually recovered. Once the employee\u2019s claim for compensation benefits amounts to a sum greater than the amount recovered by the employee in the third party suit, the employer\u2019s liability for compensation payments and medical benefits commences again. This is generally referred to as a \u2018moratorium\u2019 on the collection of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d J. Asselin, Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice Manual (1985) p. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">If the 1951 amendment had been intended to change the preexisting credit system in the way claimed by the plaintiff, we would not have expected forty years of acquiescence to it by those parties and interests most affected and most familiar with that system. Yet the practical construction of forty years has been fully consistent with such acquiescence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b53-7\">Glass, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVL\">with whom Hull, J., joins, dissenting. The majority holds that the silence of the legislature in connection with the enactment of General Statutes (Sup. 1951) \u00a7 1311b, which amended General Statutes (Sup. 1949) \u00a7 615a, both precursors of General Statutes \u00a7 31-293,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> validated the decisions of this court constru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ing the language of the statute before the amendment to grant an employer an indefinite future credit against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the net proceeds recovered by an employee from a tortfeasor in a third party action. See, e.g., <em>Rosenbaum </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Hartford News Co., </em>92 Conn. 398, 103 A. 120 (1918). Because I disagree with the inference drawn by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>majority from the legislature\u2019s silence, if it can be viewed as such, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">While the majority considers certain quoted portions of \u00a7 1311b to be worthy of note, it fails to note that the new language added to \u00a7 615a by \u00a7 1311b included the following highlighted insertion into the existing provision governing the allocation of a third party recovery: \u201cIn the event that such employer and employee shall join as parties plaintiff in such action and any damages shall be recovered, such damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, <em>as defined in this section, </em>shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of such recovery . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; emphasis omitted.) Furthermore, the language added by \u00a7 1311b included, for the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>time, a precise definition of the \u201cclaim\u201d of the employer that was to take precedence over that of the employee in a third party recovery: \u201cFor purposes of this section, the employer\u2019s claim shall consist of (1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit, and (2) <em>an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of such injury. </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original; emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Before its amendment by \u00a7 1311b, \u00a7 615a merely stated that the employer's \u201cclaim,\u201d without further adorning that term, \u201cshall take precedence over that of the employee\u201d for purposes of apportionment of a third party recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the absence of any statutory language indicating the intended scope of an employer\u2019s \u201cclaim,\u201d the <em>Rosenbaum </em>court broadly construed that term to include a credit against an employee\u2019s third party recovery for both ascertained and inchoate future compensation obligations. The court\u2019s construction was \u201cbased on the legal relation of the parties as defined by the [statute]\u201d as it existed prior to its amendment in 1951;<footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> Rosenbaum </em>v. <em>Hartford News Co., </em>supra, 402; which it found to contemplate \u201cnot only the reimbursement of an employer who has paid compensation, but also his discharge from an ascertained or inchoate obligation to pay compensation, by the payment of damages directly to the injured employee. And <em>since the [statute] expressly provides that the claim of the employer shall take precedence over that of the employee, the employer is entitled to have the first moneys so paid to the employee applied to the discharge of his obligation. </em>\"(Emphasis added.) Id., 403. Since the statute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>effect at the time of <em>Rosenbaum </em>\u201c[did] not take pains to deal explicitly with the problem of future benefits, but merely credited] the carrier for compensation paid, or compensation for which the carrier [was] liable to pay,\u201d the conclusion reached in <em>Rosenbaum </em>was arguably \u201cthe correct holding,\u201d i.e., \u201cthe excess of third-party recovery over past compensation actually paid stands as a credit against future liability of the carrier.\u201d 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 74-31 (e), p. 14-471.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Unlike the ambiguous phraseology of \u00a7 615a, the language added to the statute by \u00a7 1311b \u201ctook pains\u201d to deal with the problem of future benefits, and removed any doubts about the legislature\u2019s intentions as to the nature and extent of an employer\u2019s \u201cclaim.\u201d First, as the majority notes, \u00a7 1311b imposed a continuing obligation upon employers to pay compensation to their injured employees even after the rendition of judgment in a third party action. Second, as noted above, \u00a7 1311b mandated that the employer\u2019s claim that was to \u201ctake precedence over that of the injured employee\u201d in the proceeds of a third party recovery \u201cshall consist of\u201d two components, one relating to compensation previously paid, and one relating to compensation to be paid in the future in satisfaction of the employer\u2019s new continuing futyre obligation. \u201cFor purposes of [\u00a7 1311b],\u201d the future component of an employer\u2019s claim, \u201cas defined in [\u00a7 1311b],\u201d was unequivocally restricted to \u201can amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of such injury.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) General Statutes \u00a7 1311b. Section 1311b, of course, was the only existing statutory provision that gave an employer any rights in his employee\u2019s recovery from a third party tortfeasor, as \u00a7 31-293 does presently. The language added by \u00a7 1311b therefore filled the statutory void that led the <em>Rosenbaum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>court to the sweeping conclusion that the statute \u201ceither reimburses or discharges the employer out of the first moneys available for the payment of damages.\u201d <em>Rosenbaum </em>v. <em>Hartford News Co., </em>supra, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In view of the explicit definition of an employer\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d added to the statute by the 1951 amendment, a definition clearly at odds with the expansive judicial construction of that term espoused by the <em>Rosenbaum </em>court and its pre-1951 progeny, I cannot agree with the majority that when the legislature amended the statute, it \u201cmade no attempt to alter our earlier construction of the statute, as set forth <em>in Rosenbaum, </em>that an employer was discharged from his obligations to the extent of excess moneys available from a third party recovery.\u201d \u201cIt is a well-recognized rule of statutory construction that the legislature is presumed to know all the existing statutes, the judicial interpretation of them, and the effect that its action or nonaction will have on them.\u201d <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Saars, </em>150 Conn. 290, 298, 188 A.2d 863 (1963); see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Eighth Utilities District, </em>179 Conn. 589, 593-94, 427 A.2d 425 (1980). \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[I]t is always presumed to have intended that effect which its action or nonaction produces.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 197, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989). Rather than nonaction, the legislature took affirmative action in 1951 by promulgating an express definition of what an employer\u2019s claim \u201cshall consist of\u201d for purposes of precedence over that of an employee in the proceeds of a third party recovery. The future component of that claim was unambiguously defined to the exclusion of any amount other than that \u201cequal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of such injury.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1311b. Consequently, the action taken in 1951 appears to be a classic effort by the legislature to enlighten the judicial understanding of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>intent by amending an ambiguous statute with language unmistakably manifesting its intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe legislature has the power to make evident to us that it never intended to provide a litigant with the rights that we had previously interpreted a statute to confer.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 558, 522 A.2d 753 (1987); see <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 75, 434 A.2d 333 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Aside from the intent of the legislature inferable from its action in simultaneously confronting the problem of future benefits and curtailing the extent of an employer\u2019s preferential claim to a future credit for such benefits in spite of judicial precedent to the contrary, it is an established tenet of statutory construction that when a statute specifically defines an operative term used within it, courts are bound to accept that definition. <em>Plasticrete Block &amp; Supply Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>216 Conn. 17, 27, 579 A.2d 20 (1990); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 315, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S.

Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 20.08. The rationale underlying this rule is that the specific definition of a statutory term evinces the deliberate intent of the legislature to exclude what is not specifically included in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>definition. See <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 134, 355 A.2d 236 (1974); <em>Neptune Park Assn. </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 357, 362, 84 A.2d 687 (1951). An analogous rule applies when the legislature designates by list or enumeration the items to which a statute refers, that is, the items listed or enumerated are intended to be exclusive. See <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, </em>217 Conn. 281, 301, 585 A.2d 1199 (1991); <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 200, 585 A.2d 96 (1991) (\u201c[ejxpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d); see also 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 47.23. Both rules gather additional force when construing statutes, like \u00a7\u00a7 1311b and 31-293, that are in derogation of the common law. See 2A J. Sutherland, supra; accord <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Leslie-Elliott Constructors, Inc., </em>194 Conn. 129, 137, 479 A.2d 231 (1984). When it enacted \u00a7 1311b, the legislature expressly defined an employer\u2019s \u201cclaim,\u201d enumerated its components and preceded that enumeration with the mandatory term \u201cshall.\u201d See <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Glines, </em>217 Conn. 1, 8, 583 A.2d 1287 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Applying these rules of construction to the unambiguous language of \u00a7 1311b, I am compelled to conclude that the legislature did not intend to permit an employer to assert an indefinite future credit against his injured employee\u2019s third party recovery for anything other than the mandated \u201camount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of such injury.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). General Statutes (Sup. 1951) \u00a7 1311b. It is not the function of this court \u201c \u2018to supply a statutory omission merely because we feel there is good reason to do so\u2019 \u201d; <em>American-Republican, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>183 Conn. 523, 529, 441 A.2d 23 (1981); and \u201c[tjhis is especially so where it appears that the omission was intentional. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Conn. 412, 416, 11 A.2d 856 [1940].\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Mars, </em>138 Conn. 593, 598, 87 A.2d 388 (1952); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948). \u201cIn such a situation, the remedy lies not with the court but with the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Mars, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The majority justifies its unwarranted departure from the boundaries of the definition added by \u00a7 1311b, and presently contained in \u00a7 31-293, on the ground that its decision comports with the equitable principle prohibiting two independent compensations to an employee for the same injury. While departure from an explicit statutory definition is warranted when necessary to avoid an irrational result that could not have been intended by the legislature; see <em>Vernon Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>217 Conn. 130, 139-40, 585 A.2d 76 (1991); the majority has not explained why the possibility of an employee\u2019s double recovery ensuing from adherence to the statutory definition of an employer\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d is so irrational that it could not have been intended by the legislature. In fact, \u00a7 31-293 embodies a mechanism that sanctions just such a result when an employer fails to protect his reimbursement rights by intervening in his employee\u2019s third party action in a timely fashion. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-293. We have not wavered in strictly enforcing this provision despite the inevitable consequence of an employee\u2019s double recovery for the same injury. See <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 540-41, 582 A.2d 1174 (1990); <em>Skitromo </em>v. <em>Meriden Yellow Cab Co., </em>204 Conn. 485, 489, 528 A.2d 826 (1987); <em>Ricard </em>v. <em>Stanadyne, Inc., </em>181 Conn. 321, 323, 435 A.2d 352 (1980); <em>Olszewski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>144 Conn. 322, 325, 130 A.2d 801 (1957). By doing so, we have recognized, as has the legislature, that the prohibition against double recovery is not inviolate. \u201cAlthough one purpose of \u00a7 31-293 is to avoid double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>recovery, it does not protect those who are less than vigilant in safeguarding their own legal rights.\u201d <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Van Dyke, </em>33 Conn. Sup. 661, 667, 366 A.2d 554, cert. denied, 172 Conn. 681, 364 A.2d 864 (1976). The prohibition against double recovery should not be invoked in this case to protect employers who fail to assert their rights to a future credit for the amount permitted by the statute in a timely manner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Furthermore, the prohibition against double recovery should not be invoked for the benefit of such employers at the expense of injured employees who vigilantly pursue their rights against third party tortfeasors. An employee does not bring suit against a third party tortfeasor to ensure that his employer is reimbursed for his past or future compensation outlays. He sues the tortfeasor, rather, to collect damages to which he may be personally entitled under a common law tort theory of recovery, and which are unobtainable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act). See <em>Bartolotta </em>v. <em>United States, </em>276 F. Sup. 66, 70 (D. Conn. 1967), aff\u2019d, 411 F.2d 115 (2d Cir. 1969). An award under the act ordinarily compensates an employee for the impairment to his wage earning capacity resulting from his injury. See 1 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 2.40, p. 10; 2 A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 57.11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>p. 10-12, \u00a7 57.14 (a), p. 10-46; see also <em>Ancona </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>217 Conn. 50, 55, 584 A.2d 454 (1991); <em>Czeplicki </em>v. <em>Fafnir Bearing Co., </em>137 Conn. 454, 456,78 A.2d 339 (1951); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Stratford Lumber Co., </em>105 Conn. 297, 303, 135 A. 574 (1926). Unlike a tort recovery, such an award offers little or no redress to the employee for the physical injury itself, the loss of functional ability or the pain and suffering accompanying the injury. <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>C. S. Mersick &amp; Co., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 60, 62, 395 A.2d 351 (1977); see also 1 A. Larson, supra; 2 A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 57.11, p. 10-2. In other words, the act \u201cdoes not pretend to restore to the [employee] what he has lost . . . 1 A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 2.50, p. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Although an employee\u2019s net recovery in a third party action under \u00a7 31-293 may also include damages for past and future economic losses over and above the minimum amounts authorized by the act; see <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>C. S. Mersick &amp; Co., </em>supra; a substantial amount of that recovery unquestionably represents sums to which the employee, alone, is entitled by virtue of the tort inflicted upon him. Yet, in disregard of the potential composition of such a recovery, the majority authorizes a \u201crequired\u201d credit against the full amount of that recovery. The employee therefore loses the exclusive right to any amount of that recovery, and the employer enjoys a continued holiday from his otherwise extant future compensation obligations by periodically crediting that recovery, regardless of whether the credit taken exceeds that portion of the recovery representing probable future compensable expenses. Unless and until such expenses exceed the employee\u2019s total recovery, the employer cannot lose. The employee confronted with improbable future compensable expenses, however, undoubtedly loses. He is forced to fund such expenses with sums potentially intended as recompense for his pain, suffering and other noneco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>nomic losses resulting from his injuries. If he lacks the willpower to bank his recovery for the unexpected medical crisis, his future injuries, to the extent that the employer\u2019s credit remains unused, could go untreated. This inequitable scenario certainly could be avoided by requiring employers, as contemplated by the statute, to ascertain probable future compensation payments by award at or before the conclusion of a third party action or settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">When faced with the choice as to who, as between employer and employee, should bear the financial risk of compensable future economic expenses improbable at the conclusion of a third party action or settlement, it would not have been altogether irrational for our legislature to have intended to tip the scales in a manner favorable to the financially inferior employee. \u201cThe purpose of workmen\u2019s compensation law is to provide for the workman, and it is presumed that the General Assembly acted with the knowledge that the objective in enacting such legislation was to protect the employee.\u201d <em>Going </em>v. <em>Cromwell Fire District, </em>159 Conn. 53, 59, 267 A.2d 428 (1970); see <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 281, 240 A.2d 886 (1968). In fact, the legislative history discloses that it was this precise objective that the General Assembly intended to achieve when it enacted \u00a7 1311b. The record of the discussions on the floor of the House of Representatives<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and before the labor committee<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reveals that \u00a7 1311b was enacted along with numerous other amendatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>provisions designed to provide additional protections \u201cfor 750,000 workers of the state of Connecticut.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Remarks of Representative Anthony Miller, 4 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1951 Spec. Sess., p. 1957; see generally Public Acts 1951, No. 354. This benevolent goal is reflected in the statement of purpose of the bill<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that contained the language ultimately added to the statute by \u00a7 1311b: \u201cTo extend and increase the benefits of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.\u201d S. Bill 14 (1951 Sess.).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Consistent with this objective, and of considerable significance for our current purposes, the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>history further indicates that during the same session that the draft version of \u00a7 1311b, Senate Bill 14, \u00a7 2 (1951 Sess.), was considered and passed by both houses of the legislature,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the legislature had before it two other companion bills containing proposed amendatory language that, if approved, effectively would have codified the indefinite future credit principle announced in <em>Rosenbaum.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See H. Bill 808, \u00a7 3 (1951 Sess.); S. Bill 444, \u00a7 3 (1951 Sess.). That language, reproduced in the margin,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is strikingly similar to the language of the New York version of \u00a7 31-293 in force in 1951, also reproduced in the margin,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which the majority cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>rectly identifies as a statute that grants to employers the indefinite right to reimbursement for unknown future benefits from the proceeds recovered by an employee in a third party action. House Bill 808 was referred at the end of the 1951 legislative session to the labor committee, where it died. See H. Jour., Jan. 26,1951, p. 200. After receiving an unfavorable report from the labor committee, Senate Bill 444 was debated on the floor of the Senate and voted down. See S. Jour., May 15,1951, p. 603. \u201c[T]he rejection of an amendment indicates that the legislature does not intend the bill to include the provisions embodied in the rejected amendment.\u201d 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 48.18.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the rejection of the amendments proposed by these bills in favor of a bill devoid of the unacceptable language is persuasive evidence, in addition to the intent of the legislature expressed in the clear language of \u00a7 1311b, that the legislature did not intend the future component of an employer\u2019s claim to extend beyond what was specified in \u00a7 1311b to encompass an indefinite future credit as permitted by this court in <em>Rosenbaum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In sum, all textual, historical and policy evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 1311b consistently point to the same conclusion: that the legislature intended to supplant the broad pre-1951 judicial precedent with a narrowly formulated definition of the future component of an employer\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d that would accrue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>to the benefit of the working population of this state. Adherence to that definition today would serve the same viable purpose by requiring employers, as contemplated by the statute, to ascertain their claims to a credit for \u201cthe present worth of any probable future payments\u201d at or before the conclusion of a third party action or settlement and secure the commissioner\u2019s approval of such claims by award. General Statutes \u00a7 31-293. An employee could thus obtain a fair and final determination of the amount of his third party recovery that represents probable future compensation and must be reserved for that purpose, and the amount that he, exclusively, is entitled to use as he sees fit. Should improbable future compensable expenses arise in excess of an employer\u2019s credit, the burden of making compensation for such expenses would be borne by the employer, thereby \u201clifting from the shoulders of unfortunate victims of industrial mishaps and their dependents some measure of the resulting burden, and casting it upon the industry which occasioned it and, through that industry, upon society at large. It is not the immediate employer who, by this procedure, ultimately bears the burden that he is in the first instance made to assume. In its final distribution society bears it.\u201d <em>Piccinim </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>93 Conn. 423, 429, 106 A. 330 (1919). Construing \u00a7 31-293 in accordance with its plain language would both further these socio-economic and humanitarian goals and adequately protect the reimbursement rights of an employer who is vigilant in protecting his own rights. If \u201cthe statute in its present form is apt to work an injustice, that is something for the legislature to cure. It does not require modification of the terms of the statute by the courts for the sake of accomplishing what might appear to be justice.\u201d <em>General Tires, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corporation, </em>143 Conn. 191, 196, 120 A.2d 426 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Finally, we should not stray from the plain language of \u00a7 31-293 merely because the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner, in his practice,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> has obfuscated the manifest intent of the legislature by adhering to our superseded precedents. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 203, 550 A.2d 309 (1988); accord <em>Quinnipiac Council, Boy Scouts of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>204 Conn. 287, 295, 528 A.2d 352 (1987) (agency interpretation of statute not previously subjected to judicial scrutiny not entitled to deference); see also <em>Beauchesne </em>v. <em>Nimmo, </em>562 F. Sup. 250, 256 (D. Conn. 1983) (agency interpretation inconsistent with legislative intent manifested in plain language of statute not entitled to deference).

That the present value of probable future compensable expenses is susceptible to calculation is evident from the fact that in ordinary tort actions, future economic damages are routinely subjected to proof by statistical data. Employers could utilize such data to ascertain probable future compensation payments, subject to the approval of the commissioner, who presumably possesses special expertise in matters of valuation.

See 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 49.05. The 1987 decision of the commissioner in this case was primarily based on his reading of pre-1951 judicial precedent, not long-standing practice. The compensation review division (CRD) upheld the commissioner\u2019s decision on the basis of its earlier decision upholding an award of future credit in <em>Love </em>v. <em>J. P. Stevens &amp; Co., </em>Compensation Review Divsion, Case No. 378 CRD-7-85, November 10, 1988. The articulated grounds for the CRD\u2019s decision in <em>Love </em>were pre-1951 judicial precedent, the statements of commentators, and a 1986 decision of the CRD wherein \u201c[a]ll parties . . . appeared to view the credit issue as being one of settled law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
