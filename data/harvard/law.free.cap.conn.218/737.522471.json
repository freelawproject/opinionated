The plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had appealed to the trial court from the action of the commission in enacting the amendment. On appeal to this court, the commission claims that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the plaintiffs were aggrieved by the enactment of the amendment; and (2) the amendment is unconstitutionally vague and is arbitrary. We conclude that the trial court should not have considered the validity of the subdivision regulation in the context of the plaintiffs\u2019 zoning appeal, and we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Certain facts are undisputed. After a public hearing, the commission amended chapter IX, \u00a7 1, of the subdivision regulations by adding the following provision: \u201cLand with existing slopes of more than 25 per cent, or areas which have been designated as inland wetlands, or areas lying within a 100-year flood plain mapped by the Federal Flood Insurance Administration is environmentally sensitive land, and shall be excluded from the minimum lot size or acreage requirements set forth on the schedule in Article III of the Zoning Regulations, to the extent that such environmentally sensitive land exceeds 50 per cent of such parcel.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 1 of chapter IX of the subdivision regulations is entitled \u201cRecommendations.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>effect of the amendment was to add its provisions to the \u201cRecommendations\u201d section of chapter IX of the subdivision regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Although the parties have not explained precisely how the amendment affects subdivision applications, presumably it is linked to chapter V, \u00a7 2, of the subdivision regulations. That section provides that a \u201cPlan of Subdivision shall conform to the zoning regulations in effect at the time of approval of such Plan [of Subdivision].\u201d The general effect of the subdivision amendment, therefore, is to enable the commission to deny a subdivision application for a parcel more than 50 percent of which fits the definition of \u201cenvironmentally sensitive land,\u201d on the ground that the parcel is excluded from the applicable schedule in Article III of the zoning regulations. This record does not disclose, however, any parallel amendment to the zoning regulations. In amending the subdivision regulation, the commission was acting solely in its planning, as opposed to its zoning, capacity. See <em>Cristofaro </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>217 Conn. 103, 106, 584 A.2d 1168 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The plaintiffs appealed from the enactment of the amendment to the Superior Court. They claimed that the amendment was impermissibly vague because: (1) it contained no adequate definition of a wetland; and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the meaning of \u201c[ljand with existing slopes of more than 25 per cent\u201d was too uncertain to guide the determinations of the commission or the property owner, as was the phrase \u201cexcluded from the minimum lot size or acreage requirements set forth on the schedule in Article III of the Zoning Regulations . . . .\u201d They also claimed that: (3) the inclusion in the amendment of the reference to wetlands constituted an illegal usurpation of the power of the town\u2019s inland wetlands and watercourses commission because only that commission was authorized to determine wetlands; (4) the amendment took their land without just compensation; (5) the amendment was adopted without the commission stating its reasons therefor on the record, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (c); and (6) during the commission\u2019s deliberations on the proposed amendment, the commission arbitrarily changed the slope requirement from 15 to 25 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">At the hearing in the trial court, the plaintiffs only presented evidence of aggrievement. That evidence was that certain of the plaintiffs<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> owned undeveloped parcels of land in the town that were large enough to be subdivided, and that each of these parcels either contained an area of more than a 25 percent slope or an area that had been designated as wetlands on the town\u2019s wetlands map.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the commission had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>filed with the trial court, as part of its return of record, the administrative record of the amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">After oral argument, the trial court found that the plaintiffs were aggrieved, and ruled from the bench \u201cthat the regulation is . . . void for vagueness. . . .\u201d This was followed by a written memorandum of decision in which the trial court further stated that the amendment was \u201cvoid for vagueness in that: Said regulation lacks standards sufficient to guide the commission and to enable those affected to know their rights and obligations. In addition, the record reveals no basis for using a 25% grade or a 50% maximum as standards. The record reveals (Exhibit 12)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that both figures were arbitrarily chosen with no engineering or scientific support.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Upon a grant of certification, the commission appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The commission claims that the trial court improperly found that the plaintiffs were aggrieved and improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>erly invalidated the regulation. We need not reach the merits of the commission\u2019s claims because we conclude that the appropriate procedural vehicle for the plaintiffs\u2019 attack on the regulation was a declaratory judgment action, and not an appeal from its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Recently, in <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>209 Conn. 544, 561-63, 552 A.2d 796 (1989), we held that the trial court should have dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional vagueness attack on the adequacy of the town of Ridgefield\u2019s wetlands regulations made in the context of an appeal from the denial of a wetlands application. We stated that \u201c[t]he final constitutional issue, relating to the adequacy of the regulations in setting forth standards for a decision upon an application, constitutes the kind of general attack upon land use regulations that we have indicated should be the subject of a declaratory judgment action rather than an appeal from the denial of an application submitted pursuant to those regulations.\u201d Id., 563. The rationale for this procedural requirement is that \u201c[t]he validity of the regulations is a question in which many property owners, in addition to the plaintiffs, may have an interest, and an opportunity for such persons to intervene should be afforded before any such determination should be made.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">This rationale applies equally here. With the exception of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of a taking without just compensation, which we discuss below, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims constitute a general attack on the validity of the regulation. Such an attack should have been presented by way of a declaratory judgment action in which other property owners who may have an interest would have had the opportunity to intervene and be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Indeed, this record supplies an additional rationale for requiring the plaintiffs to have mounted their attack in a declaratory judgment action. Because this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>came to the court in the context of an appeal from the enactment of the regulation, the record is devoid of a sufficient factual basis on which to evaluate the claimed vagueness of the regulation. See <em>D &amp; J Quarry Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>217 Conn. 447, 453, 585 A.2d 1227 (1991). The only facts presented to the court, other than those contained in the administrative record, were those relating to aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Regulations, like statutes, do not exist in a vacuum. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 78, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>203 Conn. 63, 75, 523 A.2d 486 (1987). Ordinarily, their purported vagueness should be evaluated in the context of a specific factual situation, so that a court may resolve any ambiguities and, if necessary, interpret them in the light of those facts so as to avoid any potentially unconstitutional vagueness. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>218 Conn. 580, 588, 590 A.2d 447 (1991). In a declaratory judgment action, the party seeking to invalidate the regulation would be required to present sufficient facts to the court \u201cin order to meet its burden of demonstrating the [regulation\u2019s] adverse impact on some protected interest of its own, in its own particular case, and not merely under some hypothetical set of facts as yet unproven. ... In the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, facial invalidation of a [regulation] is improvident.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra. Similarly, in this case, the court\u2019s facial invalidation of the regulation on vagueness grounds was improvident, because insufficient facts were presented to permit the court to apply and to evaluate the language of the regulation in a concrete factual setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>It is of no moment that not all of the bases of the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the regulation were constitutional. It cannot be disputed that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to the trial court was a \u201cgeneral attack\u201d; <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 563; on the validity of the regulation. As such, it involved questions in which many other property owners had an interest, and they should have been afforded the opportunity to intervene and be heard. Id.; see also <em>Cristofaro </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>11 Conn. App. 260, 263-64, 527 A.2d 255, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 810, 528 A.2d 1156 (1987) (nonconstitutional challenge to validity of subdivision regulation should have been made by way of declaratory judgment action, rather than by appeal from denial of subdivision application).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We recognize that our cases have not always been consistent in requiring a declaratory judgment action as the method by which to challenge the validity of zoning or planning regulations. Compare <em>Bottone </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>209 Conn. 652, 553 A.2d 576 (1989), <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>203 Conn. 14, 523 A.2d 467 (1987), <em>Aunt Hack Ridge Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 109, 273 A.2d 880 (1970), <em>Calve Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>143 Conn. 609, 124 A.2d 881 (1956), <em>Gohld Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>141 Conn. 135, 104 A.2d 365 (1954), <em>Cristofaro </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra (declaratory judgment actions), with <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985) (injunction), <em>New Milford </em>v. <em>SCA Services of Connecticut, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 146, 384 A.2d 337 (1974) (injunction), <em>Sonn </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>172 Conn. 156, 374 A.2d 159 (1976) (appeal), <em>Zenga </em>v. <em>Zebrowski, </em>170 Conn. 55, 364 A.2d 213 (1975) (appeal). Without attempting to reconcile all those cases, we think that the rationales behind the requirement of a declaratory judgment action apply to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 principal claim in the trial court was that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague. That claim falls squarely within both the rationale of <em>Cioffoletti, </em>and the additional rationale of requiring an adequate factual predicate for such a claim. Where, as here, the plaintiffs combine constitutional and unconstitutional attacks on a regulation, it serves judicial economy to require that the nonconstitutional claims of invalidity be presented to the court in the same action as the constitutional claims. It makes little procedural sense to balkanize the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges between a declaratory judgment action and an appeal. Since the declaratory judgment action can accommodate both the constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, whereas the statutory appeal may not, judicial economy suggests that the declaratory judgment action be the proper vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">This does not mean, however, that whenever a party wishes to challenge the validity of a local land use regulation, he must do so by a declaratory judgment action. There are many instances where, because of the procedural posture of the case, he may have no practical choice but to raise his challenge in the context of an appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We hold only that where, as here, the plaintiff mounts a general attack on the legislative enactment of a regulation, primarily based on constitutional vagueness grounds, and combines therewith nonconstitutional grounds for the regulation\u2019s invalidity, he must do so by a declaratory judgment action rather than by an appeal from the enactment. Thus, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>tiffs in this case should have brought a declaratory judgment action in order to raise their challenges to the facial invalidity of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In this case, the only claim raised by the plaintiffs that does not come within the rationale of requiring a declaratory judgment action is their claim that the enactment of the regulation constituted a taking of their properties without just compensation. That claim does not involve a general challenge to the validity of the regulation. A landowner has the burden of establishing that a land use regulation amounts to a taking of his particular property. See <em>DeForest &amp; Hotchkiss Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>152 Conn. 262, 271-72, 205 A.2d 774 (1964). This ordinarily involves a showing that, on the particular facts of the case, the regulation \u201c \u2018practically destroys [the property\u2019s] value for any permitted use to which it can reasonably be put . . . \u201d <em>Primerica </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 85, 98, 558 A.2d 646 (1989), quoting <em>State National Bank </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 99, 106, 239 A.2d 528 (1968). Although generally we would remand to the trial court any issue that it did not resolve, we see no reason to do so in this case. The record establishes without question that the plaintiffs made no attempt to prove a taking. We are not inclined to remand to the trial court a claim of parties on which they made no attempt to present evidence in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\"> The plaintiffs are Stephen C. Bombero, Ronald M. Bombero, William J. Buckley, Eleanora B. Carpenter, Ellen C. Daly, Dorothy Grabowski, Edmond Fenyes, Mary Fenyes, Frank Minardi and Kathleen Minardi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> The schedule in article III of the zoning regulations, referred to in the amendment, defines the minimum lot sizes for the various zones; those sizes range from one acre in Residence AAA to three acres in Industrial I-L3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\"> Section 1 of chapter IX of the subdivision regulations, prior to the amendment at issue in this case, provided as follows: \u201crecommendations.
