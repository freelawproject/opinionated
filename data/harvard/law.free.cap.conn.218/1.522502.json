We conclude that this is so and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> complaint alleged, inter alia, that on September 23, 1986, Jason Heigl, a tenth grade student at New Canaan High School, left the school grounds, pursuant to the defendant board of education\u2019s open campus policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in a vehicle operated by another student. The vehicle subsequently was involved in a one-car accident. On September 30, 1986, Jason Heigl died of injuries sustained as a consequence of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">The plaintiffs alleged further that the defendant failed to exercise due care in supervising the town\u2019s high school students. The trial court, <em>Lewis, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the complaint, concluding that a board of education is an agent of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>and, therefore, is immune from tort liability by reason of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The plaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint alleging that the board of education had failed to supervise properly the town\u2019s high school students and had exceeded its statutory authority by implementing an open campus policy that allowed students to leave the high school during unscheduled times without permission. The trial court again granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the amended complaint and, upon the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead over, rendered judgment for the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 157. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the matter to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The two issues presented on appeal are whether the defendant is immune from tort liability because either: (1) the town board of education is an agent of the state and is protected by the doctrine of sovereign immunity; or (2) the town board of education, in adopting an open campus policy, is engaged in a discretionary activity and is protected by the doctrine of governmental immunity. We conclude that the defendant was engaged in a legislative function requiring the exercise of independent judgment or discretion in establishing the open campus policy, and therefore is insulated from tort liability under the doctrine of governmental immunity. We need not, therefore, decide the first issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">A town board of education can be an agent of the state for some purposes and an agent of the munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>pality for others. See, e.g., <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>187 Conn. 94, 101, 444 A.2d 907 (1982). A town board of education thus potentially enjoys immunity under two different theories of immunity for acts carried out within its governmental capacity. For example, \u201c[w]e have long recognized the common-law principle <em>[of sovereign </em>immunity] that the state cannot be sued without its consent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 342, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981). Alternatively, \u201c[a]t common law, Connecticut municipalities enjoy <em>governmental immunity, </em>in certain circumstances, from liability for their tortious acts.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ryszkiewicz </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>193 Conn. 589, 593, 479 A.2d 793 (1984); see <em>Evon </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>211 Conn. 501, 505, 559 A.2d 1131 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not apply in this case because the board of education was acting as an agent of the town, and not the state, in establishing the open campus policy. The plaintiffs claim further that the board is not protected by the doctrine of governmental immunity because its decision to establish the open campus policy was a ministerial, not a discretionary, act and, as a result, is excepted from the protection afforded by the doctrine. <em>See Rupp </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>417 So. 2d 658, 665 (Fla. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">A municipality\u2019s potential liability for its tortious acts is limited by the common law principle of governmental immunity. <em>Ryszkiewicz </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>193 Conn. 589, 593, 479 A.2d 793 (1984). Governmental immunity, however, is not a blanket protection for all official acts. For example, \u201c \u2018[a] municipality is immune from liability for the performance of governmental acts as distinguished from ministerial acts. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>omitted.) <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>208 Conn. 161, 167, 544 A.2d 1185 (1988).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u201cThis court has . . . discussed extensively the difference between a ministerial and a discretionary act.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>supra, 167. \u201cGovernmental acts are performed wholly for the direct benefit of the public and are supervisory or discretionary in nature. ... On the other hand, ministerial acts are performed in a prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment or discretion as to the propriety of the action.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gauvin </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>187 Conn. 180, 184, 445 A.2d 1 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The plaintiffs allege that the defendant board failed in the exercise of a \u201cministerial duty\u201d and thus is not protected by governmental immunity. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the death of the decedent was \u201ccaused by the negligence of the New Canaan Board of Education . . . <em>by promulgating a policy </em>which permitted students to leave campus during unscheduled times without . . . supervision.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">The act of promulgating a policy, however, is a discretionary activity. A policy, by definition, is \u201ca definite course or method of action selected from among alternatives . . . to guide and determine present and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>future decisions.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. The fact that a policy is enacted \u201cto guide . . . future decisions\u201d indicates that the board was engaged in a legislative, and therefore discretionary, activity. See also <em>Spitzer </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>113 Conn. 84, 87, 154 A. 157 (1931). Furthermore, the fact that the board chose to select an open campus policy from among various alternatives indicates that the exercise of judgment was involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">That the board\u2019s actions were not ministerial is supported by the fact that General Statutes \u00a7 10-221 (a) and (b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> grant local boards of education certain powers including, inter alia, the authority to \u201cimplement written policies concerning . . . attendance . . . .\u2019\u2019By its very terms, therefore, \u00a7 10-221 permits local boards significant latitude in selecting an appropriate student attendance policy. As a result, therefore, it cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>said that the board was acting \u201cin a prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment\u201d as would be true of a ministerial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The plaintiffs claim, however, that the defendant had a duty, implicit in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-240, 10-184 and 10-15,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to supervise the students during the hours for school attendance and, therefore, could not allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>them to leave the school without supervision. The plaintiffs argue that the \u201cduty to supervise high school students is generally ministerial in nature\u201d and therefore the board is not protected by governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Neither the General Statutes nor our decisional law has ever stated that a board of education has a specific duty to supervise high school students. Even if such a duty exists, actions pursuant to such a duty are discretionary if they \u201c \u2018are performed wholly for the direct benefit of the public . . . \u201d <em>Gordon v. Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>208 Conn. 161, 167-68, 544 A.2d 1185 (1988).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cIf the duty imposed ... by the statute is of such a nature that the performance of it will affect an individual in a manner different in kind from the way it affects the public at large, the statute is one which imposes ... a duty to the individual . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Leger v. Kelley, </em>142 Conn. 585, 590-91, 116 A.2d 429 (1955). If, on the other hand, \u201cno one individual is affected . . . in a manner different from other members of the general public . . . [t]he duty imposed [is] . . . public . . . .\u201d Id., 591. Pursuant to its authority under the General Statutes, the board of education in this case established a policy that affected every member of the student population of New Canaan High School in the same manner. There is no suggestion that the decedent was singled out by the policy. Thus, the board was acting for the public benefit and was not discharging an affirmative duty toward an identifiable individual student. As a result, any action by the board in this regard was discretionary and therefore protected from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">We conclude that the board of education was engaged in a discretionary activity in establishing the open campus policy. As a result, the board is immune from tort liability by reason of the doctrine of governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>immunity. The trial court therefore correctly determined that the complaint failed to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-11\"> The plaintiffs Paul Heigl and Nancy Heigl are the administrators of the estate of Jason Heigl.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-12\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint describes the board\u2019s open campus policy as a policy that \u201cpermitted tenth, eleventh and twelfth graders from New Canaan High School to leave campus for personal or school business during unscheduled time without requiring permission from school officials or parents and without supervision of off-campus activities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\"> The defendant filed a cross appeal claiming that the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint was substantially similar to their original' complaint and that therefore the trial court improperly sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 objection to their request to revise the amended complaint. See <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>183 Conn. 177, 180-82, 439 A.2d 296 (1981); <em>Good Humor Corporation </em>v. <em>Ricciuti, </em>160 Conn. 133, 136-37, 273 A.2d 886 (1970); 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1982 Sup.) \u00a7 113 (d). Because we decide this case on the issue of governmental immunity, we do not address the merits of the cross appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\"> We note that governmental immunity is subject to other qualifications not germane to this case. For example, the question of the extent of immunity granted a municipal employee as opposed to a municipal agency is not before us. See <em>Evon </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>211 Conn. 501, 505, 559 A.2d 1131 (1989). In addition, a municipality can be liable for even discretionary acts if they were committed maliciously or intentionally. See <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>208 Conn. 161, 167, 544 A.2d 1185 (1988). In addition, we do not address the various inapplicable exceptions to the doctrine of governmental immunity established by statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 13-149; see also 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 895C, comment (e); note, \u201cThe Official Responsibility Rule and its Implications for Municipal Liability in Connecticut: <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Town of Stonington, </em>\u201d15 Conn. L. Rev. 641, 644-45 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\"> One reason for granting a local government immunity from tort liability is that, as in this case, a civil trial may be an inappropriate forum for testing the wisdom of legislative actions. This is particularly true if there is no \u201creadily ascertainable standard by which the action of the government servant may be measured. . . .\u201d <em>Cady v.Plymouth-Carver Regional School District, </em>17 Mass. App. 211, 215, 457 N.E.2d 294 (1983), review denied, 391 Mass. 1103, 461 N.E.2d 1219 (1984). Thus, \u201c[t]he policy behind the exception is to avoid allowing tort actions to be used as a monkey wrench in the machinery of government decision making.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b32-12\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 10-221 provides in part: \u201cboard OF education to prescribe rules, (a) Boards of education shall prescribe rules for the management, studies, classification and discipline of the public schools and, subject to the control of the state board of education, the textbooks to be used; shall make rules for the control, within their respective jurisdictions, of school library media centers and approve the selection of books and other educational media therefor, and shall approve plans for public school buildings and superintend any high or graded school in the manner specified in this title.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">\u201c(b) Not later than July 1, 1985, each local and regional board of education shall develop, adopt and implement written policies concerning homework, attendance, promotion and retention.

Public schools including kindergartens shall be maintained in each town for a least one hundred eighty days of actual school sessions during each year. When public school sessions are cancelled for reasons of inclement weather or otherwise, the rescheduled sessions shall not be held on Saturday or Sunday. The state board of education may authorize the shortening of any school year on account of an unavoidable emergency and may authorize implementation of scheduling of school sessions to permit full year use of facilities which may not offer each child one hundred eighty days of school sessions within a given school year, but which assures an opportunity for each child to average a minimum of one hundred eighty days of school sessions per year during thirteen years of educational opportunity in the elementary and secondary schools. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and section 10-6, the state board of education may, upon application by a local or regional board of education, approve for any single school year, in whole or in part, a plan to implement alternative scheduling of school sessions which assures at least four hundred fifty hours of actual school work for nursery schools and kindergartens and at least nine hundred hours of actual school work for grades one to twelve, inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 10-184 provides in part: \u201cduties of parents.
