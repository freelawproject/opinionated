Fischer, </em>deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>C. Robert Satti, Sr., </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Peter McShane, </em>deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ANk\">The defendant was convicted of two counts of failure to assist a peace officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167b after a jury trial. He appealed from this judgment to the Appellate Court, claiming that: (1) the trial court had improperly permitted the state to amend the information by adding on the morning of trial the two counts on which he was found guilty; (2) \u00a7 53a-167b is unconstitutionally vague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>and overbroad; and (3) the jury should have been instructed to acquit the defendant if the officer\u2019s request for assistance was unlawful. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment; <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>22 Conn. App. 683, 578 A.2d 668 (1990); and the defendant petitioned for certification to appeal to this court. We granted the petition for certification limited to the following questions: (1) \u201cMay the defendant belatedly raise the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167b?\u201d and (2) \u201cIs the statute constitutional?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>216 Conn. 820, 581 A.2d 1057 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">At the time we granted certification, we had not decided <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991), in which the issue of the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-167b had been raised in the trial court by a motion to dismiss. That court resolved the issue by determining that the statute was invalid as applied to a \u201cstatement of the essential facts\u201d as alleged by the state pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 625. In our opinion in <em>Floyd, </em>we regarded the ruling of the trial court as \u201ctantamount to a facial invalidation of the statute.\u201d Id., 75. We construed \u00a7 53a-167b to authorize an official \u201cto command assistance in the execution of his duties only when circumstances render the command both necessary and reasonable.\u201d Id., 94. Ultimately we concluded that \u201cthe statute is not facially unconstitutional under the fourth or fourteenth amendments\u201d and reversed the judgment of dismissal. Id., 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In the present appeal, the failure of the defendant to raise the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-167b at trial leaves the record inadequate for a fair consideration of whether the statute was unconstitutionally applied to the circumstances under which he refused four requests to open the door of his apartment that were made by police officers over a period of several minutes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 240, 567 A.2d 823 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>(1989). The principal focus of the defendant on appeal to this court is upon his claim that \u00a7 53a-167b is facially invalid for vagueness. We resolved that claim adversely to him in <em>Floyd </em>by rejecting the identical claim in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that certification to appeal in this case was improvidently granted and that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
