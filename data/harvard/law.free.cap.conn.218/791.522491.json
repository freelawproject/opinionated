His incarceration resulted from his conviction of a crime committed in Connecticut for which he was originally sentenced on February 16,1979, to a term of imprisonment of not less than twenty years nor more than forty years. His sentence was later modified to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years nor more than twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">While the petitioner was in custody in Connecticut, but prior to his Connecticut conviction, prosecuting officials in New York notified the Connecticut authorities of criminal charges pending against the petitioner in New York and asked that a detainer be lodged against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the petitioner pertaining to those charges. On March 5, 1979, following the petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentencing in Connecticut, the New York authorities requested temporary custody of the petitioner pursuant to Article IV of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 16,1979, the petitioner was notified by Connecticut officials of the request for his temporary custody by New York prosecuting authorities and was asked to sign a form waiving extradition. The petitioner refused to sign such a waiver. Thereafter, on April 2, 1979, the governor of Connecticut was notified of New York\u2019s request that it be granted temporary custody of the petitioner for the purpose of placing the petitioner on trial in New York on New York\u2019s outstanding criminal charges. On April 19,1979, the governor of Connecticut gave notice that she did not disapprove of New York\u2019s request. See Interstate Agreement on Detainers, General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, Art. IV (a). Accordingly, on August 9,1979, temporary custody of the petitioner was transferred to the New York authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The petitioner\u2019s trial on New York\u2019s criminal charges commenced on April 4, 1980. On May 7, 1980, he was convicted of those charges, and on September 5,1980, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment in New York of not less than fifteen years nor more than life. He was thereafter returned to Connecticut to complete the service of his Connecticut sentence. Subsequently, the New York authorities lodged a detainer with the respondent warden based on the petitioner\u2019s conviction in New York. The petitioner appealed his New York conviction in the courts of that state without success, until his appeal rights were exhausted in 1983. Therefore, when the petitioner is paroled or discharged from his Connecticut sentence, if the New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>detainer filed against him is valid, he will be turned over to the New York authorities to serve his sentence in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The petitioner, however, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Superior Court in Connecticut. In his petition he alleged that the New York detainer that is lodged against him as a result of his New York conviction should be dismissed and removed from his file because his presence in New York for trial was obtained by a procedure that was in violation of Article IV of the I AD.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The habeas court, as a threshold issue, found that it had the authority to dismiss the New York detainer if the procedure used to obtain the petitioner\u2019s presence in New York for trial violated the IAD. See <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>203 Conn. 494, 498-99, 525 A.2d 502 (1987). The habeas court went on to find that the holding of the United States Supreme Court in the case of <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 101 S. Ct. 703, 66 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1981), which was decided while the petitioner\u2019s New York conviction was on direct review, required a pretransfer hearing for the petitioner before he could lawfully be transferred to New York for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\"><em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra, was an action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the alleged violation, by Pennsylvania officials, of the respondent Adams\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>rights under the IAD. The IAD is a uniform act that, as previously noted, is codified in Connecticut as General Statutes \u00a7 54-186. In <em>Cuyler, </em>the United States Supreme Court determined that Article IV of the IAD,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides for the involuntary transfer of prisoners serving a term of imprisonment in one state to another state for trial on pending criminal charges, requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>that such prisoner be afforded a pretransfer hearing substantially in accord with \u00a7 10 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, prior to the transfer of the prisoner from the sending state to the receiving state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <em>Cuyler </em>court found that the respondent Adams, who had not been afforded such a hearing, stated a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra, 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The habeas court, relying primarily on <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, reh. denied, 490 U.S. 1031, 109 S. Ct. 1771, 104 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1989), determined that <em>Cuyler, </em>which was decided after the petitioner had been transferred to, and tried, convicted and sentenced in New York, but while his case was still on direct review, was to be given retroactive effect and therefore was to be applied to the petitioner\u2019s habeas claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The habeas court concluded that the application of <em>Cuyler </em>to the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>claim required the dismissal of New York\u2019s postconviction detainer lodged at Somers because the petitioner had failed to receive a pretransfer hearing prior to his removal to New York. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\"><em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>supra, holds generally that, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be announced in or applied to cases that are on collateral review. The court in <em>Teague </em>also reiterated the view it had expressed in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 322-23, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1987), that \u201c 'failure to apply a newly declared <em>constitutional </em>rule to criminal cases pending on direct review violates basic norms of <em>constitutional </em>adjudication.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>supra, 304. The <em>Teague </em>court made clear, however, as did the <em>Griffith </em>court, that the court had reference to <em>constitutional </em>rules of criminal procedure when it mandated the application of newly announced rules of criminal procedure to cases still on direct review at the time the rules were announced. See <em>Diggs </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>833 F.2d 439, 442 (3d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 979, 108 S. Ct. 1277, 99 L. Ed. 2d 488, reh. denied, 486 U.S. 1018, 108 S. Ct. 1759, 100 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1988).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\"><em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra, was not decided on constitutional grounds. <em>Cuyler </em>resolved a conflict among divided federal courts of appeal and state courts as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the proper statutory construction of Article IV of the IAD. Id., 435-36. There is nothing in <em>Cuyler </em>to suggest a constitutional basis for the rule it announced relating to the construction of Article IV. Further, there is nothing in <em>Teague </em>or <em>Griffith </em>that suggests that nonconstitutional rules of criminal procedure are to be given retroactive effect. \u201cThere is no reason to apply the <em>Griffith </em>[or <em>Teague] </em>constitutional retroactivity holding here as the [IAD] is \u2018nothing more than a set of procedural rules . . . .\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>574 F.2d 164, 167 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 437 U.S. 907, 98 S. Ct. 3097, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1138 (1978). Therefore, a violation of the [IAD] is not an infringement of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Diggs </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>supra, 442. Because we conclude that <em>Cuyler </em>did not announce a <em>constitutional </em>procedural rule, the habeas court should not have accorded <em>Cuyler </em>retroactive application to the petitioner under <em>Teague </em>and <em>Griffith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Furthermore, <em>Cuyler </em>was a case brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It was not a habeas corpus proceeding or a criminal case. The most that can be said for <em>Cuyler, </em>therefore, is that it is precedent for the proposition that the petitioner may have a viable \u00a7 1983 claim. We have been unable to find any authority, however, nor has the petitioner directed us to any, that suggests that <em>Cuyler </em>requires dismissal of a posteonviction detainer in a habeas action because of the lack of a pretransfer hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The judgment of the habeas corpus court is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Although I agree with the majority that the habeas petition must be dismissed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>the judgment of the habeas court reversed, I would reach that result upon the ground that the petition should have been dismissed at the outset for lack of jurisdiction over the state of New York, the validity of whose judgment convicting the petitioner is under attack in this proceeding. The detainer lodged against the petitioner is based on the New York judgment and authorizes the respondent to hold him in custody for delivery to New York officials when his Connecticut sentence has been served. The detainer, however, is simply a device for enforcement of the New York judgment and must be honored so long as that judgment remains in force. The petitioner purports to seek merely the \u201cdismissal of the conviction detainer\u201d and not to \u201coverturn the New York criminal conviction.\u201d This, however, is a distinction without a difference, as the majority implicitly recognizes by addressing the validity of the New York judgment and holding that the procedural rule announced in <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 101 S. Ct. 703, 66 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1981), is not retroactive and thus cannot impair that judgment or the detainer filed pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Because the validity of the detainer that the petitioner concedes he is attempting to have dismissed is inextricably linked to the validity of the New York judgment, this court cannot properly consider the issue raised without the presence of New York in this suit. That state has the primary interest in upholding the validity of the detainer it has filed as a means of assuring delivery of the petitioner to its custody upon the expiration of his Connecticut sentence. The respondent warden, representing this state, has no significant interest in the suit because the petitioner will have satisfied his obligation for the crimes he has committed in this state before the detainer becomes operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">In <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>203 Conn. 494, 525 A.2d 502 (1987), on which the trial court relied in concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>it had jurisdiction over this petition, we held that under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, Connecticut, as the \u201csending\u201d state had jurisdiction to entertain an action by a prisoner seeking to invalidate detainers filed pursuant to the IAD by Massachusetts as the \u201creceiving state\u201d for the purpose of prosecuting charges against the prisoner in that state. The postjudgment detainer filed by New York against this petitioner, however, is not based on the IAD, which involves only pretrial detainers, but upon a judgment of a sister state to which we are constitutionally obliged to give \u201cfull faith'and credit.\u201d The validity of any judgment can properly be considered only when all those having a legal interest therein have been made parties to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Because the state of New York is an indispensable party to an action challenging the validity of the judgment it has obtained against the petitioner, the habeas court lacked jurisdiction to consider the issues raised in the petition, which relate wholly to the validity of the New York judgment. So far as the record discloses, the state of New York has not even been given notice of this proceeding, despite the fact that its interest is \u201cof such a nature that a final decree cannot be made without either affecting that interest, or leaving the controversy in such condition that its final termination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience.\u201d <em>Shields </em>v. Barrow, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 130, 139, 15 L. Ed. 158 (1855). \u201c[F]air notice is an essential prerequisite to any kind of judgment.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 5, comment b. Notice, however, would not satisfy the jurisdictional requirement for the presence of New York as a party in this litigation, in which the outcome must turn upon the validity of its judgment. Since we have no jurisdiction over an indispensable party to the controversy raised by the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>tion, I would reverse the judgment and remand the case to the habeas court with direction to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
