J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">The issues in this appeal arise out of a dispute concerning the sale of two integrated computer systems that failed to meet their purchaser\u2019s needs for accurate documentation. The plaintiff, Latham &amp; Associates, Inc. (vendor), filed a complaint to recover the unpaid purchase price for computer hardware and software delivered to the defendant, William Raveis Real Estate, Inc. (purchaser). The purchaser, claiming misrepresentation and breach of warranty, denied its own liability and sought, in a counterclaim, to recover damages as well as the return of moneys paid to the vendor. The trial court, after a hearing, found the issues for the purchaser, both on the complaint and on the counterclaim, but limited the purchaser\u2019s recovery to $81,500, representing a return of its payments for software. The vendor filed an appeal in the Appellate Court, which we transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The trial court found the following facts. The purchaser is a real estate company that sought computerized capacity to provide efficient interconnection between its own multiple offices and the various banks with which it dealt. The vendor, aware of the purchaser\u2019s needs and of the purchaser\u2019s reliance on the vendor\u2019s expertise to satisfy these needs, undertook to provide two computer systems that would meet these needs. To persuade the purchaser that it had the capacity to undertake these responsibilities, the vendor mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>represented the extent of its expertise in creating functioning computer systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The parties entered into two contracts for the delivery of computer systems. The first contract, dated October 15,1982, called for the vendor to deliver hardware and software for a so-called real estate system. The purchaser made all scheduled payments under this contract. The second contract, dated March 25,1984, called for the vendor to develop and install a second computer system, the so-called mortgage system. Because of dissatisfaction with the performance of the software tendered under both contracts, the purchaser did not fully pay license fees or software support charges for the mortgage system.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The vendor\u2019s complaint sought to recover for the amounts unpaid on the mortgage system, while the purchaser\u2019s counterclaim sought to recover the payments it had made, and damages it had incurred, with respect to the software on both the real estate system and the mortgage system. The trial court found that, for both computer systems, despite its contractual representations to the contrary, the vendor was never able to provide software that reliably delivered the information sought by the purchaser. The trial court also found, however, that the purchaser had not presented a sufficient factual basis for its alleged right to recover certain elements of damages for the vendor\u2019s nonperformance. The trial court therefore rendered judgment against the vendor on its complaint and in favor of the purchaser on its counterclaim for return of the software contract price, in the amount of $61,750 for the real estate system and $19,750 for the mortgage system, for a total recovery of $81,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The vendor\u2019s appeal from this judgment focuses on the merits of the judgment on the purchaser\u2019s counterclaim. The vendor does not contest the trial court\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ing of fact that the two computer systems that it furnished the purchaser did not fulfill the parties\u2019 expectations for reliable data retrieval. The vendor does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law that article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-101 through 42a-2-725; governs the transactions between the parties, even though the mortgage system contemplated a licensing arrangement rather than an outright sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The vendor has, however, raised thirteen other issues concerning various procedural and evidentiary rulings of the trial court. Most of these claims rest on factual assumptions that the trial court rejected. All of them suffer from the difficulty that appellate pursuit of so large a number of issues forecloses the opportunity for fully reasoned discussion of pivotal substantive concerns. A shotgun approach does a disservice both to this court and to the party on whose behalf it is presented. We do not reverse the judgment of a trial court on the basis of challenges to its rulings that have not been adequately briefed. Practice Book \u00a7 4065; <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>216 Conn. 458, 482, 582 A.2d 190 (1990); <em>Liscio </em>v. <em>Liscio, </em>204 Conn. 502, 507, 528 A.2d 1143 (1987); see <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>210 Conn. 721, 732, 557 A.2d 116 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The most important issue before us, which impinges on both parts of the purchaser\u2019s counterclaim, is whether a purchaser may recover the moneys paid for a dysfunctional computer system, on a theory of breach of express warranty, without expert testimony to identify the cause for the computer system\u2019s generation of inaccurate data. The vendor maintains that the purchaser must present expert testimony in order to rule out the possibility of user error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The need for expert testimony to establish a breach of warranty for computer systems is a question of first impression in this state and elsewhere. As a rule, expert testimony is required \u201cwhen the question involved goes beyond the field of the ordinary knowledge and experience of judges or jurors.\u201d <em>Bader </em>v. <em>United Orthodox Synagogue, </em>148 Conn. 449, 454, 172 A.2d 192 (1961); <em>Aspiazu </em>v. <em>Orgera, </em>205 Conn. 623, 630-31, 535 A.2d 338 (1987); <em>Toomey </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>161 Conn. 204, 210, 286 A.2d 293 (1971); <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Department of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 350, 64 A.2d 330 (1949); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7.16.5. We have not had the occasion to apply this principle in the context of computer dysfunction. In other jurisdictions, because expert testimony about the causes of a computer system\u2019s dysfunction was produced, the courts were not confronted with the sufficiency of the evidence claim that the vendor makes in this case. See, e.g., <em>Burroughs Corporation </em>v. <em>Chesapeake Petroleum &amp; Supply Co., </em>282 Md. 406, 408, 384 A.2d 734 (1978); <em>In re Cadillac V8-6-4 Class Action, </em>93 N. J. 412, 427, 461 A.2d 736 (1983); <em>Segall </em>v. <em>Ben\u2019s Truck Parts, Inc., </em>5 Wash. App. 482, 483, 488 P.2d 790 (1971). Even in <em>Cricket Alley Corporation </em>v. <em>Data Terminal Systems, Inc., </em>240 Kan. 551, 665, 732 P.2d 719 (1987), on which the purchaser relies for its expansive language, an expert found fault with the equipment delivered by the provider of the computer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">On the present record, we are not persuaded that we should adopt a hard-and-fast requirement for expert evidence in every case of dissatisfaction with the output produced by computer systems. Three significant facts support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that expert testimony was not required in this case. First, the purchaser\u2019s burden of proof in this case was attenuated by virtue of the trial court\u2019s finding that the purchaser\u2019s right to return of the software purchase price was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>grounded in the purchaser\u2019s exercise of its right of rejection under article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Unlike the situation of a buyer who has accepted goods despite their nonconformity, who must assume the burden \u201cto establish any breach\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 42U-2-607;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a rejecting buyer need only demonstrate that \u201cthe tender of delivery fail[s] in any respect to conform to the contract . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-601.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court found that the vendor had not sustained its burden of proving that malfunctioning of the computer systems was caused by personnel failures attributable to the purchaser. Second, despite the trial court\u2019s ruling that expert testimony was unnecessary, the record discloses that the purchaser introduced some expert testimony about deficiencies in certain aspects of the vendor\u2019s software programs. Third, at least with respect to the real estate computer system, the purchaser relied on representations by the vendor that included the promise of support services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>that inferentially encompassed some vendor responsibility for the work product of the purchaser\u2019s employees. In these circumstances, given the trial court\u2019s unchallenged finding that the computer software did not perform in accordance with the expectations of the parties, the court could reasonably conclude that the purchaser had produced sufficient evidence to sustain its recovery of the purchase price without expert testimony detailing the cause of the software failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The vendor has raised several other issues concerning the purchaser\u2019s recovery of the software purchase price on its counterclaim with respect to the real estate computer system. The vendor\u2019s appeal renews three defenses to this counterclaim, which the trial court rejected, alleging: (1) the running of the statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-725;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) an accord and satisfaction arising out of the subsequent negotiation of the mortgage system contract; and (3) a waiver arising out of a written acceptance form signed by an employee of the purchaser. In light of the trial court\u2019s factual findings, the vendor\u2019s further pursuit of these claims does not warrant extensive discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">To sustain its affirmative defense that the purchaser\u2019s counter claim was time barred, the vendor had to establish the purchaser\u2019s noncompliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>requirements of \u00a7 42a-2-725.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For this purpose, the vendor had the burden of proving the date on which \u201ctender of delivery [was] made,\u201d because delivery is what starts the running of article 2\u2019s statute of limitations. The record shows that the vendor did not satisfy this burden. It asserted that the statute began to run on October 15,1982, but that was the date when the real estate system contract was negotiated. Delivery of the hardware required for the real estate system was not completed until 1983, and delivery of the software was arguably never completed. On this factual record, the vendor has not established its affirmative defense under \u00a7 42a-2-725.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The vendor\u2019s affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction arises out of its claim that the mortgage system contract was intended to encompass and replace its obligations under the real estate system contract. The trial court made a factual finding to the contrary. Although the mortgage system contract contained a merger clause indicating that the written document was intended as a definitive integration of the agreement of the parties concerning the mortgage system; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-202;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court was entitled to find that the parties did not intend the execution of the mortgage system contract to discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the obligations previously assumed by the vendor in the real estate system contract. See <em>TIE Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kopp, </em>218 Conn. 281, 589 A.2d 329 (1991); <em>Halloran </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>126 Conn. 44, 46, 9 A.2d 290 (1939); 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts (1981) \u00a7 279.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The trial court equally rejected, on factual grounds, the vendor\u2019s assertion that an acceptance form signed by an employee of the purchaser constituted a waiver of all outstanding contract claims relating to the real estate system contract. The court found that the employee had no authority to bind the purchaser in this regard, and that she had been misled in her signature by representations on behalf of the vendor that the document was a mere formality. Without a persuasive challenge to these underlying factual findings, this defense on the part of the vendor cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The vendor\u2019s appeal raises a number of different claims with respect to the trial court\u2019s judgment permitting the purchaser to recover its software purchase price payments for the mortgage system. Procedurally, the vendor alleges that the purchaser failed to plead or prove its compliance with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-602<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for an effective rejection. Substantively, the vendor maintains that the purchaser\u2019s breach of warranty claims cannot be recon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>died with various dauses in the mortgage system contract that purport to disclaim the vendor\u2019s liability and to impose time limitations on the purchaser\u2019s recovery. These claims, too, run afoul of the trial court\u2019s dispositive factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The vendor\u2019s procedural argument focuses on the notification requirements that, under article 2, circumscribe a disappointed purchaser\u2019s rights to reject goods that are nonconforming. The vendor\u2019s contention that the purchaser was required to <em>plead </em>its compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 42a-2-602 cannot survive the trial court\u2019s finding that the vendor permitted evidence on the issue of notification of rejection to be introduced, without objection, during the trial. See <em>Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Marine Contracting Corporation, </em>203 Conn. 123, 132, 523 A.2d 1266 (1987); <em>Damora </em>v. <em>Christ-Janer, </em>184 Conn. 109, 112, 441 A.2d 61 (1981). The vendor\u2019s alternate contention that the purchaser failed to <em>prove </em>its compliance cannot stand in light of the trial court\u2019s finding that, during the pendency of the vendor\u2019s efforts to cure the defects in the software, the purchaser reasonably delayed exercising its right to reject the vendor\u2019s tender. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-508.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Until the possibility of cure had been exhausted, the purchaser did not have the opportunity to make the final inspection that is the prerequisite to an implied rejection under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-606 (1) (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>See <em>Plateq Corporation </em>v. <em>Machlett Laboratories, Inc., </em>189 Conn. 433, 441-42, 456 A.2d 786 (1983). Finally, despite the execution of an acceptance form by an employee who had no authority to bind the purchaser in this respect, the trial court could and did find that the purchaser never in fact accepted the software in the manner contemplated by the applicable provisions of article 2. These findings impliedly encompass the further factual inference that the purchaser\u2019s ultimate rejection and the accompanying notification of the vendor were, in the particular circumstances of this case, as \u201cseasonable\u201d as \u00a7 42a-2-602 requires. See <em>Contoura Business Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>TLD, Inc., </em>1 Conn. App. 690, 691-92, 474 A.2d 1265 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The vendor\u2019s substantive argument invokes the terms of the mortgage system contract as grounds for the unenforceability of the warranty claims on which the purchaser relies. This argument, too, founders on the factual findings of the trial court. The trial court found that the vendor, by its representation that it would develop a software system that would suitably meet the purchaser\u2019s demonstrated needs, had given an express warranty as that term is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-313.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Acme Pump Co. </em>v. <em>National Cash </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Register Co., </em>32 Conn. Sup. 69, 71-72, 337 A.2d 672 (1974). Such an express warranty may be actionable despite provisions in contractual disclaimers and limitation of liability clauses; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-316(1)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 42a-2-719 (2);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> if, as the trial court found, the restrictive clauses are factually determined to have been unreasonable or to have failed of their \u201cessential purpose.\u201d See <em>Conte </em>v. <em>Dwan Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>172 Conn. 112, 123, 374 A.2d 144 (1976). The court\u2019s further finding of the vendor\u2019s misrepresentation about the extent of its expertise in the development of comparable computer systems negates the vendor\u2019s assertion that the mortgage system contract, as a complete and exclusive integration of the agreement, excluded parol evidence about express warranties. A misrepresentation undermines the intentional adoption of an integrated writing that is an essential prerequisite to invocation of the parol evidence rule. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-202; see <em>TIE Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kopp, </em>supra; <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>189 Conn. 52, 56, 453 A.2d 771 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We have carefully examined the remaining issues raised by the vendor\u2019s appeal. These principally concern the provision of a transcript to the trial court and the manner in which the trial court calculated damages. Our examination of these contentions persuades us that they furnish no basis for reversal of the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-607 provides in relevant part: \u201ceffect of ACCEPTANCE; NOTICE OF BREACH; BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING BREACH AFTER ACCEPTANCE; NOTICE OF CLAIM OR LITIGATION TO PERSON ANSWERABLE over.
