The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the second district (commissioner) determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the named defendant, Dow Chemical Company, was so liable and accordingly ordered the defendant insurer, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to pay the plaintiff, Peter Levanti, an award of compensation benefits for a 15 percent back impairment. The compensation review division (review division) affirmed. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court and we thereafter transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed. In 1954 and in 1962, the plaintiff sustained injuries to his back during the course of his employment in the receiving department of Dow Chemical. Because our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did not provide specific benefits for back impairment until 1967; see Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 15, which amended General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 to provide specific benefits for back impairment; the plaintiff did not receive specific benefits for the injuries sustained in 1954 and 1962. Thereafter, the plaintiff was promoted to a position in Dow Chemical\u2019s traffic department that required minimal physical labor. In May, 1985, the plaintiff was returned to his previous position in the receiving department and on June 19, 1985, he sustained a third injury to his back during the course of his employment at Dow Chemical.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Following the third injury, the plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for total incapacity<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>from Dow Chemical pursuant to a voluntary agreement that had been approved by the commissioner. After his back injury had reached maximum medical improvement, the plaintiff sought a specific award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for permanent partial impairment of his back.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants contested liability for the entire impairment, claiming that they were not liable for that portion of the impairment attributable to the earlier back injuries, since our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did not provide specific indemnity benefits for back impairment either in 1954 or in 1962. In a finding and award, the commissioner determined that the plaintiff \u201cha[d] suffered a 15% permanent partial disability of the back as a result of the injury of June 19, 1985 which ha[d] been superimposed upon previous injuries or condition, the sum total of which ha[d] contrived to make the [plaintiff\u2019s] condition materially and substantially worse than had he suffered the injury of June 19, 1985 by itself alone\u201d and that, therefore, under \u00a7 31-349, Dow Chemical was \u201cliable for the full amount of the 15% permanent partial disability to the back.\u201d Accordingly, the commissioner ordered Aetna to pay the plaintiff seventy-eight weeks of compensation benefits. The defendants renewed their claim in the review division which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding and award.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The defendants claim that the commissioner\u2019s finding and award are unsupported by the evidence. This claim has two subparts. First, the defendants argue that because the evidence before the commissioner pertained solely to the plaintiff\u2019s physical impairment rather than to impairment of his earning capacity, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that following the injury in 1985, the plaintiff had a \u201cdisability\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-349. The defendants next argue that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs overall disability following his most recent injury was \u201cmaterially and substantially worse\u201d as a consequence of his previous injuries. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">An award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for permanent partial impairment of one\u2019s back is a specific indemnity award. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (b); J. Asselin, Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice Manual (1985) pp. 151-54. \u201cSpecific benefits are benefits for the loss or loss of the use of specific body parts. <em>See Everett v. Ingraham, </em>150 Conn. 153, 155, 186 A.2d 798 (1962).\u201d <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>208 Conn. 576, 584, 546 A.2d 243 (1988); see also <em>Panico </em>v. <em>Sperry Engineering Co., </em>113 Conn. 707, 710, 156 A. 802 (1931). \u201c \u2018These [specific] benefits . . . are not paid as compensation for loss of earning power but to compensate the injured employee for the incapacity through life because of the loss or loss of use of the body member in question.\u2019 J. Asselin, supra, p. 151.\u201d <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>supra. Thus, \u201c[compensation in such cases is not dependent upon actual incapacity in whole or in part. <em>Franko </em>v. <em>Schollhorn Co., </em>93 Conn. 13, 104 Atl. 485 [1918].\u201d <em>Dombrozzi </em>v. <em>Gross &amp; Co., </em>112 Conn. 627, 629, 153 A. 780 (1931); see also J. Asselin, supra, pp. 151-54. In fact, \u201c[p]ermanent partial schedule awards are based on medical condition after maximum improvement has been reached and ignore wage loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>entirely.\u201d 2 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 57.13, p. 10-41. Nonetheless, \u201c[a] limited schedule is not inconsistent with the earnings-impairment principle [of workers\u2019 compensation law], provided that the items included are such that the conclusive presumption of probable actual wage loss is realistic and not fictitious. In addition, the loss must be obvious enough so that the reason for indulging the presumption-administrative convenience and prevention of litigation\u2014is also realistic.\u201d 2 A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 57.14 (a), p. 10-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In enacting the schedule of benefits set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> our legislature must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>presumed that the losses therein affected earning capacity, because any other construction would suggest that the section was intended to provide compensation solely for the body part itself, comparable to a tort recovery. This construction would be inconsistent with our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. \u201c[Wjorkers\u2019 compensation \u2018established almost a complete substitute for the common law of torts . . .\u2019\u201d since \u201cthe\u2018purpose of our Act ... is to give to the employee . . . compensation for the loss of wages accruing from the employee\u2019s injury.\u2019 <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Stratford Lumber Co., </em>105 Conn. 297, 303, 135 A. 574 (1926).\u201d <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 540, 494 A.2d 555 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Furthermore, in remarking on the defendants\u2019 apparent confusion between general incapacity benefits and specific benefits, the review division implicitly concluded that an award of specific benefits does not require a showing of impairment of earning capacity because the probability of wage loss is presumed. This interpretation of the review division \u201c \u2018warrants respect as the considered judgment of the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>mental agency vested with primary authority for enforcing our workers\u2019 compensation statutes.\u2019 <em>Felia </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>[214 Conn. 181, 188, 571 A.2d 89 (1990)], citing <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>168 Conn. 478, 493, 362 A.2d 785 (1975).\u201d <em>Ancona </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>217 Conn. 50, 56, 584 A.2d 454 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The defendants have failed to show that evidence of loss or loss of use of a body part compensable under \u00a7 31-308 (b) is insufficient to sustain a finding of disability under our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We conclude, therefore, that the evidence of the plaintiffs back impairment was sufficient to sustain the commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had a disability within the meaning of \u00a7 31-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The defendants\u2019 second assertion is that even if the evidence supported a finding of disability, it was inadequate to sustain the commissioner\u2019s finding that as a result of the earlier injuries, the plaintiff\u2019s overall disability following'the third injury was \u201cmaterially and substantially worse than had he suffered the injury of June 19, 1985 by itself alone.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 31-349. The commissioner determined that each of the three injuries had caused a 5 percent impairment of the plaintiff\u2019s back for an overall 15 percent back impairment. The commissioner then concluded that because the earlier injuries together had caused a 10 percent impairment, two-thirds of the overall disability, the disability after the third injury was materially and substantially worse than it would have been had the earlier injuries not occurred. According to the defendants, because the commissioner merely compared the impairment percentages and did not find that the injuries had \u201ccombined and merged,\u201d there was an insufficient basis on which to determine that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>resultant disability was materially and substantially greater. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u201cIt has always been accepted without question that the situation to which the Second Injury Fund applies consists of a <em>prior </em>noncompensable injury followed by and combining with a <em>subsequent </em>compensable injury.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 2 A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 59.32 (g), p.10-488. Contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertion, the prior impairment need not combine with the compensable injury in any special way, but must merely add something to the overall disability before the fund can become liable. 2 A. Larson, supra, p. 10-472. Thus, evidence that the preexisting impairment has materially increased the claimant\u2019s overall disability is sufficient to warrant application of \u00a7 31-349. See <em>Lovett </em>v. <em>Atlas Truck Leasing, </em>171 Conn. 577, 583, 370 A.2d 1061 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In this case, the commissioner determined that the prior injuries had caused a 10 percent back impairment while the third injury had caused a 5 percent back impairment for a total of 15 percent. The defendants do not challenge this finding. Because the earlier injuries increased the extent of the resultant disability by 200 percent, we conclude that the commissioner reasonably determined that the plaintiff\u2019s overall disability was materially and substantially greater as a result of the earlier injuries within the meaning of \u00a7 31-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The defendants claim that applying \u00a7 31-349 in cases such as this will lead to irrational results by imposing liability on employers for consequences a mere fraction of which are attributable to their employment. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Section 31-349 does not create liability. To the contrary, it is an apportionment statute that limits the liability of employers previously imposed. <em>Plesz </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corporation, </em>174 Conn. 181, 186, 384 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>363 (1978); <em>Lovett </em>v. <em>Atlas Truck Leasing, </em>supra, 582-83. According to the general rule of workers\u2019 compensation law, if an employee was injured during the course of his employment, an employer was liable to provide compensation for the full extent of the employee\u2019s disability, regardless of whether the disability was due, in part, to a preexisting condition or impairment. <em>Plesz </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corporation, </em>supra, 185; <em>Lovett </em>v. <em>Atlas Truck Leasing, </em>supra, 581-82.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, \u201cemployers were often held liable for the full consequences of work-related accidents suffered by their employees, even though those consequences were aggravated by preexisting disabilities.\u201d <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>H.O. Penn Machinery Co., </em>166 Conn. 352, 356, 349 A.2d 847 (1974). The legislature, cognizant of the hardships posed by the general rule, including discrimination against handicapped workers and employer liability for consequences not attributable to their employment; <em>Plesz </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corporation, </em>supra; <em>Lovett </em>v. <em>Atlas Truck Leasing, </em>supra, 582; enacted \u00a7 31-349 to limit the employer\u2019s liability to 104 weeks of compensation in situations where a claimant\u2019s disability following a work-related injury is materially and substantially greater as a result of an earlier injury or previous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In this case, because the award of compensation benefits was less than 104 weeks, the defendants had to pay the entire award. Nevertheless, if the resultant disability had warranted an award in excess of that amount, \u00a7 31-349 would have served to limit the defendants\u2019 liability. We conclude, therefore, that application of \u00a7 31-349 in cases such as this promotes rational results.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) The fact that an employee has suffered previous disability, or received compensation therefor, shall not preclude him from compensation for a later injury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting therefrom. If an employee who has previously incurred, by accidental injury, disease or congenital causes, total or partial loss of, or loss of use of, one hand, one arm, one foot or one eye, or who has other permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability by accident or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability, including total disability, less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and necessary medical care, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that part of such disability was due to prior accidential injury, disease or congenital causes. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. . . . Thereafter all responsibility for compensation and medical treatment shall be with the custodian of the second injury fund. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> Travelers Insurance Company and the Second Injury and Compensation Assurance Fund; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 et seq.; were also defendants in the plaintiff\u2019s action for workers\u2019 compensation benefits brought to the workers\u2019 compensation commission.

In scenario one, an employee sustains an injury dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ing the course of his employment. The employee had a preexisting 50 percent back impairment and following the work-related injury, his back impairment is 51 percent. According to the general rule of workers\u2019 compensation law, the employer would have been liable to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the entire 51 percent impairment; <em>Plesz </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corporation, </em>174 Conn. 181, 185-86, 384 A.2d 363 (1978); <em>Lovett </em>v. <em>Atlas Truck Leasing, </em>171 Conn. 577, 581-82, 370 A.2d 1061 (1976); however, \u00a7 31-349 applies in this case. Because the employee\u2019s total disability is materially and substantially greater as a result of his prior condition, the employer\u2019s liability is limited to payment of 104 weeks of benefits. Any further liability is allocated to the Second Injury Fund. General Statutes \u00a7 31-349. This apportionment of liability is rational because the greater increment of the total disability, 50 percent, was caused by a condition unrelated to the employee\u2019s present employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">In scenario two, an employee sustains an injury during the course of his employment.

There is no allocation to the Second Injury Fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-349, because it cannot be said that the employee\u2019s total disability is materially and substantially greater as a result of his preexisting condition. This result is rational because the greater increment of the total disability, 50 percent, was caused by the injury suffered while in the employer\u2019s employ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
