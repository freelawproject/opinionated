Because \u00a7 3006d provided a remedy that altered substantive marital rights and obligations, we conclude that the legislature intended it to be prospective in application. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court that the equitable decree of separate maintenance and support entered in 1953 in favor of the defendant, Doris G. Thorne, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>her action against the now deceased Lawrence S. Thorne (decedent), was not transformed into a decree of legal separation by virtue of the subsequent enactment of \u00a7 3006d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. The defendant and the decedent were married in Connecticut on January 2, 1939. Some years later, the couple experienced marital difficulties. On or about September 15, 1952, the defendant left the decedent to live elsewhere, taking with her the two minor children of the marriage, the plaintiffs, Sally T. Mia\u00f1o and Dana T. Tartoff. Shortly thereafter, on September 24,1952, the defendant commenced an equitable action against the decedent in the Superior Court alleging that he had been habitually cruel to her and had neglected to support her and the plaintiffs. She sought relief in the form of: \u201c(1) A decree requiring [the decedent] to support her and [the plaintiffs], and providing at least Twelve Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00) per month for that purpose; and a temporary allowance for the same amount; (2) A lump sum judgment in the amount of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00); [and] (3) Such other relief as to equity may appertain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">From the transcript of the subsequent trial, it is evident that the defendant and the decedent had reached an agreement regarding the financial orders to be issued by the court. The court rendered judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>accordance with the agreement on May 7,1953, ordering, among other things, that the decedent make monthly payments to the defendant for the support of her and the plaintiffs. Because of the parties\u2019 agreement, the issue of the decedent\u2019s alleged cruelty was never factually resolved, even though the court\u2019s memorandum of decision found all of the issues in favor of this defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">After the entry of the decree of separate maintenance and support, the defendant and the decedent continued to live separately up to and including the date of October 6, 1988, when the decedent died as a resident of West Palm Beach, Florida. It was later discovered that he had left a will naming the plaintiffs as the primary beneficiaries and residuary legatees of his estate. On January 25,1989, after the will had been submitted to probate in a Florida court, the defendant filed an application in that court seeking to exercise the election afforded to a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d under Florida law to claim a 30 percent share of the gross estate of a deceased spouse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 732.201, 732.207 (West 1976). The plaintiffs promptly challenged the defendant\u2019s status as the surviving \u201cspouse\u201d of the decedent by filing this action in the Connecticut Superior Court for a declaratory judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-29.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The defendant counterclaimed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>alleging that she was in fact the spouse of the decedent from the date of her marriage until the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Thereafter, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether the defendant remained married to the decedent until the date of his death. The plaintiffs argued that \u00a7 3006d applied retroactively to the decree of separate maintenance and support obtained by the defendant, and thus transformed the decree into one of legal separation. In addition, the plaintiffs maintained that the subsequent passage and retroactive application of Public Acts 1973, No. 73-373, \u00a7 7 (b) (1973 act),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> farther transformed the decree into one of legal separation \u201chav[ingj the effect of a decree dissolving the marriage,\u201d thereby giving the defendant and the decedent \u201cthe status of unmarried persons.\u201d The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The plaintiffs have presented two issues for our review: (1) whether the enactment in 1955 and retroactive application of \u00a7 3006d transformed the decree of separate maintenance and support entered in 1953 into a decree of legal separation; and (2) if the decree was so transformed, whether the passage and retro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>active application of the 1973 act further transformed the decree into one giving the defendant the status of an \u201cunmarried person.\u201d Because we hold that \u00a7 3006d does not apply retroactively, we need not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The starting point for our analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that \u00a7 3006d applied retroactively is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3. Section 55-3 provides: \u201cNo provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have a retrospective effect.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018obligations\u2019 referred to in the statute are those of substantive law.\u201d <em>Nagle </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>178 Conn. 180, 186, 423 A.2d 875 (1979); see <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>216 Conn. 523, 529, 582 A.2d 764 (1990). Accordingly, \u201cwe have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only.\u201d <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 467, 556 A.2d 145 (1989). This presumption is rebutted only when the legislature \u201c \u2018clearly and unequivocally\u2019 expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>200 Conn. 734, 741, 517 A.2d 610 (1986); <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>[194 Conn. 165, 174, 479 A.2d 1191 (1984)]; <em>Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>[184 Conn. 569, 572, 440 A.2d 220 (1981)].\u201d <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>supra, 468. Moreover, although we have presumed that procedural or remedial statutes are intended to apply retroactively absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary; <em>Citizens Against Pollution Northwest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>217 Conn. 143, 151, 584 A.2d 1183 (1991); \u201ca statute which, in form, provides but a change in remedy but actually brings about changes in substantive rights is not subject to retroactive application.\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>177 Conn. 327, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>332, 416 A.2d 1201 (1979). \u201cThe rule is one of obvious justice and prevents the assigning of a quality or effect to acts or conduct which they did not have or did not contemplate when they were performed.\u201d <em>Union Pacific R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Laramie Stock Yards Co., </em>231 U.S. 190, 199, 34 S. Ct. 101, 58 L. Ed. 179 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">While \u00a7 3006d was intended to provide a new remedy for spouses desiring to live apart,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the marital rights and obligations of spouses subject to a decree of legal separation were markedly different from those bound by an equitable decree of separate maintenance and support. The fundamental difference concerned the corollary marital rights and obligations of cohabitation and support. To obtain a decree of separate maintenance and support, an aggrieved spouse, typically a wife, was required to demonstrate in an equitable proceeding that she was \u201cjustified\u201d in living apart from her husband. <em>DeRosa </em>v. <em>DeRosa, </em>129 Conn. 409, 412, 28 A.2d 846 (1942). A wife alleging her husband\u2019s cruelty as a ground for the entry of the decree, for example, could prevail with a showing of \u201csomething less than conduct which would constitute intolerable cruelty as a ground for divorce. It [was] sufficient if the husband [had] made it intolerable in any way for his wife to live with him.\u201d <em>Kurzatkowski </em>v. <em>Kurzatkowski, </em>142 Conn. 680, 683, 116 A.2d 906 (1955); see <em>Cantiello </em>v. <em>Cantiello, </em>136 Conn. 685, 689, 74 A.2d 199 (1950); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>110 Conn. 277, 279, 147 A. 800 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The nature of the relief afforded by the decree of separate maintenance and support, however, was limited. Rather than authorizing a wife\u2019s continued separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>from her husband, the decree provided only temporary relief from her obligation to cohabit with him as an incident to her right to receive his support. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>134 Conn. 354, 356, 57 A.2d 622 (1948); see also 24 Am. Jur. 2d, Divorce and Separation \u00a7 4. A husband could at any time make a good faith offer of reconciliation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which would place his wife under an obligation to resume cohabitation if the original justification for her refusal to do so had passed. See <em>Kurzatkowski </em>v. <em>Kurzatkowski, </em>supra, 684; accord <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 358. If she unjustifiably rejected the offer of reconciliation, her right to support could be forfeited; see <em>Kurzatkowski </em>v. <em>Kurzatkowski, </em>supra, 683; <em>DeRosa </em>v. <em>DeRosa, </em>supra, 411; and she could be charged with willful desertion, a ground for divorce. See General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 7327; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra; see also 24 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">By comparison, the decree of legal separation available under \u00a7 3006d, while leaving the bulk of the statutory and common law rights and obligations of married persons intact,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> terminated the right and correspond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ing obligation of cohabitation, thereby authorizing the continued separation of the parties to the decree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 65, 69, 160 A.2d 501 (1960); see also <em>Pettis </em>v. <em>Pettis, </em>91 Conn. 608, 617-18, 101 A. 13 (1917) (discussing similar decree of divorce a menso et thoro); see generally 24 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 111; 1 H. Clark, Law of Domestic Relations (1987) \u00a7 7.4. Although cohabitation could be resumed at any time after the entry of the decree upon the mere filing of a written \u201cdeclaration of resumption\u201d; General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3006d; a wife could reject her husband\u2019s offer of reconciliation without jeopardizing her right to support or incurring a charge of willful desertion. See generally 24 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 111; 1 H. Clark, supra. A husband, on the other hand, could not invoke his right to his wife\u2019s cohabitation as an incident to his obligation to support her by simply improving his behavior and making the appropriate offer of reconciliation. 24 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 111; 1 H. Clark, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The evident basis for the distinction between the rights and obligations of married persons bound by the respective decrees was that a wife seeking a decree of legal separation, unlike a wife bringing an equitable action for separate maintenance and support, was required to demonstrate, \u201cin accordance with the procedures governing divorces,\u201d that she \u201cwould be entitled to a divorce.\u201d General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3006d. In other words, \u201c[t]he existence of statutory grounds for a divorce must be established in such proceedings, such grounds as would justify the court in finally terminating the marriage relationship.\u201d <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>supra, 70. A wife alleging that her husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>had treated her cruelly was therefore required to establish that his behavior rose to the level of \u201cintolerable cruelty,\u201d a statutory ground for divorce; see General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 7327; which entailed proof that \u201cthe cumulative effect of the [husband\u2019s] cruelty upon the suffering [wife] has become such that the public and personal objects of matrimony have been destroyed beyond rehabilitation . . . .\u201d <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>99 Conn. 427, 432, 122 A. 100 (1923); see also <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In view of the substantive disparity between the marital rights and obligations of spouses subject to the respective decrees, we presume that the legislature did not intend \u00a7 3006d retroactively to transform previously entered equitable decrees of separate maintenance and support, obtained upon a lesser degree of proof than that required for a divorce, into decrees of legal separation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have not directed our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>attention to any \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d language in \u00a7 3006d, nor do we find any upon an independent examination of the statute, that rebuts this presumption.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 3006d did not apply retroactively, and hence did not transform the equitable decree of separate maintenance and support obtained by the defendant into a decree of legal separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Since the decree was not so transformed, the subsequent passage of the 1973 act, limited in application by its terms to \u201cactions for divorce, annulment, and legal separation,\u201d could not have further transformed the decree into one giving the defendant the status of an \u201cunmarried person\u201d even if retroactively applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Sup. 1955)] Sec. 3006d. legal separation. In any case in which a divorce might be decreed the superior court, on petition of the party who would be entitled to a divorce, may decree a legal separation of the parties, which separation shall have in all respects the effect of a divorce, except that the parties shall not thereby be made free to marry any third person and except as hereinafter provided. Upon such petition the procedure shall be the same as in actions for divorce, and the court shall have the same power in all matters relating to temporary and permanent orders for alimony, custody and support of children, and to allowances, as in cases of divorce. The parties to such action may at any time resume marital relations, upon filing with the clerk of the superior court for the county in which the separation was decreed their written declaration of such resumption, signed, acknowledged and witnessed. Such declaration shall be entered upon the docket, under the entries relating to such petition.\u201d A related statute contemporaneously enacted was General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3007d, which provided: \u201cDIVORCE SUBSEQUENT TO LEGAL SEPARATION. At any time after the entry of a decree of legal separation, either party may petition the superior court in the county where such decree was entered for a decree finally dissolving and terminating the marriage, and if the court finds that the parties have not resumed marital relations since the entry of the decree of legal separation, it may enter a decree finally dissolving and terminating the marriage and may affirm or modify any existing orders and may enter any additional orders relating to alimony, custody and support of children and allowances as are usual in divorce cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that the defendant was married to the decedent on May 7,1953, the date of the entry of the decree of separate maintenance and support, but did not specifically address the issue of the retroactivity of General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3006d. The parties briefed and argued the issue before the court, however, and have treated the court\u2019s decision, for purposes of appeal, as also indicating that no subsequent statutory enactment retroactively altered the original decree. Therefore, we also treat the court\u2019s decision as including an implicit determination that \u00a7 3006d is not subject to retroactive application, and we affirm its decision on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> Counsel for the decedent stated at the hearing: \u201cI want it understood in the record now that the statements made by the [wife] relating to the conduct of the [husband are] categorically denied by the [husband] and will be denied if those allegations are made again in the future.

It must also appear from the character of the man that there is a reasonable probability that he will not again indulge in acts of cruelty. <em>DeRosa </em>v. <em>DeRosa, </em>129 Conn. 409, 411, 28 A.2d 846 (1942).\u201d <em>Kurzatkowski </em>v. <em>Kurzatkowski, </em>142 Conn. 680, 684, 116 A.2d 906 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\"> Despite the broad language of General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3006d stating that a decree of legal separation \u201cshall have in all respects the effect of a divorce, except that the parties shall not thereby be made free to marry any third person,\u201d the statute was construed to have the following limited effect: \u201cEach separated husband and wife retain[ed] all the statutory rights of property, inheritance and administration in the estate of the other together with all the obligations of the continuing marriage contract <em>except for those concerned with cohabitation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>22 Conn.

Bill No. 72 (1955 Sess.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\"> This conclusion is reinforced by a reading of the statute in conjunction with its concurrently enacted companion provision, General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3007d. See footnote 1, supra. Section 3007d permitted \u201ceither party\u201d to a legal separation decree to petition for and obtain a decree \u201cfinally dissolving and terminating the marriage\u201d upon a showing that cohabitation had not resumed since the entry of the legal separation decree. The dissolution decree available under \u00a7 3007d, although bearing a different label, was the functional equivalent of a decree of divorce, which could not, under the law existing in 1955, be obtained upon a mere showing of the absence of cohabitation, over a period of time. See General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 7327. Rather, it was necessary to establish \u201cfault\u201d on the part of the spouse against whom the divorce action was brought, i.e., the existence of a statutory ground for divorce. See General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 7327; see also <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 65, 69-70, 160 A.2d 501 (1960). The availability of a \u201cconversion divorce\u201d under \u00a7 3007d, however, was not considered a material change in the public policy of this state because it could be obtained only by parties to a legal separation decree that had been entered in accordance with General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3006d, which required, as a prerequisite to the entry of the decree, that the existence of a statutory ground for divorce be established. See General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3006d; see generally <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Because an equitable decree of separate maintenance and support could be obtained without establishing grounds for divorce; see, e.g., <em>Kurzatkowski </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>v. <em>Kurzatkowski, </em>142 Conn. 680, 683, 116 A.2d 906 (1955); the transformation of such decrees into decrees of legal separation by the retroactive application of \u00a7 3006d would have permitted either spouse bound by the equitable decree to obtain, under \u00a7 3007d, a decree finally dissolving and terminating the marriage without the requisite showing of \u201cfault.\u201d Such a result would have been inconsistent with \u201cthe long established policy of this State which regards marriage as a life <em>status </em>and indissoluble save for such causes as in effect repudiate and annul the marriage covenant.

Moreover, since the decedent\u2019s alleged habitual cruelty was never conclusively established in the defendant\u2019s action for separate maintenance and support, it would be particularly inappropriate to apply \u00a7 3006d retroactively in this case. Legislation will not be applied retroactively if \u201cgood sense and justice dictate otherwise.\u201d <em>East Village Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>173 Conn. 328, 332, 377 A.2d 1092 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> In this respect, we note that the statement accompanying the bill that ultimately became General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7 3006d stated that the legislation proposed by the bill \u201cwould not take away anyone\u2019s right to pursue present remedies.\u201d H.
