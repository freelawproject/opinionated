He has appealed from the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The sole ground of appeal briefed by the defendant was the claim that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that possession of heroin was a lesser included offense of the crime of sale of heroin. Of necessity, the defendant admits that unless this court reverses its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 52, 301 A.2d 547, he cannot prevail on this appeal. We adhere to our previous decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
