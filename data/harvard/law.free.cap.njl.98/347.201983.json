Unless it be properly certified within fifteen da3Ts after the judgment, the appeal must be dismissed. <em>Ervin </em>v. <em>Wohlfert, </em>76 <em>N. J. L. </em>430; <em>Berstecher </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>89 <em>Id. </em>426; <em>Galligan </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>97 <em>Id. </em>327; 116 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>486; 118 <em>Id. </em>211.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The answer made is that, though the transcript was not certified by the judge that tried the cause, it was certified in due time by another District Court judge sitting temporarily for the trial judge, pursuant to section 19 of the District Court act, and that such certificate is sufficient under the statute of 1905. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>259; <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We cannot accede to this view. At common law a review in error of trial rulings could be had only on a bill of exceptions sealed by the trial judge; and although the later use of a stenographer at the trial resulted in practice in a general reliance on the stenographic transcript as correctly exhibiting what occurred at the trial, it was never legally authoritative and the exceptions had to be sealed as before. By the Practice act of 1912 \u201cbills of exceptions\u201d were abolished, but even this did not give the stenographic transcript an authoritative status, as is shown in <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Public Service Railway Co., </em>94 <em>N. J. L. </em>157, 160, where the certificate of the trial judge was called for by the court to settle a dispute as to what he had actually said to the jury. This was of course in line with the general rule that the appellate court will treat as conclusive the certificate of the lower court as to what occurred before it. 4 <em>C. J. </em>512 <em>et seq.; </em>see <em>Frisch </em>v. <em>Warnke, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>456, 457; <em>Pinkney </em>v. <em>Ayres, </em>21 <em>Id. </em>694; <em>Paterson, &amp;c., Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>24 <em>Id. </em>535; <em>Meirs </em>v. <em>Bussom, </em>57 <em>Id. </em>383.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The District Court act permits the parties, or their attorneys, in a ease where no stenographer has been appointed to stipulate a state of the case for appeal, but when they cannot agree, the case must of course be settled by the judge, and in that event only the judge that tried the cause could settle the state of the case for appeal. <em>Tenement-House Board </em>v. <em>Schlechter, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>88, 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In cases where there is a stenographer, the language of the statute plainly indicates that the trial judge is to certify the state of the case. When application is made to the judge of a District Court to appoint a stenographer to transcribe the proceedings, &amp;e., \u201cit shall be the duty of the said judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>designate a stenographer * * * and if an appeal be taken * * * the transcript of said proceedings and testimony made by said stenographer, shall be certified by <em>said </em>judge as the state of the case,\u201d &amp;c. <em>Comp. Stat., pp. </em>1957, 1958. The manifest intent is that the transcript shall be certified by the \u201csaid\u201d judge, not any other judge temporarily imported into the court under section 19, with no knowledge of the case, and who naturally is in no position to certify that the transcript is in effect a faithful minute of what took place at the trial, or, indeed, that it has any authenticity whatever. As was said of the \u201centire record of proceedings at the trial\u201d returned under section 136 of the Criminal Procedure act, such record \u201ccertainly must, in some way, be authenticated, and we see no other satisfactory way than by that [the trial] court\u2019s certificate.\u201d <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>State, </em>60 <em>N. J. L. </em>552 (at <em>p. </em>554). And, so, under the statute now considered, this court has already said that \u201cthe statute gives no authority for any state of the case thus composed <em>(i. e., </em>stenographer\u2019s transcript), except it be certified by the judge who tried the cause.\u201d <em>Speiser </em>v. <em>North Jersey Street Railway Co., </em>73 <em>Id. </em>413, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The transcript in the present case was not so certified. Wliat happened w'as that as the fifteen days were about to expire, appellant\u2019s attorney went to the court room on a trial day with the transcript, found the trial judge had gone out of town and another judge, an entire stranger to the case, was sitting, and procured his certificate. This, for the reasons given above, was ineffective; and for lack of a proper certificate in due time the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
