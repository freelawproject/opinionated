THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL OF THE BOROUGH OF CLIFFSIDE PARK AND LOUIS J. RENTLER, RESPONDENTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b332-5\">Submitted July 10, 1922</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ADN\">Decided September 26, 1922.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-6\">On appeal from the Supreme Court, in which court the following <em>per curiam </em>was filed:</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-7\">\u201cWe indicated the propriety of a dismissal of the cause because there appeared to' be no return to the writ. On application of prosecutor, he was allowed to supply the deficiency, and did so about April 23d last, and we therefore take up the case on the merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-8\">\u201cProsecutor was dismissed after trial from the police force of Cliffside Park, on a finding of guilt]*- on twp- of four charges lodged against him. These two1 were \u2014 (1) neglect of duty and disobedience of orders in failing to' ring in to headquarters from certain specified police boxes on specified dates; (2) neglect of duty and disobedience in failing to report his failure so to ring in and in failure to report going off duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-9\">\u201cThe principal evidence of failure to ring in is the record tape operated by a mechanism at headquarters. This tape shows absence of calls at the times specified. Prosecutor testified that he made the calls. It is in evidence that the tape is not reliable at times. It is also in evidence that when it is out of order that fact is noted thereon. All this goes to the weight of the evidence of the tape, not to its competency, and of its weight, the special tribunal was the judge. Prosecutor admitted missing a number of calls. His first point is -that there was no evidence on which he could be found guilty of failure to ring in. The point is not sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-10\">\u201cThe second point is that there is no evidence supporting a finding that he failed to- make the required report. It might be sufficient to answer that if he was lawfully con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>vieted under the first charge, it becomes immaterial whether the conviction under the second was proper, lor the conviction under the first would support the sentence. But there was evidence, in our opinion, supporting the second charge in both aspects in the testimony of Eentler, Officer O\u2019Brien and prosecutor himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-5\">\u201cThe third and fourth points relate to technical error in rulings on evidence. But it is now settled that, in this class of cases, where there is sufficient legal evidence'to support the finding, technical error in admitting cumulative evidence will not ordinarily invalidate the conviction. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>92 <em>N.

See, also, Windhorst <em>v. </em>Jersey City, No. 244 of the present term, unreported.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-6\">\u201cThe conviction and sentence will be affirmed, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-7\">For the appellant, <em>Alexander Simpson.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-8\">For the respondents, <em>Arthur M.

On the call of the list it was announced by counsel that the case would be submitted on briefs. A brief on behalf of the respondents was filed within the time limited by rule 35, as amended, but none has been filed on behalf of the prosecutor-appellant, and, therefore, the appeal is considered to be abandoned, as provided in the rule. In this situation the respondents are entitled to an affirmance of the judgment; and that will be the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chancellor, Chief J ustice, Trenchard, Bergen, Mtnturn, Kalisch, Katzenbach, White, Heppenheim'er, Williams, Gardner, Van Bus-kirk, JJ; 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
