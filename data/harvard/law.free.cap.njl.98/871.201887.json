The argument advanced by counsel in behalf of prosecutor, that because no injurious results developed from the accident which prevented the prosecutor from continuing in his employment until after expiration of a year from the time he received the injury, that, therefore, the time of the running of the statute was automatically suspended until such injurious results developed, is palpably unsound. The Court of Common Pleas properly dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b943-13\">\u201cWrit is dismissed and judgment affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b944-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>Ror the appellant, <em>Gaetano M.

He continued to work until March 20th, 1921, when he went to the hospital. The deputy commissioner before whom the case was tried dismissed the petition because it was not filed within one year from the date of the accident, as provided for in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation act. The petitioner appealed to the Essex Common Pleas, which dismissed the appeal, and he removed the order of the Common Pleas into the Supreme Court by certiorari, where the order of the Common Pleas was affirmed. He now appeals here. The Supreme Court says that petitioner asked to review the validity of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas dismissing his petition for compensation under the statute, for the reason that the petition was not filed within a year from the happening of the accident, as required by the act. This is not an accurate statement. The motion to dismiss the petition was made to the workmen\u2019s compensation bureau and was granted by it. The motion in the Common Pleas was not to dismiss the <em>petition </em>for compensation \u2014 the bureau had done that \u2014 but was to dismiss the <em>appeal </em>from that decision, and it was dismissed for the same reason that moved the deputy commissioner to dismiss the petition. With the opinion in other respects we are content.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\"><em>For affinnance </em>\u2014 Ti-ie Chancellor, Chief Justice, Trenchard, Parker, Bergen, Minturn, White, Heppenheimee, Ackerson, Van Buskirk, JJ. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
