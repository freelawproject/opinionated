THEODORE TISCHLER, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b652-9\">Argued November 21, 1922</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AiZs\">Decided January 19, 1923</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b652-10\">On appeal from the Supreme Court, in which the following <em>per curiam, </em>was filed:</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-11\">\u201cThe defendant was convicted on indictment charging assault and battery with intent carnally to abuse a female child under the age of sixteen. The female in question was a little girl of twelve, and the charge was that the crime had been committed in the back room of a grocery store kept by the defendant. Several errors are assigned, but it seems only necessary to consider one, which we consider must work a reversal. The girl testified that the defendant got her into a back room, that he laid her on the floor and committed the assault, complained of. This was denied by the defendant. In charging the jury the judge used this language: \u2018If you believe the state\u2019s witnesses, the crime of assault and battery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>with intent to abuse, is abundantly made ont. On the other hand, if you believe the defence, the defendant is not guilty. Who is telling the truth? Which is the more logical, the more probable story ? That, after all, is the real question, the question which is peculiarly within your province.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\">\u201cThe effect of this language seems plainly to make the logical and probable character of the story told by one or the other of the parties concerned the test of a verdict of guilt or innocence. But there are other considerations besides mere logic and probability which may legitimately influence the conclusion of a jury, notably, for example, the appearance and demeanor of the witnesses and the manner in which they may testify. The credibility of the witnesses and the verdict of the jury should not be dependent exclusively on rules of logic and estimates of probability. The language used by the trial judge, in our estimation, constituted harmful error for which there must be a reversal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\">\u201cAs there must be a retrial, it may be proper to say that we think the action of the court in permitting the girl to testify was not an abuse of discretion, and that the statement of the court to the jury as to what the policewoman said seems to have been supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b653-8\">\u201cLet the judgment be reversed, to the end that a new trial be had.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-9\">Pot the plaintiff in error, <em>John O. </em>Bigelow, prosecutor of the pleas.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-10\">Por the defendant in error, <em>Braelow &amp; Tepper.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b653-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">The judgment'under review herein should be affirmed, for the reasons expressed in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chancellor, Swayze, Teenchard, Bergen, Minturn, Katzenbach, Ackerson, JJ. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 Black, White, Gardner, JJ. 3.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
