In this suit on the bond there was a default judgment which on a previous hearing I directed to he opened on terms that there be paid the amount of defalcation conceded to he correct. This seems to have been done. Plaintiff claimed in addition the return of salary paid the defendant as collector during the period of the defalcations, and also the cost of having an audit of defendant\u2019s books by certified public accountants. The default judgment included these amounts, and it was the questionable legality of the claims which led to the opening of the judgment, subject to further argument on the propriety of such claims, which has been had, as on a trial before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-9\">\u201cMy conclusion is that the claim for return of salary paid is not warranted in law. The collector was a public officer, not serving under any contractual relation, and was entitled to his salary by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-10\">\u201cI think also that the claim fox costs of an audit cannot be sustained. It does not seem to me to be anything that could reasonably have been contemplated by the parties as damages proximatelv to be caused by a default. No statute that I know of makes it a liability of the collector himself and until some higher authority in this state declares that such an expense is recoverable as damages for a defalcation, I am not willing to recognize such a claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-11\">\u201cThe result seems to be to leave plaintiff without any lawful claim, in addition to the conceded amount of the defalcation and interest. Plaintiff is entitled to judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>as a matter of form for this amount, which was due at the beginning of the suit, and paid as a condition of opening the default, with costs, but for no more than that.\"</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b958-5\">For the appellant, <em>J ohm O.
