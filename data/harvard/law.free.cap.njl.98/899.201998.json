Both defendants prosecute this appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b971-8\">\u201cAt the trial it appeared that plaintiffs decedent, Frank L. Schreiner, was a passenger on a ferry boat owned and operated by the railroad company from 23d Street, New York, to Hoboken. He boarded the ferry boat and proceeded to a position in the front end of the boat, being the central portion of the forward part of the boat chained off apparently for the use of passengers. At any rate it appeared and was in effect admitted that the space was reserved for foot passengers during the rush hours, at which time the accident happened. While there, a heavy motor truck, owned and operated by the defendant, the Efficient Motor Transportation Company, came through the team gangway at a high and dangerous rate of speed, entirely out of control, and crashed through the chain, causing it to snap and strike the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, throwing him in front of the truck which then ran over him and injured him so severely that he died. So at least the evidence tended to show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b972-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>\u201cWith respect to the negligence of the Efficient Motor Transportation. Company, it is sufficient to say that the evidence respecting the plainly obvious defective condition of the brake and driving chain of the truck, made the negligence of the company in inspection and repair a jury question. So, too, the questions of the alleged contributory negligence and assumption of risk of the decedent were at most for the jury. Consequently, the motions to nonsuit and to direct a verdict made by that company were properly refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b972-5\">\u201cAs to the railroad company, their contention is that their negligence in failing to take proper precautions for the safety of the decedent was not the proximate cause of defendant\u2019s injury, and therefore a verdict should have been directed in the railroad\u2019s favor, or a nonsuit granted as to it. But with respect to this it is sufficient to say that the facts upon which contention is predicated were in dispute, and hence a verdict could not have been directed nor a nonsuit granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b972-6\">\u201cThe judgment will be affirmed, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b972-7\">For the appellant, the Delaware.
