The trial judge sentenced Losing to a total of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by a five-year special parole period. This court affirmed the convictions on appeal. <em>United States v. Losing, </em>560 F.2d 906 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 969, 98 S.Ct. 516, 54 L.Ed.2d 457 (1977). Losing filed <em>pro se </em>motions in the district court for correction or reduction of sentence under Rule 35 [Fed.R.Crim.P. 35] and for a free transcript of his trial on the heroin charges. The district court denied the motions in two decisions which are consolidated on this appeal by Losing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">I. <em>The Motion to Reduce Sentence </em>\u2014 No. <em>78-1264.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">In this motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35, filed on March 12, 1978, Losing requests that the fifteen-year sentence he is now serving be recharacterized as one under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2) (1976) in order to make him immediately eligible for parole at the discretion of the Parole Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In support of this request, Losing argues that his sentence is unduly severe in comparison to those imposed on his codefendant and on coconspirators who pled guilty and that his \u201csalient factor\u201d score of criteria bearing on parole eligibility is, by his calculation, only eleven points, which would make him a good candidate for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-18\">Losing makes several additional contentions in his brief, claiming that the trial judge\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion was \u201cmechanical,\u201d that the judge was influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>enced by \u201csecret information\u201d contained in a letter not of record, and that Losing was deprived of any opportunity to rebut statements contained in the presentence report. These issues were not mentioned even implicitly in Losing\u2019s motion to reduce sentence of March 12, 1978, on review here. Assuming, however, that these supplementary claims are properly before us, we find no support for them in the record. The \u201cmechanical sentencing\u201d rule of <em>Woosley v. United States, </em>478 F.2d 139 (8th Cir. 1973), is plainly inapplicable on these facts, where the judge exercised his discretion to impose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences and where Losing\u2019s coconspirators were given a broad range of different sentences. We have examined the sentencing record in this case, and we find no error in the procedures employed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The district court has considered repeated motions for reduction of sentence, brought both by counsel and <em>pro se, </em>on behalf of Losing and concluded each time that no reduction was warranted. Losing\u2019s latest motion raises no new matters except that self-computed salient factor score and the request that the parole board be allowed to immediately consider his eligibility for parole. \u201c[A] motion to reduce a sentence under Rule 35 F.R.Crim.P. is entrusted to the district court\u2019s discretion; its ruling will not be disturbed except for a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Bickoff, </em>531 F.2d 182 (3d Cir. 1976). This court cannot \u201csubstitute [its] judgment for the discretion committed solely to the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Krueger, </em>454 F.2d 1154, 1155 (9th Cir. 1972). (affirming the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 35 motion to reduce).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">There is nothing in this record to indicate that either the original sentence imposed or the denial of Losing\u2019s motion to reduce was an abuse of discretion. The district court\u2019s denial of Losing\u2019s motion to correct or reduce sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">II. <em>The Motion for Free Transcript </em>\u2014 No. <em>78-1895.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Losing seeks a transcript to aid him in the preparation of a claim for postconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He states in his brief that he has not yet filed such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (1970), transcripts may be furnished without charge\u2019 to indigent persons \u201cin proceedings brought under [28 U.S.C.] section 2255 * * * if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the suit or appeals is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented * * *.\u201d We think it clear under this statutory language and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. MacCollum, </em>426 U.S. 317, 96 S.Ct. 2086, 48 L.Ed.2d 666 (1976), that any request for a free transcript prior to the filing of a section 2255 complaint is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Losing\u2019s motion for a free transcript is thus premature, and the district court\u2019s denial of that motion is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">[T]he court may fix the maximum sentence * * * in which event the court may specify that the prisoner may become eligible for parole at such time as the board of parole may determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">Losing alleges, and we assume for purposes of this appeal, that under his sentence as it stands he will not be eligible for parole until he has served sixty months or one-third of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
