ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<author id=\"b550-10\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">On October 17, 1974 appellant Burton was charged with thirty-five counts of distributing a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Seven counts were struck on the Government\u2019s motion, and a jury trial commenced on the remaining twenty-eight counts on April 27, 1976. On May 10, the jury returned a verdict finding appellant guilty as charged on the twenty-eight counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">On April 26, 1976, the date which was originally set for trial, Dovey Roundtree, one of two counsel retained by appellant, filed a motion to withdraw which was granted by the district court. At the same time, appellant moved for a thirty- to sixty-day continuance for the purpose of seeking counsel to replace Roundtree. The court denied this motion, and it is from this ruling that defendant appeals. The issue presented to us is whether the district court\u2019s ruling deprived appellant of his right to choice of counsel thereby violating the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel for [the accused\u2019s] defence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b550-20\">The Sixth Amendment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> guarantees that a person brought to trial in any federal court must be afforded the right to the assistance of counsel before he can be validly convicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The importance of counsel\u2019s function to the effective operation of our adversary system is unquestioned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>essential element of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection of the right to the assistance of counsel is that a defendant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to secure counsel of his own choosing. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932), \u201c[i]t is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\u201d 287 U.S. at 53, 53 S.Ct. at 582.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An accused who is financially able to retain counsel must not be deprived of the opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Yet, the right to retain counsel of one\u2019s own choice is not absolute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The right \u201ccannot be insisted upon in a manner that will obstruct an orderly procedure in courts of justice, and deprive such courts of the exercise of their inherent powers to control the same.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The public has a strong interest in the prompt, effective, and efficient administration of justice; the public\u2019s interest in the dispensation of justice that is not unreasonably delayed has great force.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">In this case, appellant challenges the denial of his motion for a continuance to replace Roundtree, one of his two retained attorneys. It is firmly established that the granting or refusal of a continuance is a matter within the discretion of the judge who hears the application, and is not subject to review absent a clear abuse.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Yet when the continuance is sought to retain or replace counsel, the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel is implicated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In such circumstances, the right to select counsel must be carefully balanced against the public\u2019s interest in the orderly administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">Thus, the trial judge may not insist on such expeditiousness that counsel for the defendant lacks reasonable time to prepare for trial; stripping away the opportunity to prepare for trial is tantamount to denying altogether the assistance of counsel for the defense. On the other hand, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>defendant cannot insist on an unnecessary delay or a delay of unreasonable proportions. The condition of most criminal dockets demands reasonably prompt disposition of cases; when cases are set far in advance for a day certain, an unreasonable delay in one case only serves to delay other cases, and this carries the potential for prejudice to the rights of other defendants. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Given these countervailing considerations, and recognizing that the court has the right to control its own docket to require that cases proceed in an orderly and timely fashion, the conclusion is inescapable that the court in exercise of a sound discretion may grant or deny motions for continuances. As stated by the Court in <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964),</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The matter of a continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge, and it is not every denial of a request for more time that violates due process even if the party fails to offer evidence or is compelled to defend without counsel. . . . Contrariwise, a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality. . . . There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">376 U.S. at 589, 84 S.Ct. at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">We recognize that the right to choice of counsel devolves not only from the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment but also from the more stringent and overlapping standards of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This, however, does not alter the fact that the determination of whether the defendant\u2019s right to select his counsel was protected depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. Once a fair and reasonable initial opportunity to retain counsel has been provided, and adequate counsel obtained, the court, mindful of the accused\u2019s interest in having counsel in whom he has confidence, is free to deny a continuance to obtain additional counsel if, upon evaluation of the totality of the circumstances, it reasonably concludes that the delay would be unreasonable in the context of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">What is a reasonable delay necessarily depends on all the surrounding facts and circumstances. Some of the factors to be considered in the balance include<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>: the length of the requested delay<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; whether other continuances have been requested and granted<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; the balanced convenience or inconvenience to the litigants, witnesses, counsel, and the court<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>whether the requested delay is for legitimate reasons, or whether it is dilatory, purposeful, or contrived<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; whether the defendant contributed to the circumstance which gives rise to the request for a continuance <footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; whether the defendant has other competent counsel prepared to try the case, including the consideration of whether the other counsel was retained as lead or associate counsel<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>; whether denying the continuance will result in identifiable prejudice to defendant's case, and if so, whether this prejudice is of a material or- substantial nature<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; the complexity of the case<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>; and other relevant factors which may appear in the context of any particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">All of these factors are the appropriate subject of the trial court\u2019s attention when a continuance is sought. How the balance operates to obtain a result must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>depend on the circumstances of the particular case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For example, a long delay and a great deal\u2019of inconvenience may be tolerated if defendant\u2019s only counsel is suddenly lost by some unforeseen circumstance in a very complex case. However, only a slight inconvenience or delay may be sufficient grounds for rejecting defendant\u2019s request for a continuance to enable him to retain an additional counsel in a simple case where he has already retained three or four other attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The evaluation of appellant\u2019s need for additional counsel, and the balance between the right to select counsel and the public\u2019s interest in the orderly administration of justice must all be carefully and delicately weighed; but sitting as a court of review, we afford substantial discretion to the trial court in judging that balance, and we will not reverse absent a showing of a deprivation of the defendant\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Upon consideration of the standard outline above with respect to the instant facts, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion, and did not violate defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. Before engaging in this analysis, we set forth the background of this case, which is essential to a full understanding of the legal issues.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">Appellant is a physician, and has taught medicine and practiced in the District of Columbia since 1939. Appellant was initially charged in May, 1974, with nineteen counts of unlawful distribution of controlled substances. The essence of the charges was that appellant had in effect acted as a pusher in selling preludin and ritalin to numerous persons by writing prescriptions on mere requests <em>without giving proper physical examinations or taking proper medical histories. </em>When he was first indicted, he hired Allen Hutter as his <em>sole </em>legal counsel.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">Sometime thereafter, appellant retained an' additional counsel, Ms. Dovey Round-tree, at Hutter\u2019s suggestion when appellant indicated he desired additional counsel.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although the evidence does not indicate the precise date when Roundtree was retained<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Roundtree was present when defendant was brought up for arraignment on October 23, 1974.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It is fair to say that from the October 23, 1974 proceeding until Roundtree requested to withdraw from the case, Hutter acted as lead counsel. At the October 23 proceeding, Hutter made the entire presentation on appellant\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>At the November 11, 1974 hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, Hutter and Roundtree were both present, but Hutter presented and argued defendant\u2019s entire case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> At the April 16, 1975 hearing on the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, <em>only </em>Hutter was present to argue defendant\u2019s position.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> At the December 17, 1975 status call to set a trial date, both Hutter and Roundtree were present.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Hutter made the first statement for the defense, and thereafter both attorneys participated in setting the date, as a time convenient to each defense attorney, the Government\u2019s attorney, and the court was sought.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The trial date was set for April 26, 1976. On April 23, Roundtree filed a motion \u201cfor leave to withdraw as co-counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In that motion, she stated as reasons for seeking leave to withdraw:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">That a definite and broad difference of opinion with respect to the prosecution of this case presently exist between her and the client which would make it impossible and do violence to her sworn duty as a member of the Bar of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">That she has discussed the matter with the client <em>and with the trial attorney, Mr. Hutter, </em>and verily believes that her presence and participation in this matter would create a conflict such as might reasonably jeopardize the best interest of the client as he pursues a full trial on the issues herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">R. 24. This pleading, prepared and signed by Roundtree, clearly refers to Hutter as the <em>trial attorney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">The April 26 proceeding began with the district judge inquiring into Roundtree\u2019s motion and the reasons which underlay it. Roundtree testified that when she first came into the case, she talked with Burton and Hutter, investigated on her own, and concluded that she had \u201ca reasonable and justifiable basis within [her] own conscience mind and principles\u201d to represent appellant.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> After the case was reinstated, Roundtree stated that she found \u201chard facts\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> which caused her to decide to withdraw.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> She explained her reasons as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>I have discussed it with Mr. Hutter; I have discussed it with the Doctor, what is the defense in this case. I just have to speak frankly . . . . I find that I am not only frustrated, but with twenty-four years at the bar, I have a total inaccurate and in violation of what I know to be, that I believe that <em>Mr. Hut-ter and I are now working at cross purposes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I do not believe from where I see that I have a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">I have talked to \u2014 at my home, I think it was a Wednesday night \u2014 at length with the doctor of my views in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">I think under the Cannons <em>[sic] for me to have such view, for Mr. Hutter to have his view, we have the poor Dr. Burton somewhere in the middle. I don\u2019t think there is a reconciliation of it.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">[Roundtree then refers to a defense which had figured importantly in her decision to represent Burton.] I think that to this extent, perhaps I was misled; maybe I am naive, but in that posture, <em>I do not think I would be either fair to Dr. Burton to be associate counsel; I couldn\u2019t be associate counsel, and just sit at the table. That is not my role as a lawyer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">I am greatly disturbed about the posture of the case, and as I read the Cannons [sic] of Ethics and my professional responsibility, I am more and more persuaded, I have no alternative, I will go down the road in my thinking in my persuasion based on the things I have told this Court, and I think Mr. Hutter is going down quite a different road.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">THE COURT: You could not be effective counsel for Dr. Burton under those circumstances; you don\u2019t think he has a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">MISS ROUNDTREE: That is my view.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Tr., April 26, at 4-5 (emphasis added). Roundtree\u2019s explanation refers to a disagreement between counsel for the defense. It is difficult to perceive why, if Roundtree was lead counsel, the disagreement between Hutter and Roundtree was even pertinent: if Roundtree was the lead counsel, then the views of the associate counsel, if different, would not be of severe concern. Burton was free to participate in the selection of a defense. Instead of choosing the defense proposed by Hutter, he could have chosen the defense offered by Roundtree. Burton had full power to rely on one counsel and to agree to the withdrawal of the other. Burton\u2019s acquiescence in Roundtree\u2019s departure and reliance upon Hutter for the presentation of the defense can hardly be viewed as a denial of defendant\u2019s right to have the lead counsel he wanted. Indeed, Burton simply exercised his choice between alternative defenses proposed by his two counsel. Whatever definition we ascribe to <em>\u201clead\u201d </em>counsel, it is apparent that Hutter was agreeable to advancing some defense that Burton agreed with and that Roundtree was not. Finally, Roundtree\u2019s statement that it would be unfair \u201cto be associate counsel\u201d is not a conclusive indicator of anything: she might be referring either to the unfairness of becoming associate counsel after having been retained as lead counsel, or when she was antagonistic to promoting the defense that Burton desired, to the unfairness of remaining as associate counsel after having been retained in that capacity. Whatever characterization may be given to Hutter and Roundtree \u2014 whether they were co-equal, or whether one was lead counsel and the other subordinate \u2014 the fact is that Hutter was willing to present the defense that Burton wanted, and that Burton in the end received the representation that he desired. Hutter was hired first, was fully informed as to the case, was fully prepared, and was available to proceed with a defense that Roundtree was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>willing to espouse. It also appears that Hutter conducted the trial after Round-tree\u2019s withdrawal with the consent of the defendant in such a manner that has not evoked any claim of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">After Roundtree\u2019s statement, the court asked Hutter if he was ready to proceed. He responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Yes, Your Honor. It is not incumbent to find at this time. I don\u2019t think there is any problem, any statements that the doctor might make now that would pose any problem. I <em>do respect his relationship with Miss Roundtree. </em>I think he could best respond to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\"><em>Id., </em>at 6 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Acting upon Hutter\u2019s invitation, the court asked appellant to speak to the matter. Appellant stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">[W]hen I was indicted in 1974, I hired Allen Hutter as lead counsel. After the metting [sic], I thought a skilled trial lawyer would be helpful and necessary if [sic] defending this case, especially one familiar with the ghetto community.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Mr. Hutter presented Dovey Roundtree to me. I was well please, [sic] and indeed, an excellent lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\"><em>Id. </em>Burton did not say he hired Roundtree as the lead counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">The statement that a \u201cskilled trial lawyer would be helpful and necessary [in] defending this case\u201d does not mean that the newly-retained attorney was expected to act as lead counsel, particularly if the defendant was already being served by a skilled trial attorney such as Hutter. Burton\u2019s statement can be read no further than evidencing a belief that \u201ctwo skilled attorneys are better than one,\u201d and cannot be read as a statement that he intended the newly-retained attorney to act as the lead counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">Burton also explained his reasons for retaining Roundtree:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">Although Mr. Hutter is a well qualified lawyer, I do not feel he is able to handle the case alone without the <em>assistance </em>of someone who has the skill as with Attorney Roundtree. I am behind the competence, experience and reputation of Attorney Roundtree. I do not want her to stay since she doesn\u2019t want to create an atmosphere of inadequacy, but getting a seasoned trial lawyer to replace her is difficult. I have to secure a new lawyer who must of necessity become familiar with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\"><em>Id., </em>at 7-8 (emphasis added). Here again, appellant indicates that Roundtree was retained to <em>assist </em>Hutter, not to take over the conduct of the trial. The statement that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to create an atmosphere of inadequacy\u201d is some indication that this skilled trial lawyer was not engaged by Burton to employ her full talents. Though Burton\u2019s explanation contains references to obtaining a \u201cseasoned trial lawyer,\u201d it is quite sensible for Burton to desire the best lawyer obtainable, even though that lawyer might perform as associate counsel. That he considered Hutter needed <em>assistance, </em>as opposed to supervision, was again emphasized by Burton in further testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-17\">From my observation at the beginning, I felt Mr. Hutter needed <em>assistance. </em>Since I relate to the black community, I spoke to him and he brought in Attorney Roundtree who is capable.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-18\">Now, I must confess I do not know of an experienced trial lawyer <em>to assist Mr. Hutter </em>in my trial. This would take some time to arrange, if allowed, and the new lawyer would have to acquaint himself with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-19\">I, therefore, request Your Honor to grant an extension of time of thirty to sixty days before the case comes up for trial in order to assist and a judgment can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-20\"><em>Id., </em>at 8 (emphasis added). To say that someone needs \u201cassistance\u201d is far different from saying someone needs replacement as lead counsel. Burton wanted an experienced, skilled, and seasoned trial lawyer to <em>assist </em>Hutter. At no point does Burton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>state that he intended Roundtree to conduct the trial.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">After the court made inquiries of Government counsel regarding the Government\u2019s opposition to the granting of a continuance, the court made inquiries of Hutter. Hut-ter\u2019s statement reaffirms Burton\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">[Appellant] did want a black attorney <em>to assist </em>for problems of relating to witnesses, relating to the jury, because of the nature of the community, and that was the primary object that he had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"au2-dedup-0\"><em>Id., </em>at 12 (emphasis added). None of the factors to which Hutter alludes require that Roundtree have been hired as lead counsel. Most importantly, it appears that the court, which was very familiar with the case, believed that appellant simply wanted an additional attorney, not a new lead attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"als-dedup-0\">In other words, Dr. Burton wants a black attorney \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">[T]his is certainly a unique situation where the defendant states on the record in open Court that he wants an <em>additional attorney </em>because the <em>additional attorney </em>would happen to be black. It seems not to be very good. The jury shouldn\u2019t consider on the color of the defendant whether he be pink, blue, green.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\"><em>Id., </em>at 12, 13 (emphasis added). Dr. Burton then explained why he wanted a black attorney: he stated that blacks relate better to blacks.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">COURT: You want a black attorney to make a favorable impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">BURTON: Just the converse with these people, the witnesses and all I called.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">Your Honor, may I say this, I am a citizen of this country and you represent the government and whatev\u00e9ryou [sic] say, I will abide by it really.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">COURT: I believe this case will go forward, Dr. Burton.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">BURTON: All right, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-20\">COURT: You have, Miss Roundtree, my permission to withdraw. I grant your motion, Miss Roundtree.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\"><em>Id., </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">In the April 26 proceeding, the court also inquired into the Government\u2019s reasons for opposing the continuance. Government counsel indicated that the Government was prepared to go to trial, that it had assembled all the witnesses, that it would be a burden to reassemble them at a later date, and that the Government\u2019s attorneys\u2019 caseloads had been adjusted to accommodate the scheduling of this case.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The trial lasted eight trial days,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and the Government introduced eleven witnesses<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and 2300 signed prescriptions.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Government counsel emphasized his prior contacts with Hutter:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-23\">Mr. Hutter should be prepared to go to trial. <em>He </em>has got a lot of the information. I gave <em>him </em>the grand jury testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ny. <em>We </em>have been in contact in terms of what the facts are. <em>He </em>knows what we have.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\"><em>Id., </em>at 10 (emphasis added). This statement, as do the others made by the various declarants in the April 26 hearing, suggests that Hutter had been conducting the case all along and was intended to do so at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">To recapitulate, Burton, in all of his testimony, did not say that he hired Roundtree as lead counsel. Indeed, the plain reasonable interpretation to be given his testimony is that he wanted a skilled, black trial attorney to <em>assist </em>Hutter in the conduct of his defense. Even if Roundtree expected to conduct the trial, it was Burton who retained both counsel and who had the authority to specify who would conduct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The reasons given by Roundtree for wanting to withdraw were varied. Round-tree noted a disagreement as to the viability of any defense between herself and Hut-ter with Dr. Burton in the middle; but if Roundtree was lead counsel, what Hutter thought would not be controlling, as he would not be conducting the trial. She also indicated a conflict between herself and her client. We do not and need not speculate beyond the record into Roundtree\u2019s beliefs, as the record reasonably supports the conclusion that Roundtree was not the lead counsel. In reaching this conclusion, it is particularly significant that Roundtree\u2019s motion to withdraw refers to <em>Hutter </em>as the <em>trial attorney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">For these reasons and others mentioned earlier, we conclude that the record does not support the conclusion that Roundtree was hired by Burton with the shared expectation that she would function as lead counsel. Instead, the record points to the conclusion that Roundtree was intended to assist Hutter in the conduct of the trial, and that Hutter would continue in the lead role he had performed throughout the pre-trial period. That Burton would want to retain a skilled black attorney to sit at counsel table, perhaps examine a few witnesses, and otherwise assist Hutter, is perfectly understandable and reasonable. But when the district court\u2019s ruling is viewed against this background, it becomes apparent that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Burton\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Although the record does not identify with specificity how the trial judge considered the various factors which determine whether the defendant was afforded his right to choose his own counsel, we are satisfied that the district court under these circumstances perceived the salient factors and evaluated them in a manner within the zone of his proper discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">It is true that no prior continuances had been requested or granted but Burton\u2019s motion of October 23, 1974, to dismiss the indictment, had delayed the trial of the case until April 1976. That motion was based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 319, 505 F.2d 426 (1974), which held an indictment identical in theory to Burton\u2019s to be invalid. However, our decision in <em>Moore </em>was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 96 S.Ct. 335, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975). This held, in effect, that Burton\u2019s indictment was also valid. Nothing in the record, however, suggests that appellant improperly contributed to any circumstance which caused Roundtree to request leave to withdraw from the case. Nor does the record suggest that the continuance was requested for the specific purpose of disrupting or undercutting the orderly administration of justice. Had that been the case, the district judge would have denied Roundtree\u2019s request for leave to withdraw. It is a fact, however, that Hut-ter told Burton five days before the scheduled trial date that Roundtree was withdrawing. When he was so advised, he should have immediately started to obtain additional counsel if he considered that to be necessary. The record, however, does not indicate that any such attempt was made. Had he acted promptly it might not have been necessary for him to request the lengthy delay that the court found to be unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>No error </em>in the actual conduct of the trial is claimed to exist, and no identifiable prejudice in the trial of the case resulted to defendant by virtue of the denial of the continuance. There is no suggestion that any possible defense was stifled or weakened because the continuance was not granted. The arguments advanced by the defense centered around attacks on the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and some appeal to sympathy because of Burton\u2019s age and his long practice as a doctor. Indeed, the record shows that flutter fulfilled his duty to his client as a diligent, conscientious advocate. The record is replete with examples of effective representation. This is not to say that a different strategy might have been somewhat more effective, or that some other counsel might have done a better job; however, there can be no doubt that Hutter\u2019s representation of appellant far exceeded the standard of assistance that is constitutionally required.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The question here, however, is whether appellant was afforded his constitutional right to select his own counsel. In determining whether the right was violated, the existence of prejudice is only one of the factors to consider. The existence of prejudice to the case is not a prerequisite to a constitutional violation in this context.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> But in appraising this particular factor, the inability of appellant to prove prejudice to his defense, and the absence of prejudice apparent to us in the record suggests that the district court properly balanced the competing considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">It may be that having a black attorney present at the trial, as appellant planned, might have enabled appellant to relate better to the jury, the witnesses, or the court, as Burton expressed it. But appellant chose Hutter to conduct his defense as lead counsel, and this is precisely what he received. Had Roundtree been the lead trial attorney, appellant clearly would have had a stronger case for a continuance \u2014 but with her view that Burton did not have a defense,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> a guilty plea might more possibly have been the result.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As it was, appellant had other competent counsel, fully familiar with the case and prepared and ready to try it, available to present his defense. Crucially, it was the counsel he had chosen as lead trial counsel. This is a significant and weighty factor, which the district court unquestionably took into account.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">The dissent argues that \u201ccircumstances beyond appellant\u2019s control invalidated part of the right to choose his defense team and thus the trial court had no discretion to prevent appellant from regaining it.\u201d Dissent at note 45. Thus, the dissent claims that defendant never was given a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice. Dissent at - of 189 U.S.App.D.C., at 500 of 584 F.2d. This argument is based on a quick shift from \u201cde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>fense <em>team\" to </em>\u201ccounsel\u201d and they are not completely interchangeable. There are a variety of situations that can be imagined where defendant loses access to one of his chosen counsel by circumstances beyond his control. Yet in our view, the fact that circumstances beyond the defendant\u2019s control prevented him from utilizing the services of part of his defense team does not, by itself, conclusively indicate that defendant was denied a fair opportunity to select adequate counsel. This is one important factor, and carries very great weight particularly if circumstances beyond defendant\u2019s control deprive him of his only counsel. Suppose that a defendant retains three attorneys, and that all are prepared and qualified to try the case. Two days before trial, one of the attorneys is suddenly taken ill, and is unable to appear at trial. This factor is certainly beyond defendant\u2019s control, but depending on the circumstances of the case, we are not prepared to say that denying a continuance until the third attorney\u2019s health is restored is an abuse of discretion. <em>See Giacalone v. Lucas, </em>445 F.2d 1238 (6th Cir. 1971). Or suppose that a defendant retains an attorney far in advance of trial, and the attorney\u2019s obligations in other cases subsequently prevents scheduling of a reasonable trial date. This development is certainly beyond defendant\u2019s control, but depending on the circumstances of the case, we are not prepared to say that denying a continuance until the attorney\u2019s schedule is free is an abuse of discretion and violative of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right. <em>See United States v. Poulack, </em>556 F.2d 83 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 986, 98 S.Ct. 613, 54 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977). Defendants must be given an initial, fair and reasonable opportunity to select counsel. Burton received this opportunity, and enjoyed the services of both Hutter and Roundtree for nearly two years. When Roundtree was granted leave to withdraw, she considered the \u201cCanons of Ethics\u201d to which she was bound as a lawyer would not permit her to go forward with the defense that Burton and his counsel had agreed upon, <em>see </em>text at ---of 189 U.S.App.D.C., at 493-495 of 584 F.2d, <em>supra. </em>The circumstances surrounding that withdrawal, including whether Burton contributed to the withdrawal, were the proper subject of the trial court\u2019s inquiry. The fact that Burton may not have contributed directly to the withdrawal does not, by itself, determine that Burton\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated. We do not believe that every time circumstances beyond the accused\u2019s control result in the loss of one member of the defense team that it follows automatically that the defendant did not receive a fair and reasonable opportunity to select his own counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">The district court was in a good position to judge the inconvenience to the litigants, the witnesses, counsel, and the court from granting such a continuance. Any delay might result in some inconvenience, and this case was no exception to that rule.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Given this, plus the crucial fact that appellant had competent counsel there whom he had retained to conduct the trial as lead counsel, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In essence, appellant contends that a continu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>anee should have' been granted to allow additional counsel to assist in a trial already adequately prepared by earlier-retained counsel. This is not a strong case for granting a continuance, and the district court did not abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> To have delayed appellant\u2019s trial further would have amounted to an unreasonable delay under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Since defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"A7EP\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-13\">. Appellant was indicted on May 21, 1974 for 19 counts of unlawful distribution of controlled substances. The grand jury returned a second indictment containing 35 counts on October 11, 1974, and then a superseding 35-count indictment was returned on October 17, 1974. The Government dropped the first two indictments and appellant moved for dismissal of the third on October 23, 1974. On authority of this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v.

The right of choice of counsel is related to the right to adequate time to prepare for trial. Counsel is not entitled to unlimited preparation time; instead, counsel is entitled to reasonable preparation time. Just as continuances to enable defendants to select counsel need not be granted where the orderly procedures of the court will be disrupted, continuances for more preparation time than necessary need not be granted. In turn, the question of reasonable preparation time is closely related to the issue of inadequate assistance of counsel: if preparation time is unreasonably short, counsel cannot competently represent his client, and may make negligent omissions or acts that deprive defendant of his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel for his defense. While all of these rights are related, as they all are within the parameters of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel, the right to choice of counsel is distinct from the right to adequate assistance of counsel.

The defendant may choose a particular counsel for any reason that he deems important. However, one of the factors appropriate to testing whether a requested delay is reasonable is the good faith of the defendant; accordingly, a court must at times inquire into the reasons for the request for a continuance. Where defendant seeks to obtain an additional counsel or to substitute another counsel for his present one, the court must make certain inquiries into the reasons for the addition or change. This inquiry is appropriate only when a fair opportunity to retain counsel of choice has already been provided. Regardless of whether inquiry into the defendant\u2019s reasons for adding or substituting counsel is relevant in any particular case, the appropriateness of the court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a continuance may turn on other factors, mentioned in the text, which have more significance in the particular factual context.

The Supreme Court has indicated that a Sixth Amendment violation, as it implicates a substantial right of a party, cannot be harmless, <em>Chapman v.

The dissent would attach no significance to the fact that the remaining counsel was the lead counsel: \u201c[I]f a [a defendant] becomes objectively or subjectively dissatisfied with one important member of his team, his entitlement to a continuance to secure a replacement normally is no different than if the member in question was his only counsel.\u201d Dissent at-of 189 U.S.App.D.C., at 508 of 584 F.2d. When a defendant is initially afforded the opportunity to retain counsel, he may retain as many as he can afford (subject to the power of the court to limit the number that may participate in court). And a defendant may thereafter add as many attorneys as he desires, so long as he does not acquire counsel to disrupt the orderly process of justice. However, when on the eve of trial, a defendant seeks a continuance to add or substitute counsel which necessitates a rescheduling of the trial, many factors are relevant to whether the request for delay is reasonable. If the defendant has other competent counsel prepared to go to trial, then the court, when considering all the factors, need not tolerate as much inconvenience as in the case where defendant has no other counsel prepared to go to trial. This is not to say that defendant\u2019s rights differ in one case or the other; this is only to say that the result of the balancing may differ when the circumstances are different. And it goes without saying that whether the remaining counsel is prepared to go to trial may be substantially affected by whether he was retained as lead or associate counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b561-5\">. The dissent criticizes the lack of specific record evidence listing the inconvenience which would be encountered from granting the continuance (Dissent at---of 189 U.S.App.D.C., at 510 of 584 F.2d). The Government did refer to the \u201ctime to get all the witnesses together.\u201d Tr., April 26, 1976, at 10. It would have been better for our review if the specific nature of the inconvenience had been set forth by the Government and/or sought out by the trial judge. Here, we do not rely on the amount of inconvenience enumerated in the record as the principal factor in the balance. Rather, this is one factor which lends weight toward affirming the district court, inasmuch as defendant did receive the service of his lead counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b561-14\">. It is also stated in the dissent that the district court predicated its disposition on its disapproval of what it deemed to be. a \u201csingular desire on appellant\u2019s part to engage a black trial attorney as one of his counsel\u201d (Dissent at - of 189 U.S.App.D.C., at 510 of 584 F.2d). In our view, the record does not bear out this characterization of Burton\u2019s asserted position. The trial judge noted that, in his view, the defendant wanted \u201can <em>additional </em>attorney because the <em>additional </em>attorney would happen to be black\u201d (Tr., April 26, 1976, at 13; emphasis added). As noted earlier, the reasons for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>taining counsel are not subject to approval or disapproval by this court, and we do not see that the district judge denied the request for a continuance simply because he might have thought the defendant\u2019s personal reasons for retaining a particular attorney were without merit. We think that the district court recognized that Hutter was the lead counsel and that defendant\u2019s interest in having an additional attorney assist Hutter \u2014 regardless of who that additional attorney was \u2014 did not justify delaying the trial at that late date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\">. The dissent contends that <em>United States v. Mardian, </em>178 U.S.App.D.C. 207, 546 F.2d 973 (1976) <em>(en </em>banc) and <em>Lee v. United States, </em>98 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 235 F.2d 219 (1956), read together, control this case. We disagree. The resolution of cases involving the denial of a request for a continuance depend on the particular circumstances. <em>Mardian </em>is distinguishable on several grounds. First, the counsel for defendant who remained after co-counsel was taken ill had not been personally retained by defendant (178 U.S.App.D.C. at 213, 546 F.2d at 979). Second, Mardian stated in court that he had taken special care in selecting the counsel who became sick, who was very definitely his lead counsel <em>(id.). </em>Third, even though the court recognized that defendant bore no responsibility for his lead counsel\u2019s absence, the court noted two factors which made defendant\u2019s motion unique \u2014 (a) joinder of Mardian with the other defendants was not supported by evidence as strong as that against the other defendants (178 U.S.App.D.C. at 214, 546 F.2d at 980); and (b) <em>the Government did not oppose Mardian\u2019s motion (id.). </em>The court gave this last factor the highest importance, as it demonstrated that granting the motion would not have caused undue disruption. <em>Lee </em>is distinguishable on its facts as well. Defendant\u2019s two retained counsel requested, with defendant\u2019s consent, permission to withdraw from the case. Defendant advised the judge that he had obtained a third attorney who was ready for trial. Permission to withdraw was granted by the court. When the new attorney appeared before the trial judge, he announced that he was troubled about a possible conflict of interest. The court, after hearing some of the circumstances, granted permission to the new attorney to withdraw and appellant requested a short two day continuance over the weekend to obtain new counsel. The court refused this request and then directed one of the two attorneys who had been allowed to withdraw, to conduct the defense. It became clear at that time that defendant objected to either of the two prior attorneys representing him and that both prior counsel desired to comply with appellant\u2019s position. The Court of Appeals stated that appellant bore no responsibility for being without counsel at the beginning of trial. Thus, under these circumstances, the defendant was denied a reasonable request to select counsel and was never represented by counsel of his own choosing. 98 U.S.App.D.C. at 274, 235 F.2d at 221. <em>Lee </em>is a far cry from the facts here. Thus, <em>Mardian </em>is distinguishable on several grounds, and <em>Lee </em>involved a situation where defendant was denied a fair opportunity to choose his own counsel after he discharged his original attorneys and had <em>no one </em>available to represent him who did not have a disqualifying conflict of interest. These two cases, read together, do not indicate how the balance of the various factors should be performed in a case where the circumstances are markedly different.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b562-5\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AKz\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Appellant challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance to enable Mm to obtain replacement counsel after the court permitted one of his existing counsel to withdraw on the eve of trial. My colleagues affirm, applying an abuse of discretion standard to the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Though that analysis is impeccable when a trial court has adjudged the time necessary to prepare for trial, or when the continuance was requested after a fair opportunity to retain counsel had already been provided, it is, in my view, unacceptable when such an opportunity has been set for naught by circumstances beyond the accused\u2019s control. That situation \u2014 which is the case before us \u2014 is directly analogous to denial of the initial opportunity to select one\u2019s lawyer, and I believe trial courts have no discretion to allow the undoubted social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>need for expeditious administration of criminal justice to hold sway over the fundamental Sixth Amendment right freely to choose counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Even if the District Court had discretion to deny the opportunity to retain new counsel in light of the factors enumerated in the majority opinion, that discretion was not exercised in this case because the court relied solely on one improper consideration. Thus I think error was committed. I am unable, moreover, to shed reasonable doubts about whether the error prejudiced appellant in his unsuccessful endeavor to win an acquittal on the drug charges on which he was prosecuted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">I. THE BACKGROUND EVENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Appellant, a physician, had practiced his profession in the District of Columbia since 1939. When, in 1974, he was subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a grand jury, he retained Allen M. Hutter as his sole counsel. Later that year, appellant was charged in a 19-count indictment with unlawful distribution of controlled substances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The gravamen of the indictment was that he had effectively sold preludin and ritalin to numerous persons by writing prescriptions without benefit of proper physical examinations or medical histories. Sometime thereafter, appellant requested Mr. Hutter to seek the addition of a \u201cskilled trial lawyer.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dovey J. Roundtree was contacted and retained in the shared expectation that she would serve appellant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">As fate would have it, appellant was not destined for an early trial. The grand jury returned a second indictment charging 35 drug violations, and then a superseding 35-count indictment; the Government dropped the first two indictments and appellant\u2014 with Ms. Roundtree first appearing as counsel \u2014 moved for dismissal of the third. On authority of this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Moore,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the District Court granted the motion without prejudice, but on the Government\u2019s appeal the case was remanded for further proceedings in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s pending review of <em>Moore</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Eventually, the Court reversed the decision in <em>Moore</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>whereupon the District Court vacated its order of dismissal and set the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">Five days before trial was to commence, appellant learned from Mr. Hutter that Ms. Roundtree had indicated a desire to terminate her services. Appellant attempted to contact her but did not succeed until she responded to his telegram late the following day, a Thursday. Despite his entreaties, she refused tb continue as counsel, and on Friday she filed a motion for leave to withdraw. On Monday morning, the date upon which trial was to begin, the District Court heard the motion. Ms. Roundtree explained that \u201cI do not believe . . . that I have a defense,\u201d adding that she and Mr. Hutter were \u201cworking at cross-purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In response to the court\u2019s ensuing inquiry, Mr. Hutter stated that he was ready for trial but that he would like appellant to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">Indulged that opportunity, appellant declared that he was \u201csurprised and shocked\u201d by Ms. Roundtree\u2019s decision and \u201canguish[ed] because my reputation and livelihood are at stake.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He explained that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>had picked Ms. Roundtree both because of her experience<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and because she, unlike Mr. Hutter, was black:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Although Mr. Hutter is a well qualified lawyer, I do not feel he is able to handle the case alone without the assistance of someone who has the skill [of] Attorney Roundtree . . . . I do not want her to stay since she doesn\u2019t want to create an atmosphere of inadequacy, but getting a seasoned trial lawyer to replace her is difficult. I have to secure a new lawyer who [must] of necessity become familiar with the case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">* * * sf: <em>% </em>sjs</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">From my observation at the beginning, I felt Mr. Hutter needed assistance.

The court, noting Mr. Hutter\u2019s competence and experience \u2014 which no one denies \u2014 felt that</p>\n<p id=\"Asz\">this is certainly a unique situation where the defendant states on the record in open Court that he wants an additional attorney because the additional attorney would happen to be black .</p>\n<p id=\"A8D\">As a matter of fact, for the jury, Dr. Burton, to feel sympathy for you or decide the case on the basis of your attorney\u2019s color and your color or Mr. Kogan [Government counsel] or my color or anything like that, that isn\u2019t a consideration that the jury could [] properly weigh.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4J5\">Responding personally, appellant insisted that \u201c[i]n the black community, blacks relate to blacks better, some relate better,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but added, \u201cI am a citizen of this country and you represent the government and whatever you say, I will abide by it really.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The judge then ordered trial to commence on the next morning, and after eight days of trial the jury convicted on 28 counts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-19\">II. THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL OF CHOICE</p>\n<p id=\"b564-20\">A. <em>General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-21\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees invaluable procedural safeguards to an accused, including prominently the \u201cright to have the Assistance of Counsel for his de-fence.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And it is firmly established that as an integral and important part of that right \u201ca defendant should be afforded a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It follows that the wheels of justice may not grind so swiftly or so finely that an accused financially able to engage counsel is deprived of the chance to do so.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Consequently, while continuance of a trial is a matter normally within the discretion of the court,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Sixth Amendment imposes limits when the continuance is sought for purposes of retaining counsel.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cProper exercise of this discretion,\u201d says the Seventh Circuit, \u201crequires a delicate balance between the defendant\u2019s right to adequate representation of counsel at trial, and the public interest of a prompt and efficient administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> And the Supreme Court has warned that a continuance may not be denied if more time is needed to afford the accused \u201ca reasonable opportunity to employ and consult with counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">Once that initial opportunity has been fully provided, however, the court, with due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>regard for the accused\u2019s interest in counsel in whom he maintains confidence, is generally free to deny a continuance that would unreasonably inconvenience the judge or the trial participants.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As we observed long ago, \u201cthe right to select [one\u2019s] own counsel cannot be insisted upon in a manner that will obstruct an orderly procedure in courts of justice, and deprive such courts of the exercise of their inherent powers to control the same.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> An accused who is dilatory, or one who acts in bad faith, need not be rewarded with further time once he has squandered away his fair opportunity.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>On the other hand, though the accused has no \u201c \u2018unbridled right\u2019 \u201d to change counsel on the eve of trial,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> if circumstances have arisen that vitiate the original choice or lead the accused to believe sincerely that his earlier pick is unsatisfactory, a request for leave to choose new counsel must be carefully and seriously considered.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201cThe balancing considerations,\u201d one court has put it, \u201care that the right of counsel cannot be manipulated so as to interfere with the fair administration of justice, but the defendant must have complete confidence in counsel and hence, a change, if it occurs, or even a discharge, will usually point to a continuance.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">B. <em>The Relevance of the Accused\u2019s Reasons for Wanting New Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARv\">The accused\u2019s side of the balance can feature either subjective or objective grounds for a requested continuance. Instances of subjective dissatisfaction with the original choice \u2014 a recent loss of confidence in counsel, for example \u2014 frequently call upon the court to decide whether the accused seeks the continuance in good faith. In analyzing any given situation for a determination on that score, the court obviously must often inquire into the reasons for the request and for not having acted earlier. Those advanced for the asserted need for substitute or additional counsel might, of course, depend on \u201cfacts\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>court recognizes as false or so frivolous as to cast a shadow on the accused\u2019s sincerity.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But to say that the court may examine the accused\u2019s subjective reasons for wanting to replace his existing counsel is not to say that the court may exert control over his selection of particular counsel if qualified.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u201cIf the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel means anything, it certainly means that it is the actual choice of the defendant which deserves consideration\u201d;<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> resultantly, the court has no general power to approve or disapprove the accused\u2019s reasons for picking to-be-retained counsel.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Only when a fair opportunity to engage counsel of choice seemingly has already been provided \u2014 the case when new counsel is being sought late in the pretrial period \u2014 and when the proposal will entail a substantial imposition on the Government are the accused\u2019s motives for wanting a change at all relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">This distinction is well illustrated by one of our own decisions. In dealing with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>effort to replace appointed counsel with retained counsel,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> \u201c[w]e presume[d] that in ordinary circumstances an accused who finds that funds have become available may, for <em>reasons sufficient unto him, </em>conclude that he prefers to have his own paid counsel without necessarily claiming that appointed counsel is inadequate.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Since, however, the circumstances were not \u201cordinary\u201d \u2014 in the sense that the request was made just four days before trial was to begin \u2014 we held that the substitution could be refused because the accused did not bother to explain either the basis of his dissatisfaction or why he had not utilized his ample prior time to secure retained counsel.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In sum, the inquiry into the reasons was indulged only to accommodate the exigencies of ascertaining good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The accused who has had an adequate chance to secure counsel, and who on the very eve of trial seeks a postponement to obtain a substitute or additional counsel, needs a strong showing of sincerity to overcome a natural inference of bad faith.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> On the other hand, where, as here, the accused effectively loses an attorney shortly before trial due to events beyond his control, the inference of sincerity rings loud and clear.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The ground for continuance is wholly objective \u2014 the original choice of counsel was frustrated not by a change of the accused\u2019s mind but by a change in external circumstances. Because the validity of the accused\u2019s claim that the situation has been altered can be objectively examined, no inquiry into the accused\u2019s mental state is normally required or permissible. The accused so situated need establish only that the reason for withdrawal is not a pretext and that the time remaining before trial is insufficient to obtain an adequately-prepared replacement without a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">C. . <em>The Circumstances Here</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Reverting to the case at bar, we may first observe that appellant\u2019s good faith has not been challenged by the Government \u2014 nor hardly could it be. He had retained Ms. Roundtree many months before trial, and from aught that appears her last-minute motion to withdraw came as a sudden surprise. Surely the District Court did not believe that the episode was a planned dilatory tactic, for if the court had it should\u2014 and presumably would \u2014 merely have denied withdrawal.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Appellant had only one business day between the time Ms. Roundtree told him her intentions and the commencement of trial,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and his failure to retain replacement counsel during that short interval certainly does not indicate bad faith. In a nutshell, everything points not to an attempt to temporarily sidestep trial but to an endeavor to replace, with reasonable dispatch, counsel whom appellant had long expected to assume a major role at trial.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The fact that appellant had selected Mr. Hutter as part of his defense team is irrelevant. He had not selected him as his only counsel. And the fact that appellant still had one attorney remaining after Ms. Roundtree\u2019s departure is similarly of no significance.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> During the initial opportunity to retain counsel of one\u2019s choice, the accused may engage two attorneys;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> indeed, he may hire as many as he can afford, although the trial court may limit the number \u2014 but not the choice \u2014 of those who actively participate in court. Even if the accused initially retains only one counsel, he is free to add others later so long as he does not thereby substantially inconvenience the trial participants. And if he becomes objectively or subjectively dissatisfied with one important member of his team, his entitlement to a continuance to secure a replacement normally is no different than if the member in question was his only counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Here, it is clear that appellant\u2019s earlier retention of counsel of choice was rendered nugatory by an event beyond his control.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> He \u201cwas denied a fair opportunity to choose his own counsel. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Although a continuance might have mildly inconvenienced the court, the prosecution and some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of the witnesses,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> that consequence was hardly appellant\u2019s fault. The motion for leave to withdraw was not forthcoming until the trial date was virtually at hand, and the court granted it, effectively negating appellant\u2019s opportunity to satisfy an understandable desire for comfort and confidence in his trial representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">More than two decades ago we articulated the legal principle that governs this case. In <em>Lee v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the accused's third retained lawyer appeared before the trial judge on the trial date and disclosed a possible conflict of interest stemming from earlier representation of the chief prosecution witness. The trial judge granted his motion to withdraw and, over objection, appointed as the accused\u2019s counsel an attorney in the courtroom whom the accused had discharged earlier. We enforced the accused\u2019s right to select his own counsel and, of even greater significance, observed:</p>\n<p id=\"ALA\">[Ajppellant bore no responsibility for being without counsel on the eve of his trial. He had appeared for trial with counsel of his own choosing, and the record does not show that he had anything to do with that counsel\u2019s withdrawal by leave of court. However that withdrawal may have obstructed the processes of court, such obstruction is clearly not chargeable to the appellant and cannot be made the occasion for denying him his constitutional right to counsel of his own choosing.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Furthermore, we indicated that in circumstances objectively invalidating the initial choice of counsel \u2014 as when the accused seeks to replace a withdrawing retained attorney \u2014 the court cannot force unwanted counsel upon him, however ill-founded his objections to that counsel may be.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> With subjective sincerity not at issue, the reasons for the particular choice of replacement counsel were of no concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">We recently reaffirmed the objective-grounds rule set down in <em>Lee. </em>Sitting <em>en banc </em>in <em>United States v. Mardian,</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we held that the trial court had erred in requiring the accused to proceed with only one of his counsel after his lead counsel became ill two weeks into the trial.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We pointed to the client\u2019s lack of contribution to the loss of his lawyer \u2014 the loss, we found, was <em>\u201cbona fide </em>and unforeseeable\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> \u2014 and although co-counsel was certainly skilled, we recognized that the right to choose one\u2019s counsel was critical in a difficult conspiracy case featuring disparately condemnatory evidence against several codefendants.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> We placed considerable reliance on the Government\u2019s decision not to resist a continuance,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> attributing importance to this because it indicated that no \u201cundue disruption\u201d of the criminal justice system would ensue from a grant of the motion.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Although <em>Mardian </em>does indicate a wholesome concern for the orderly administration of justice,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> that concern is controlling only when the accused\u2019s reasons for seeking new counsel are purely subjective \u2014 that is, when the accused is merely unhappy with how he utilized his initial opportunity to choose counsel and not when that opportunity has been debased by subsequent events. As I read Lee and <em>Mardian </em>together, they teach that the District Court should have exercised its discretion in favor of appellant\u2019s good faith effort to reacquire a defense team of his own choice.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>D. <em>The Absence of Any Proper Reasons for Denying Appellant\u2019s Request</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The foregoing analysis establishes both the limited number of justifications for denying a requested continuance in these circumstances and the rigorous scrutiny to which such a denial must be subjected. Even if inconvenience to trial participants could ever outweigh appellant\u2019s objectively-grounded assertion that his earlier Sixth Amendment choice of counsel had become ineffectual, I am not persuaded that the Government made a sufficient showing. The record does not indicate that any of the Government\u2019s witnesses were from afar, nor does it specify any inconvenience to those in the vicinity, many of whom were local police officers or informants.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The main argument advanced by the Government against any sort of continuance was that the prosecutor himself had spent many days preparing for trial. I note, however, that the prosecutor did not indicate any conflict in his schedule that would have precluded trial within a reasonable time of its original date, and I am unable to see why his preparation would not have served him almost if not fully as well at a trial in May as at one in April.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Even in dealing with run-of-the-mill motions for continuance, the trial court\u2019s discretion \u2014 though indubitably broad \u2014 is not unlimited, and at the very least some plausible reason for refusing an honest and meritorious request must appear.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Moreover, even if my colleagues were correct that a denial of the continuance sought by appellant could have been supported on the basis of inconvenience, the District Court gave no indication that it \u201cperceived the salient factors and evaluated them. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Though the court \u201cwas in a good position to judge the inconvenience to the litigants, the witnesses, counsel, and the court,\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> the simple fact is that it never used that approach to make such a judgment. On the contrary, the District Court predicated its disposition on its disapproval of what it deemed to be a singular desire on appellant\u2019s part to engage a black trial attorney as one of his counsel.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> It seems worth mentioning that appellant was at least as much concerned about Ms. Roundtree\u2019s experience as her color, a matter to which the court did not speak.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> More importantly, however, as I have explained, the reasons for a litigant\u2019s choice of counsel are a personal matter, and become relevant to a judicial ruling only so far as they might indicate bad faith or insincerity of subjective grounds for the request.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The trial court gave not so much as a hint that appellant\u2019s reasons suggested that; instead, it articulated only its opinion that appellant\u2019s bid for a black lawyer was simply improper.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> That ground for denial lay beyond the domain of trial-court discretion, and a decision bottomed on it is unsustainable. And by relying upon a totality-of-the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>circumstances standard never employed by the trial court, the majority is exercising its own discretion, not affirming that of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">One further consideration merits brief discussion. Even if it had been the District Court\u2019s function to judge any more than the sincerity of appellant\u2019s reasons, the court would still have erred.. The majority apparently agrees that a feeling that black counsel might do better than white counsel with black witnesses and jurors is no more improper than one that ofttimes prompts a litigant to retain a handsome lawyer, a glib lawyer or a famous lawyer.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> That jurors should not be swayed by the color of lawyers and others appearing before them is a proposition with which all would agree, but it does not mean that an accused who believes that juries sometimes do such things must surrender the prerogative of taking that opinion into account.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The District Court perhaps felt that a grant of appellant\u2019s request would have brought about some sort of equal protection violation. Such a position I would not share, for I am unable to see whose rights could thereby have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">I would find, then, that the District Court denied appellant\u2019s motion for continuance in the erroneous view that the reason behind it was unworthy.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Beyond that, I would conclude that had it fully exercised its discretion on the record then before it, the request could not have justifiably been refused. I accordingly would hold that the court infringed appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a renewed opportunity to retain counsel, but that does not end my task. It is still necessary to determine whether appellant waived his right and, if he did not, whether its deprivation was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">III. WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">The court does not reach this issue, but it hints that appellant \u201cwas less than forceful in asserting his ... right. . \u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> I must object to any implication that appellant waived his right. As a commonsense matter, appellant\u2019s decision to \u201cabide by\u201d the District Court\u2019s ruling<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> seems not to be in the nature of a waiver of his right to counsel of choice. Rather, it appears quite plainly that he was acting simply out of courtesy and respect for the court; he had made his argument for the continuance and lost, and it was time to sit down and accept whatever outcome the court decreed.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> We should not encourage litigants to act contumaciously out of fear that otherwise their constitutional rights will evaporate,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> nor should we penalize them for dignified rather than vociferous protests of what they consider to be unwarranted treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Nor, as a legal matter, does appellant\u2019s statement to the court rise to the level of a voluntary, knowledgeable and unambiguous waiver of a right secured by the Constitution. The stringent standard incorporating those elements, laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v. </em>Zerbst,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> retains its vitality forty years later \u2014 at least for waivers of constitutional rights at criminal trials.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> And as the Court has stated in somewhat similar circumstances \u2014 involving an accused, a lawyer, who after initial objection remained silent as the court ordered one of his counsel to represent a codefend-ant as well \u2014 \u201cwe indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of fundamental rights.\"<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Here, as in that case, \u201cthe manner in which the parties accepted the [court\u2019s ruling] indicates that they thought they were acceding to the wishes of the court\u201d;<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> here, as there, to read a waiver into appellant\u2019s muted response is to \u201cdo violence to reality,\u201d <footnotemark>81</footnotemark> and that I decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">IV. HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The final question, and \u2014 though my colleagues deem the answer foreclosed<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> \u2014 by far the most difficult one for me, is whether the denial of appellant\u2019s right to replacement counsel of his choice was reversible error. It is now settled, of course, that some mistakes of constitutional magnitude can be labeled harmless,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> but the standard for determinations on that score is not nearly so clear.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> This imprecision is understandable, and perhaps it is wise. Any simply-stated rule might not encompass or assign true value to all concerns that should guide such decisions. Any hard-and-fast rule might spawn anomalous or even arbitrary results in some cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">A. <em>General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">The justification for harmless-error rules is singleminded: they avoid wasting the time and effort of judges, counsel and other trial participants.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Other considerations enter into the picture, however, when we set out to ascertain what is harmless and what is not. Wisdom of the ages counsels against appellate erosion of the stature and function of the trial jury.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Societal beliefs about who should bear the risk of error in particular types of proceedings deserve weight in decisions on harmlessness.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Respect for dignity of the individual, as well as for the law and the courts that administer it, may call for rectification of errors not visibly affecting the accuracy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>judicial process.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> And the prophylactic effect of a reversal occasionally might outweigh the expenditure of effort on a new trial.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">My point of departure is the nature of the error I see here: a constitutional breach in a criminal case. The heavier burden of proof \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 constitutionally imposed upon the Government in a criminal case<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> reflects our societal philosophy that malfunctions of the criminal justice process ordinarily should affect the state and not the individual.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> By the same token, the standard for measuring harmlessness should be much higher when guilt or innocence of crime is at stake.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> And when judicial error is of a constitutional character, the test becomes yet more stringent,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> precisely because conformity with constitutional guarantees is often critical to assuring a fair and accurate determination on culpability.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">The interaction of all these factors is reflected in the rule laid down by the Supreme Court over a decade ago in <em>Chapman v. </em>California,<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> which places on the Government the onus of demonstrating that constitutional error at a criminal trial is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> If the infirmity is in the admission or rejection of evidence, it is \u2014 in theory at least \u2014 possible for an appellate court to consider the case on the evidence that should properly have been let in, just as though the mistake had never occurred.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Thus, if, that evidence is so convincing that the court cannot find even a reasonable possibility that a jury would reach a different result another time around, the court will seldom reverse,<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>though this traditional approach is not without its critics.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the error is procedural in nature, even strong evidence of guilt can be an unreliable indicator of harmlessness simply because the evidence presented might not have been the same absent the infirmity.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Some procedural errors will have such obvious ramifications in the case presented to the trier of fact that we can adjust accordingly our consideration of the remaining evidence, but often the impact will be \u201cincapable of any sort of measurement.\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> With procedural errors, then, we can count on an overwhelming-evidence test only in limited circumstances where we are able to say without a reasonable doubt whatsoever that the error did not subtly and substantially corrode the ultimate state of the argument, and evidence presented to the initial decisionmaker. To be sure, some rights are so peripheral to fairness of the trial, and some trespasses on fundamental interests so minor in nature, that one can perceive clearly that the result of the process was not critically altered. But, as the Supreme Court has declared, \u201cthere are some constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Many aspects of the right to counsel may reach this magnitude<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> \u2014 its infringement can taint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the trial to its roots,<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> for a court might be unable to safely excise particular items that particular counsel might have kept out of the evidence, or to identify those that he might have gotten in.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">B. <em>The Probability of Prejudice in This Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Appellant\u2019s right to counsel of his choice was violated when he was denied the opportunity to secure new counsel to replace Ms. Roundtree. Since, however, Mr. Hutter represented him throughout the trial, obviously the violation did not negate all of the Sixth Amendment protection to which he was entitled. Nonetheless, I have reasonable \u2014 indeed, substantial \u2014 doubts that it did not materially affect the evidence and argument presented on his behalf to the jury. Mr. Hutter performed competently, but the right to effective assistance of counsel is not the concern here. Appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right was to retain not merely adequate counsel but one or more exceptional counsel if he could.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Mr. Hutter is experienced, but appellant wanted counsel who, like Ms. Roundtree, was more experienced and additionally was black \u2014 in a word, counsel in whom appellant could repose complete confidence.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> To say that Mr. Hutter did well is not to say that had appellant gotten his full constitutional due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the defense might not have been markedly better.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">.Many of the raw facts of the case were not in serious dispute, but the interpretation of the facts definitely was. Appellant\u2019s office admittedly was a madhouse at times; the Government\u2019s evidence certainly indicated that appellant had many more patients than any one physician should attempt to handle, and that many of them received what charitably can be called less than thorough care.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> The crucial question was whether this sad state of affairs was attributable to a well-intentioned endeavor to provide medical service to a needy community,<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> to malpractice remediable only in a civil suit or by the medical society or instead to a criminal scheme to peddle prescriptions for controlled drugs. Who can say with real assurance that another lawyer <footnotemark>110</footnotemark> \u2014 more experienced in the courtroom and more familiar with life in the ghetto\u2014 would not have been able to impeach prosecution witnesses\u2019 interpretations of what they saw, to elicit a more favorable gloss on the facts from appellant\u2019s own witnesses, or to convince the jury in final argument that the Government\u2019s conclusion on the facts was not the only reasonable explanation?<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">On this we are not permitted nor am I willing to speculate, particularly in the context of a criminal appeal where the Government\u2019s burden is to establish harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> The decision in this regard, rather, must be guided by <em>Glasser v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> in which the trial court, over objection, had assigned one of Glasser\u2019s two counsel<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> to simultaneously represent a codefendant after one of the codefendant\u2019s counsel had become unable to participate and the codefendant had become dissatisfied with his other counsel.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Finding that this was error, the Supreme Court noted that a possible conflict of interest and the burden of representing two clients might have impaired the assigned counsel\u2019s effectiveness in defending Glasser.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> But critically for present purposes, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>did not search for specific instances of prejudice before reversing the conviction:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser as a result of the court\u2019s [action] is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3G\">Because I believe that the right to a reasonable opportunity to replace one counsel on a two-attorney defense team is as fundamental as the right to have both members of such a team devote their full energies to their client, I too would decline \u201cto indulge in nice calculations\u201d of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">I am supported in this course by the very nature of the constitutional deprivation confronting us here. To treat the error as harmless on the ground that one cannot perceive grave fault in Mr. flutter\u2019s performance<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> would be to undermine the right to retain counsel of choice.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> It would make no sense to hold that a trial court may not say that because attorney X is competent the accused has no right to retain attorney Y, and then to turn right around and say that such an error is harmless because attorney X really was competent. Surely trial judges are not likely to force unqualified counsel upon an accused, and if proficiency were the lone predicate of harmlessness the constitutional guarantee of freedom to select one's paid counsel would be an empty exhortation.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Implicit in the right is that neither trial nor appellate courts may dishonor it simply because the accused already has a lawyer who is capable. In short, the right should not be gutted simply because violations of it seem \u201cgenerically harmless.\u201d<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"arl-dedup-0\">The logic of this conclusion is exemplified by a Fourth Circuit decision in which the statutory right to have two appointed counsel in federal capital cases<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> had been denied. The court recognized \u201cthe almost insuperable difficulty which would be placed on any defendant, if the burden is placed on him, to show <em>post hoc </em>that he was prejudiced by denial of his right to two attorneys.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Because the court believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cthe statute would be eviscerated by application of the harmless error doctrine,\u201d it \u201cperceive[d] no alternative but to enforce\u201d the statute, even though the evidence was \u201csubstantial, if not overwhelming\u201d and on the whole the accused was \u201cfairly tried.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> I believe a similar outcome is even more strongly indicated where the right to two counsel derives from the Constitution rather than just a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">A refusal to demand precise quantification of prejudice in these limited circumstances is further necessitated by the character of the interests shielded by the constitutional protection denied in this case. Lest we forget, the right to counsel of choice is one that safeguards the dignity of the accused and of the court. The right to choose to defend oneself <em>pro se, </em>the Supreme Court has recently proclaimed, is also such a right,<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> and we have recognized that the interest in preserving that dignity demands that a refusal of the right not be deemed harmless.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> By the same token, one charged with crime must have a fair opportunity to retain counsel of his choice even if the court\u2019s choice of counsel would make for a better defense.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> It is our heritage that \u201ceach person is ultimately responsible for choosing his own fate, including his position before the law,\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> and I share the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view that reversal of an erroneous denial of the right to pick one\u2019s own retained counsel may be necessary even absent an obvious example of prejudicial impact.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Indeed, this court adopted that very proposition many years ago. In <em>Smith v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> we examined a situation in which counsel was appointed to represent Smith after his retained counsel failed to appear for trial because he was kept in another court longer than he had anticipated.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> Assuming that error had occurred,<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> we held that reversal would be warranted not only if the accused had been \u201cactually prejudiced\u201d but also if \u201cthe attorney assigned to represent the defendant was unsatisfactory to him . . .\u201d<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> In that case the accused had made no objections to the appointment; in this case appellant did protest his dissatisfaction, and <em>Smith </em>thus directs us to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">If I believed it possible on careful scrutiny to determine the presence or absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>prejudice as a demonstrable fact, I would support a remand to the District Court for a hearing. But such an investigation would be both futile and dangerous: futile because outcroppings of prejudice \u2014 instances in which Mr. Hutter performed adequately but another counsel might have done better \u2014 would be next to impossible to discern; dangerous because in the absence of affirmative proof of prejudice one might tend to think that no harm had occurred. Even if it could be shown conclusively that appellant suffered no prejudice, I would have grave reservations about a ruling that the wrong done appellant is legally inconsequential. The right to counsel of choice seeks not only to assure an accurate assessment of guilt or innocence but also to protect the accused\u2019s dignity. If only violations of the former interests were remediable, breaches of the latter would have no effective protection. Courts will not allow constitutional rights so easily to come to naught.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Y. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The scope of trial-court discretion with respect to motions for continuance does not extend to the point of denying an accused a fully effective opportunity to retain a team of defense attorneys of his choice. That, however, has happened in this case, and I think the ensuing error was harmful. I must, then, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-11\">.

It seems clear that a justified motion for a continuance with a view to securing new or additional counsel may not be denied merely because the time sought is longer than the court deems necessary. That is the more so when the request comes from an accused untutored in the ways of the law. The correct response is to allow a reasonable time for retention of counsel desired \u2014 normally a few working days \u2014 with extensions if the accused - can show that he has attempted in good faith but unsuccessfully to arrange acceptable representation. Once counsel is engaged, the court could ask for an estimate of the time he needs to prepare for trial, and if dissatisfied with the response the court could require justification. The court would of course remain able to exercise its discretion to deny unreasonable requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b564-23\">.

When the accused seeks to dismiss his retained or appointed counsel and defend himself, the impaneling of the jury has been set by some courts as the outer limit of timeliness, at least in the absence of bad faith. <em>Chapman v.

In the circumstances of this case \u2014 Ms. Roundtree\u2019s unexpected withdrawal, approved by the court as trial was about to get under way \u2014 an immediate request for an opportunity to secure a replacement would be timely under any general rule.

By my analysis, circumstances beyond appellant\u2019s control invalidated part of the right to choose his defense team and thus the trial court had no discretion to prevent appellant from regaining it. Consequently, in assessing whether a constitutional violation has occurred, it makes no difference whether Ms. Roundtree was intended to serve as lead counsel. That would be significant only in determining whether the violation was harmless. See text <em>infra </em>at note 110.</p>\n<p id=\"aqb-dedup-0\">In any event, I think the record on this matter \u2014 which is critical in the court\u2019s analysis \u2014 is much less clear than a reading of the majority opinion might indicate. Appellant states in his brief that Ms. Roundtree was in fact to be lead counsel. <em>E. g., </em>Brief for Appellant at 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17. The Government\u2019s brief, which is signed by the trial prosecutor, never denies that. Indeed, the Government confirms that \u201cMrs. Roundtree said . . . that she could not take a passive role as associate counsel in the case,\u201d Brief for Appellee at 3; accord, <em>id. </em>at 12, and that \u201cMr. Hutter told the court that appellant wanted a black attorney <em>to try the case.\" Id. </em>at 5 (emphasis supplied); accord, <em>id. </em>at 4. It is quite natural for a layman to say, as appellant did, that the chronologically-second lawyer he retained was hired to assist the initial lawyer, even though the second was to be the trial lawyer. Furthermore, Ms. Roundtree\u2019s statement that \u201cI do not think I would be . fair to Dr. Burton to be associate counsel,\u201d J.App. 27, was spurred not by a disinclination to continue as associate counsel after she and her client had disagreed on the defense to be presented, but by her belief that she could not be lead trial counsel for that very reason and her refusal to take a less active role than planned. As she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t be associate counsel, <em>and just sit at the table. That is not my role as a lawyer.\" Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">Though irrelevant to my analysis, the proposition that Ms. Roundtree was not to be lead counsel \u2014 or even an equal partner in the defense \u2014 but rather a mere assistant to Mr. Hut-ter is central to the court\u2019s disposition. See Maj.Op. at note 22. The court is able to reach its decision to affirm only by concluding that Ms. Roundtree was to act in a subservient capacity. The record undisputably leaves room for doubt on that score, and I would not share any reluctance at least to remand for an accurate determination of that fact if I felt it crucial to the outcome. And because the court operates on cryptical indications in the trial record, I see no reason why our ruling today would be dispositive of a new-trial motion seeking to establish beyond peradventure that Ms. Round-tree\u2019s trial role was to equal or exceed that of Mr. Hutter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b570-15\">.

The first and more important involved testimony by a Government witness to the effect that appellant had prescribed ritalin pills for her brother and that he had jumped from a three-story building while under the influence of the pills, perhaps leaving the jury with the impression that he had died. Although the court ultimately instructed the jury to disregard this testimony, appellant now argues that he might have been prejudiced by Mr. Hutter\u2019s failure to prevent the testimony from getting before the jury at all. The other instance of alleged deficiency was Mr. Hutter\u2019s attempt to ask a hypothetical question for which no supporting facts had been or were expected to be testified to. Appellant now argues that the question and its overruling might have undermined the credibility of his case in the eyes of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">If I were sure that the possibility of prejudice to appellant was confined to these two instances, I would not deem them of such character as to raise a reasonable doubt that the constitutional denial was not harmless.

If our experience should someday teach us that we can never eliminate all reasonable possibility of prejudice in these circumstances, that would be the time to impose a per se rule. The desire to accommodate those possible situations where one can say with absolute certainty that no harm was suffered within the court\u2019s unnecessarily absolute position on harmlessness causes it to incorporate a showing of prejudice as one factor in its totality-of-the-circumstances test. See Maj.Op. text at note 19.
