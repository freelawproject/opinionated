In resolving this issue, we recognize the tension created by the conflicting interests between the power of a grand jury to compel testimony and a witness\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. Following the teaching of <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), and the precepts established in this court\u2019s precedents, <em>see United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d 534, 542-43 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc); <em>United States v. Hockenberry, </em>474 F.2d 247 (3d Cir. 1973), we hold that grand jury testimony which is compelled under a grant of immunity may be utilized only as the <em>corpus delicti </em>of an indictment for perjury or for false swearing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-19\">On December 13, 1976 and January 3, 1977, Stanley Apfelbaum, then an administrative assistant to the District Attorney in Philadelphia, appeared as an immunized witness before a federal grand jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The grand jury was investigating criminal activities (including racketeering and extortion) alleged to be involved in the operation of a Chestnut Hill automobile dealership in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-20\">In response to questioning before the grand jury, Apfelbaum made two series of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>statements which served as the basis for his subsequent false swearing indictment and conviction. In his December 13th grand jury testimony <em>he denied that he had tried to locate one Harry Brown in Fort Lauder-dale, Florida during the month of December 1975</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Then, on December 13, 1976 and again on January 3, 1977, Apfelbaum testified before the grand jury that <em>he did not recall telling F.B.I. agents that he had loaned $10,000 to Brown. </em>The grand jury which heard these two statements returned an indictment against Apfelbaum which charged him with two counts of wilfully and knowingly making false material declarations before a grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">With respect to Apfelbaum\u2019s \u201clocating Brown,\u201d paragraph 5 of Count One of the indictment recited Apfelbaum\u2019s grand jury testimony. That testimony and the charging clause of the indictment follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">Q. It\u2019s my understanding you went down to Florida in December of 1975, approximately the 5th of December.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">A. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I said before.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">Q. Now, at that time did you see Mr. Brown?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">A. No. I told you I went down there for a fishing trip, not fishing trip, to look at a boat for Dr. Slawek and then go to Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">Q. And you only stayed in Florida about three days?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\">A. About three or four days, something like that. I\u2019m not sure exactly. Don\u2019t hold me to three or four. It was around that. I spent a total time of about two weeks between the two, including flight time and so on.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">Q. When you were down there, did you call up Harry Brown to talk to him?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-14\">Q. Did you know he was down there?</p>\n<p id=\"AcE8\">A. I heard he was down there. Somebody had said he was down there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-15\">Q. Did you do anything to attempt to contact Mr. Brown when you were down there?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-16\">A. Not that I remember. I don\u2019t think I knew where he was at.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-17\">Q. Well, how did you find out where he was at eventually?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-18\">A. Somebody had told me about it and I don\u2019t know who, but they told me he was down in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-19\">Q. Okay. By this time, had the papers reported that Harry Brown was missing?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-20\">A. I don\u2019t believe so. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m trying to recollect. I don\u2019t know whether they said he was missing or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-21\">Q. So, in December, when you were down there, you\u2019re sure you didn\u2019t try to contact Harry Brown; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"aru-dedup-1\">A. Yeah, Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-22\">Q. Did you try to locate Harry Brown when you were down there?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-23\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-24\">Q. You\u2019re sure?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-25\">A. Positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-26\">Q. Now, did you tell anyone that you were trying to locate Harry Brown in Florida?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-27\">A. Not that I remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-28\">Q. And, you know, you were on your vacation and you were looking at the boats, so you weren\u2019t running around trying to find somebody you didn\u2019t know where they were, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-29\">A. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-30\">Q. And you would remember that?</p>\n<p id=\"azs-dedup-1\">A. Yeah, I think I would.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-31\">Whereas, in truth and fact, as Stanley Apfelbaum then well knew, he had tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>to locate Francis Harry Brown-, aka Harry Brown, in Florida, during December of 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">With respect to Apfelbaum\u2019s failure to recall his loan discussion with the F.B.I., paragraphs 4 and 5 of Count Two of the indictment recited Apfelbaum\u2019s grand jury testimony. That testimony and the charging clause follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">Q. Did you ever tell anyone that you had lent any money to Harry Brown or Marvin Greenblatt?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">Q. Did you ever tell anyone that you had been involved in a loan to Harry Brown or Marvin Greenblatt?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\">A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">Q. You never told anyone that you . had been involved in any kind of loan to Harry Brown?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">Q. Did you ever tell the F.B.I. \u2014 you denied last week that you told anyone you had lent money to Harry Brown?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-14\">A. That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-15\">Q. You denied that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-16\">A. How could I lend money when I don\u2019t have any money myself, Mr. Friedman?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-17\">Q. So, you didn\u2019t tell the F.B.I. or anyone that you had lent money to Harry Brown?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-18\">A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-19\">Q. Is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-20\">A. That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-21\">* * * sfe * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-22\">Q. Now, sir, in 19 \u2014 what, 1975 and 1976, did you have $10,000?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-26\">A. Did I what?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-27\">Q. Have $10,000?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-28\">A. I told you I didn\u2019t have $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AoK\">Q. And, you didn\u2019t lend $10,000 to Harry Brown, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-29\">A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-30\">Q. And, you testified that way last week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-31\">A. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-32\">Q. You testified last week that you never told anyone that you had lent $10,-000 to Harry Brown; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-33\">A. That\u2019s right, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-34\">Q. Okay. And, you still persist in that testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-35\">A. Uh-huh. How can I lend it to him when I didn\u2019t have it? I had to go to the bank and borrow money myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-36\">Q. You still persist in that testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"azy-dedup-0\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-37\">Q. You never told the F.B.I. that you lent Harry Brown $10,000; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"Adh\">A. If I did, it was ridiculous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-38\">Q. Did you tell them that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-39\">A. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I did. Q. Do you have any recollection of telling them that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-40\">A. No, no sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-41\">Whereas, in truth and fact as Stanley Apfelbaum then well knew, he (Stanley Apfelbaum) had told someone, to wit, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that he (Stanley Apfelbaum) had lent ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to Harry Brown.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-42\">At the trial upon the indictment, the Government produced evidence in support of its charges that Apfelbaum\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>to the grand jury were false.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the Government produced evidence that Apfelbaum knew his statements were false. In proving its case in chief, the Government introduced a series of excerpts taken from the transcript of Apfelbaum\u2019s immunized grand jury testimony. The immunized testimony introduced at trial related to a range of topics relevant to the prosecution\u2019s case. These included <em>inter alia </em>(1) the degree of friendship between Apfelbaum and Brown (App. 96a-98a); (2) the circumstances surrounding Apfelbaum\u2019s discovery of, and visit to, Brown in Florida in 1976 (App. 107a, 110a, 124a-29a); (3) whether Apfel-baum and Brown discussed any loan transactions while in Florida (App. 112a); (4) whether Brown \u201cpatted down\u201d Apfelbaum for weapons during his visit, or merely hugged him (App. 113a); (5) Apfelbaum\u2019s denial that he ever engaged in financial transactions with the Chestnut Hill dealership other than a $500 loan (App. 114a); (6) Apfelbaum\u2019s denial that he ever co-signed a loan for Brown (App. 115a); (7) a statement that Apfelbaum was introduced to one John Orem by Harry Brown (App. 116a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Apfelbaum objected to the introduction of this testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts of false swearing. Apfelbaum was sentenced to concurrent terms of two years in prison. His appeal charges, among other alleged errors, that the fifth amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination precluded the admission at trial of his immunized grand jury testimony. It is to that issue that we turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-11\">The fifth amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d The privilege \u201cassures that a citizen is not compelled to incriminate himself by his own testimony, . . . [and] usually operates to allow a citizen to remain silent when asked a question requiring an incriminatory answer.\u201d <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 461, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1665, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-14\">A competing constitutional interest however is that a duly constituted grand jury, \u201can integral part of our constitutional heritage\u201d whose \u201chistoric office has been to provide a shield against arbitrary or oppressive action,\u201d <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. 564, 571, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 1774, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976) (plurality opinion of Burger, C. J.), has the \u201cright to every man\u2019s evidence\u201d to fulfill its historic office. <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. at 443, 92 S.Ct. 1653; <em>see United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. at 571, 96 S.Ct. 1768. This \u201cright\u201d necessarily includes the authority to compel the attendance and the testimony of witnesses. <em>Id.; United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 345, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>(1974); <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. at 443, 96 S.Ct. 1653. Yet the power to compel testimony is necessarily limited by the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 92 S.Ct. 1653; <em>see United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. at 573, 96 S.Ct. 1768; <em>Counselman v. Hitchcock, </em>142 U.S. 547, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892). Any testimony compelled in violation of that privilege may, along with its fruits, be suppressed. <em>United States v. Blue, </em>384 U.S. 251, 255-56, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">Accommodation of these interests has been achieved by the use of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"Amjx\">[It] is the Government\u2019s ultimate tool for securing testimony that would otherwise be protected; . . . [w]hen granted immunity, a witness once again owes the obligation imposed upon all citizens \u2014 the duty to give <em>testimony </em>\u2014 since <em>immunity substitutes for the privilege.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\"><em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. at 576, 96 S.Ct. at 1776 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">A grant of \u201cuse and fruits\u201d immunity conferred under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> may indeed substitute for the fifth amendment privilege, but only because its protection against the subsequent use of the compelled testimony is <em>coextensive </em>with the scope of the privilege. <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. at 453, 96 S.Ct. 1653. That is, the grant of the immunity must, by definition, afford the witness the same protection he would have received had he invoked the privilege. <em>See Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. at 462, 96 S.Ct. 1653; <em>United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d 534, 542-43 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc); <em>United States v. Kurzer, </em>534 F.2d 511, 516 (2d Cir. 1976). Because a witness who has properly invoked the privilege may remain silent, <em>see Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. at 461, 92 S.Ct. 1653, use and fruits immunity under section 6002 \u201cprohibits the prosecutorial authorities from using the compelled testimony in <em>any </em>respect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 92 S.Ct. at 1661 (emphasis in original); <em>accord, United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d at 543; <em>United States v. Hockenberry, </em>474 F.2d 247 (3d Cir. 1973). Put another way, invocation of the privilege would have left Apfelbaum in a position where he would not have answered questions, truthfully or falsely, and thus such answers could not have been used against him. In the words of the Constitution, he would not have been compelled to \u201cbe a witness against himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-14\">Perjury however is a violation of an independent criminal statute, and as a practical matter, if immunity constituted a license to lie, the purpose of immunity would be defeated. Thus in order to preserve the integrity of the truth-seeking process, <em>see United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. at 576, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 1776; a narrow exception to immunity has been carved out. That exception permits prosecution for perjurious statements made under a grant of immunity. Indeed, the Supreme Court has observed that false swearing \u201chas no place whatever\u201d in the \u201cconstitutional process of securing a witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d Id. \u201cThe Fifth Amendment privilege does not condone perjury; . [nor] endow the person who testifies with a license to commit perjury.\u201d <em>United States v. Wong, </em>431 U.S. 174, 178, 97 S.Ct. 1823, 1825, 52 L.Ed.2d 231 (1977) (even the predicament <em>of being forced </em>to choose between an inculpatory truth or falsehood does not justify perjury), <em>quoting Glickstein v. United States, </em>222 U.S. 139, 142, 32 S.Ct. 71, 56 L.Ed. 128 (1911); <em>accord, United States v. Knox, </em>396 U.S. 77, 82, 90 S.Ct. 363, 24 L.Ed.2d 275 (1969) (furnishing false infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>mation on a federal tax return in purported compliance with a statutory requirement is unprivileged); see <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 225, 226, 91 S.Ct. 643, 646, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971) (voluntary confessions obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>may be used to impeach a testifying defendant so as not to \u201cpervert\u201d \u201cthe shield provided by <em>Miranda . . . </em>into a license to use perjury\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Kahan, </em>415 U.S. 239, 243, 94 S.Ct. 1179, 39 L.Ed.2d 297 (1974) (testimony given by indigent in order to exercise the right to counsel may be effectively compelled and therefore protected from subsequent use, but it may not \u201cbe converted into a license for false representations\u201d); Note, <em>Resolving Tensions Between Constitutional Rights: Use Immunity in Concurrent or Related Proceedings, </em>76 Column.L.Rev. 674 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">The sanction of the perjury statute adequately protects against a witness making a mockery of immunity. Our court has accordingly held that although a witness\u2019s false immunized testimony may indeed subject him to a prosecution for perjury, <em>United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d at 543; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hockenberry, </em>474 F.2d at 249, the use of the witness\u2019s immunized testimony is limited <em>only </em>to its use as <em>the basis of a perjury indictment. </em>As we explained in <em>Hockenberry,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">[t]he immunity statute <em>properly permits prosecution </em>for perjury committed in an otherwise , immunized statement <em>and also the introduction in evidence of so much of the statement as is essential to establishing the corpus delicti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">474 F.2d at 249 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further than this, however, and consistent with the fifth amendment, the Government may not <em>go. See id.; United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d at 543 (\u201c[w]e reiterate our adherence to this principle; except as <em>the basis for a prosecution for perjury </em>a witness\u2019s immunized testimony may not be used against him\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>And see Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">The introduction of immunized testimony in any subsequent proceeding is thus severely restricted. Other than as the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the indictment, the Government may not use immunized testimony as substantive evidence. <em>United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d at 541-43; <em>United States v. Hockenberry, </em>474 F.2d at 249-50. As we have previously explained: \u201cno one [could] clai[m] that [the appellant\u2019s immunized] responses could be used in the government\u2019s case in chief against him at a subsequent trial. Clearly such use would contravene <em>Kastigar.\u201d United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d at 542. Nor may immunized testimony be used to impeach the testimony of the witness. <em>Id. </em>at 542-43; <em>United States v. Hockenberry, </em>474 F.2d at 250. Again we have earlier explained:</p>\n<p id=\"a4b-dedup-0\">Clearly, if a witness had invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, the government could have no testimony available with which it might impeach his subsequent sworn statements. Were we to permit impeachment with immunized testimony, we would then be affording the immunized witness something less than his full Fifth Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-13\"><em>United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-15\">At Apfelbaum\u2019s trial, the Government introduced in support of its accusa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>tions a number of immunized statements made by Apfelbaum. The statements were used to prove a wide variety of substantive matters in the case-in-chief. As we have explained, however, such use cannot be reconciled with Apfelbaum\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. Nor may such use be harmonized with the scope of immunity afforded Apfelbaum by statute, because as the Supreme Court has declared, use and fruits immunity is, and must necessarily be, co-extensive with the privilege. <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. at 453, 96 S.Ct. 1653. Thus, the introduction of immunized statements which did not form the core of, and which were not incorporated in, the indictment violated constitutional dictates, requiring the reversal of Apfelbaum\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">The Government however, seeking to justify the introduction of Apfelbaum\u2019s testimony, argues that a witness\u2019s immunized grand jury testimony is nonetheless admissible at a subsequent trial for false swearing where (as is alleged here), the immunized testimony is either \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the statement in the indictment charged as false, or where the immunized testimony is \u201cnot incriminating in itself,\u201d or where the immunized statement is \u201cin all likelihood false.\u201d <em>See </em>Government\u2019s Brief at 11-14. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">We find no support or warrant for reading the \u201cdirectly related\u201d or \u201cnot incriminating in itself\u201d exceptions into our prior case-law. Rather, <em>Frumento </em>and <em>Hockenberry </em>unequivocally prohibit any subsequent use of truthful immunized testimony against its speaker. We of course are bound by this precedent. Even were we not so bound, we would independently reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">As to the Government\u2019s assertion that Apfelbaum\u2019s grand jury testimony was \u201cin all likelihood false,\u201d we acknowledge that if it is false it is unprotected, and therefore would subject Apfelbaum to the risk of a perjury or a false statement prosecution. However until such time as the immunized statements are incorporated into a false swearing indictment as the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the indictment, the statements are unavailable for use by the Government at trial. Permitting the Government unrestricted use of any immunized statements whenever it supposes them to be false would necessarily vitiate the protection afforded by a grant of immunity and would effectively abrogate the immunity agreement. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has observed, and as we here hold, the proper remedy in the situation where the Government believes that immunized statements are false is not to disregard the immunity grant but rather is to prosecute the perjurious witness. <em>See United States v. Kurzer, </em>534 F.2d at 518. <em>But cf. United States v. Tramunti, </em>500 F.2d 1334 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1079, 95 S.Ct. 667, 42 L.Ed.2d 673 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">In short, we conclude that the three categories of immunized testimony asserted by the Government to be exceptions to the blanket protection afforded under a grant of immunity are in fact included within the ambit of the fifth amendment's protection. Thus the use of such testimony would trench upon a witness\u2019s fifth amendment privilege. <em>United States v. Frumento, </em>552 F.2d at 541 \u2014 44; <em>United States v. Hockenberry, </em>474 F.2d at 249-50; <em>see Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. at 453, 96 S.Ct. 1653; <em>cf. United States v.

Hence they may be disposed of summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">Apfelbaum urges us to go beyond reversing his conviction and a new trial. He contends that we should <em>dismiss </em>his two-count indictment for false swearing. This contention is based upon his argument that it was the same jury which not only heard his immunized testimony but which also returned his indictment for false swearing. He claims that this \u201csame jury\u201d procedure violated his privilege against self-incrimination because the grand jury was necessarily influenced to indict by having previously heard his protected testimony. The short answer to this contention is that the record is deficient of any proofs that the grand jury which indicted Apfelbaum impermissibly relied on his immunized testimony. <em>See Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 339, 348-49, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958). In light of such a barren record, we decline Apfelbaum\u2019s invitation to address his purported constitutional violation, <em>see United States v. Anzalone, </em>555 F.2d 317, 319-20 (2d Cir.), <em>aff\u2019d on rehearing, </em>560 F.2d 492 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1015, 98 S.Ct. 732, 54 L.Ed.2d 760 (1978) (rejecting a \u201csame jury\u201d claim); <em>United States v. Camporeale, </em>515 F.2d 184 (2d Cir. 1975) (same); <em>cf. United States v. Hinton, </em>543 F.2d 1002, 1010 n. 9 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 980, 1051, 1066, 97 S.Ct. 493, 764, 796, 50 L.Ed.2d 589, 767, 783 (1977) (upholding a \u201csame jury\u201d claim when the subsequent indictment charged the substantive crimes under investigation but expressly distinguishing the situation when the subsequent indictment charges false swearing), or his suggested <em>per se </em>rule that \u201cthe government should be required to use a different grand jury to indict for perjury or false declarations.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 35. <em>See also United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 345, 94 S.Ct. 613, 618, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974) (\u201can indictment valid on its face is not subject to challenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or incompetent evidence [citation]; or even on the basis of information obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination\u201d); <em>Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U.S. at 349, 78 S.Ct. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-11\">Apfelbaum also claims that the district court improperly instructed the jury as to his knowledge of the falsity of his statements because it used a <em>Mann </em>charge, <em>i. e. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>one which states that \u201cunless the evidence points otherwise,\u201d a jury may infer that \u201cone intends all the natural and probable consequences of an act.\u201d In <em>United States v. Garrett, </em>574 F.2d 778 (3d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 919, 98 S.Ct. 2265, 56 L.Ed.2d 759 (1978), our court, exercising its supervisory powers, adopted a rule disapproving use of the Mann charge in all trials commencing ninety days after the date of the <em>Garrett </em>decision. Apfelbaum\u2019s new trial, which we have directed, necessarily will begin after that date. Thus, on remand and at re-trial, our <em>Garrett </em>decision will be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">Next, Apfelbaum argues that the use of certain evidence by the prosecutor, particularly the testimony of one John Orem, violated the rule announced by our court in <em>United States v. Crocker, </em>568 F.2d 1049 (3d Cir. 1977). He further charges that the district court abused its discretion when it ruled that it would permit prospective character witnesses intending to testify favorably to the defendant\u2019s reputation for veracity to be cross-examined with reference to a newspaper article which implicated Ap-felbaum\u2019s honesty. <em>See Michelson v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948); Fed.R.Ev. 608(b). Inasmuch as we have ordered a new trial, it would be inappropriate for us to anticipate and rule upon claims which challenge the admissibility of evidence which has not as yet been, and may never be, introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">We will reverse Apfelbaum\u2019s judgment of conviction, and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1327-21\">. Immunity had been granted in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002, <em>quoted in full in </em>n. 8 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1328-13\">. Harry Brown was the general manager of Chestnut Hill who was subsequently convicted of collecting extensions of credit by extortionate means (in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894); mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341); racketeering (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962); and conspiracy (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1328-32\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 provides in pertinent part: (a) Whoever under oath ... in any proceeding before ...

The indictment (Indictment No. 77-317) is reproduced in full at App. 14a-25a.</p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">Apfelbaum had been the subject of an earlier indictment which charged three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. The district court dismissed that indictment however because each of the three counts failed to allege sufficiently why the allegedly false statements were <em>material </em>to the grand jury investigation. <em>See United States v. Slawik, </em>548 F.2d 75 (3d Cir. 1977). <em>And see United States v. Tonelli, </em>577 F.2d 194 (3d Cir. 1978). Apfelbaum was then re-indicted under Indictment No. 77-317 which charged two counts of violating \u00a7 1623. As explained by Apfelbaum:</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-44\">The substantial difference between the first and second indictments was the allegations regarding materiality. The new indictment spelled out in more detail the subject matter of the grand jury investigation and how Mr. Apfelbaum\u2019s false statements tended to influence or impede the grand jury\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"ALDc\">Appellant\u2019s Brief at 15. Apfelbaum therefore does not challenge on appeal the materiality of the charges contained in Indictment No. 77-317.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">. That evidence demonstrated that Apfelbaum did indeed try to find Harry Brown in Florida in December, 1975, but could not locate him. Further, the evidence showed that on March 16, 1976, Apfelbaum told the FBI agents in an interview that he tried to locate Brown in Florida because he had loaned $10,000 to Brown in an \u201cextremely complicated arrangement\u201d and wanted to recover his money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">. In its brief the Government does not dispute that the excerpts of grand jury testimony, as noted above, were introduced at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">. Although Apfelbaum objected to the testimony summarized in text above, he did not object to any testimony reproduced in the indictment, nor to the admission at trial of other immunized grand jury testimony. The Government has not raised, nor has it argued, whether this failure to object constituted a waiver of any defect in the indictment, or a waiver which would permit the entire grand jury testimony transcript to be introduced at trial, despite the partial objection. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12. <em>See generally, Rogers v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 367, 372-75, 71 S.Ct. 438, 442, 95 L.Ed. 344 (1951) (\u201cwhere criminating facts have been voluntarily revealed, the privilege cannot be invoked to avoid disclosure of the details\u201d); <em>Brown v.

In light of the Government\u2019s failure to raise this issue, we do not address it here. <em>Stotler &amp; Co., Inc. v. Amstar Corp., </em>579 F.2d 13, at 20 (3d Cir. 1978) (opinion sur petition for panel rehearing); <em>see Singleton v.

As noted, <em>Hockenberry, </em>in defining the scope of the protection afforded by the immunity statute, limited the use of subsequent testimony to that \u201cessential to establishing the <em>corpus delicti.\u201d </em>In so holding however, there was apparently no need for the <em>Hockenberry </em>court to define the term <em>\u201ccorpus delicti\u201d </em>more specifically. Here, however, faced with a situation where there has been a wholesale introduction of immunized testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial, the need for defining <em>corpus delicti </em>with greater particularity becomes imperative. Thus, in the present context of a \u00a7 6002 immunity-perjury prosecution, we define <em>corpus de-licti </em>to mean only the statement or statements of the defendant which the grand jury has charged to be perjurious, together with no more than that minimal testimony <em>essential </em>to place the charged falsehood into its proper context. <em>See United States v. Patrick, </em>542 F.2d 381, 385 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 931, 97 S.Ct. 1551, 51 L.Ed.2d 775 (1977); <em>United States v. DiOrio, </em>150 F.2d 938, 939-40 &amp; n. 1 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>326 U.S. 771, 66 S.Ct. 175, 90 L.Ed. 465 (1945). Further, all of the testimony constituting the <em>corpus delicti </em>must be incorporated <em>in haec verba </em>in the perjury indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">. Our difficulty with the Second Circuit\u2019s rule as expressed in <em>Tramunti, Moss, </em>and <em>Berardelli </em>(among other cases) is that by permitting the subsequent use of arguably false, immunized testimony which is not the <em>corpus delicti </em>of a perjury indictment, the burden which the Government must carry to overcome immunity, and obtain a perjury conviction, is effectively lowered. Conviction for perjury requires that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that a false statement was made, and that it was knowingly false. By contrast, the Second Circuit\u2019s rule allows the government to obtain a conviction based on the admission of immunized testimony which is not the basis of any indictment and which the <em>court </em>finds, apparently on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence, to have been false. Further, it is unclear whether the Second Circuit requires a showing of scienter before the false immunized testimony is admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
