All defendants entered pleas of not guilty and filed motions to suppress certain evidence obtained as incidental to or growing out of their arrest. Following a hearing on June 1, 1977, all motions were denied pursuant to a written memorandum dated June 7, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-14\">Senior District Judge Sirica in that June 7th memorandum noted that the \u201ctangible evidence in question\u201d had been lawfully obtained in the course of investigative efforts by the arresting officer. Subsequent developments resulted in a dismissal of all charges against defendant Hughes. The remaining parties stipulated for a bench trial, the Government proffered certain evidence not already in the record, and the parties were directed to submit post-trial memoranda, and they did so. Thereafter a Memorandum of Decision was filed on July 29, 1977, with the district judge then setting forth his ultimate findings and conclusions of law. Judge Sirica noted that the Government\u2019s proof had not established beyond a reasonable doubt that Stafford had possessed phencyclidine \u201cwith a specific intent to distribute.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, he concluded that beyond a reasonable doubt, defendants Prince, Stafford and Foster \u201care each guilty as charged of one count of unlawful possession of phencyclidine.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Motions for acquittal were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-19\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-20\">Our inquiry accordingly will be directed to the events giving rise to the Government\u2019s acquisition of the \u201ctangible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-22\">Pertinent background facts may here be supplied, compendiously to be distilled from the findings reported by the trial judge. About 1:30 p. m. on March 7, 1977, Officer McMaster, a six-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Department, was on patrol in Southeast Washington. Over his radio he heard a police broadcast that a bank robbery had just taken place in nearby Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-23\">Two suspects had made their escape in a Volkswagen automobile. Based on his ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>perience, the officer undertook to station his cruiser at a location some two or three miles from the robbery scene and on a route most likely to be followed by the escaping robbers. Before he reached his intended lookout point, the officer saw a silver-painted Volkswagen already parked in the 2200 block of Southern Avenue, S.E. Later to be identified was the driver, one Hughes, and the other front seat passenger was the appellant Prince. The occupants of the rear seat turned out to be appellants Foster and Stafford.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Two men on the curbside were, as the judge put it, \u201chuddled by the car talking to\u201d the occupants of the Volkswagen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Believing that he had located the getaway car, Officer McMaster drove on past the silver-painted Volkswagen, unnoticed by the cluster of individuals just referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">He had noted that there was a Maryland dealer\u2019s tag on the suspect car and that there was no registration plate on the front. Presently turning his cruiser around, the officer came up behind the Volkswagen and parked that he might approach on foot. He cautiously sought, tactically, to disguise his suspicion that he had come upon the getaway Volkswagen involved in the Maryland robbery and that before him were at least some of the robbers. He intended to ask Hughes to produce his driver\u2019s permit and the registration for the Volkswagen. He feared that if alarmed, the possible suspects might take flight or even resort to violent action.</p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">As McMaster walked up, he saw appellant Stafford<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pass a hand-rolled cigarette to driver Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">The latter exhaled what the experienced officer identified as marijuana smoke, just as Hughes was being asked<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to produce his driver\u2019s permit and the car\u2019s registration. Hughes at once threw the cigarette to the ground. Hughes explained that the car had been rented in Maryland and that he had no registration for it, but he did produce his own driver\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-14\">The officer seized the opportunity, ostensibly to check<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the information so provided and so returned to the police car. He thereupon was able to radio to his superiors and to inform them of his suspicions and of his likely need of assistance. Two Metropolitan Police lieutenants promptly responded. They noticed that the Volkswagen before them was gray whereas the getaway car was of an entirely different color. They informed McMaster that he had the \u201cwrong ones.\u201d He, in any event, announced his purpose to arrest the two suspects who had been smoking marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-15\">Accordingly, he ordered driver Hughes to get out of the car, saying \u201cYou are under arrest.\u201d As McMaster was patting him down he saw Prince in the front passenger\u2019s seat remove from under a newspaper on his lap, a folded paper grocery bag. Prince pushed that paper bag between the two front seats, and then passed it back \u201cstealthily\u201d to appellants Stafford and Foster in the rear seats. We quote verbatim from the findings of the trial judge with particular reference to what next developed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>It became clear enough that Prince, Stafford and Foster sought to dissociate themselves from control of that bag and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">But Officer McMaster believed the paper bag contained a weapon. He pushed Hughes out of the doorway of the car where he was being patted down and reached for the bag then held by Stafford. McMaster ordered the latter to get out of the car while, at the same time, holding Stafford\u2019s arm so that he could not reach into the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The officer then feeling the bag which weighed at least a pound, noticed that its contents included a soft object and something which he believed to be \u201csome type of weapon.\u201d Opening the bag, the officer found narcotics paraphernalia, cutting and packaging materials, individually-wrapped tinfoil and plastic packages containing some 35,570 milligrams of phencyclidine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">The trial judge concluded <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that these appellants \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d had been engaged in a common enterprise, each participating in and guilty of a constructive possession of a dangerous drug within the meaning of 33 D.C.Code \u00a7 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">All of us at one time or other, one might say again and again, have considered cases where we reviewed the denial of motions for judgment of acquittal. We have recognized that the judge in the trial court and we in this court must view the question in the light most favorable to the Government\u2019s position. Judge Burger (now Chief Justice) so stated in <em>Crawford v. United States, </em>126 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 158, 375 F.2d 332, 334 (1967). He pointed out similarly that we must accord to the Government the benefits of all legitimate inferences as he drew upon <em>Thomas v. United States, </em>93 U.S.App.D.C. 392, 393, 211 F.2d 45, 46, <em>cert. denied, </em>347 U.S. 969, 74 S.Ct. 780, 98 L.Ed. 1110 (1954). The rule has been respected in numerous instances, such as <em>Curley v. United States, </em>81 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 392, 394-395, 160 F.2d 229, 232, 234-235, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 U.S. 837, 67 S.Ct. 1511, 91 L.Ed. 1850 (1947), <em>United States v. Fench, </em>152 U.S.App.D.C. 325, 333, 470 F.2d 1234, 1242, <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 964, 35 L.Ed.2d 271 (1973), <em>United States v. Weston, </em>151 U.S.App.D.C. 264, 266, 466 F.2d 435, 437 (1972) and <em>United States v. (Joseph) Davis, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 562 F.2d 681, as lately as April 6, 1977. In our careful consideration of the claims here advanced, once again we have applied the principle, and with the record so viewed, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-13\">Judge McGowan in <em>United States v. Wylie, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. -, 569 F.2d 62, 66 (1977), observed that the Supreme Court in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 13, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), had recognized that</p>\n<p id=\"axx-dedup-0\">\u201c[sjtreet encounters between citizens and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity,\u201d and consequently each case must be evaluated in light of the particular array of facts presented .</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-15\">It is our view that the police conduct at issue here involved a proper progression of escalating responses to circumstances which generated a mounting degree of suspicion that a crime had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>The series of events here, as found by the trial judge, successively gave rise to the ultimate conclusion he reached. For example, a circumstance neutral of itself, upon becoming part of the gathering whole may, as here, take on important significance. In <em>United States v. (Patrick) Davis, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 400, 403, 458 F.2d 819, 822 (1972), our opinion spelled out that the surreptitious passing of a package can become a possible element in establishing the probable cause mix. Again, the <em>Wylie </em>opinion, <em>supra, </em>at 68, emphasized \u201cthat in judging the reasonableness of the actions\u201d of a police officer, \u201cthe circumstances before him are not to be dissected and viewed simply,\u201d but must be considered as a whole. \u201cSo considered they are to be viewed through the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer on the scene, guided by his experience and training. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 15, 525 F.2d 857, 859 (1976).\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Reasonableness of the action taken by a police officer in a particular situation presents a criterion not to be overlooked as we undertake to strike and apply a proper balance. Judge McGowan in <em>United States v. Wylie, supra, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. at 239, 569 F.2d at 70, and Judge Leventhal in <em>United States v. Short, </em>187 U.S.App.D.C. 142, 145, 570 F.2d 1051, 1054, note 6 (1978), have both pointed to guidance we deem helpful here. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 145-146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972) (citations omitted):</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">In <em>Terry </em>this Court recognized that \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d The Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape. On the contrary, <em>Terry </em>recognizes that it may be the essence of good police work to adopt an intermediate response. A brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">Taking account of the facts as found by the trial judge and the inferences<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> reasonably to be drawn from those facts, we are in agreement with the conclusion reached by the trial judge that Officer McMaster as an experienced Metropolitan Police Officer had here acted prudently and reasonably. The arrest was lawful and the contraband was properly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">At the risk of possibly redundant reference to Supreme Court rulings predating <em>United States v. Chadwick, infra, </em>we deem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>it desirable to trace out the development of pertinent principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">. When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that .the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer\u2019s safety might well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction. And the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items must, of course, be governed by a like rule. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\"><em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 762-763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">Perhaps no one of our illustrious legal mentors better has conferred guidance than the late Mr. Justice Black writing for a unanimous court in <em>Preston v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 364, 84 S.Ct. 881, 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1964):</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">. The rule allowing contemporaneous searches is justified, for example, by the need to seize weapons and other things which might be used to assault an officer or effect an escape, as well as by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence of the crime \u2014 things which might easily happen where the weapon or evidence is on the accused\u2019s person or under his immediate control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\"><em>Id., </em>at 367, 84 S.Ct. at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">In view of the circumstances we have narrated based upon the findings of the district judge, we deem it entirely reasonable that Officer McMaster sought to exclude the possibility of assault when he was in the immediate presence of four possibly drug-stimulated suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">We have been urged to rule that error here must be found because of the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 53 L,Ed.2d 538 (1977). Reliance upon <em>Chadwick </em>is misguided, to say the least, for there the accused were already securely in custody, no exigency had been shown, and a seized and padlocked footlocker had been for more than an hour in the exclusive control of the federal agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">Rather, we should read <em>Chadwick </em>as teaching once again what had already been said in <em>Chimel </em>and <em>Preston, supra:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">When a custodial arrest is made, there is always some danger that the person arrested may seek to use a weapon, or that evidence may be concealed or destroyed. To safeguard himself and others, and to prevent the loss of evidence, it has been held reasonable for the arresting officer to conduct a prompt, warrantless \u201csearch of the arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u2018within his immediate control\u2019 \u2014 construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-14\">Such searches may be conducted without a warrant, and they may also be made whether or not there is probable cause to believe that the person arrested may have a weapon or is about to destroy evidence. The potential dangers lurking in all custodial arrests make warrantless searches of items within the \u201cimmediate control\u201d area reasonable without requiring the arresting officer to calculate the probability that weapons or destructible evidence may be involved. . . . (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-16\"><em>Id., </em>at 14-15, 97 S.Ct. at 2485.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-17\">The law so stated must govern here. Certain claims of a minor nature have been taken into account in the course of our review of the record in these consolidated appeals. Nothing short of frivolous, we might say, such claims have no substantive bearing upon the conclusions reached by the trial judge. We have adequately discussed in ample detail the factors which we deem controlling and which require that the judgments of conviction be and they are</p>\n<p id=\"ah2-dedup-0\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1060-16\">. The trial judge recited in his Conclusions that phencyclidine is a \u201ccontrolled substance within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and a dangerous drug within 33 D.C.Code \u00a7 702.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-17\">Section 841(a) proscribes as unlawful the possession of a controlled substance \u201cwith intent to distribute . . .\u201d. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, Schedule 111(b)(7) identifies \u201cphencyclidine\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-25\">The Forensic Chemist Laboratory Director, in his laboratory reports also identifies phencycli-dine in its \u201cstreet\u201d terms as PCP.

The Government dismissed the remaining counts against the three appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">. As Stafford tells us in his brief, the officer saw Stafford \u201ctake a drag on a hand-rolled cigarette and pass it to the driver, Mr. Hughes, who did the same.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">. One of the two men on the curbside, leaning into the car, then seeing the officer, turned and ran into a nearby apartment house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">As events so rapidly unfolded the second man on the curbside noticed the uniformed officer, backed away and disappeared.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">. <em>Cf. United States v. Weston, </em>151 U.S.App.D.C. 264, 267-268, 466 F.2d 435 at 438-39 (1972), where we find an example of the value of police tactics in verifying a driver\u2019s permit and the registration of a car on a public street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1061-18\">. The trial judge\u2019s findings next read:</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-19\">14. McMaster further observed that defendant Stafford placed the bag on the seat and pushed it towards defendant Foster who pushed it back to Stafford, who again pushed it towards Foster, all of which indicated to Officer McMaster that neither Prince, nor Stafford, nor Foster wished to be deemed in possession of the bag\u2019s contents. These actions also indicated that these three individuals knew what was contained in the bag.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">. Officer McMaster thereupon arrested appellants Prince and Foster. From the latter the officer took a shoulder bag which was found to contain 4,860 milligrams of phencyclidine and 3,820 milligrams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">The several defendants were then and there advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights and were taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">At the Narcotics Office where the defendants were again advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights, Officer McMaster began typing up his formal police report. He then asked fellow detectives to estimate the street value of the seized contraband. One detective expressed an appraisal of some $1,400. Stafford thereupon volunteered that the street value was much less than the estimate given by the officer. The trial judge viewed Stafford\u2019s volunteered comment as highly probative but inconclusive to establish that Stafford personally had harbored an intent to distribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1062-17\">. No narcotics sale was shown to have occurred although Prince possessed in the paper bag in his lap the phencyclidine \u201cpackaged in saleable form.\u201d The judge in his Conclusions further noted that the two men whom he described as \u201chuddled by the car\u201d were, he said, \u201cthought to be potential purchasers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">. <em>Compare United States v.
