The Commission rejected the petitions, finding that WCBB had failed to raise any substantial and material questions requiring a hearing on the renewal applications. Petitioner then sought review in this court. We deferred our consideration of these challenges pending the decision of this court <em>en banc </em>in <em>Bilingual Bicultural Coalition on Mass Media v. FCC, </em>(D.C.Cir. No. 75-1855, decided May 4, 1978) <em>(Bilingual). </em>We now remand the records in these cases for further consideration by the Commission in light of the <em>Bilingual </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-18\">Petitioner\u2019s primary claim before the Commission and this court has been that the three licensees involved should not be granted immediate renewal under the applicable public interest standard, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a) (1970), because of substantial underemployment of women in their work forces. In all three cases the percentages of women employed by the licensee during the license term<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are substantially less than the percentage of women in the Los Angeles Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) work force; with respect to two of the licensees, KTTY and KCOP, the percentages of women employed in the upper four job categories most closely related to a station\u2019s actual operations and programming are less than 15 percent of the percentage of women in the SMSA work force. It is petitioner\u2019s claim that, at the very least, further inquiry is required to determine the reasons for these disparities and to shape appropriate sanctions or reporting requirements to redress the underlying problems.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>In <em>Bilingual </em>this court emphasized that the \u201cpublic interest is not served by licensees who engage in intentional employment discrimination.\u201d Slip op. at 13. Such practices \u201cput seriously into question a licensee\u2019s character qualifications to remain a licensee: intentional discrimination almost invariably would disqualify a broadcaster from a position of public trusteeship.\u201d Slip op. at 14. Moreover, even apart from the question of past intentional discrimination, underrepresentation of certain groups in a licensee\u2019s work force, particularly in the professional and operations categories where decisionmaking responsibility is located, may result in programming which fails adequately to serve the community. Thus we recognized as well in <em>Bilingual </em>the responsibility of the FCC \u201cto ensure that programming reflects minority interests,\u201d a responsibility which necessitates invocation of <em>\u201cprospective, </em>administrative sanctions \u2014 short-term license renewals and license renewals conditioned on reporting\u2014 which enable [the FCC] to monitor broadcasters\u2019 progress in recruiting and hiring minority workers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">This is not to say that further inquiry or sanctions are appropriate whenever there is any disparity between the available workforce in the SMSA and the licensee\u2019s own workforce. We stated in <em>Bilingual:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">Evidence of minor statistical disparities between the available minority workforce and a station\u2019s employment, standing alone, in most cases will not warrant a hearing. Yet evidence of <em>substantial </em>statistical disparity \u2014 evidence that a licensee\u2019s minority employment is outside the \u201czone of reasonableness\u201d \u2014 while it may not in itself necessarily require resolution at a hearing, <em>should at least put the FCC on notice that more information is required before the license renewal application can be granted. * * *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">Slip op. at 15-16. (first emphasis in original, last emphasis added; footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">Where further information is needed the FCC may either conduct its own inquiry or afford the petitioner an opportunity to conduct discovery. If it chooses the first alternative, however, the Commission must ensure that the petitioner has a meaningful opportunity to examine and comment on the information received. As we stated in <em>Bilingual, </em>\u201cThe full report of the Commission\u2019s investigation, including all evidence it receives, must be placed in the public record, and a stated reasonable time allowed for response and rebuttal by petitioners. These procedures will permit meaningful participation by petitioners without necessitating potentially burdensome discovery.\u201d Slip op. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>The cases before us now were decided by the Commission before our decision in <em>Bilingual. </em>Because we believe the Commission should have the opportunity, in the first instance, to apply the principles we announced and clarified in <em>Bilingual </em>to the facts of these cases, we remand the records before us now to the Commission for further consideration in light of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1153-16\">. As to post-term improvements, of which there is some evidence in these cases, it should be noted that while post-term statistics \u201cmay be of some relevance * * * we have never accepted, and we do not here accept, the proposition that license renewals may be granted in reliance on post-term statistics alone. To permit exclusive reliance on such statistics would be to allow licensees to discriminate throughout the term, confident that they could secure renewal by hiring minority workers <em>after </em>the term had expired. We would not permit this; we trust the FCC would not permit it either.\u201d <em>Bilingual Bicultural Coalition on Mass Media v. FCC, </em>(D.C.Cir. No. 75-1855, decided May 4, 1978) n.42 (1978) <em>(en </em>banc) (Bilingual) (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1153-20\">. In all these cases WCBB\u2019s petitions were denied subject to any action the Commission might deem appropriate as a result of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or judicial determinations in cases of specific charges of employment discrimination by the licensee then pending before EEOC. As we stated in <em>Bilingual, supra </em>note 1, \u201cEvidence of actual discriminatory conduct in most cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>will present a substantial and material question of fact warranting a renewal hearing.\u201d Slip op. at 15. In these cases there is no indication of any final disposition on the charges involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">. This court has not required employment and population percentages to be in exact parity; we have found it sufficient if the licensee\u2019s employment figures fall within a \u201czone of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Bilingual, supra </em>note 1, slip op. at 11 n.15. The FCC has stated a rule of thumb that a licensee\u2019s minority or women employment is within this zone if it \u201c \u2018reflects at least 50 percent of [these groups\u2019] respective percentages in the relevant work force and 25 percent of such percentages in the station\u2019s upper-four jobs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>Slip op. at 16 n.33. According to this rule of thumb, two of the three licensees challenged here \u2014 KTTV and KCOP \u2014 fail to fall within the zone of reasonableness with respect to their employment of women. Moreover, the zone of reasonableness must contract over time, <em>id., </em>and substantial disparities, such as those claimed with respect to all three licensees, may necessitate further inquiry and action even if falling slightly short of the rule of thumb definition of reasonableness. This is particularly true where, as is alleged here, recruitment efforts are not in fact aggressive and result-oriented; where similar recruitment efforts have failed to produce significant or lasting improvements in the past, at a minimum Commission monitoring may be necessary to ensure that there will indeed be improvements in the future, as the zone of reasonableness contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1155-7\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"afq-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">In remanding these cases to the FCC for further consideration in the light of our recent <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Bilingual Bicul-tural Coalition on Mass Media v. FCC, </em>(No. 75-1855, D.C.Cir., May 4, 1978) (hereafter <em>\u201cBilingual IF\u2019), </em>when to my mind <em>Bilingual </em>calls for an affirmance of the FCC, the majority asserts three bases for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">First the majority states:</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">In all three cases [KNXT, KCOP, KTTV] the percentages of women employed by the licensee during the license term are substantially less than the percentage of women in the Los Angeles Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) work force .</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">This is true for a number of reasons, but neither this court nor the FCC has ever required full parity between the percentage of a given group employed at a licensee and the percentage of that group in the area work force. In the case of these three stations, it appears that for two of them the total percentage of women employed in the total work force of each station was, for <em>every year during the license term, </em>within the 50% parity \u201crule of thumb\u201d for determining the \u201czone of reasonableness\u201d and in the case of KNXT that station during the first two years of its license term exhibited 47.2% and 49% parity respectively, and exceeded 50% in the third year of its license. In addition, the Commission found that KNXT had a vigorous affirmative action program and that its \u201cpractices and policies exhibit a result oriented, affirmative commitment towards hiring

related to a station\u2019s actual operations and programming are less than 15 percent of the percentage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>of women in the SMSA work force. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Majority op. at--of 190 U.S.App.D.C., at 1091 of 584 F.2d. No authority is cited for these figures and their source and accuracy are not easily checked. Apparently they are based on the KCOP and KTTV employment records during the license period, although in 1974 by my checking the figure for women in the \u201cupper four job categories,\u201d KTTV was somewhat over 16%, not under 15%. When the majority seeks to rely on these statistics it overlooks the dramatic increase in the number of women in these job categories in 1975 in the two stations. The FCC found that the attitude which caused this dramatic increase was clear proof of the vigor of the affirmative action programs, and of the unbroken trend of increasingly large percentages of women in these upper level jobs during the license period itself. The zone of reasonableness \u201crule of thumb\u201d figure of 25% parity with the percentage of women in the workforce as being a \u201creasonable\u201d percentage of women to have in the upper four job categories is not a rigid requirement, and in light of the affirmative action programs of these stations and the overall reasonableness of their percentage of women employees, the Commission was fully justified in renewing these stations\u2019 licenses without further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">Further, in footnote 3 the court states: . two of the three licensees challenged here \u2014 KTTV and KCOP \u2014 fail to fall within the zone of reasonableness with respect to their employment of women.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">This statement does not refer to any particular year so it is hard to determine what period of time the majority is referring to and it does not specify whether it is based on overall employment or employment in the upper four job categories. Since all stations exceed the \u201crule of thumb\u201d reasonableness standard for 1975 for total women employee's, it can only be referring to 1974, and to a much less degree to 1975. As heretofore stated, neither KCOP nor KTTV had a sufficiently high percentage of women employed within the top four job categories to come within the \u201crule of thumb\u201d reasonableness standard. For a station to be within the \u201czone of reasonableness,\u201d it must employ in the upper four job categories at least 25% of the percentage of women in the SMSA work force. While both KCOP and KTTV are extremely close to this figure in 1975, they were not as of 1974. But it is the present and the future that is the principal concern, not the past. This slight numerical failing that presently exists is more than compensated for by the fact that the FCC explicitly found that both these stations had effective and diligently pursued affirmative action programs. At KNXT, the Commission found that its \u201cpractices and policies exhibit a result oriented, affirmative commitment towards hiring minorities and women,\u201d In Re Application of Metromedia, Inc., 57 F.C.C.2d 277, 281 (1975). At KCOP the FCC discerned \u201csubstantial efforts to recruit, hire, and promote\u201d women employees, In Re Application of KCOP Television, Incorporated, 57 F.C.C.2d 227, 229 (1975). In neither 1974 nor 1975 did either KTTV or KCOP fall outside the \u201czone of reasonableness\u201d insofar as total employment of women was concerned. With these facts in mind we review <em>Bilingual II </em>to determine its application to the action of the FCC with respect to renewals it granted to the three stations here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-10\">In <em>Bilingual II, supra, </em>we upheld the action of the FCC in renewing, without further investigation, the operating license of station KCBS against which a petition to deny had been filed alleging discrimination against Asians at the station. The record in <em>Bilingual II </em>reflects that in 1975, action there taken by the Commission is the same as that taken in the case of the stations whose license renewals are here presented for review. In 1975, the year after the station\u2019s previous license term expired, the employment of Asians at KCBS was at 56% parity with the percentage of Asians in the SMSA work force. This is to be compared with the FCC\u2019s \u201crule of thumb\u201d figure of 50% parity for determining when a station\u2019s employment profile is within the \u201czone of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>reasonableness\u201d sanctioned by this court in several cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In renewing the license, the Commission also noted the presence of an affirmative action program at the station and dismissed the petitioners\u2019 allegations of discriminatory programming, relying primarily on the doctrine that \u201ca licensee has wide discretion in the area of programming,\u201d WOIC, Inc., 39 F.C.C.2d 355, 367 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Bilingual II </em>we then affirmed the Commission\u2019s action stating that \u201cin view of these findings, as well as the absence of any allegation of overt discrimination, the FCC properly concluded that no substantial and material question of fact had been raised and that renewal without prospective remedies was consistent with the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Anyz\">In the three cases before us in this consolidated appeal, the Women\u2019s Coalition for Better Broadcasting raised virtually identical charges of programming discrimination against KCOP, KTTV and KNXT as were raised against KCBS, and the FCC rejected them on much the same grounds as it had in <em>Bilingual </em>II.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In our opinion in <em>Bilingual II </em>there is nothing to intimate that any reason exists for the Commission to reconsider its rejection of appellants\u2019 challenge to the stations\u2019 programming.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nothing in the opinion even discusses that possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">With respect to the employee status of the three stations here involved the record before us shows that in 1975 KTTV had 59% parity with the percentage of women in the Los Angeles SMSA work force; and KCOP had a 67% parity in that year. Both these figures are, needless to say, more favorable to the licensee than those on which we relied in affirming the license renewal of KCBS without further investigation in <em>Bilingual II. </em>The 1975 figure was unavailable for KNXT, but in 1974, the station\u2019s employment profile showed a 56% parity with the SMSA work force. This is the same figure that we found for KCBS in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-11\">The Commission\u2019s decision in renewing KCBS\u2019s license did not present any summary of the employment profile of the station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>during the license term, due apparently to the absence of meaningful annual figures during this period resulting from the quick turnover of Asians employed between 1971-1974.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is, accordingly, difficult to compare precisely the license term employment records of KCBS with those of KTTV, KCOP and KNXT. The most significant available point of comparison is the fact that the FCC explicitly found that the employment profiles of all three stations for all women employees were within the zone of reasonableness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, in the cases of KTTV, KCOP and KNXT, the Commission, having workable license term statistics before it, discussed these records in detail and found them to be reasonable,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and used the dramatic post-term improvements it observed <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to corroborate its judgment that no substantial question of discrimination on the part of the stations was thereby presented. Although in the last year of the license term KCBS has a remarkable 98% parity figure \u2014 exceeding that of any of the stations herein question \u2014 in view of the rapid drop in this figure (as opposed to the general improvement during the same period in the employment figures for KTTV, KCOP and KNXT in 1975 and the uncertainty of the data during the first two years of the license period), KCBS\u2019s employment record cannot credibly be said to be any more impressive than those of the interve-nors in this appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If anything, it appears that the employment profiles of the latter can \u2014 due to availability of better statistical analyses- \u2014 more confidently be found to be reasonable (and thus these stations\u2019 licenses more properly renewed without further investigation) than those of KCBS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">The station, KONO, whose license renewal we remanded in <em>Bilingual II </em>for further consideration by the Commission presents a marked contrast to any of the stations dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>cussed above. In responding to a petition to deny filed by a Mexican-American group the FCC found not only that the employment of Mexican-Americans was outside the zone of reasonableness, but also that the percentage of Mexican-Americans in the station\u2019s work force had remained \u201cstatic\u201d for four years and that the station\u2019s affirmative action program was \u201cpassive.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our remand in <em>Bilingual II </em>of the Commission\u2019s refusal, on such ah abysmal record as that presented by KONO, to investigate further allegations of discrimination does not provide any authority for the remand \u201cfor further consideration\u201d of the renewal applications of stations with such enormously different employment histories as KTTV, KCOP or KNXT. While the Commission found the KONO employment profile specifically to be outside of the zone of reasonableness, it found exactly the opposite for these other three stations. Such fact was considered important by the court in <em>Bilingual II.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the case of KTTV and KCOP, it also explicitly praised the licensees\u2019 affirmative action program both in terms of increasing total employment of the minority in question and of the employment of this group in the upper four job categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\"><em>Bilingual II </em>established no precise statistical cut-off points for determining when the FCC should be required to conduct further inquiries into allegations of employment discrimination; nor would any rigid lines be appropriate in view of the flexible nature of the \u201czone of reasonableness concept\u201d adopted by the FCC following our earlier declaration. It is, therefore, impossible to assert that <em>Bilingual II compels </em>this court to affirm the Commission\u2019s actions in the license renewals now under consideration. Instead, the similarities between KCBS and KTTV, KCOP and KNXT and the dissimilarities between all these stations and KONO are so marked that it cannot be said that <em>Bilingual II </em>provides any support for a remand in these cases. At the very least, the majority should provide some more reasoned explanation of its decision to remand than merely to state that \u201cwe believe the Commission should have the opportunity, in the first instance, to apply the principles we announced and clarified in Bilingual.\"<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On the figures presented here, these \u201cprinciples\u201d would strongly suggest that the license renewals should be summarily affirmed rather than remanded, particularly as <em>Bilingual II </em>emphasized the limited scope of our review of FCC action on license renewals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-13\">In conclusion, it is important to underscore the extent to which the panel\u2019s remand of these appeals on the alleged authority of <em>Bilingual II </em>seriously distorts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>impact of that decision. A principal emphasis in our opinion in <em>Bilingual II </em>was on the need for expedition in the handling of the numerous renewal requests received by the FCC each year<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and on the fact that the FCC was not a surrogate Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged with promoting the policies of the EEOC instead of the broader \u201cpublic interest\u201d embodied in the Federal Communications Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">The employment discrimination claims advanced in the appeals before us in these cases are on their face unfounded and the Commission\u2019s disposition of them should receive summary affirmance. Moreover, the petitions to deny filed in the three separate cases here were practically boilerplate and presented largely meritless objections to the license renewals. The three briefs are also essentially identical. In fact, the appellants used the same brief and only changed the appellee\u2019s name to such an extent that in one of their briefs by mistake they inserted \u201cKNXT\u201d rather than \u201cKTTV.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission must be allowed to deal expeditiously and summarily with such petitions if the present system of triennial license renewals is to function at all. By remanding these appeals to the Commission for further consideration in light of <em>Bilingual II, </em>the court implicitly suggests that this opinion should be viewed as arguably requiring the FCC to adopt significantly more rigorous standards, or at least apply a closer scrutiny under existing standards, in evaluating the reasonableness of a station\u2019s equal employment record. Whatever misgivings the other members of this panel may have had concerning the outcome of <em>Bilingual II, </em>candor compels recognition of the fact that that decision cannot justifiably be interpreted in a light that would call for the remand of these cases.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In directing the remand of these cases, in my view, the majority is overreaching its appellate jurisdiction and distorting our own <em>en banc </em>decision on which the ink is barely dry.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1155-61\">.

Typical of the attention that the Commission thought was merited by these arguments is the following passage from the Commission\u2019s order renewing KTTV\u2019s license:</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-14\">In view of the licensee\u2019s past programming, we cannot accept the petitioner\u2019s argument that the licensee has responded to women\u2019s interest through only two programs. The Commission find no merit to the coalition\u2019s allegations, specifically that the needs of women have not been served by KTTV-TV. We reject the argument that women\u2019s problems or interests were only addressed by programs specifically designed for the female viewer. Therefore, we believe, KTTV\u2019s past programming, contrary to the Coalition\u2019s allegation demonstrates that the licensee has presented programs devised specifically for women \u201cas well as programming which has a wider range of appeal.\u201d Taft Broadcasting Co., 38 F.C.C.2d 770, 792 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-15\">There is nothing in <em>Bilingual II </em>that would supply any reason for the Commission to alter this opinion or the similar decisions reached concerning KCOP and KNXT\u2019s programming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">.

The fact that the Commission found the employment figures to be within the zone of reasonableness and that the stations\u2019 licenses should be renewed is entitled to considerable deference. \u201cIf the Commission\u2019s action in granting those renewals \u2018was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, we must affirm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bilingual II, </em>slip op. at 19, quoting from <em>Columbus Broadcasting v.

There has been no suggestion, nor does the majority suggest, that the Commission\u2019s examination of the figures in question has been anything but thorough. The scrutiny with which the FCC investigated any plausible claims of discrimination involving the intervenor licensees is indicated by the fact that the Commission did impose additional reporting requirements on KCOP concerning its \u201cprogress in recruiting qualified minority personnel\u201d in light of what the FCC considered a \u201cweak\u201d KCOP employment profile for minorities. 57 F.C.C.2d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">It is also worth noting in regard to KTTV in particular, that the station\u2019s employment record in regard to other minority groups was so impressive that the Commission considered that it merited special mention. The total minority availability in the Los Angeles SMSA work force was only 29.1%. At KTTV there were 23.30% minority workers in all jobs and 12.94% in the upper four job classifications in 1974 and 23.11% minorities in all jobs and 15.38% in the upper four occupational groups in 1975. These statistics heighten the implausibility of the claim that KTTV is a discriminatory employer. 57 F.C.C.2d at 281.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1158-12\">. KTTV and KCOP, the only stations whose 1975 employment profile appears in this record showed significant increases in the number of women employed in the top four job categories. At KTTV, this figure increased from 6.5 to over 9%. Indeed, the four person increase in upper four job category employees in 1975 appears to have been constituted entirely of new upper level women employees, 57 F.C.C.2d at 280-281. KCOP also showed a major increase in the percentage of women employed in the upper four job levels in 1975, this percentage jumping from 5.3% to 9.2% (an increase of approximately 73%). In view of this record,the majority\u2019s comment that \u201cthere is some evidence\u201d of post term improvements, Majority opinion at-n.l of 190 U.S.App.D.C., at 1091 n.1 of 584 F.2d, is patently misleading.

Moreover, the small representation of Asians in the SMSA workforce makes the KCBS statistics somewhat susceptible to misinterpretation.
