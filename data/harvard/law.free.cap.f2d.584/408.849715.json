(Williams) and (2) joint rates initiated by Williams and intervenor Explorer Pipeline Co. (Explorer), as against claims that the former are unreasonably excessive, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 l(5)(a), and the latter are discriminatory, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2, and illegally preferential, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">This review proceeding is unique in that, while pending before us awaiting briefing and oral argument, jurisdiction over the rates in question was transferred by Congress from the ICC to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the latter has been substituted for the ICC as the respondent agency. FERC has advised this court that it takes no position with respect to the merits of the order under attack, and urges us rather to forego adjudication on the merits in favor of a remand of the case to it so that it can formulate, independently to the ICC, the regulatory principles it finds to be suitable for application in this new area of responsibility committed to it. The United States, a statutory respondent, purporting to see deficiencies in the ICC\u2019s decision, supports FERC\u2019s remand request.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The court, now having had the benefit of full briefing and oral argument of the merits by all parties except FERC, has concluded, to the extent and for the reasons hereinafter appearing, to remand the case to FERC for determination by it, under its new authority, of the compatibility of the subject rates with 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 l(5)(a), and, in light of its findings thereon, for examination of the preference issue under <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3(1). As to the existence of discrimination, however, petitioners\u2019 failure properly to raise the issue before the ICC mandates our affirmance of that agency\u2019s decision insofar as it is based on <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Williams, an independent common carrier, is a relatively new entrant in the oil pipeline transmission industry, having begun doing business in 1966 with the purchase of Great Lakes Pipe Line Co. (Great Lakes). It acquired the physical assets of Great Lakes from eight petroleum producer-owners for $287.6 million \u2014 the highest among the competitive bids received.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The pipeline system thus acquired serves a large portion of the Midwest, with connections in such producing and refining cities as Tulsa, Fargo, Lincoln, and Topeka, and in such consuming cities as East St. Louis, Chicago, and Minneapolis. By interconnecting with intervenor Explorer Pipeline Co. (Explorer) at Tulsa, Williams also may connect refineries located along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana with consumers in the Midwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Petitioners are a group of oil producers and refiners located primarily in the Great Plains area who historically have used the Great Lakes-Williams pipeline system to transport their petroleum products to the Midwest. In late 1971 and early 1972, Williams informed them that it was raising its rates by approximately 15 percent (or 3 cents a barrel) across the board. At the same time as it generally increased its rates, Williams, together with Explorer, initiated joint rates for through service from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. These joint rates are uniformly 9.5 cents a barrel lower than the combination of Williams\u2019 and Explorer\u2019s local rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">Shortly after the appropriate tariffs were filed with the ICC, petitioners made them the subject of complaints under the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>sions of the Interstate Commerce Act which, <em>inter alia, </em>regulates oil pipeline rates, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 l(l)(b). Petitioners\u2019 protests led the ICC to initiate investigations into the lawfulness of both sets of rates, although the disputed rates have remained in effect without suspension since their inception, pending the outcome of these proceedings. Although many claims were originally raised by the parties, the course of administrative consideration has left three major issues of import on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">First, petitioners argue that Williams\u2019 rate increases for the transportation of oil in the area formerly served by Great Lakes are unreasonable under <em>id. </em>\u00a7 l(5)(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because they are derived from an inflated valuation rate base<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and allow an excessive rate of return on that rate base (10%); and further because certain operating expenses<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and tax allowances<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> used by Williams in computing its rates were unreasonable. Second, petitioners claim that by charging them local rates to transport their oil from the Great Plains to the Midwest while charging the Gulf Coast shippers less (per mile) \u2014 under the joint Williams-Explorer rates \u2014 to transport their oil to the same destinations, intervenors are giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the Gulf Coast shippers an unjust preference. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, petitioners argue that by unevenly dividing the joint rate revenues with Explorer, Williams is giving the eight Gulf Coast shippers that jointly own Explorer a discriminatory rebate. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioners asked the ICC to order Williams to lower \u2014 and Williams and Explorer to readjust \u2014 the rates in question, and to pay reparations plus interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Petitioners do not contest the propriety of the procedures used by the ICC in adjudicating their complaints. The administrative law judge announced his decision favorable to Williams on June 6, 1974, after holding several days of formal hearings in 1972 and 1973 and after considering copious written submissions. <em>Petroleum Products, Williams Bros. Pipe Line Co. </em>(unpublished initial decision) [hereinafter referred to as <em>Initial Decision </em>and cited to Joint Appendix (JA)]. Exceptions were filed by the petitioners on both sets of issues, thereby entitling them to consideration by a three-commissioner division of the ICC. On the basis of the record as well as the exceptions and replies filed by the parties, the division, one commissioner dissenting, accepted the findings of the administrative law judge. <em>Petroleum Products, Williams Bros. Pipe Line Co., </em>355 I.C.C. 102, 126 (1975) [hereinafter referred to as <em>Williams I],</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Petitioners next asked the entire Commission to reconsider the case, arguing that it involved \u201cmatters of general transportation importance\u201d \u2014 the standard that must be met to secure reconsideration by the full Commission. Although asserting that the issues did not rise to the requisite level of importance, the full Commission felt that reconsideration of the record, as supplemented by written submissions by the parties, was merited \u201cbecause of the relative dearth of precedent concerning petroleum pipeline rates, and in view of the substantial sums of money at issue. ...\u201d <em>Petroleum Products, Williams Bros. Pipe Line Co., </em>355 I.C.C. 479, 481 (1976) [hereinafter referred to as <em>Williams II]. </em>In an opinion filed December 3, 1976, the full Commission, one commissioner dissenting and two not participating, affirmed the findings of the administrative law judge and the division, <em>id., </em>and petitioners sought direct review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">In 1906, the Interstate Commerce Act of Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, was amended by the Hepburn Act to include companies engaged in the \u201ctransportation of oil . by pipe line\u201d among the common carriers subject to regulation thereunder. Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, \u00a7 1, 34 Stat. 584. Yet, while pipeline companies joined railroads, and were later joined by motor carriers, as regulatory subjects of the Interstate Commerce Act, those companies never faced the degree of regulation to which the vehicular common carriers were subject. Thus, while under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>same duty as railroads and/or motor carriers to furnish or allow continuous transportation, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1(1), 1(4), 7, to establish, file, and publish reasonable, nondiscriminatory rates subject to ICC approval, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1(5), 3(1), 4(1), 6, 15(1), to avoid certain pooling relationships, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5(1), to file certain financial reports, and to use certain accounting procedures subject to ICC specifications, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 20(1), (2), (4), (5), pipeline companies have none of the special obligations imposed upon the vehicular regulatees under the Act concerning acquisitions, mergers, corporate affiliates, uniform cost and revenue accounting, issuance of securities, and corporate or financial reorganizations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5(2)-(13), 20(3), 20a, 20b, 20c. For this reason, we may infer a congressional intent to allow a freer play of competitive forces among oil pipeline companies than in other common carrier industries and, as such, we should be especially loath uncritically to import public utilities notions into this area without taking note of the degree of regulation and of the nature of the regulated business. <em>See </em>J. Bonbright, Principles of Public Utility Rates 4-5 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Consequently, beyond the general outlines of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the specific provisions therein dealing with ratemaking, see notes 2, 6 &amp; 7 <em>supra, </em>we have little to rely on in constructing a theory of oil pipeline ratemaking. Although the Act, as amended by the Valuation Act, 37 Stat. 701 (1913), does provide the ICC with the wherewithal to gather the information necessary to determine the \u201cvaluation\u201d of railroads <em>and </em>oil pipeline companies, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 19a, <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra, </em>we see nothing in the Valuation Act that requires the agency to translate its valuation authority into a mandatory approach to ratemaking or that makes a valuation approach inevitably reasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5IC\">. ICC precedent provides little additional guidance as to appropriate ratemaking methodology for the oil pipeline industry. In the four published opinions in which it has heretofore discussed oil pipeline rate-making, the ICC adopted the valuation rate base without discussion, or even explicit recognition, of alternative bases. <em>Reduced Pipe Line Rates and Gathering Charges, </em>243 I.C.C. 115 (1940) [hereinafter <em>Reduced Rates </em>I], <em>reopened, </em>272 I.C.C. 375 (1948) [hereinafter <em>Reduced Rates </em>II]; <em>Petroleum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>Rail Shippers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Alton &amp; So. R. R., </em>243 I.C.C. 589 (1941); <em>Minnelusa Oil Corp. v. Continental Pipe Line Co., </em>258 I.C.C. 41 (1944). Nonetheless, the ICC\u2019s use in the 1940\u2019s of the \u201cfair value\u201d method is not hard to explain \u2014 and in that explanation lies an important reason to reexamine the continued viability of the decisions announced during that era.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The ICC\u2019s primary experience with rate-making prior to the 1940\u2019s involved railroads, as to which a landmark Supreme Court case had appeared to mandate the fair value method of ratemaking. <em>Smyth v. Ames, </em>169 U.S. 466, 546-47,18 S.Ct. 418, 42 L.Ed. 819 (1898); <em>see </em>note 8 <em>supra. See also St. Louis &amp; O\u2019Fallon Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>279 U.S. 461, 49 S.Ct. 384, 73 L.Ed. 798 (1929). Subsequently, the Supreme Court\u2019s endorsement on this method was extended to other areas. <em>E. g., Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Missouri Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>262 U.S. 276, 43 S.Ct. 544, 67 L.Ed. 981 (1923). Although under the impetus of Justice Brand\u00e9is\u2019 concurring opinion in the last-cited case, <em>id. </em>at 289-312, 43 S.Ct. 544, the Supreme Court during the 1930\u2019s began to countenance experimentation with other ratemaking approaches, e. <em>g., Railroad Comm\u2019n of California v. Pacific Gas Co., </em>302 U.S. 388, 399, 58 S.Ct. 334, 82 L.Ed. 319 (1938), by this time the ICC had established a firm practice of using the valuation method. <em>E. g., Petroleum Rail Shippers, supra. </em>Thus, the ICC practice, reflected in the four pipeline rate cases cited earlier, of using a valuation rate base had become ensconced in that agency\u2019s decision by 1944, when the Supreme Court decisively reversed its field and became openly critical of talismanic reliance on \u201cfair value.\u201d <em>FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 601, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944). Moreover, between the time that <em>Hope\u2019s </em>implications became clear and the ICC\u2019s consideration of this case, that agency did not have occasion to discuss the principles of oil pipeline ratemaking.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As such, we are left to draw our conclusions about this case based on a series of ICC opinions that arose in a ratemaking environment that has since been dramatically altered by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">In addition to the significant changes in the relevant <em>legal </em>environment since the ICC\u2019s 1940\u2019s decisions, important <em>economic </em>transformations have occurred. First, that agency\u2019s only actual comparison in the 1940\u2019s of the \u201cvaluation\u201d of pipeline assets and the actual investment therein \u201cas carried on [the pipeline companies\u2019] books\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>apparently, original cost) shows that in a majority of cases \u201cthe valuations] found by the Commission were materially <em>lower </em>than the carriers\u2019 investment. ...\u201d <em>Reduced Rates I, supra, </em>243 I.C.C.. at 138 (emphasis added). This 1940\u2019s situation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>in marked contrast to that experienced in today\u2019s inflationary economy wherein valuation typically <em>exceeds </em>investment by a substantial amount.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Second, based on rather detailed analyses of economic conditions facing the industry in the 1940\u2019s, the Commission\u2019s 1940\u2019s decisions determined that oil pipeline rates should allow carriers to recover operating expenses plus no more than either an 8 percent return on value for transmission of crude oil or crude oil plus refined petroleum products, <em>Reduced Rates II, supra, </em>272 I. C.C. at 376, 384 (rates upheld actually producing 7.6 percent rate of return); <em>Min-nelusa, supra, </em>258 I.C.C. at 54; <em>Reduced Rates I, supra, </em>243 I.C.C. at 142, <em>or </em>a 10 percent return on value for transmission of gasoline. <em>Petroleum Rail Shippers, supra, </em>243 I.C.C. at 663. The ICC pointed out that by 1940\u2019s standards these rates of returns were</p>\n<p id=\"A8r\">somewhat larger . . . than . would be reasonable to expect would be applied in industries of a more stable character, where the volume of traffic is more accurately predictable.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\"><em>Minnelusa, supra, </em>258 I.C.C. at 54, <em>accord, Petroleum Rail Shippers, supra, 243 </em>I.C.C. at 661-62; <em>Reduced Rates I, supra, </em>243 I.C.C. at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">In the Commission\u2019s estimation, these \u201csomewhat larger\u201d rates of return were justified on the one hand by the need to attract capital to the oil pipeline industry despite the higher-than-normal risks faced by carriers of petroleum products,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and especially of gasoline,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and on the other hand, by the need to keep rates low enough to forestall the dangers of oligopolistic control of the oil pipeline industry by the big producers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Other factors considered by the ICC were the possibility of price fixing <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and a history of \u201cenormous\u201d profits,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the cost effects of greatly increased taxation during the 1930\u2019s,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the increased demand for oil products, the improved technology of pipeline transmission precipitated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>by World War II,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the prediction that economic forces would cause rates to drop regardless of ICC action.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Notably, aside from brief discussions of increased labor costs, the ICC\u2019s decisions make clear that operating costs other than taxes were relatively free from inflationary (or deflationary) influences from 1937 to 1947.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">To the extent that economic conditions facing the oil pipeline industry have changed since 1948 \u2014 and, in light of the modern onslaught of inflation, petroleum shortages, and reliance on imports, as well as the maturing of the industry itself, we may readily assume they have \u2014 the conclusions of the ICC in its earlier cases as to appropriate rates of return are equally as much artifacts of a bygone era as is its reliance then on a valuation rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Finally, the ICC\u2019s 1940\u2019s cases recede even further into the background when it is realized that the ICC has been replaced by FERC as the government agency charged with watching over oil pipeline rates.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The transfer of authority to FERC occurred during the pendency of this petition pursuant to the Department of Energy Organization Act (the DOE Act), Pub.L.No.95 \u2014 91, \u00a7 402(b), 91 Stat. 584 (1977), <em>effectuated, </em>Executive Order No. 12009, 42 Fed.Reg. 46267 (Sept. 15, 1977), <em>implemented, </em>42 Fed. Reg. 55534 (Oct. 17, 1977). Although, the DOE Act provides that litigation commenced before the transfer shall continue, with \u201cappeals taken, and judgments rendered . . . as if this Act had not been enacted,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> as regards the substantive administrative law applicable in this case, the transfer further unsettles the foundations on which we must adjudicate this petition. Thus, it removes the stabilizing influence of the courts\u2019 usual desire to afford an administrative agency some latitude over time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>develop its own approach to the regulatory tasks delegated to it by Congress. <em>See Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 790, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968). Here, the transfer of authority has deprived us of even the possibility of endorsing ICC\u2019s attempt to develop such an approach, and, in fact, has created the likelihood that anything we say will inhibit <em>FERC </em>from freely developing its approach in the future. That FERC has refused to adopt the IGC\u2019s position in this case, and \u2014 joined by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice \u2014 has asked that the case be remanded to it, illustrates this problem.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">This background should explain our reluctance to embark on the first federal judicial foray into the area of oil pipeline ratemak-ing.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In this endeavor, beyond the statute\u2019s admonition that rates be \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d we must rely almost entirely on the ICC\u2019s opinions in this case. Moreover, as the next section demonstrates, those opinions are characterized by analytical difficulties that undermine their usefulness in resolving the overall reasonableness of the assailed rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The parties have joined issue over the ICC\u2019s treatment of five criteria they deem crucial to the reasonableness of Williams\u2019 rate increases: rate base, rate of return, depreciation costs, tax treatment, and certain items of operating expenses. <em>See </em>notes 2-5 <em>supra </em>and <em>accompanying text. In </em>reaching our conclusion that the ICC\u2019s decisions<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> present problems that impel us to remand the reasonableness issue to its successor, FERC, we find it necessary to dwell on only the first three of these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Despite petitioners\u2019 insistence on original cost less depreciation of all of Williams\u2019 assets used in transmitting oil <em>(i. e., </em>$101.1 million), and Williams\u2019 somewhat tentative advocacy of purchase price ($287.6 million) as the appropriate rate base, the ICC used a \u201cvaluation\u201d base. <em>Williams I, supra, </em>351 I.C.C. at 108. This is calculated to be $167.6 million, <em>id., </em>based primarily on two factors listed in the Valuation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 19a \u2014 original cost, and the cost of reproduction new.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> All three decisions based their analyses of the rates on the percent return they allowed on valuation, so that the importance to all three of the valuation rate base cannot be gainsaid.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Most prominent among the three opinions\u2019 explanations of the use of the \u201cfair value\u201d method was that as the \u201ctraditional,\u201d \u201ccustomar[y],\u201d and \u201cwell-established practice\u201d of the ICC in oil pipeline cases, valuation ratemaking has \u201cwithstood the test of time.\u201d <em>Initial Decision, supra, </em>JA at 1608; <em>see id. </em>at 1605; <em>Williams I, supra, </em>351 I.C.C. 105, 107, 113, 114; <em>Williams II, supra, </em>355 I.C.C. at 485. In support of this \u201ctradition,\u201d however, the opinions (when they cite any support at all) list only (1) the 1940\u2019s oil pipeline cases discussed above, (2) the Commission\u2019s history of computing valuations under the Valuation Act, and (3) the fact that the Commission\u2019s mandatory accounting procedures for pipelines, see <em>Uniform System of Accounts for Pipeline Companies, </em>337 I.C.C. 518, 523 (1970), are geared to the use of a valuation rate base. <em>See Initial Decision, supra, </em>JA at 1605, 1608; <em>Williams I, supra, </em>351 I.C.C. at 107, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">As our previous discussion indicates, however, these three indicia of a tradition of fair value ratemaking are weak and outmoded. Both the oil pipeline precedents and the history of valuation computations under the Valuation Act are in large measure products of a bygone era of ratemaking ushered in by the Supreme Court in <em>Smyth v. Ames </em>in 1898 and ushered out by that same body in <em>Hope Natural Gas </em>in 1944. <em>See </em>notes 8-10 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. To the extent that the ICC\u2019s accounting rules derive their valuation focus from the 1940\u2019s precedents and the Valuation Act, <em>see Uniform System of Accounts, supra, </em>337 I.C.C. at 523, they, too, are subject to this same criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Moreover, each of the three indicia suffers from infirmities of its own. First, even if we assume under <em>Hope </em>that valuation ratemaking might be capable of producing a viable \u201cend result,\u201d there is no assurance in the Commission\u2019s 1940\u2019s precedents \u2014 born as they were of peculiar post-depression, World War II, and post-War economic conditions \u2014 that such a result will occur in the 1970\u2019s. Second, the Commission itself has seen fit to abandon its so-called tradition of valuation computation and ratemaking based thereon in the railroad area, which is equally subject to the Valuation Act. <em>See </em>note 9 <em>supra. </em>Finally, the ICC decision setting forth pipeline accounting rules states explicitly that it is</p>\n<p id=\"aeh-dedup-0\">concerned . . . with accounting rules which are not necessarily dispositive of the manner in which expenditures will be treated in a proceeding to determine the reasonable level of particular rates.</p>\n<p id=\"AU5\"><em>Uniform System of Accounts, supra, </em>337 I.C.C. at 523. This last-quoted caveat should hardly have to be express. After all, it is rates, not bookkeeping, that the statute requires to be reasonable, and there is no assurance of record, at least, that reasonable accounting measures translate automatically into reasonable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">In sum, we are not persuaded by the Commission\u2019s conclusion that \u201cconsistency and fairness\u201d dictate resurrection of the \u201cfair value\u201d method last used thirty years ago. <em>Williams II, supra, </em>355 I.C.C. at 484. To the extent that the method was wrongly grounded in the law at that time, it is no better off now. To the extent that it may have been rightly grounded in the economics of that day, the ICC has provided us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>with no reason to believe that three decades have not changed the situation. And, to the extent that Williams, having nothing else to depend on but the earlier cases, justifiably relied on them in adopting its rates, <em>see id., </em>the solution is not to perpetrate that reliance but to end it prospectively, without allowing reparations based on its occurrence in the past.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Aside from the above arguments, the three ICC opinions mentioned but one other justification for the \u201cfair value\u201d method: the need for a ratemaking theory responsive to inflation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We have no quarrel with the ICC\u2019s aspirations on this score. The Supreme Court has indicated that rates must be high enough to allow the regulatee to attract capital, and investors will be unlikely to invest if their earnings will not keep abreast of, and have some chance of exceeding, the rate of inflation. <em>See FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., supra, </em>320 U.S. at 603, 64 S.Ct. 281. Nonetheless, the ICC\u2019s failure to assess the actual effects of inflation on Williams\u2019 ability to attract capital, and its apparent \u201cdouble counting\u201d of concerns about inflation, <em>see </em>pp.---of 189 U.S.App.D.C., pp. 420-421 of 584 F.2d, <em>infra, </em>cast a shadow over its conclusion that a valuation rate base properly reflects inflation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">We find the ICC\u2019s discussion of rate of return equally problematical. Here the <em>total </em>emphasis is on the 1940\u2019s precedents: because 8-10 percent was a viable return for carriers of petroleum products from 1940 to 1948, it is said, so must it be today.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Even more so than the choice of a reasonable rate base methodology, a \u201creasonable rate of return\u201d determination must be the product of the economic moment. As noted earlier, the ICC\u2019s choice in the 1940\u2019s of the 8 and 10 percent figures turned on such \u201chazards\u201d as the infancy of the gasoline industry, the likelihood of disruptive discoveries of new oil fields and the unidimen-sional nature of the product market served by pipeline carriers, as well as on such factors as unduly high profits in the past, high taxes, and a rapidly expanding economy relatively free of inflation. <em>See </em>notes 12-20 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. Absent some accompanying assessment of how this complex of relevant factors has changed in thirty years, the ICC\u2019s reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>on its antiquated precedents in determining a reasonable rate of return differs little from a rule that would require modern automobile accident damages to conform to those awarded by juries in 1940.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Finally, we come to the depreciation charges allowed Williams as a cost that it may recoup through its rates. Just prior to Williams\u2019 purchase of Great Lakes, it secured a Commission opinion that the Commission\u2019s accounting instructions for pipeline carrier property accounts, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1204-3-1 <em>et seq., </em>applied to the purchase. JA at 202, 205. Under those instructions, Williams recorded its full purchase price of $287.6 million in its property account. Although the ICC informed Williams that this opinion did \u201cnot prejudice the Commission\u2019s continuing rights and responsibilities with regard to rate determinations that may come before it,\u201d JA at 205, Williams used this same method of valuing its wasting assets when calculating depreciation expenses for ratemaking purposes. Allowing this revaluation, for ratemaking as well as accounting purposes, of the Great Lakes-Williams property not only greatly increased depreciation charges from that point forward, but it also withdrew any recognition that rate payers had already been charged almost $100 million for depreciation by Great Lakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In upholding this operating expense calculation, the Commission did little more than (1) note the calculation\u2019s congruence with its reporting and accounting rules, especially as discussed in <em>Uniform System of Accounts, supra, </em>and (2) point out the inability of petitioner\u2019s recommended original cost approach to keep pace with inflated property values. <em>Williams II, supra, </em>355 I.C.C. at 489. Once again, we cannot countenance the ICC\u2019s current unexplained insistence on irrevocably hitching its ratemaking theory to its accounting rules. This linkage is especially troublesome because, when it wrote those rules, the Commission expressly denied them any such controlling impact on rates. <em>See </em>p. - of 189 U.S.App.D.C., p. 418 of 584 F.2d <em>supra. </em>It supported that express denial of linkage with a reminder that the ICC traditionally did not tie rates to \u201cinvestment as shown on the carriers\u2019 books, but rather [to] . valuations [computed] pursuant to the [Valuation Act].\u201d <em>Uniform System of Accounts, supra, </em>337 I.C.C. at 523. Hence, we are left with the additional unexplained anomaly of a valuation rate base coexisting with a purchase price depreciation base\u2014 hardly an \u201caccepted . . . practice [].\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The final irrationality is that the depreciation basis used, unlike original cost, valuation, and other possible approaches, allows depreciation charges, and thus the rates, to change dramatically from one day to the next \u2014 so long as a purchase of the assets intercedes \u2014 even though the cost of the carriers\u2019 public service has not actually changed. It is true that occasional acquisitions of carriers at prices deemed currently reasonable might serve as a mechanism for accurately reflecting inflation\u2019s impact on the value of such enterprises. We have our doubts, however, about either the desirability of encouraging acquisitions solely for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>this purpose, or of depending on their unpredictable occurrence to serve this function. In any case, the ICC in this case purports to have recognized inflation in figuring rate base (and perhaps even rate of return, <em>see Williams II, supra, </em>355 I.C.C. at 487), so that a further inflation adjustment by way of increased depreciation charges would seem precipitous and itself unduly inflationary. <em>See </em>p. - of 189 U.S.App.D.C., p. 419 of 584 F.2d, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The foregoing discussion illustrates our unease with the ICC\u2019s findings regarding rate base, rate of return, and depreciation costs. Those three criteria, in turn, are important enough that doubts as to them must infect our view of the Commission\u2019s ultimate finding of reasonableness.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Nonetheless, were this a normal case, the limited scope of review under which we operate in these proceedings might require us to look beyond ICC\u2019s rationale to the record itself, before we would be prepared to disapprove the Commission\u2019s ultimate holding. <em>See, e. g., Permian Basin, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 766-67, 88 S.Ct. 1344 (rate must be upheld if total effect is reasonable); <em>FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., supra, </em>320 U.S. at 603, 64 S.Ct. 281 (rate must be upheld, even if subject to theoretical \u201cinfirmities,\u201d if \u201cend result\u201d is reasonable); <em>The Second National Natural Gas Rate Cases, </em>No. 76-2000, <em>et al., </em>slip op. at 18 (D.C.Cir. June 16, 1977) (\u201cbasic . requirement [is] that there be support in the public record for what is done.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">But this is not a normal ratemaking case \u2014 in large measure because we are at something of a loss to know what to look for should we resort to the public record. The lack of viable precedents in this area and thus of some semblance of established ratemaking theory undercuts any confidence we have that we can make a \u201creasonableness\u201d determination in the absence of some significant assistance from the agency formerly charged with making that determination in the first instance. Moreover, the record appears to be incomplete in certain significant respects. <em>See </em>note 27 <em>supra. </em>What clinches our decision to remand on the reasonableness issue, however, is the fact that the agency <em>now </em>charged with that responsibility, FERC, has requested a remand so that it may begin its regulatory duties in this area with a clean slate. While \u201cinfirmities\u201d in an agency\u2019s methodology may not prevent us from affirming its otherwise supportable \u201creasonable rate\u201d determination, <em>see FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., supra, </em>320 U.S. at 603, 64 S.Ct. 281, such \u201clegal blemishes\u201d may justify us in honoring that agency\u2019s (or its successor\u2019s) request that we remand its decision for reconsideration. <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>149 U.S.App.D.C. 322, 463 F.2d 268, 290 (1971); <em>see </em>note 22 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Under the circumstances presented herein, it seems logical both to avail ourselves of some additional expertise before we plunge into this new and difficult area, and to allow the relevant administrative agency to attempt for itself to build a viable modern precedent for use in future cases that not only reaches the right result, but does so by way of ratemaking criteria free of the problems that appear to exist in the ICC\u2019s approach. <em>See </em>note 24 <em>supra. Cf. Permian Basin, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 790, 88 S.Ct. at 1372 (\u201cbreadth and complexity of the [agency\u2019s ratemaking] responsibilities demand that it be given every reasonable opportunity to formulate methods of regulation appropriate for the solution of its intensely practical difficulties.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">We realize that this disposition is at the expense of important finality concerns, embodied herein by intervenor Williams Pipeline Co. which has already faced six years of litigation and continues to face the possibility of reparations back to 1972 should its increased rates ultimately be found unreasonable. In subordinating those concerns to the public interest in an orderly ratemaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>environment for oil pipeline transmissions, we rely on assurances from counsel for FERC that the agency will move this case through its ratemaking procedures with dispatch. Moreover, because Williams is hereby being exposed to the possibility of future operations under an unreasonable rate, not because of its own actions freely taken in the past, but because of FERC\u2019s quasi-legislative action<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> taken \u2014 with our sanction\u2014 with an eye to the future activities of all oil pipeline carriers, we are comforted by the apparent applicability of the rule that reparations are generally not available when the subject rates were in force as a result of quasi-legislative actions of a regulatory agency.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we remand the case to FERC for determination of the reasonableness of Williams\u2019 rates pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 l(5)(a). As a result of the necessity of remanding this issue, we are also constrained not to decide the preference/prejudice issue under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 3(1). <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. This latter issue involves, <em>inter alia, </em>questions of (1) whether a disparity exists between Williams\u2019 local rates and the through rates it has jointly initiated with Explorer, (2) if so, whether petitioners are competitively damaged thereby, and (3) if so, whether cost differentials or other \u201ctransportation conditions,\u201d justify the disparity. <em>See State of New York v. United States, </em>568 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>Chicago &amp; E. Ill. R. R. v. United States, </em>384 F.Supp. 298, 300-01 (N.D.Ill.1974) (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>421 U.S. 956, 95 S.Ct. 1943, 44 L.Ed.2d 445 (1975). Since, on remand of the reasonableness issue, FERC will undoubtedly obtain additional evidence and conceivably could order that Williams lower its local rates, the nature of each of these three questions might change significantly on remand, so that any examination by us would be premature. Accordingly, FERC should also fully reconsider the section 3(1) issue.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Petitioners also challenge the joint rates filed by Explorer and Williams, claiming that they work an illegal discrimination under section 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Section 2 prohibits a carrier from granting a special rate or rebate to any shipper. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>The aim of this provision is to prevent personal favoritism from affecting rates. <em>See Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, </em>219 U.S. 467, 478, 31 S.Ct. 265, 55 L.Ed. 297 (1911); <em>Wight </em>v. <em>United States, </em>167 U.S. 512, 518, 17 S.Ct. 822, 42 L.Ed. 258 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Section 2 normally requires proof that despite a like kind of traffic moving under substantially similar circumstances, two shippers are being charged different prices. It has been accepted for at least ninety years that proof that a carrier charges shippers less for through goods than for those moving locally does not, without more, establish a violation of section 2. <em>E. g., Union Pac. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>117 U.S. 355, 6 S.Ct. 772, 29 L.Ed. 920 (1886); <em>Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>ICC, </em>162 U.S. 197, 16 S.Ct. 666, 40 L.Ed. 940 (1896). Hence, petitioners cannot rest on proof that the joint Explorer-Williams rates are lower than the combination of their local rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Beyond introducing such clearly insufficient proof, petitioners note that together the bulk of the Gulf Coast shippers served by the Explorer-Williams interconnection <em>own </em>Explorer. Petitioners attempt to turn this affiliation into a rebate by challenging the division of rates between the two intervenors. They argue that by taking less than its due, Williams has left more to Explorer and to its shipper-owners (through dividends) than is their due, and accordingly has rebated some of the rates that Williams otherwise would have collected. Petitioners support this allegation with evidence allegedly showing that under the Explorer-Williams division of the joint rates Explorer receives the same price for transporting through oil as it does for transporting local oil under its individual rates, while Williams allegedly receives 9.5 cents per barrel less for through oil transported under the joint rates than it does for local oil transported over the same route under its individual rates. Thus, it is argued, Williams bore the full brunt of the \u201cshrinkage\u201d in through rates vis-a-vis the combined local rates, instead of dividing that shrinkage equally with Explorer.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Although dicta in Supreme Court cases suggest that divisions of rates between carriers is a matter between themselves, leaving shippers without standing to challenge them before the ICC,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> there also exist precedents for the view that unequal divisions of rates in situations involving <em>shipper-owned </em>carriers can result in rebates to the controlling shippers that are illegal under section 2. <em>The Tap Line Cases, </em>234 U.S. 1, 28-29, 34 S.Ct. 741, 58 L.Ed. 1185 (1914) (dicta); <em>see Divisions Received by Brimstone R. R. &amp; Canal Co., </em>68 I.C.C. 375, 386-88 (1922), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Brimstone R. R. &amp; Canal Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 104, 48 S.Ct. 282, 72 L.Ed. 487 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Unfortunately, petitioners did not discover these latter precedents and mold them into a coherent argument until they filed their reply brief in this court. Reply Brief of Petitioners at 20-22; <em>cf. </em>Brief of Petitioners, at 44; JA at 1526-32; 3789-95; 1703-08, 1891-92. To the extent that petitioners\u2019 somewhat muddled arguments before the ICC implied that Williams\u2019 joint rates were \u201ca clear revenue drain\u201d on Williams and thus unreasonably low under section 1(5), JA at 1528, the ICC found otherwise and petitioners have not appealed that finding before us. To the extent that petitioners appeared to be arguing \u201cthat the lesser combination rate is, itself, a form of discrimination exercised by\u201d Williams, JA at 1527, they appeared merely to be repeat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ing their argument under section 3(1) that the combination rates were preferential to Gulf Coast shippers and prejudicial to themselves. Hence, while we do not necessarily agree with the administrative law judge that whether \u201cone carrier (public- or shipper-owned) is shortchanged in divisions with another carrier (public- or shipper-owned) is a matter . . . between the carriers [and one that is] foreign to the issue whether the joint rates . . . are discriminatory,\u201d we do agree that in <em>this </em>case the issue was not properly raised.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Accordingly, the ICC is affirmed on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The case is remanded to FERC for determination by it of whether Williams\u2019 rates are reasonable and whether those rates in relation to the combined Williams-Explorer rates create an illegal preference. In other respects, the decision of the ICC is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\">. The ICC did not approve this sale for the reason that, unlike its regulatory authority with respect to other common carriers such as railroads, its jurisdiction over oil pipelines does not extend to the sale or acquisition of a pipeline company. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(13); p.-of 189 U.S.App.D.C., 412 of 584 F.2d <em>infra. </em>Although petitioners do not appear to claim that the price paid was irrational, they do insist that it was subject to the inflationary trend that has recently affected the American economy. The exact relationship of the price to the \u201cfair market value,\u201d replacement cost, and reproduction cost of the Great Lakes enterprise is subject to dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-5\">. In relevant part, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 l(5)(a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"ABL\">All charges made for any service rendered or to be rendered in the transportation of property, . . or in connection therewith, shall be just and reasonable, and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such service or any part thereof is prohibited and declared to be unlawful. . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">. A valuation rate base allows the carriers to receive a return on the present \u201cfair value\u201d of all of its property devoted to public use. The Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Valuation Act, 37 Stat. 701 (1913), gives the ICC broad authority to \u201cinvestigate, ascertain, and report the value of all property owned or used by\u201d regulated carriers, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 19a(a), based, <em>inter alia, </em>on \u201cthe original cost to date [of public assets], the cost of reproduction new, the cost of reproduction less depreciation, and an analysis of the methods by which these several costs are obtained, and the reason for their differences, if any.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19a(b). It is generally accepted that in inflationary times the above formula will produce a rate base greater than one derived from \u201coriginal cost\u201d less depreciation to date of all assets committed to common carrier service, and lower than one derived from the reproduction cost (present cost of reproducing the same physical assets), the replacement cost (present cost of building a like enterprise taking advantage of modern technology), or the going concern value of the business enterprise as it might appear to an arm\u2019s-length purchaser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">. Petitioners object to Williams\u2019 inclusion of two items in the operating expenses for which it is entitled to compensation by way of rate revenues. First, Williams computed its depreciation charges by assuming that its wasting assets had a value equal to the price it paid Great Lakes in 1966 for the purchase of the pipeline, $287.6 million, plus amounts spent since 1966 in adding new physical assets to the system. Petitioners consider this depreciation base excessive both because the purchase price as of 1966 \u2014 due to inflation \u2014 is much higher than the sum of the monies actually spent over the years by Great Lakes in putting the physical assets in place, and because that depreciation base allegedly did not account for the fact that Great Lakes had already been compensated for almost $100 million worth of depreciation by way of prior rate revenues. Second, petitioners argue that payments by Williams to two affiliated companies for terminal leases and administrative services were unreasonably excessive, allegedly suggesting intracorporate extravagance that should not be charged to rate payers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b473-13\">. In figuring its tax costs, Williams used the \u201cnormalization\u201d method. Under this method, a regulated business accelerates its depreciation schedule for tax purposes, but figures its tax costs for ratemaking purposes as if it were paying the higher taxes required by a straight-line depreciation schedule. The difference between the two amounts is placed in a deferred tax reserve account, out of which the taxes are eventually paid, but on which the business in the meantime collects interest. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 167(f)(3)(G). Alternatively, Williams could have reflected its present tax savings from accelerated depreciation in lower current costs for ratemaking purposes. This latter method allows current tax savings to \u201cflow through\u201d to current ratepayers, while burdening future ratepayers with the deferred taxes when they come due. Normalization, on the other hand, allows the current benefits and future burdens to be shared more equally by current and future ratepayers. <em>See generally </em>The Second National Natural Gas Rate Cases, No. 76-2000, <em>et al., </em>slip op. at 29-39 (D.C.Cir.

Petitioners contend both that the ICC should better explain its deviation from its past insistence on the \u201cflow through\u201d method of computing costs, and that it should take measures to assure that ratepayers will benefit from the interest revenues accruing to Williams\u2019 deferred tax account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\">.

Congress passed the Valuation Act at a time when the Supreme Court appeared to require ratemaking to proceed from some type of valuation base. <em>See, e. g., Smyth v. Ames, </em>169 U.S. 466, 546-47, 18 S.Ct. 418, 42 L.Ed. 819 (1898). The exact components of \u201cfair value\u201d were still \u201cundergoing modification\u201d in the courts as of 1913, however. 49 Cong.Rec. 3796 (1913) (remarks of Sen. La Follette). In putting its gloss on the <em>Smyth </em>doctrine, the ICC wished to include original cost of physical assets as one factor relevant to valuation, but found itself stymied by the railroads\u2019 refusal to supply it with the information necessary to determine that cost. <em>Id. </em>at 3795-96. Consequently, Congress enacted the Valuation Act to give the agency the necessary information-gathering ability with respect to original cost, as well as to the more easily determined cost of reproduction new. <em>Id. </em>at 3796. The drafters, however, were decidedly not \u201cprepared ... to set the boundaries and fix the limits [of ratemak-ing] absolutely by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Their mission was merely to allow the necessary facts \u201cto be secured for the enlightenment of the Commission and the courts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Once the Supreme Court made clear its willingness to countenance any ratemaking approach that enabled investors to cover operating expenses and capital costs without burdening consumers with exorbitant rates, <em>see, e. g., FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 603, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944), even the historical link between ratemaking theory and the valuation-computation authority given ICC by the Valuation Act was broken. After that time, in fact, the apparent endorsement by the Valuation Act\u2019s drafters of significant reliance on original cost as a rate base stands as an equally strong indication that past investment rather than present value should predominate in ratemaking methodology. <em>See, e. g., </em>49 Cong.Rec. 3795 (remarks of Sen. La Follette). The important point, however, is that in passing the Valuation Act, Congress explicitly refused to endorse any ratemaking theory, and, in fact, its complete preoccupation with railroads and its understandable failure to predict the inflationary economy of a half century later make its deliberations on the Act largely irrelevant to oil pipeline ratemaking in the 1970\u2019s. Consequently, to the extent that the ICC finds a mandate for \u201cfair value\u201d ratemaking in the Valuation Act, we disagree. <em>See Wiliams I, supra, </em>351 I.C.C. at 114. <em>But see Initial Decision, supra, </em>JA at 1605-06.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\">. The ICC has explained the \u201cdearth of precedent concerning petroleum pipeline rates,\u201d <em>Williams II, supra, </em>355 I.C.C. at 481, as in part a function of the ownership of many of the pipelines by shippers. See <em>Reduced Rates I, </em>supra, 243 I.C.C. at 138-39. Thus, shippers, who generally are the complainants before the ICC in rate cases, are often responsible for, rather than affected by, potentially unreasonable oil pipeline rates. Two of the ICC\u2019s four precedents in this area, in fact, derive from nonad-versary, ICC-originated investigations. <em>Reduced Rates I, </em>supra; <em>Reduced Rates II, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Railroad rate-setting \u2014 another major source of ICC jurisdiction over rates \u2014 has also presented the agency with limited opportunity for developing post-World War II ratemaking theory, because the general decline of the rail industry has made academic the problem of unreasonably high rates of return. Nonetheless, in this proceeding, the ICC acknowledged that in those railroad ratemaking cases that have considered the issue since the early 1950\u2019s, the Commission has abandoned the valuation base, due to the difficulty of determining reproduction cost. <em>Williams I, supra, </em>351 I.C.C. at 114 \u2014 15 (discussing Increased Freight Rates, 1951, 297 I.C.C. 17, 25 (1955)). <em>See </em>Net Investment \u2014 Railroad Rate Base and Rate of Return, 345 I.C.C. 1491, 1514-20, 1604 (1976); Brief for Interstate Commerce Commission, at 13-14. Instead, railroad ratemaking has focused on original cost, present value of land and rights, and working capital needs. <em>See also </em>Increased Rates and Minimum Charges Within, From, and to the South, 335 I.C.C. 77, 97 (1969) (using original cost and rejecting valuation ratemaking for motor carriers).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\">. To the extent that the Valuation Act encouraged the ICC to use the \u201cfair value\u201d method, it, too, is a product of <em>Smyth v.

The special \u201chazards\u201d adverted to by the ICC were the pipelines\u2019 total dependence on one commodity that flows in only one direction and that must flow in consistently large quantities to be economical, the depletable nature of that commodity, and its exposure to large and unpredictable fluctuations in availability depending upon the discovery of new oil fields. <em>See Petroleum Rail Shippers, supra, </em>243 I.C.C. at 661; <em>Reduced Rates I, supra, </em>243 I.C.C. at 122-23.

In addition to the general \u201chazards\u201d of the oil pipeline industry discussed in note 12 <em>supra, </em>gasoline transmission by pipeline faced special risks of its own. Most importantly, such transmission was in its \u201cinitial stages\u201d in the 1940\u2019s \u2014adequate pipeline technology only recently having been developed \u2014 and its \u201cspeculative\u201d nature prevented financing through bond issues. <em>Petroleum Rail Shippers, supra, </em>243 I.C.C. at 599-600, 661. Although the ICC never said so explicitly, these special hazards apparently dictated its use of the 2% higher rate of return for gasoline transmission than crude oil transmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">It is noteworthy that by 1948, the ICC was no longer willing to accept the \u201cgeneral assertion that rates for pipe-line service should make allowance for the need of [higher] earnings in view of the material hazards of the business.\u201d <em>Reduced Rates II, supra, </em>272 I.C.C. at 381. Nonetheless, having made this observation, the ICC continued to utilize the 8% rate of return maximum that it developed at a time when it did accept the industry\u2019s \u201chigher risks\u201d assertion. <em>Id. </em>at 376, 384.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b477-16\">. <em>See Reduced Rates I, supra, </em>243 I.C.C. at 138-39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b477-17\">. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 139.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b477-18\">. <em>Id. </em>at 130-42.

In fact, it was FERC (in its previous incarnation as the Federal Power Commission) that, by deviating from \u201cfair value\u201d ratemaking, inspired the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that valuation is not the <em>sine qua non </em>of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d ratemaking. <em>See FPC </em>v. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 601, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944). In that case, the Commission . had used a modified original cost method in determining that the rates charged by a producer-distributor of natural gas were unreasonably high. The Fourth Circuit overturned the Commission\u2019s order in part because it felt that the rate base should reflect the valuation of the property. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>134 F.2d 287 (4th Cir. 1943). In reversing the Fourth Circuit, the Supreme Court noted that basing rates on present value, which in turn is a function of expected rate revenues, is analytically unsound. 320 U.S. at 601, 64 S.Ct. 281.

The degree to which the ICC\u2019s valuation rate base responds to inflation is a matter of doubt.

A. Lindberg &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>408 F.Supp. 1032, 1037-38 (W.D.Mich.1976); <em>Chicago &amp; E. III. R. R. Co. v. United States, supra, </em>384 F.Supp. at 301 (both cases suggesting that <em>any </em>showing of (a) actual competition between the parties subject to the rate disparity, and of (b) some effect on that competitive situation caused by the disparity, will suffice). Second, does petitioners\u2019 showing that the ratio of rates to cost for transporting local products under the local rates was much higher than that same ratio for through products under the joint rates belie the existence of \u201ctransportation conditions\u201d that justify the disparity between local and through rates? Finally, does the decision in <em>Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 627, 649-55, 53 S.Ct. 768, 77 L.Ed. 1410 (1933), protect Williams and Explorer from liability in this case because of their inability to control the other\u2019s rates? <em>Cf.

Initial Decision, supra, </em>JA at 1594; <em>see id. </em>at 1592-94; 1605. In the two Supreme Court precedents relied upon by the administrative law judge for the proposition that \u201cdivision of a joint rate is a matter of no concern to a shipper,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1592; <em>see </em>note 37 <em>supra, </em>no shipper-owned carrier was involved. In both cases, shippers challenged joint rates as unreasonable under \u00a7 1, and the division of the rates had no impact on their overall reasonableness, as the Court noted in both cases. <em>Great No. Ry. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>supra, 294 U.S. at 463, 55 S.Ct. 216; <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Sloss-Shef-field Steel &amp; Iron Co., supra, </em>269 U.S. at 234, 46 S.Ct. 73. Hence, they do not appear to disapprove of the dicta in <em>The Tap Line Cases, supra, </em>234 U.S. at 28-29, 34 S.Ct. 741, suggesting that, in a case under \u00a7 2 in which shipper ownership of a carrier is relevant to the existence of discrimination, the division of joint rates may be a matter of importance to the allegedly injured shippers. The ICC, in fact, has allowed a shipper to intervene in a division-of-rates case on precisely this theory. Divisions Received by Brimstone R. R. &amp; Canal Co., 68 I.C.C. 375, 376 (1922), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Brimstone R. R. &amp; Canal Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 104, 48 S.Ct. 282, 72 L.Ed. 487 (1928). <em>See id. </em>at 386, <em>citing The Tap Line Cases, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">In reviewing the ICC\u2019s <em>Brimstone </em>decision, however, the Supreme Court did conclude that the ICC had no authority to order the retrospective redivision of joint rates; the Commission\u2019s authority with respect to rate divisions, derived from 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(6)(a), <em>as amended, </em>Pub.L. 94-210, \u00a7 201, 90 Stat. 34 (1976), is entirely prospective. <em>Brimstone R. R. Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 104, 121-23, 48 S.Ct. 282, 72 L.Ed. 487 (1928); <em>see Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. v. Alabama Great So. R. R. Co., </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 506 F.2d 1265, 1268-69 (1974). Consequently, by affirming the Commission on the ground that petitioners failed properly to raise this issue before the ICC, we have not foreclosed them from raising it again before the ICC\u2019s successor (FERC) and from receiving precisely the prospective redress to which they would potentially be entitled were we instead to remand. Williams, of course, would be free at that time to interpose the defense that whatever special treatment was accorded Explorer\u2019s owners was required by the need to meet competition from Explorer and other carriers. See, e. <em>g., McGraw Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>120 F.Supp. 354, 361-62 (E.D.Mo.) (three-judge court), <em>affd mem., </em>348 U.S. 804, 75 S.Ct. 45, 99 L.Ed. 635 (1954); JA at 1888, 2574.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
