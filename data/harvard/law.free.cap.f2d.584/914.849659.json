We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">On November 9, 1977, the Federal Aviation Act was amended by adding a new section 418 (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388), empowering the Board to issue operating certificates, to conduct \u201call-cargo air service\u201d between the fifty states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. This legislation provided, among other things, for the issuance, within sixty days after application, of \u201cGrandfather\u201d Certificates to citizens who had been operating <em>scheduled </em>all-cargo service.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Petitioner is an <em>air freight forwarder, </em>doing business pursuant to authority granted by the Civil Aeronautics Board under Part 296 of the Board\u2019s Economic Regulations, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 296. An \u201cair freight forwarder\u201d is defined to mean an indirect air carrier as defined in \u00a7 296.1(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Petitioner applied for a Grandfather\u2019s Certificate authorizing it to begin providing all-cargo air service under the provisions of \u00a7 1388(a)(2). The Board concluded that the Grandfather Certificates could be issued only to direct <em>air carriers </em>currently providing scheduled all-cargo service and that the Congress did not intend Grandfather Certificates should be issued to air freight forwarders, which are <em>indirect air carriers </em>engaged in the business of consolidating and shipping property to be loaded and transported on direct <em>air carriers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">REGULATORY AND STATUTORY POSTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">For in excess of forty years, <em>air carriers </em>have been subject to precise economic regulation by the Board under the Federal Aviation Act and its predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. An \u201cair carrier\u201d is defined by the statute, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(3) as \u201cAny citizen of the United States who undertakes, whether directly or indirectly, or by lease or any other arrangement, to engage in air transportation: . . . \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">The Board has consistently recognized two distinct kinds of air carriers \u2014 direct and indirect. <em>Monarch Travel Services, Inc. v. Associated Cultural Clubs, Inc., </em>466 F.2d 552 (CA9 1972); <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, </em>2 C.A.B. 531 (1941); <em>Air Freight Forwarder Case, </em>9 C.A.B. 473 (1948), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. American Airlines v. C. A. B., </em>178 F.2d 903 (CA7 1949), and <em>Consolidated Flower Shipments, Inc. </em>\u2014 Bay <em>Area v. C. A. B., </em>213 F.2d 814 (CA9 1954). Simply stated, these cases hold that direct air carriers are those who operate aircraft, while indirect air carriers hold out a transportation service to the public under which they utilize the services of a direct carrier for the actual transportation by air; i. e. those persons who procure shipments from shippers, assemble them, and tender the consolidated lot gathered from the various shippers to a direct air carrier for transportation at a bulk rate which is lower than the rates collected by the forwarders from the shippers. Although they carry no merchandise themselves, the forwarders assume the responsibility of a carrier, but ship by air in direct carrier\u2019s planes. Upon arrival of the shipment at the airport of destination, the forwarder divides the bulk shipment and distributes the separate portions to the individual consignees. <em>See American Airlines v. C. A. B., supra, </em>at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">A fundamental regulatory provision of the Act is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371(a). It provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>that no one may operate as an air carrier without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Board. However, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(3) empowers the Board to relieve air carriers not directly engaged in the operation of aircraft from the regulatory provisions of the Act. It was under the authority of this provision and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386(a) that the Board proceeded to establish just and reasonable classifications of groups of air carriers for purposes of the Act. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 296 was promulgated to implement the provisions of this legislation. \u00a7 296.2 established a class of \u201cindirect air carriers\u201d which included \u201cair freight forwarders.\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 296.-11 provides, among other things, that <em>\u201cair freight forwarders and international air forwarders </em>are hereby relieved from all\u201d of the Act\u2019s economic regulatory provisions (with stated exceptions not here applicable). 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 296 for all intents and purposes gave an absolute freedom of entry into air transportation to those who were in the freight forwarding business under the regulation. <em>Air Freight Forwarder case, supra, </em>at 499-500; <em>ABC Air Freight Co. v. C. A. B., </em>391 F.2d 295, 301 (CA2 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Not to be overlooked is the fact that Congress granted exemption authority to the Board under \u00a7 1386(b), as well as the classification power granted under \u00a7 1386(a). 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 298, which was promulgated pursuant to this authority, deals with classifications and exemptions of \u201cair taxi operators.\u201d \u00a7 298.3 creates \u201ca classification of air carriers, designated as \u2018air taxi operators\u2019 which <em>directly </em>engage in the air transportation of persons or property . . and which ... do not . . . utilize large aircraft . . . .\u201d Included in the \u201cair taxi\u201d classification are \u201ccommute:.air carriers\u201d defined as taxi operators performing at least five flights per week between two or more points pursuant to published schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">THE 1977 AMENDMENT, FEDERAL AVIATION ACT, \u00a7 418; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388(a)(1), (2) AND (b)(1)(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">The 1977 amendment, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388(a)(1) and (2) added two grandfather provisions to the existing legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">\u00a7 1388(a)(1) provides that holders of a certificate of necessity issued under \u00a7 1371(d)(1) who provided scheduled all-cargo service between January 1st and November 9, 1977 [the date of enactment] may, within 45 days of enactment, apply for a certificate to provide all-cargo service.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">Another grandfather provision is contained in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388(a)(2). It is this provision which appellant believes supports its position. The provision permits, within 45 days of enactment, an application for an all-cargo certificate by a U.S. citizen \u201c[which] operates pursuant to an exemption granted by the Board under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386,\u201d and which \u201cprovided scheduled all-cargo service continuously . . . during the twelve-month period ending on November 9, 1977.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388(b)(1)(A) the Board is directed to issue a Grandfather\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Certificate not later than sixty days after submission of the application under either \u00a7 1388(a)(1) or (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">At the outset, we observe that the petitioner holds no certificate under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371 [Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act]. Thus, the first of the two Grandfather Clauses previously mentioned has no application whatsoever. If petitioner is entitled to a certificate, it must fall within the language of the second provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">To obtain a certificate under the second Grandfather Clause, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388(a)(2), an applicant must meet two requirements: (1) the applicant is required to operate pursuant to an exemption granted by the Board under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386(b); and (2) the all-cargo service it afforded during the twelve months before enactment of the 1977 amendment, must have been <em>scheduled. </em>We hold that petitioner fails to meet either requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The Board concedes that DHL operates under an exemption granted to freight forwarders under 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 296.11 of the Board\u2019s Economic Regulations, but forcefully argues that such exemption was not granted pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386, the original classification and exemption statute. The parties agree that a statutory source of 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 296.11 and its predecessors is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(3), which provides, among other things, that the Board may by order relieve air carriers who are not directly engaged in the operation of aircraft in air transportation from the provisions of the Act, including the Act\u2019s certificate of necessity requirement. The authorities support this view. <em>Air Freight Forwarder case, supra, </em>9 C.A.B. at 499, 512; <em>ABC Air Freight Co. v. C. A. B., supra, </em>391 F.2d at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">The Board has never made findings in favor of air freight forwarders as required for a \u00a7 1386(b) exemption. (See Appendix A). For that matter, under part 296 C.F.R. the Board cites as its authority for the regulations: \u00a7\u00a7 101(3), 204(a) and 416(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended [49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301(3), 1324(a), and 1386(a)]. Of significance is the fact that the Board in promulgating the regulations specifically mentioned 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386(a), the classification section, and made no mention whatsoever of subdivision (b), the exemption section upon which the petitioner relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">We must assume that the Congress, when speaking in 1977 of the \u00a7 1386(b) exemption, was aware of the decision in <em>Hughes Air Corp. v. C. A. B., </em>160 U.S.App.D.C. 301, 492 F.2d 567 (1973), where the court in passing on the Board\u2019s regulations said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF5\"><em>\u201cIn order to exempt a class of carriers from any of the regulatory requirements deriving from the Federal Aviation Act, the Board must find that enforcement would be (1) \u2018an undue burden\u2019 on the class to be exempted because of the \u2018limited extent\u2019 of the class\u2019s operations, or because of \u2018unusual circumstances\u2019 affecting its operations, and (2) not in the \u2018public interest.\u2019 </em>Since exemption cannot be in the public interest unless the end that it is calculated to achieve is in the public interest, and we have already set forth the Board\u2019s purpose in exempting larger air taxi operations than heretofore, we begin with an examination of this finding.\u201d 160 U.S.App.D.C. at 305, 492 F.2d at 571. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">As previously stated, no such exemption has ever been declared in favor of air freight forwarders and none of the required findings have been made in favor of this classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">The fact that the order of dismissal on this appeal states that \u201cboth air taxis and air freight forwarders operate under \u00a7 416 exemption authority\u201d does not demonstrate that the Board in this case was of the belief that the petitioner was covered by that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>section. To the extent that the Board\u2019s statement or finding goes beyond a reference to the \u00a7 416(a) classification power, it is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The Board\u2019s conclusions in <em>Hughes Air Corp., supra, </em>provides sufficient findings to allow air taxi operators a \u00a7 1386(b) exemption. Significantly, there is no claim by petitioner that it was actually operating under a 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386(b) exemption certificate or that the Board ever held a hearing or made findings in its favor as required by the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Moreover, the language in \u00a7 296.11 states that air freight forwarders \u201care hereby relieved\u201d from the provisions of this Act. \u00a7 1301(3), the statutory authority for \u00a7 296, uses the phrase \u201cmay by order relieve.\u201d \u00a7 298.11, the exemption section for air taxi operators, uses the language \u201care exempt\u201d which coincides with the phrase in \u00a7 1386(b), \u201cmay exempt.\u201d This provides a strong indication that the exemption granted petitioner by \u00a7 296.11 was pursuant to the authority of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(3), not \u00a7 1386(b) upon which petitioner relies. For these reasons, petitioner fails to meet the first requirement of \u00a7 1388(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">The second eligibility requirement for a Grandfather Certificate is that the applicant shall have been engaged in <em>scheduled all-cargo service. </em>While petitioner devotes almost all of its efforts to establishing that it was engaged in all-cargo service throughout the Grandfather period, it bypasses the statute\u2019s requirement that the service shall have been \u201cscheduled.\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 298.-2(u) defines \u201cscheduled service\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQKM\">\u201c(u) . . . <em>[Transport service operated over routes pursuant to published flight schedules, </em>or pursuant to mail contracts with the U.S. Postal Service.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Air freight forwarders do not provide any such service. For that matter, it would seem that as consolidators of shipments, it would be practically impossible to provide such a schedule. We conclude that \u201cscheduled\u201d all-cargo service means what it says. That is, a service performed pursuant to a published list of regular departure or arrival times. There is nothing in petitioner\u2019s application, in its motion, or in its argument which suggests that it provides or publishes \u201cscheduled\u201d all-cargo service.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">The legislative history of the \u00a7 1388 amendments clearly supports the interpretation placed thereon by the Board. We quote from Senator Cannon\u2019s comments on the floor of the Senate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-12\">\u201cThe amendment will permit U.S. all-cargo carriers such as Flying Tiger Line, Federal Express, Seaboard World, Airlift International, and other small air taxi firms to obtain, within 45 days, certificates to operate all-cargo services to any point within the United States. . . \u201d 123 Cong.Rec. S. 17534 (daily ed. Oct. 20, 1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">Of significance is the fact that no mention whatsoever is made of air freight forwarders in the Senator\u2019s remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">Fully supporting Senator Cannon\u2019s comments are those of Representative Anderson.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-16\">\u201c . . . the Board would be required to issue all-cargo certificates to applicants who have operated all-cargo service as a <em>certificated scheduled airline. </em>This includes carriers holding scheduled all-cargo certificates \u2014 such as Flying Tiger\u2014 and carriers holding certificates authorizing scheduled passenger and cargo service \u2014 such as American and United \u2014 but only if these carriers operated service with all-cargo aircraft from January 1, 1977, through date of enactment. Certificates would also be issued to <em>commuter airlines </em>who have provided <em>scheduled all-cargo service </em>during the 12-months prior to the enactment.\u201d 123 Cong.Rec. H. 12044 (daily ed. Nov. 2, 1977). [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-18\">Again, there is nothing in the Congressman\u2019s remarks which would even remotely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>suggest that air freight forwarders would be covered by the Grandfather Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Additionally, Representative AuCoin intimated that Grandfather Certificates were to be issued only to <em>direct air carriers </em>by saying: \u201c . . . supplemental airlines\u2014 are excluded from the Grandfather provision provided for scheduled and commuter airlines.\u201d 123 Cong.Rec. H. 12049 (daily ed. Nov. 2, 1977). That the Board in its interpretation and construction of the legislation was faithful to the legislative intent is fully borne out by the conference report of both Houses, which specifically refers to the Grandfather Clauses. We quote therefrom:</p>\n<p id=\"akz-dedup-0\">\u201cA new section 418 is added to the Act establishing certificates for all-cargo air service. One hundred five days after the date of the enactment of the new section the Board is required to award all-cargo certificates <em>to any air carrier who holds a certificate under section 401(d)(1) of the Act </em>and has provided <em>scheduled interstate all-cargo air service at any time between January 1, 1977 and the date of enactment. </em>During the same time period, the Board is also required to award certificates for all-cargo air service to <em>commuter air carriers </em>who have provided <em>scheduled all-cargo air service </em>continuously during the 12-month period preceding the date of enactment.\u201d [H.Conf.Rep. No. 95-773, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 13, Reprinted in [1977] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 3396, 3399.] [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In passing, we observe the significant emphasis placed on the phrases \u201cscheduled airline,\u201d \u201cscheduled all-cargo service,\u201d \u201cscheduled interstate all-cargo air service,\u201d and \u201cscheduled all-cargo air service,\u201d by the congressional sponsors of the legislation and in the conference report of both Houses. The identical phraseology used by the sponsors is incorporated in the legislation. For us to ignore this congressional declaration of intent would be nothing short of judicial arrogance.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">The legislative history is crystal clear. The Grandfather Clauses were intended for certified air carriers and air taxis including commuter air carriers, with scheduled air service, all of whom are by definition direct carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">PETITIONER\u2019S CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">Petitioner argues that the construction placed on the legislation by the Board is inconsistent with the congressional purpose in providing a truly competitive all-cargo business. However, the record makes it rather clear that the <em>immediate </em>concern of Congress was protecting existing direct carriers. No doubt, it was the intention of Congress to create a fully competitive all-cargo business, but only after November, 1978. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388(a)(4), as amended March 14, 1978, U.S.C.A., June, 1978, Supp. 1, which would permit the petitioner to apply for a certificate at any time after November 9,1978. The purpose of delaying an immediate total deregulation is explained by Representative Anderson in his comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">\u201cThe deregulation of all-cargo transportation would be phased to give existing operators, who have invested in reliance upon the existing system, an opportunity to adjust their fares and marketing approach to an unregulated system.\u201d 123 Cong.Rec. H. 12044 (daily ed. Nov. 2, 1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-13\"><em>Patagonia Corp. v. Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System, </em>517 F.2d 803 (CA9 1975), upon which petitioner relies, does not support its position. Petitioner argues that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the legislation and reliance upon its legislative history violate the <em>Patagonia </em>principles of statutory construction. We disagree. <em>Patagonia </em>recognizes that the courts must accord great weight to the interpretation given a statute by an agency charged with the statute\u2019s administration, particularly when the statute is <em>relatively new </em>and the agency\u2019s officers played an important role in the statute\u2019s drafting and consideration. It is only when there are compelling indications that the administrative interpretation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>wrong that the courts do not defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. In <em>Patagonia, </em>the court found that the language of the statute itself provided a compelling indication that the Board\u2019s position was mistaken and that its view found no support in the pertinent legislative history. <em>Patagonia </em>at 812. Here, as we have shown, the precise opposite is true. The Board\u2019s position is fully supported by the statutory language and legislative history of \u00a7 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Petitioner would have us believe that the phrases \u201call-cargo air service\u201d and \u201cinterstate air transportation\u201d are identical. Although the latter includes the former, it also includes all other methods of interstate carriage, such as passenger and combined passenger-property service and charter cargo service. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(21). To follow petitioner\u2019s reasoning, we would be compelled to hold that all persons engaged in \u201cinterstate air transportation\u201d of property \u2014 direct or indirect, scheduled or unscheduled, would be entitled to a Grandfather\u2019s Certificate. This construction would lead to an \u201cabsurd result.\u201d In making this type of an argument, petitioner entirely overlooks the fact that the purpose of a Grandfather Clause in a licensing statute is to permit the continuation in the same or expanded form of operations <em>already in existence. </em>Consequently, petitioner does not qualify. A similar contention was advanced in <em>Railway Express Agency, supra, </em>at 531, in support of a Grandfather application under the original Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. There the statute provided for the issuance of certificates to those who had been operating as \u201cair carriers.\u201d Railway Express Agency, an indirect air carrier, applied for a Grandfather\u2019s Certificate, but the Board denied the application finding that Congress did not intend to make indirect air carriers eligible for Grandfather Certificates even though they were, by statutory definition, air carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Other authorities and contentions of the petitioner have received our attention. We find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Petitioner\u2019s petition must be denied and the judgment of the Board affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386. <em>Classification and exemption of carriers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">\u201c(b)(1) The Board, from time to time and to the extent necessary, may (except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection) exempt from the requirements of this sub-chapter or any provision thereof, or any rule, regulation, term, condition, or limitation prescribed thereunder, any air carrier or class of air carriers, if it finds that the enforcement of this subchapter or such provision, or such rule, regulation, term, condition, or limitation is or would be an undue burden on such air carrier or class of air carriers by reason of the limited extent of, or unusual circumstances affecting, the operations of such air carrier or class of air carriers and is not in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">NIELSEN, District Judge, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">I believe the order should be reversed and the Board directed to issue the requested certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Board properly construed 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388. It is my conclusion that the Board\u2019s reliance on legislative history to alter the plain language of the state was wholly unwarranted and resulted in an unjustified re-writing of the section.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-12\">. \u201c(e) \u2018Indirect air carrier\u2019 means any citizen of the United States, who undertakes indirectly to engage in air transportation of property only, and who</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">(1) does not engage directly in the operation of aircraft in air transportation, and</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">(2) does not engage in air transportation pursuant to any Board order which has been issued for the purpose of authorizing air express service under a contract with a direct air carrier.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b977-19\">. \u201cAir transportation\u201d means the carriage by aircraft of persons or property as a common carrier, in interstate or foreign commerce. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(10) and (21).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b978-5\">. \u201c49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388. <em>Certificate for all-cargo air service Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">(a)(1) Any citizen of the United States who has a valid certificate issued under section 1371(d)(1) of this title and who provided scheduled all-cargo air service at any time during the period from January 1, 1977, through November 9, 1977, may, during the forty-five-day period which begins on November 9, 1977, submit an application to the Board for a certificate under this section to provide all-cargo air service.
