He was sentenced to serve two years imprisonment, three years special parole, and to pay a $5,000 fine. The principal issues raised on this appeal are the legality of a search of his safe deposit box containing cocaine and other incriminating evidence, the alleged exclusion of evidence bearing on his awareness of the presence of the cocaine in his box, and the trial judge\u2019s instructions on the subject of knowledge, willfulness and intent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-22\">On October 21, 1977, upon the application of Agent John E. Daniocek of the Drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), U. S. Magistrate Kent Sinclair of the Southern District of New York issued a search warrant authorizing the Government to search Dunloy\u2019s safe deposit box at a branch of the Citibank at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, New York City,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to seize \u201ca quantity of cocaine, and additionally, all narcotic drug controlled substances, documents, records and other evidence of distribution and possession with intent to distribute narcotic drug controlled substances.\u201d The warrant was issued on the basis of the following statement in Daniocek\u2019s supporting affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">\u201cThe sources of your deponent\u2019s information and the grounds for his belief are information received from Special Agent Lyons of the Drug Enforcement Administration stationed in La Paz, Bolivia and received via teletype on October 20, 1977 including the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201c(1) On October 18, 1977, officials in Bolivia arrested the following three persons who were then in possession of 1900 grams of cocaine; Ian Bruce Dundas (\u2018Dundas\u2019), a Canadian citizen with Canadian Passport # B0479456; Eugene Thomas Friedell, an American citizen with United States Passport # G197584; and Luis Alfredo Palomino Davila, a Peruvian citizen with Peruvian Passport # 5000885.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201c(2) After his arrest, Dundas was interviewed by Special Agent Lyons and stated that he had purchased cocaine in Bolivia on previous occasions and delivered the said cocaine to James D. Dunloy (\u2018Dunloy\u2019), 120 West 28th Street, Apartment 3B, New York, New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201c(3) On October 21, 1977, your deponent was advised by the superintendent of the building located at 120 West 28th Street, New York, that James D. Dunloy is a resident of Apartment 3B in that building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">\u201c(4) Dundas further stated that on these previous occasions, the method of operation utilized was to purchase round trip tickets from New York to Curacao to New York, and separate round trip tickets from Curacao to Bolivia to Curacao, all of which tickets were provided by Dunloy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">\u201c(5) Upon information and belief, no passports are required for entry to Curacao from the United States of America or re-entry to the United States of America from Curacao.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">\u201c(6) Dundas further stated that he had purchased cocaine in Bolivia on these previous occasions which he would take back to Curacao where the Curacao-Bolivia-Curacao tickets would be destroyed and his passport mailed home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">\u201c(7) Dundas further stated that on these previous occasions the cocaine purchased in Bolivia was brought back into the United States concealed in a rubber raft and/or in oxygen tanks of the type utilized for scuba diving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-14\">\u201c(8) Dundas further stated that Dun-loy keeps some of the cocaine which Dun-das has delivered to him in a safety deposit box at the branch of the Chemical Bank located at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, New York, New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-15\">\u201c(9) Dundas stated that on one prior occasion, he saw approximately one kilogram of cocaine in the said safety deposit box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-16\">\u201c(10) On October 21, 1977, your deponent was advised by Mr. Casey, Assistant Manager of the said Chemical Bank that Dunloy had no safety deposit box at that bank; and your deponent was advised by Mr. Buckley, Assistant Manager of Citibank, located at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, directly across the street from the said Chemical Bank, that Dunloy has a safety deposit box there which he has retained since October 31, 1975.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-17\">Upon executing the warrant on October 24, 1977, at the Citibank Branch at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, Agent Daniocek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>seized the contents of the safe deposit box, which consisted of a brown paper bag containing approximately V2 kilogram of 81% pure cocaine, $26,763 in cash, two white boxes containing gold coins worth $17,205, a passport, two bank books, and various papers, including Dunloy\u2019s birth certificate, evidence that he had changed his name from James Dennis Dunloy to Zaran Dun-loy and bank notices evidencing purchase of securities worth $95,000. Dunloy\u2019s apartment was located a short distance from the bank. On October 26,1977, after a warrant had been issued for his arrest, he surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In a written opinion dated March 15, 1978, Judge Motley denied Dunloy\u2019s motion to suppress the seized items, which had been based principally on the claim that the supporting affidavit was insufficient because of the alleged unreliability, staleness, inadequacy and inaccuracy of the information furnished by Ian Bruce Dundas, the informant. Judge Motley found the evidence of Dundas\u2019 reliability to be sufficient, and the information furnished to be sufficiently detailed and corroborated, to credit his statement. She also concluded that his mistake in misnaming the bank was immaterial and that since Dundas described an on-going narcotics operation the information was sufficiently current to provide reasonable grounds for belief that there still was cocaine in Dunloy\u2019s safe deposit box on October 21,1977, which turned out to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">At trial the Government introduced the cocaine and other items found in the safe deposit box, including the large amount of cash, the other evidence of substantial wealth, and Dunloy\u2019s passport, which showed recent foreign travel, principally to Latin America. In addition it was established that Dunloy had visited the box once or twice a week prior to the execution of the search warrant and, upon finding it had been opened, stated that he was \u201cin trouble\u201d and fled the bank, despite a request by the manager to remain. Upon being interrogated after arrest he admitted that he had earned $5,000 in 1976 and virtually nothing in 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Dunloy\u2019s defense was that he had been victimized by his close friend Dundas. Dunloy and his wife testified that upon Dundas\u2019 asking him to keep in his safe deposit box a paper bag containing valuables or stock certificates while Dundas was away on a trip, Dunloy and Dundas went to the bank where Dundas placed the bag in the box without Dunloy\u2019s ever touching it or seeing its contents. Dunloy further stated that, except for a $5,000 modelling fee belonging to his wife, the cash in the box was derived from his gem business, that his frequent visits to the box were occasioned by the same business, since he kept his gem inventory in the box when he was not showing the gems, and that an Iranian friend owned the $95,000 of securities purchased through the Royal Bank of Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">In rebuttal to Dunloy\u2019s testimony that he never touched the paper bag containing cocaine or saw its contents, Agent Daniocek testified that a bag containing $20,000 in U. S. currency (two plastic sealed packages of new $100 bills, each bound with a Federal Reserve Bank $10,000 wrapper) was stuffed in the rear of the box behind the cocaine bag. In order to put in or get to the cash supposedly connected with Dunloy\u2019s gem business, he would therefore have been required first to remove the bag containing the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Appellant first contends that the district court erred in not suppressing the evidence seized from his safe deposit box on the grounds that the affidavit in support of the search warrant, being based entirely on the hearsay statements of Dundas, was inadequate to establish probable cause for the search. Specifically, Dunloy attacks the affidavit for failure to furnish sufficient evidence of Dundas\u2019 reliability as an informant, <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 416, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), and failure to meet the standards established by <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 114-15, 84 S.Ct. 1509,12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), because it did not furnish sufficiently de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tailed circumstances to provide a basis for believing Dundas\u2019 assertion that the cocaine and other incriminating evidence would be found in the box at the time it was searched. We find both arguments to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Since Dundas was not a paid informant but an admitted \u201cparticipant in the very crime at issue,\u201d the Government was not required \u201cto show past reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Rueda, </em>549 F.2d 865, 869 (2d Cir. 1977). See also <em>United States v. Miley, </em>513 F.2d 1191, 1204 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>423 U.S. 842, 96 S.Ct. 74, 46 L.Ed.2d 62 (1975); <em>United States v. Rollins, </em>522 F.2d 160, 164 (2d Cir. 1975), <em>cert, denied, </em>424 U.S. 918, 96 S.Ct. 1122, 47 L.Ed.2d 324 (1976). His participation as an accomplice satisfied the reliability standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the facts and circumstances furnished by Dundas and set forth in Daniocek\u2019s affidavit were sufficiently detailed and corroborated to establish probable cause to believe that Dundas was telling the truth and that an ongoing criminal enterprise involving smuggling and sale of narcotics, in which the safe deposit box was used for storage of cocaine, was in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Dundas furnished, on the basis of his own personal observation, clear and specific details of the operation, including Dunloy\u2019s address, the location of the bank and safe deposit box, and the fact that Dunloy was then keeping cocaine in the box. Daniocek, moreover, personally corroborated the accuracy of some of the information received from Dundas by verifying Dunloy\u2019s address, the location of the bank, and the existence of the safe deposit box in Dunloy\u2019s name. Construing the affidavit as a whole and in a common sense fashion, as we are required to do, <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965), the information, far from being stale, appeared to be current. Such corroborated, current, detailed information furnished sufficient grounds for Magistrate Sinclair reasonably to believe that there was cocaine in Dunloy\u2019s safe deposit box at the time when he issued the search warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Mapp v. Warden, </em>531 F.2d 1167, 1171-72 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Rollins, supra, </em>522 F.2d at 165; <em>United States v. Canestri, </em>518 F.2d 269, 272 (2d Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">For these reasons we hold that the search warrant was validly issued upon the basis of an adequate showing of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Dunloy next contends, for the first time on this appeal, that both the language of the warrant and the scope of the search made in executing it violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that warrants particularly describe the persons or things to be searched. The failure to assert this ground below operated as a waiver. Rule 12(f), F.R.Cr.P., <em>United States v. Rollins, supra, </em>522 F.2d at 165. However, even assuming the district court would for good cause have relieved Dunloy from the effects of the waiver, the warrant, when viewed against the totality of the background facts, including the inability under the circumstances to provide a more precise description of the criminal instrumentalities that would be found in the box, was not impermissibly broad. Similar language has been upheld under comparable circumstances. See, e. g., <em>Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 479-82, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976); <em>United States v. Scharfman, </em>448 F.2d 1352, 1355 (2d Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 919, 92 S.Ct. 944, 30 L.Ed.2d 789 (1972). In this case the breath of the warrant\u2019s language was tempered by the extremely confined area authorized to be searched \u2014 one safe deposit box. The warrant was no blank check permitting agents to roam throughout an en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tire house, or even a room, but a narrowly restricted permit which did specify some contraband items that were to be seized (e. g., the cocaine) and led to the seizure of others in plain view, such as the currency, coins, passport and confirmation slips, which was permissible, <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 300-10, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1966); <em>United States v. Rollins, supra, </em>552 F.2d at 166. In any event, since any documents that may have been improperly seized were not introduced into evidence, Dunloy was not prejudiced.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Dunloy next contends that he was denied a fair trial when the trial judge refused to permit him to explore fully what Dundas had told him regarding the contents of the bag eventually found to contain cocaine. Dunloy proposed to testify that before storing the package in Dunloy\u2019s box, Dundas had advised him that Dundas was going on a trip and had \u201csome valuables he wanted to put in for safekeeping while on the trip.\u201d Anticipating an objection based on the ground that this evidence was hearsay, Dunloy\u2019s counsel argued that this testimony was admissible not to prove the truth of Dundas\u2019 statement but to show Dunloy\u2019s state of mind, but then confusingly cited as authority F.R.Evid. 803(1), (2) and (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Motley initially ruled that the statement would be admitted to the extent that Dundas came to appellant\u2019s house and asked him to keep the package of valuables for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Dunloy then testified that Dundas came to his house, asked him \u201cto hold a package of valuables,\u201d which they then deposited in Dunloy\u2019s box, without Dunloy ever touching the package or seeing the contents, and that Dundas told him \u201cit was valuable documents . . . stock certificates and things like that.\u201d An objection to this characterization by Dundas of the contents was not ruled upon by the court except to the extent that in reviewing the testimony with the witness in the jury\u2019s presence the judge did not refer to the contents. In later testimony Dunloy again emphasized that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know there was cocaine in that envelope. My friend told me there were only valuables in it\u201d and that Dundas had \u201csaid it was stocks\u201d in the package. In summation Dunloy\u2019s counsel referred to the foregoing testimony in arguing that Dunloy was unaware of the contents of the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">Although Dunloy\u2019s testimony as to what he had been told by Dundas regarding the contents of the package was inadmissible to prove the truth of the statement itself, since for that purpose it was hearsay, the testimony was clearly admissible to prove that the statement had been made, which was relevant to the material issue of whether Dunloy believed that the package contained valuables or securities rather than narcotics. To the extent that the trial judge indicated at one point that Dunloy would be limited to testifying that Dundas \u201cleft a package with him and asked him to keep it for him while he went on a trip,\u201d this ruling out of the jury\u2019s presence, had it been adhered to by the court after the jury returned, would have been unduly restrictive, since Dunloy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>entitled to recount any details tending to flesh out the basis for a belief on his part that the package did not contain contraband. The court\u2019s ruling, however, must be viewed in the context of Dunloy\u2019s subsequent testimony, which repeatedly described his understanding from Dundas as to the nature of the contents of the bag, without any instruction by the court that the testimony was to be disregarded. The jury, therefore, was adequately informed of the Dundas statement claimed to have been relied upon by Dunloy, and his counsel has failed to point to any material testimony that was excluded. Any error in the trial judge\u2019s initial ruling out of the jury\u2019s presence was therefore cured or rendered harmless by the admission into evidence, albeit in a confused fashion, of the essential testimony relied on by appellant. The jury\u2019s guilty verdict makes it clear that, in view of the extremely incriminating other evidence against Dunloy, including Agent Daniocek\u2019s testimony that Dunloy would have had to move the bag of cocaine in order to get at the $20,000 of currency in another bag, the jury simply did not credit Dunloy\u2019s testimony regarding Dundas\u2019 statement about the contents of the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Appellant\u2019s final claim of error \u2014 that Judge Motley\u2019s instruction explaining to the jury that knowledge, willfulness and intent might be proved by circumstantial evidence diluted the constitutional requirement that these elements be proved beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 borders on the frivolous. Aside from the fact that this contention was waived by failure to object to it at trial, the challenged instructions, when read in context, as we are required to do, <em>United States v. Gentile, </em>530 F.2d 461, 469 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 936, 96 S.Ct. 2651, 49 L.Ed.2d 388 (1976), make it clear that the Government assumed the burden of proving these elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\">. Although the bank was described by Dundas as a branch of the Chemical Bank at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, it turned out to be a branch of Citibank across the street at the same intersection, where appellant maintained a safe deposit box.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">. Under the federal rule an accomplice\u2019s uncorroborated testimony, although subject to strict and careful scrutiny, may nevertheless be sufficient alone to support a conviction. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>426 F.2d 1069, 1071 (2d Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>400 U.S. 843, 91 S.Ct. 86, 27 L.Ed.2d 78 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">. In addition, of course, the determination of U. S. Magistrate Kent Sinclair was entitled to weight. <em>Mapp v. Warden, supra, </em>531 F.2d at 1172; <em>United States v. Londono, </em>553 F.2d 805, 810 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">. Personal papers having no relevance to issues before the court were not introduced. In any event the remedy with respect to any items exceeding the scope of the warrant would not have been invalidation of the search but suppression of those items. <em>Andresen v.
