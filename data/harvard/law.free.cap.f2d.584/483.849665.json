BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\"><em>Black Book </em>is \u201ca small, weekly booklet containing listings of wholesale auction prices for cars and trucks in various states.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It had been entered into the second-class mails since November 9, 1967.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By letter dated June 25, 1973, from the then-Manager of the Mail Classification Division <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (at present, the Director of the Office of Mail Classification), USPS, appellant was informed that its second-class entry was to be annulled because <em>Black Book </em>was not a \u201cperiodical publication.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Appellant contested the proposed action, and an evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) followed. The ALJ believed that, although <em>Black Book </em>was not a \u201cperiodical,\u201d it was a \u201cnewspaper,\u201d and thus was entitled to retain its second-class status.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Director appealed to the judicial officer of USPS, who agreed that <em>Black Book </em>was not a \u201cperiodical,\u201d but disagreed with, and reversed, the ALJ on the \u201cnewspaper\u201d issue on the ground that it was not properly before the ALJ.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant moved for reconsideration, but the judicial officer reaffirmed the Postal Service Decision, now ruling explicitly that <em>Black Book </em>was not a \u201cnewspaper.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Appellant filed suit in the district court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted that of USPS and denied that of appellant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">II. RESOLUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">The ALJ, the judicial officer, and the district court based their opinions on the belief that <em>Houghton v. Payne, </em>194 U.S. 88, 24 S.Ct. 590, 48 L.Ed. 888 (1904), required \u201ca variety of original articles.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>reasons set forth in <em>Standard Rate &amp; Data Service, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, </em>189 U.S.App.D.C. -, 584 F.2d 473 (1978), argued orally at the same time as the instant case and decided today, we believe that this was erroneous. We therefore remand with instructions to remand to the Postal Service for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-12\">. Appendix (App.) at 31-38. The Memorandum &amp; Order granting the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying that of appellant is dated December 20, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-13\">. <em>Id. </em>at 31 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-14\">. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-15\">. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 31; <em>see </em>Brief and Appendix for Appellees at 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-16\">.

See note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b546-23\">. The administrative law judge (ALJ) believed that <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>194 U.S. 88, 24 S.Ct. 590, 48 L.Ed. 888 (1904), established a rule that \u201ca periodical publication other than a newspaper . . . means either a magazine containing a variety of original articles by different authors devoted either to some special branch of learning or to a special class of subjects or a so-called \u2018non-descript\u2019 publication.\u201d App. at 118. He went on to note that appellant\u2019s publication \u201cdoes not contain articles of any kind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He rejected explicitly a narrow reading of <em>Houghton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-25\">The judicial officer reinforced the interpretation of the ALJ in his statement \u201c[t]he [ALJ] held, correctly in my opinion, that [appellant\u2019s publication] did not meet the <em>Houghton v. Payne </em>definition of a periodical publication and that it did not fall within the type of nondescript publications such as railway guides that have been treated as periodicals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-26\">Finally, the district court, having succinctly and correctly stated the rule of <em>Houghton </em>to be that \u201cbooks do not become periodicals entitled to second class treatment simply because they are issued periodically and in consecutive numbers\u201d and, having noted that appellant advocated an interpretation limiting <em>Houghton </em>to its facts, rejected appellant\u2019s contention, stating that appellant \u201cignores the definition of periodicals in <em>Houghton, </em>however: \u2018A periodical . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>contains a variety or original articles by different authors . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b547-32\">. Our disposition would make any discussion of other issues raised by appellant premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
