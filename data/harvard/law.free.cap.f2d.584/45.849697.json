The complaint alleged jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(4), and prayed for both declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court concluded that it had jurisdiction, but granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss upon the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-21\">We find it unnecessary to reach the merits of the appeal since we conclude that under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, </em>436 U.S. 49, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978), the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain the action. In accepting jurisdiction the court below understandably relied upon our decision in <em>Crowe v. Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Inc., </em>506 F.2d 1231 (4th Cir. 1974). In that case, drawing upon the rationale of <em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968), we held that Section 1343(4) provided \u201ca logical and specific basis of jurisdiction\u201d, <em>Id. </em>at 1234, to assert rights guaranteed under the ICRA. In <em>Martinez, </em>however, the Court concluded that suits against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>a tribe under the ICRA are barred by its sovereign immunity and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">\u201cunless and until Congress makes clear its intention to permit the additional intrusion on tribal sovereignty that adjudication of such actions in a federal forum would represent, we are constrained to find that \u00a7 1302 does not impliedly authorize actions for declaratory or injunctive relief against either the tribe or its officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">436 U.S. at 72, 98 S.Ct. at 1684.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Our decision in <em>Crowe </em>was, of course, overruled by the clear and unequivocal holding of the Court in <em>Martinez, </em>and requires that the jurisdictional ruling of the trial court be set aside. Accordingly, this case is remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
