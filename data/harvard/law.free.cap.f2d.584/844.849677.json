MacLaughlin, United States District Judge, District of Minnesota, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b907-5\">MacLAUGHLIN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Plaintiffs appeal from judgment for defendant entered on a jury verdict in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The jury found no deprivation of constitutional rights in the death of plaintiffs\u2019 son which resulted from the discharge of defendant\u2019s gun. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">This suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 arises out of events which occurred in University City, Missouri, on November 23,1974. That day, defendant Robert Conley reported for work in his capacity as a patrolman for the University City Police Department. Patrolling alone in a squad car, he received a call at approximately 1 p. m. to investigate a minor traffic accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The jury had to resolve the parties\u2019 differing versions of the events that transpired at the scene of the accident. Defendant testified that in an attempt to gather information for an accident report he approached the automobile Albert Smith was driving. The automobile had not been directly involved in the accident, but a participant had told defendant that its movement had caused the collision. Defendant asked to see Albert Smith\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Albert Smith responded with profanity and attempted to leave the car. Defendant stopped him, fearing that a fight between the occupants of another automobile involved in the accident and Albert Smith was likely. Eventually, Albert Smith gave defendant his driver\u2019s license and succeeded in getting out of the automobile. He then grabbed the officer and began striking him. At about the same time, Albert\u2019s brother Darrell, who was a passenger in the vehicle, emerged, circled the back of the vehicle, and jumped on defendant\u2019s back. During the ongoing struggle, Darrell Smith tried to remove defendant\u2019s gun from its holster. The officer removed the gun himself and, while bent over from the weight of Darrell Smith on his back, attempted to strike Albert\u2019s knees with the handle of the gun. Failing in the attempt, defendant brought the gun in close to his body. The gun discharged while in defendant\u2019s hand and the bullet struck Albert Smith in the stomach, causing his death. A hole made by a bullet traveling outward was discovered in defendant\u2019s jacket. Defendant testified he did not intend to shoot anyone, but attempted only to secure his weapon in a safe position in the circumstances and it accidentally discharged. Four witnesses corroborated to various degrees defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">Plaintiffs, who are the parents of the decedent, maintained that defendant initially reached into the automobile and assaulted Albert Smith to provoke the incident. Albert then forced his way out of the vehicle and exchanged blows with defendant. Darrell Smith testified that he emerged only to break up the fight, that he never jumped on the officer\u2019s back, and never tried to remove his gun. Another witness, a friend of the decedent, testified that without warning defendant drew his revolver, disentangled himself from the struggle, aimed, and deliberately shot Albert Smith in the stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">The primary issue raised on appeal concerns the exclusion of certain expert testimony during plaintiffs\u2019 rebuttal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After calling three other rebuttal witnesses, plaintiffs called R. A. Steindler, a firearms expert. Steindler would have testified that defendant\u2019s gun would not fire unless the trigger was pulled, and that if the gun had discharged while defendant gripped its barrel, he would have felt a definite sting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>experienced powder burns on his hands. The district'court excluded the testimony-on two grounds: first, because it was not proper rebuttal evidence, and, second, because plaintiffs had failed to disclose Stein-dler as a witness in violation of the court\u2019s pretrial order and Fed.R.Civ.P. 26. Since we hold that the testimony was excludible as improper rebuttal evidence, we do not reach the question of the consequence of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to disclose the identity of Steindler or the substance of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Rule 611(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides a district court discretion in managing the conduct of a trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\"><em>United States v. Jackson, </em>549 F.2d 517, 528 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 985, 97 S.Ct. 1682, 52 L.Ed.2d 379 (1977). This discretion extends to the reception of evidence in rebuttal. In <em>Skogen v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>375 F.2d 692, 705 (8th Cir. 1967), we stated: Accord, e. g., <em>Swanson &amp; Youngdale, Inc. v. Seagrave Corp., </em>561 F.2d 171, 174 n.6 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>Hanrahan v. St. Vincent Hosp., </em>516 F.2d 300, 302 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>French v. Hall, </em>119 U.S. 152, 7 S.Ct. 170, 30 L.Ed. 375 (1886). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has suggested that the discretion to exclude rebuttal evidence should be exercised with caution. <em>Weiss v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>515 F.2d 449, 457-59 (2d Cir. 1975). In Weiss, the failure of Chrysler to answer interrogatories revealing its theory of the cause of an automobile accident effectively prevented the plaintiff from disputing that theory until after she had rested.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF9Y\">\u201c[T]he order in which . . . evidence . . . [is] presented . [is] an area largely within the discretion of the trial court. . . . Normally, parties are expected to present all of their evidence in their case in chief. Allowance of a party to present additional evidence on rebuttal depends upon the circumstances of the case and rests within the discretion of the individual most able to weigh the competing circumstances, the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Plaintiffs here can make no reasonable claim of ignorance as to defendant\u2019s theory of the shooting. Defendant\u2019s deposition and opening statement revealed the defense that the shooting was accidental,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of a deliberate aiming and firing of the revolver controverted the defense. This is not a situation in which the proffered testimony would have significantly increased the cogency of plaintiffs\u2019 case if it was received in rebuttal. Defendant himself conceded that he must have pulled the trigger, and defendant\u2019s expert testified that pulling the trigger was the only way the gun could be fired. Plaintiffs chose, for whatever reason,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> not to call Steindler during their case in chief. We cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\">. Plaintiffs raise five other issues on appeal. The errors concern cross-examination of plaintiffs\u2019 principal witness, closing argument by defense counsel, the jury instructions, judicial notice of a Missouri statute, and the trial judge\u2019s alleged lack of impartiality during trial. We have carefully examined the record and find that these allegations of error are without merit and justify no further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-9\">. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel concluded his direct examination of the opening witness in plaintiffs\u2019 case in chief with this question: \u201cDid you at any time see Officer Conley shoot a hole in his jacket in any way at all?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b908-10\">. A possible motivation for delaying Steindler\u2019s testimony might have been an attempt to avoid the apparent consequences of failing to disclose his identity as an expert witness. The district court\u2019s pretrial order, cited by plaintiffs in this regard, provided in part: \u201cExcept for good cause shown, no party shall be permitted to offer in evidence (other than in rebuttal or as impeachment) the testimony of any trial witness . . not listed or submitted by said party as herein required . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
