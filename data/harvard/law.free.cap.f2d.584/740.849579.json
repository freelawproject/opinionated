BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b803-22\">Gary Thomas Rieves and Virginia Gayle Berry were arrested and indicted on charges of importing cocaine into the United States<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of possession with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>distribute cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court without a jury convicted them as charged,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and this appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">On June 11, 1977, at approximately 4:20 p. m., appellant Berry arrived at the Miami International Airport on a flight from Bogota, Colombia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She claimed her baggage and awaited routine custom inspection<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in Inspector Christine Hinton\u2019s line. Although Hinton found no contraband in Berry\u2019s luggage, she noticed that Berry was wearing a very large, loose-fitting pantsuit. She questioned appellant generally about her trip and was told that Berry was a housewife from Hawaii, traveling alone on vacation to Mexico and Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Believing that she should investigate Mrs. Berry further, Inspector Hinton called for her supervisor, Sigmund Korzeniowski, and requested that he approve a secondary search. Korzeniowski then questioned Berry, who told him that her daughter\u2019s husband or boyfriend had paid for her trip. As they were talking, Korzeniowski noticed that Berry\u2019s clothing appeared to be several sizes too large for her and that there were \u201cunnatural contours\u201d in the leg, crotch, and bosom areas of her body.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-18\">During this conversation, another customs inspector, Edward Archer, requested Korzeniowski\u2019s attention. He had examined the luggage of appellant Rieves, who had just arrived from Bogota, Colombia.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although he had found no contraband, he had received a \u201cpositive\u201d TECS read-out,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> indicating that Rieves was suspected of smuggling cocaine. Korzeniowski noticed that Rieves was wearing a shirt with a Hawaiian insignia and, upon examining his passport, discovered that Rieves and Berry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>had gone through the same Colombian customs examiner on the same day. This additional information, along with his observation that Rieves was. nervously watching the \u201cexceptionally calm\u201d Mrs. Berry, led Korzeniowski to order a personal search of Berry.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Inspector Hinton and another female customs official escorted Mrs. Berry to a closed room. There the conducted a secondary search, which produced ten condoms and two plastic bags of cocaine that appellant had secreted in her bra and between her girdle and panty hose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hinton officially arrested Mrs. Berry at approximately 4:30 p. m. and immediately read the <em>Miranda </em>rights to her from an official customs form. After Mrs. Berry read the form herself and stated that she understood her rights, Inspector Hinton notified the Drug Enforcement Administration of the arrest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">While Hinton was searching Berry, or shortly thereafter, a further search of Rieves\u2019 luggage produced condoms of the same type that Berry had used to carry cocaine. It also revealed the same type of tape that she had used to attach the cocaine to her body. A subsequent secondary search of Rieves failed to produce any contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">At approximately 4:50 p. m. DEA agent Charles Martinez arrived at the Miami airport. After identifying himself to Mrs. Berry, advising her of her rights, and obtaining her assurance that she understood those rights, he spoke briefly with Rieves and read him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Martinez and another DEA agent, Kenneth Goodman, began questioning Berry at approximately 5:00 p. m. During the subsequent interrogation, which lasted until 5:45 p. m., Berry admitted that a man known to her as G.T. had solicited her aid in importing cocaine. She gave a physical description that fit Rieves and then identified his passport photograph as \u201cG.T.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Agent Martinez looked through Mrs. Berry\u2019s purse as he and Agent Goodman were questioning her and found hotel receipts from the Hotel Tequendama in Bogota, Colombia. He also seized a note pad, on which Mrs. Berry had written the number \u201c1602.\u201d She told the agents that this was Rieves' room number. Customs also found Rieves\u2019 receipt for room 1602 at the Hotel Tequen-dama among his personal effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">Rieves was arrested at approximately 5:45 p. m.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in Korzeniowski\u2019s office. After Agent Martinez again advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Rieves denied knowing Berry and stated that he thought he should speak to an attorney. Martinez asked no further questions. Although he walked in and out of the customs inspector\u2019s office several times during the next few hours, and told Rieves that any cooperation would be made known to the Court at the time of sentencing, he elicited no statements from Rieves. At 8:30 p. m., despite his earlier expression of desire to remain silent, Rieves asked to speak with Agent Martinez. He then said that Berry was not \u201cinvolved,\u201d but was merely \u201cbringing it in.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>having given their oral statements, both appellants gave extensive written statements detailing their activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Appellant Berry now claims that reasonable suspicion<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> did not support the strip search of her person. Since, she argues, the resulting seizure of cocaine was therefore illegal, the Court should have granted her motion to suppress. We, however, do not agree that Mrs. Berry\u2019s appearance and demeanor did not raise suspicions reasonably sufficient to warrant the search. First, she fit several of the characteristics of the \u201csmuggling profile\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u2014a woman, traveling alone, returning from a short stay in Colombia where she had no relatives, and wearing overly large clothing. Although she presented more than one bag for customs inspection and calmly declared over $100 worth of merchandise,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> these factors were outweighed by Customs Supervisor Korzeniowski\u2019s observation of unnatural contours in the bust, leg and crotch areas.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He had constitutionally sufficient reason to believe that a search of Mrs. Berry\u2019s body would produce contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Our prior decisions support the result we reach in this case. In <em>Forbicetta, supra, </em>a young, unemployed woman returned from vacation in Colombia wearing a loose-fitting dress. She carried only one bag and declared no purchases. Based upon this evidence, we upheld a strip search, which revealed two and one-half pounds of cocaine attached to her body. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Smith, supra, </em>we upheld a strip search conducted on a \u201cvery, very nervous,\u201d \u201cvery pale,\u201d unemployed man who was returning from Colombia after \u201cvacationing\u201d alone there. Finally, in <em>United States v. Himmeiwright, supra, we </em>considered the search of a young woman who was traveling alone after a short stay in Colombia. She wore platform shoes <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and, more significantly, gave evasive answers when questioned about her employment. We affirmed her resulting conviction, finding that the decision to search her was reasonable. Applying the results of those cases to' the present facts, we find that Berry\u2019s unnatural contours, like Smith\u2019s nervousness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>and Himmelwright\u2019s evasiveness, supported Korzeniowski\u2019s decision to authorize the secondary search.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We now turn to appellant Rieves\u2019 claim that his oral and written statements were coerced. To support his position, he maintains first that custom officials should have released him after thorough searches of his body and luggage produced no contraband. His continued detention, he argues, was not based upon probable cause. He further contends that during this detention, customs officials continually interrogated him despite his consistent invocation of his right to remain silent and his request for an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">A re-examination of the magistrate\u2019s report reveals that the facts as she found them do not support Rieves\u2019 contentions. In claiming that customs officials detained him merely on the basis of (1) the TECS \u201chit\u201d and (2) the fact that he and Mrs. Berry had gone through the same Colombian customs inspector, he ignores the discovery of the tape and condoms in his luggage. He disregards Supervisor Korzeniowski\u2019s observations \u2014 that Rieves nervously watched Mrs. Berry and that the inscription on his shirt indicated that, even though he claimed to reside in Michigan, he had been in Hawaii.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, he does not even mention that customs officials, while searching Rieves\u2019 personal effects, found a receipt from the same hotel Mrs. Berry had stayed in in Colombia.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In light of all of these factors, we cannot say that the customs and DEA officials acted without probable cause in holding Rieves.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We acknowledge that the Government\u2019s case against Rieves grew stronger as he was detained. We point out, however, that although arrest (and detention) must stand upon more than reasonable suspicion, the arresting officer need not have in hand evidence sufficient to convict. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">The magistrate\u2019s findings similarly do not support Rieves\u2019 claim that customs and DEA officials continued to interrogate him after he invoked his right to remain silent and asked to see an attorney. According to the magistrate, Agent Martinez did go in and out of the room in which Rieves was sitting and did mention that he would make known to the Court any cooperation on Rieves\u2019 part. These comments, however, constituted neither interrogation nor coercion. Rieves admitted that his rights had been read to him and that he understood them. When he reinitiated\u2014 unprompted by further interrogation \u2014 the dialogue with Agent Martinez, he affirmatively demonstrated that he wished to waive his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>A long line of decisions of this Circuit supports this result. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Hopkins, </em>5 Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 1041, <em>cert. denied, </em>1971, 401 U.S. 1013, 91 S.Ct. 1252, 28 L.Ed.2d 550 (when accused initiates the conversation, his statements do not result from \u201cinterrogations\u201d and are therefore admissible); <em>United States v.

Both appellants had filed motions to suppress, Berry contesting the constitutionality of her search, Rieves claiming that his confession was involuntary. A magistrate held an eviden-tiary hearing and entered findings of fact and a recommendation that the trial judge deny the motions. When the matter came before the Court for trial and reconsideration of the suppression motions, Berry and Rieves both waived jury trial and stipulated that since the testimony at trial would track that at the suppression hearing, the Court should proceed on the basis of the transcript of that hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b804-12\">. We present the facts as the magistrate found them and as the District Judge adopted them. Both appellants contest particular findings and point to conflicts in the testimony to support their version of the facts. According to well established precedent in this Circuit, however, we must, in the face of conflicting testimony, accept the magistrate\u2019s findings, which by adoption the trial judge made his own in determining guilt or innocence. She made her recommendation after \u201c[h]aving carefully listened to the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witnesses and defendants in this case . .\u201d Magistrate\u2019s Report at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-20\">After a careful and independent review of the entire suppression hearing transcript, we conclude that the magistrate\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous. <em>See, e. g., Dickens v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 545 F.2d 886.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b804-21\">. As this Court observed in <em>United States v. Himmelwright, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 551 F.2d 991, 993, cert. <em>denied, </em>434 U.S. 902, 98 S.Ct. 298, 54 L.Ed.2d 189, a customs official at the Miami International Airport may stop a person who has just arrived from Colombia to examine his or her visa and search luggage, even without \u201cany articulable suspicion that actual criminal activity [is] afoot.\u201d Such searches occur \u201cunder circumstances constituting the \u2018functional equivalent of the border.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b804-22\">. Korzeniowski also testified that Mrs. Berry wore her jacket open, with a blouse underneath it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b804-23\">. Appellants arrived on different flights, Berry on Braniff Airlines, Rieves on Avianca.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b804-24\">. Customs inspectors in many major cities routinely feed the names and birth dates of persons entering the country into a computer system known as Treasury Enforcement Capability (TECS). The computer stores notice of outstanding arrest warrants, names of persons suspected of smuggling, and other related information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\">. According to Inspector Hinton\u2019s testimony, she asked appellant to lift her blouse. When Mrs. Berry lifted it in front, Hinton could see \u201csomething inside her bra.\u201d She instructed appellant to \u201cpull it up or open it up,\u201d and Berry admitted having contraband. Hinton then instructed her to undress completely. She at no time touched Mrs. Berry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\">. Inspector Hinton also testified that she did not question Berry after reading the <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b805-10\">. Although Rieves had not been formally arrested, Customs officials were detaining him in another room.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b805-14\">. She later identified him in person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b805-15\">. He was arrested on the basis of Mrs. Berry\u2019s statements identifying him and describing the smuggling plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b805-16\">. Contrary to the Magistrate\u2019s finding that no one questioned him after he invoked his right to remain silent, Rieves insists that he was repeatedly interrogated and that he did not begin talking until 9:30 p. m. Moreover, although Agent Martinez testified that appellant appeared calm, confident, and composed, Rieves stated that he had not slept for over 24 hours and had had two Valium tablets and several drinks. (He does acknowledge, however, that when Agent Martinez asked him if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>felt \u201cokay,\u201d he replied that he did.) Again, the magistrate \u2014 and the trial judge \u2014 resolved these conflicts in favor of the Government. <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. We have often approved the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard for secondary customs searches. See, e. <em>g., United States v. Smith, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 557 F.2d 1206, 1208, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1073, 98 S.Ct. 1259, 55 L.Ed.2d 777. In <em>Smith, </em>this Court emphasized that \u201c[tjhis Circuit expressly rejects the Ninth Circuit rule\u201d that \u201creal suspicion\u201d is required for strip searches. We again find that \u201ca \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 standard affords sufficient fourth amendment protection.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">. The \u201csmuggling profile\u201d has been compiled by customs agents based on characteristics found in a high percentage of individuals who attempt to smuggle drugs. This Court has considered \u201cpattem[s] of characteristics\u201d associated with smuggling activity in other drug cases. <em>United States v. Forbicetta, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 484 F.2d 645, 646, <em>cert. denied, </em>1974, 416 U.S. 993, 94 S.Ct. 2404, 40 L.Ed.2d 772; <em>United States v. Himmelwright, supra </em>at 995-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. According to the smuggling profile, persons attempting to smuggle cocaine will usually carry only one suitcase and will declare nothing in order to clear customs quickly. <em>United States v. Smith, supra </em>at 1208 n.l. Appellant claims that this is the most significant indicator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">. Thus, while we recognize, as we have before, that mere resemblance to a smuggling profile will not \u201cpermit a reasonable conclusion that a strip search should occur,\u201d we again hold that certain circumstances \u201cnotwithstanding the fruitless search of luggage may well render a physical search reasonable.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Himmelwright, </em>supra at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Korzeniowski\u2019s statement \u2014 that he had not decided to authorize the search until he received additional information from Inspector Archer \u2014 does not affect our determination. While the Supervisor\u2019s hesitancy in ordering secondary searches is admirable, he nevertheless could have ordered the search based on his own observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">In reaching this decision, we find it unnecessary to address Mrs. Berry\u2019s contention, based on <em>United States v. Afanador, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 567 F.2d 1325, that information relating to Rieves could not bolster the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify her strip search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b806-14\">. The Court observed that \u201cthe officers knew from their experience that platform shoes were often used as a cache for smuggled contraband.\u201d 551 F.2d at 992. An x-ray of the shoes, however, revealed that Ms. Himmeiwright had hidden nothing in them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\">. As we pointed out earlier, Mrs. Berry was a resident of Hawaii and admitted beginning her trip there. Both appellants eventually admitted that they had planned the smuggling venture in Hawaii.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b807-11\">. Although it is unclear (from the magistrate\u2019s findings) just when customs officials found Rieves\u2019 receipt, they definitely realized its significance during Rieves\u2019 detention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b807-12\">. Appellant cites <em>United States </em>v. <em>Afanador, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 567 F.2d 1325, presumably attempting to argue that customs officials could not justify their detention of Mr. Rieves by transferring to him their reasonable suspicion that Mrs. Berry was smuggling contraband. While <em>Afanador </em>does hold that \u201cthe fourth amendment does not permit any automatic or casual transference of \u2018suspicion,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1331, the opinion acknowledges that in certain circumstances \u201cthe degree of suspicion as to an already suspicious individual may be somewhat enhanced by virtue of suspicious activity by a closely linked traveling companion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2bE\">Rieves cannot find support in the Court\u2019s having reversed Ms. Afanador\u2019s conviction. The only basis the Government had for searching her was that a DEA agent had received information that a fellow stewardess was carrying cocaine. The Court explained that:</p>\n<p id=\"APKm\">[t] hough a Siamese symbiosis need not be demonstrated, more than physical companionship and/or a working relationship is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">A much more suspicious connection existed between Rieves and Berry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b807-16\">. We must point out that although <em>Miranda </em>requires Government agents to cease all interrogation when a suspect expresses a desire to consult with an attorney, it does not mandate immediate access to an attorney. We find that the agents\u2019 statement that Mr. Rieves could consult an attorney when he arrived at jail satisfies <em>Miranda. </em>See <em>Atwell v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 507.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
