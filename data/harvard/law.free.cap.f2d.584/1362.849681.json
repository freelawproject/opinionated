K. HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1424-25\">The issue we decide in this appeal is a limited one: whether a state which has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>established a policy for the stated objective of eliminating state medical assistance (medicaid) funding for nontherapeutic abortions may implement that policy by using a policy standard which requires a physician to certify that \u201con the basis of [his] professional judgment the life of [the medicaid recipient] would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\u201d We hold that it cannot and remand to the district court for entry of an order enjoining use of such a policy and physician\u2019s certification standard and directing modification of that standard to make it conform to its stated policy objective until such time as the state may elect to officially change its medicaid funding policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">\u201cJanet Doe,\u201d a pregnant Virginia medicaid recipient, brought a civil class action against various officials of the Commonwealth of Virginia to enjoin implementation of a policy of the Virginia State Board of Health by use of a standard which would tend to discourage physicians from performing abortions for medicaid recipients by eliminating reimbursement for all abortions other than those for which a physician could certify that the recipient\u2019s life would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. She alleged violations of the Social Security Act, Title XIX, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle XIX\u201d) and the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. A temporary restraining order was issued pending determination of the merits of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">The policy in question is an amendment to the \u201cState Plan 'for Medical Assistance\u201d which was finally approved by the State Board of Health on November 30, 1977. The minutes of that meeting show that the amendment was \u201cto limit the payment for abortions to only those instances in which the mother\u2019s life was in danger.\u201d The minutes of that meeting and a previous meeting held September 9, 1977, show that the amendment was made following public response to hearings held to discuss medicaid funding of abortions after Congress enacted a similar limitation on the use of federal funds for abortions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The amendment was approved against the recommendation of both the Governor\u2019s Advisory Committee on Medicare and Medicaid and the staff of the Department of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-13\">On March 20, 1978, a \u201cMedicaid Memo\u201d was issued to physicians and hospitals participating in the medicaid program setting forth the standard for reimbursement and the physician\u2019s certification requirement which Doe finds objectionable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>quent to filing of her class action and entry of the temporary restraining order, the State Board of Health passed a resolution explaining its new funding policy. The resolution referred to unspecified Supreme Court rulings which recognized that states have some discretion in funding abortions through their medicaid programs and it stated that the policy amendment was made \u201cbecause [the Board] desired and continued to desire to eliminate reimbursement for abortions for which there were no good medical reasons.\u201d The resolution also stated that, while the new funding policy \u201cpermits the physician to consider [a woman\u2019s health], as well as other factors affecting medical necessity,\u201d the Board was opposed to use of any subterfuge in a physician\u2019s certification that a patient needed an abortion, \u201cparticularly for insubstantial mental health, or familial, or social reasons in cases in which there is no immediate threat to the mother\u2019s life.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">A hearing on the merits of Doe\u2019s claim was held on May 16, 1978, at which the President of State Board of Health and the State Health Commissioner testified as to the purpose of the policy amendment and the interpretation which would be placed on it by the Commonwealth\u2019s program administrators. Based upon the evidence presented and the arguments of counsel, the district court found that the purpose of the policy was to eliminate state funding of nontherapeutic abortions, that such a policy was permitted under Title XIX, <em>Beal v. Doe, </em>432 U.S. 438, 97 S.Ct. 2366, 53 L.Ed.2d 464 (1977) and under the Constitution, <em>Maher v. Roe, </em>432 U.S. 464, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977), and that the policy directive contained in the resolution was clear. Thereupon, the temporary restraining order was vacated and Doe\u2019s class action was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-11\">Immediately following entry of the court\u2019s order, the Commonwealth issued another \u201cMedicaid Memo\u201d which adopted the court\u2019s findings of fact that the new funding policy permits the physician to consider the recipient\u2019s \u201cphysical and mental health, as well as other factors affecting medical necessity.\u201d It concluded by restating the previous requirement that a physician certify that, based upon his professional judgment, the life of the recipient would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>Doe appeals the court\u2019s decision, claiming that use of a policy standard and a certification requirement which speak in terms of endangerment of \u201clife\u201d rather than \u201chealth\u201d belies the Commonwealth\u2019s stated intent to eliminate reimbursement only for nontherapeutic abortions when its practical effect is to eliminate many medically necessary abortions from medical coverage. She asserts that Title XIX requires funding of all abortions which are determined by physicians to be medically necessary based upon their professional consideration of all medical factors, including the mental health of the recipient and the possibility of a recipient bearing a deformed child, as in the case of her exposure to German measles. She asserts that abortions following rape and incest should be included in medicaid coverage for eligible recipients. Also, she alleges that failure to fund medically necessary abortions for low income persons effectively denies them access to abortions in violation of their constitutional rights of privacy and equal protection and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">The Commonwealth agrees with the district court\u2019s finding that its objective is to eliminate funding only for nontherapeutic abortions. Its counsel argues that this limited objective brings the Virginia program in line with the holdings of <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Doe, supra, </em>and <em>Maher v. Roe, supra, </em>and that based upon the facts before us and the rulings of those cases, we should not reach the issues of statutory and constitutional construction urged upon us by Doe. It is also argued that the phrases \u201cendanger the <em>life </em>of the recipient\u201d and \u201cendanger the <em>health </em>of the recipient\u201d convey essentially the same meaning except that the former imports a more substantial degree of medical need, and that use of the policy standard of endangerment of the life of the recipient facilitates the important state interest of monitoring funding for this special medical procedure by assuring that in no instance will the Commonwealth fund an abortion for which no substantial medical reason exists. Finally, counsel for the Commonwealth argues that if we find its policy standard to be ambiguous in light of the policy-makers\u2019 intent and the interpretation placed on it by program administrators, we should invoke the doctrine of abstention in order to permit the state courts to construe the standard in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">We think that on the facts of this case we need not reach the statutory and constitutional issues raised by Doe of whether a state may be compelled by either Title XIX or the Constitution to fund induced therapeutic abortions. Also, since the dispute before us is a limited one, we decline to invoke the doctrine of abstention. This issue may be settled simply and without further delay. See <em>Zbaraz v. Quern, </em>572 F.2d 582 (7th Cir. 1978). Thus, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing Doe\u2019s class action because the policy standard set out in the amendment and the physician\u2019s certification requirement is ambiguous in light of the Commonwealth\u2019s stated objective to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>eliminate only funding of nontherapeutie abortions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">The Commonwealth\u2019s position throughout has been that the words \u201cendangerment of life\u201d really mean \u201cendangerment of health,\u201d or more properly \u201csubstantial endangerment of health.\u201d We disagree. In usual parlance, conditions involving \u201cendangerment of life\u201d are those which pose a serious threat of death. <em>Zbaraz v. Quern, </em>572 F.2d at 585. But such a narrow meaning is contrary to the one intended by the Commonwealth and makes the standard of endangerment of life ambiguous in violation of Title XIX, 1396a(a)(17). When the meaning of a standard can be made clear, we think it should be made clear and, therefore, find it necessary to reverse and remand this class action for entry of an appropriate order by the district court. Since the stated objective of the policy amendment to the State Plan for Medical Assistance is to eliminate reimbursement only for nontherapeutie abortions, as defined in <em>Beal v. Doe, supra, </em>and <em>Maher v. Roe, supra, </em>the order shall include provisions (i) directing substitution of the words \u201csubstantial endangerment of health\u201d for the words \u201cendangerment of life\u201d in the amendment and the physician\u2019s certification requirement, (ii) directing immediate issuance of a public notice for the benefit of recipients and a written communication to physicians and hospitals participating in the Commonwealth\u2019s medicaid program which clearly set forth the standard for reimbursement to be one based upon a physician\u2019s professional medical judgment that the health of the recipient would be substantially endangered if the fetus were carried to term and that such judgment shall \u201cbe exercised in light of all factors \u2014 physical, emotional, psycho- \u25a0 logical, familial, and the woman\u2019s age \u2014 relevant to the well-being of the patient,\u201d <em>Beal v. Doe, </em>432 U.S. at 442, n. 3, 97 S.Ct. at 2369, citing <em>Doe v. Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973), and (iii) expressly authorizing administrative flexibility in the establishment of various physician\u2019s certification forms and requirements to conform to any federal requirements imposed from time to time for federal funding of abortions for which the Commonwealth may choose to seek available federal funds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">The decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"atk-dedup-1\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">.

On appeal, counsel for Doe and the Commonwealth move this court for leave to supplement the record in several respects and, in light of our limited holding, we find it necessary to grant only that part of Doe\u2019s motion which would add to the record this \u201cMedicaid Memo\u201d which was issued after dismissal of her class action. This second \u201cMedicaid Memo\u201d is dated June 19, 1978, and reads in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-14\">SUBJECT: Abortions Covered by Medicaid The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate reimbursement for abortions for which <em>there are no good medical reasons. </em>It does not limit reimbursement only to those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>in which there is an immediate threat to the life of the mother. \u201cEndanger\u201d means to expose to harm or danger; imperil. The State Board of Health intends this language <em>to receive a broader construction than one limited to an immediate threat to the life of the mother. The amendment permits the physician to consider the woman\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as other factors affecting medical necessity, when forming his/her professional judgment that the life of the woman would be endangered. </em>The physician is not to rely upon insubstantial mental health or family or social reasons when reaching his/her judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">Either medical diagnoses or the presence of medical risk factors, including age, could justify an induced abortion for medical reasons under this rule. The Medical Assistance Program does not intend to second guess each physician on his/her professional judgment so long as the diagnoses therefor are reasonable. However, the Board of Health is opposed to the use of subterfuge in the physician\u2019s certification. If such is suspected, the Medical Assistance Program will investigate and, when indicated, take appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-11\">The following exact statement must accompany each claim for an elective (induced) abortion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-12\">\u201cI, Dr._, certify that on the basis of my professional judgment, the life of (name) of (address) would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.
