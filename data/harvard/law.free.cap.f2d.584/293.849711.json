BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), the National Labor Relations Board has petitioned for enforcement of its Orders against respondents. The Board, affirming the findings made by an Administrative Law Judge in separate hearings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found respondents Tahoe Nugget and Nevada Lodge violated sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act). We grant enforcement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In 1959, the Reno Employers Council (the Association), a voluntary combination of restaurant and casino employers, entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Union Local 86 (the Union).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Soon after it opened in 1958, Nevada Lodge joined the Association; Tahoe Nugget joined after opening for business in 1962.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A series of three-year contracts, the last expiring on November 30, 1974, recognized the Union and set terms and conditions of employment for all Association members. By joining the Association, both respondents recognized the Union as bargaining representative for its employees; an election has never been held in either single employer unit or in the multi-employer unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">On September 17, 1974, Nevada Lodge withdrew from the Association; on October 25, it refused to recognize or bargain with the Union. Tahoe Nugget took the same action on September 18 and October 23, respectively. The withdrawals were timely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In November, the Union filed unfair labor practice charges against respondents. Subsequently, each employer filed an election petition, but under established Board practice, the elections were stayed pending the outcome of the unfair labor practice charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">The Union alleged that respondents\u2019 refusal to bargain violated section 8(a)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5), and that respondents subsequently interfered with the free exercise of employee rights in violation of section 8(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). The refusal to bargain charge was premised on the Union\u2019s presumed majority status. Respondents defended by introducing evidence to show their refusal was based on a reasonable doubt of the Union\u2019s majority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board found respondents\u2019 proof unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"amx-dedup-0\">The 8(a)(1) violations charged were of two varieties: dependent and independent. The dependent 8(a)(1) charges flowed from the refusal to bargain: by refusing to bargain with the employees\u2019 bargaining representative, the employer interferes with the employees\u2019 organizational rights and thereby violates 8(a)(1), if the refusal is not justified. The Board upheld these charges inasmuch as the refusal to bargain had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>adjudged unlawful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The independent 8(a)(1) charges stemmed from unilateral wage and benefit increases instituted after the collective bargaining agreement expired. These charges were also sustained by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Respondents\u2019 primary contentions on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">1. The presumption of majority status is inapplicable; and</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">2. A reasonable doubt has been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"AeGZ\">The presumption endorsed by the Board must be upheld unless it fails to evenhandedly further the Act\u2019s purpose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s factual findings must be sustained if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\n<em>THE PRESUMPTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aaa\">To sustain an 8(a)(5) charge, the General Counsel must show the union represented a majority of the unit employees when the employer refused to bargain. The Board employs two presumptions obviating an evidentiary showing of majority status. For a reasonable time, usually one year, after certification or voluntary recognition, majority support is irrebuttably presumed absent \u201cunusual circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After one year, the presumption becomes rebuttable. Absent sufficient countervailing proof, the presumption establishes, without more, the employer\u2019s duty to bargain. <em>NLRB v. Tesoro Petroleum Corp., </em>431 F.2d 95, 97 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Respondents contend a presumption cannot have such efficacy under rule 301, Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Only a superficial reading of the rule supports this contention. The courts have approved the presumption\u2019s use and force in reviewing 8(a)(5) violations, both before and after the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">The presumption is rebutted if the employer shows, by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the union was in the minority or that the employer had a good faith reasonable doubt of majority support at the time of the refusal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Some courts view these as complete defenses;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> other courts say they simply shift the burden to the General Counsel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Counsel usually relies on the presumption alone, as he did here, the distinction is primarily academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Proving minority status is a straightforward factual question. When the employer seeks to rely on the less exacting standard of reasonable doubt, he must also show the doubt was entertained in good faith. <em>Orion Corp. v. NLRB, </em>515 F.2d 81, 85 (7th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Respondents sought to substantiate their factual defense by showing the Union did not enjoy majority support at the time of voluntary recognition. The showing was disallowed as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In <em>Bryan Manufacturing</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that the six-month statute of limitations for filing unfair labor practice charges contained in \u00a7 10(b) of the Act can also act as an evidentiary bar. The issue arose when an employer recognized a minority union and entered into a collective bargaining agreement with it. No unfair labor practice charges were filed for ten months. The Board upheld the charges, reasoning that execution of the agreement was a continuing violation. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that \u00a7 10(b) precluded a challenge to the union\u2019s majority position.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Two situations were differentiated. The Court said when events within the six months preceding the filing of charges \u201cmay constitute, as a substantive matter, unfair labor practices,\u201d evidence showing earlier unfair labor practices is admissible to clarify the more recent events. When, however, the recent events violate the Act only if an earlier unfair practice occurred, the prior events are not merely evidentiary and evidence thereof is inadmissible. The facts in <em>Bryan Manufacturing </em>fell into the second category because enforcement of the agreement was illegal only if its execution were an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Here we are presented with the other side of the coin. Respondents intended to use the evidence defensively to prove their conduct was lawful. Respondents argue the evidence clarifies their subjective motivation and is therefore admissible to prove their good faith doubt defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">In <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Tragniew, Inc., </em>470 F.2d 669 (9th Cir. 1972), this court held that evidence of an unfair labor practice that occurred beyond the 10(b) period could not be admitted in defense of a refusal to bargain charge. <em>Accord, Lane-Coos-Curry-Douglas Counties Building and Construction Council, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, </em>415 F.2d 656, 659 n. 7 (9th Cir. 1969). Other courts agree that under <em>Bryan Manufacturing </em>a defunct unfair practice claim cannot be revived to defend subsequent charges. <em>E. g., NLRB v. District 30, United Mine Workers of America, </em>422 F.2d 115, 122 (6th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 959, 90 S.Ct. 2173, 26 L.Ed.2d 543 (1970). In <em>Tragniew, </em>however, the employer had not attempted to avail himself of the good faith doubt defense, but only tried to prove the union was in the minority. Consequently, the court did not consider the precise question raised by respondents.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">The defense respondents press has two parts:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">1. objective facts sufficient to support a reasonable doubt; and</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">2. the employer\u2019s good faith.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>NLRB v. Cornell of California, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 513, # 76-1545 (9th Cir. 1978). The Sixth Circuit has held in similar circumstances that evidence otherwise time barred is admissible to substantiate the second part of the defense presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In <em>NLRB v. Dayton Motels, Inc., </em>474 F.2d 328 (6th Cir. 1973), the employer sought to defend refusal to bargain charges by showing that union authorization cards, obtained more than six months previously, were procured fraudulently. The court held that evidence to support this defense was admissible. The employer does not resurrect a stale claim by showing the original authorization cards were obtained through fraud, the court reasoned, but only proves that the employer acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We think this misperceives the essence of the good faith criterion. The good faith criterion is ordinarily satisfied if, at the time the employer challenges the union majority, the employer has knowledge of the facts which give a reasonable basis for doubting the union\u2019s majority.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The good faith criterion is unconcerned with the employer\u2019s subjective motivation; its focus is empirical and objective. <em>See NLRB v. Vegas Vic, Inc., </em>546 F.2d 828 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 818, 98 S.Ct. 57, 54 L.Ed.2d 74 (1978). What the employer knew is determinative, not why he challenged the union\u2019s position. <em>See Automated Business Systems v. NLRB, </em>497 F.2d 262 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>NLRB v. Gulfmont Hotel Co., </em>362 F.2d 588, 589 (5th Cir. 1966); Seger, <em>The Majority Status of Incumbent Bargaining Representatives, </em>47 Tul.L.Rev. 961, 984 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">In a parallel context, the Supreme Court has deemphasized motivation. In <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), the court endorsed the Board\u2019s disregard of an employer\u2019s subjective motivation in election cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acf-dedup-1\">\u201cUnder the Board\u2019s current practice, an employer\u2019s good faith doubt is largely irrelevant, and the key to the issuance of a bargaining order is the commission of serious unfair labor practices that interfere with the election processes and tend to preclude the holding of a fair election. Thus, an employer can insist that a union go to an election, regardless of his subjective motivation, so long as he is not guilty of misconduct; he need give no affirmative reasons for rejecting a recognition request, and he can demand an election with a simple \u2018no comment\u2019 to the union. The Board pointed out, however, (1) that an employer could not refuse to bargain if he <em>knew, </em>through a personal poll for instance that a majority of his employees supported the union, and (2) that an employer could not refuse recognition initially because of questions as to the appropriateness of the unit and then later claim, as an after-thought, that he doubted the union\u2019s strength.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 89 S.Ct. at 1930.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-12\"><em>See Komatz Construction, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>458 F.2d 317, 326 (8th Cir. 1972) (\u201cIn view of the demise in <em>Gissel Packing </em>of the subjective test of an employer\u2019s good faith doubt, 395 U.S. at 608, 89 S.Ct. 1918, the proper test for rebuttal of the presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>is whether there is objective evidence sufficient to warrant a good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority. . . . \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In contrast to the situation in <em>Gissel Packing, </em>the employer must give \u201caffirmative reasons\u201d for challenging the union\u2019s position when asserting the reasonable doubt defense. The added burden is justified here because the Union\u2019s majority has already been established once. The Act favors stability in bargaining. Therefore, the employer must affirmatively defend his decision when he disrupts the existing relationship whereas he must only proceed in good faith when refusing to recognize the union initially.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Our construction of the reasonable doubt defense also comports with the Act\u2019s emphasis on neutral employer-union conduct to ensure employees unfettered freedom regarding their organizational desires. Congressional policy with \u25a0 respect to unfair practices is directed to controlling misconduct: it does not require the employer to embrace the union movement\u2019s precepts. Even when anti-union motivation is a necessary element of the unfair labor practice, conduct is still the key. The subjective inquiry is necessary to determine whether the employer has acted impartially; the presence of anti-union animus is immaterial unless it prompts the misconduct. <em>See NLRB v. Tayko Industries, Inc., </em>543 F.2d 1120 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>Conolon Corp. v. NLRB, </em>431 F.2d 324 (9th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 908, 91 S.Ct. 866, 27 L.Ed.2d 806 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">We hold the employer is free to act on the objective grounds before him, regardless of his underlying motivation. If union support is lacking, the employer\u2019s action actually furthers the cause of employee democracy by overcoming the inertia which helps maintain the status quo.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Since the employer\u2019s action is not in derogation of employee rights, his subjective motivation is important only evidentially.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In sum, when challenging the union majority, good faith is demonstrated if the employer is aware of the facts manifesting lack of union support and employer misconduct did not contribute to the loss of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Our conclusion is buttressed by pragmatic considerations. Administratively and evi-dentially, testing objective facts is simpler and more precise than probing an employer\u2019s mind.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Also, an objective construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>of the reasonable doubt defense eliminates uncertainty for the employer and reduces the risk of an erroneous determination if an unfair practice charge is filed. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">When motivation is an issue, evidence of a prior unfair practice is admissible.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Subjective motivation is not, however, an element of the reasonable doubt defense. Consequently, the evidence was inadmissible, and the alleged prior unfair practice did not constitute an objective ground for challenging the Union\u2019s bargaining status.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The employers argue that placing on them the burden of refuting the presumption of majority status is unfair because the Union has superior access to the information regarding Union support. The effect, respondents conclude, is that they are forced to assume the risk of erroneous determinations. We agree: the employer usually does have inferior access to the relevant information and may risk further penalty in garnering additional data.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Yet we think the burden is fair.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">In refusing to bargain because of an alleged decline in union adherents, the employer is acting as vicarious champion of its employees, a role no one has asked it to assume.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The employees were free to petition for decertification; here, they never did. Respondents were also free to petition for an election, the preferred method for resolving majority disputes, but neither did until much later. When the employer chooses to unilaterally disrupt an established bargaining relationship without an election, the threat to industrial peace must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>be counterbalanced by good cause.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> When the employer has doubts, the goal of the Act would be better served by filing an election petition.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Requiring the employer to show that his refusal to bargain was reasonable fairly allocates the burdens and concomitant risks.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Respondents also argue the <em>Bryan Manufacturing </em>rule makes this an irrebuttable presumption. The argument confuses the presumption with its factual predicate. \u00a7 10(b) does preclude respondents from showing the Union was in the minority when the Union was first recognized, but the presumption pertains to the Union\u2019s majority at the time the employer refused to bargain. The presumption may be rebutted; the only fact conclusively established is the fact that triggers the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Respondents\u2019 reliance on <em>NLRB v. Heyman, </em>541 F.2d 796 (9th Cir. 1976) is misplaced. There the contract had been invalidated by a prior judicial decree; therefore, the presumption was inapplicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cMajority representation is not the issue in this case; but what was and is the issue is the effect of the district court rescission on the presumption of validity utilized by the Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\"><em>See Pioneer Inn Associates v. NLRB, </em>578 F.2d 835 (9th Cir. 1978). The Board cannot ignore a judicial decree; it must ignore evidence which the Supreme Court has held to be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\n<em>WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The next issue is whether the presumption survives dissolution of the multi-em-ployer unit. Three interests embraced by the Act shape our decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">1. employee free choice;</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">2. stability in bargaining; and</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">3. the deference we owe to Board expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\"><em>See Zim\u2019s Foodliner, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>495 F.2d 1131, 1140 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 838, 95 S.Ct. 66, 42 L.Ed.2d 65 (1974). We conclude the Board did not abuse its discretion in balancing free choice and stability when it determined that, in this instance, freedom of choice must subserve the goal of industrial peace. <em>See id. </em>at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">Multi-employer units are formed by mutual consent of union and employer. But their power is limited: voluntary recognition of a union which does not enjoy majority support in the single employer unit is an unfair labor practice. <em>See NLRB v. Local 210, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc., </em>330 F.2d 46 (2d Cir. 1964). Nevertheless, either party may withdraw from the multi-employer unit without ascertaining the effect on union majority in the respective units.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">Relying on Member Walther\u2019s dissenting opinions, respondents assert the presumption is inapplicable once the employer withdraws from the multi-employer unit.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Since recognition was based on majority support within the larger unit, respondents argue, the factual predicate of the presumption, prior majority status, is inapposite when applied to the single employer unit. Respondents point out: no election was ever held; the Union was not recognized until the employers joined the Association; no separate contracts were signed; and withdrawal from the larger unit was timely. Under these facts, respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>dents conclude, the presumption is derivative, supported only by policy far-removed from actual fact; therefore, it should not be weighed heavily, if at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The reasoning of the Board majority persuades us that respondents\u2019 argument must fail. Respondents\u2019 argument misconstrues the presumption in two ways. First, the presumption is rooted in the employer\u2019s appraisal of union strength among its own employees. Second, the basis of the presumption is primarily policy, not probability; it is a vehicle for maintaining industrial peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In many instances, the presumption originates with an election among the employees of several employers. When the bargaining representative is chosen in a multi-employer-unit election, the factual premise is derivative: majority status in the single employer unit is inferred from the union\u2019s victory in the multi-employer election. Although the inference is reasonable,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> some reviewing courts have deemed it too speculative to support the presumption after the larger unit has dissolved.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Here, however, no election was held; the Union was voluntarily recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">When respondents joined the Association and recognized the Union, they implicitly declared their employees favored the Union. Thus, majority status can be directly inferred from the employer\u2019s own conduct; the presumption is not derived from the larger unit\u2019s majority, but originates with the employer\u2019s implicit declaration of a majority in the single employer unit. Moreover, the original factual inference is convincing: employers normally will not knowingly violate the law and union fraud is rare. Continued membership in the larger unit does nothing to negate this principle even though the larger unit becomes the appropriate one for bargaining.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The original presumption subsists: withdrawal from the unit simply entails a reversion to the original unit, a unit previously determined from the employer\u2019s own conduct to favor union representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">A secondary consideration supporting the presumption\u2019s continued vitality is its grounding in policy. By preserving the status quo, the presumption ensures the Act\u2019s most valued objective: industrial peace.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Respondents\u2019 assertion \u2014 that the inference of majority support based on voluntary recognition a decade before is too attenuated to survive withdrawal from the Association<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> \u2014 assumes the presumption is merely an evidential tool based wholly on probabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ty. The presumption, however, also subsists for policy reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Presumptions often function to further social, economic, or other policies, distinct from the fact presumed. C. McCormick, <em>Law of Evidence </em>\u00a7 343 (Cleary ed. 1972). <em>But see Ref-Chem Co. v. NLRB, </em>418 F.2d 127, 128-29 (5th Cir. 1969). In assorted contexts, the Board has used presumptions to stabilize labor-management relations. Inasmuch as primary responsibility for reconciling the inherent conflict between employee rights and bargaining stability has been entrusted to the Board, we determine only whether adoption of the presumption strikes a fair balance.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the single-employer context, the balance struck by the Board has been approved by the Supreme Court even though majority support was not demonstrable. <em>NLRB v. Burns International Security Services, Inc., </em>406 U.S. 272, 92 S.Ct. 1571, 32 L.Ed.2d 61 (1972).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> As stated previously, the presumption here, though perhaps distinguishable, stems from the single employer unit. Other circuits have approved Board presumptions in analogous circumstances when majority support was not readily deducible. <em>E. g., Zim\u2019s Foodliner, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>495 F.2d at 1136-38. <em>See also Franks Bros. Co. v. NLRB, </em>321 U.S. 702, 64 S.Ct. 830, 88 L.Ed. 1007 (1944). The Board may have concluded that the potential for abuse inherent in the employer\u2019s right to unilaterally withdraw from the Association justifies the incursion on employee freedom.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> If an employer could routinely negate the presumption of union majority status by withdrawing from a bargaining association, unions might refuse to consent to multiple party bargaining and this effective device for promoting industry-wide peace would be lost. Since industrial peace is no less desirable in multi-employer units and the election alternative is available to both employer and employee, we think the Board has not abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">\n<em>THE EMPLOYERS\u2019 EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axr\">Both the Administrative Law Judge and the Board found respondents had failed to introduce evidence sufficient to support a reasonable doubt. The credibility determinations made by the Administrative Law Judge and approved by the Board were fully warranted; in fact, conflicts in the evidence were rare, and virtually all of the testimony was credited. We pay great deference to the inferences drawn by the Board from the credited testimony because Board members\u2019 expertise and experience in labor-management relations is an invaluable asset to the task.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Nonetheless, derivative inferences which are tenuous, irrational, or unwarranted do not constitute substantial evidence and will be overturned on appeal. <em>Penasquitos Village, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>565 F.2d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Seven factors relied upon by respondents are discussed below. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">1. employee discontent,</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">2. turnover,</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">3. union inactivity,</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>4. low membership,</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">5. financial difficulties of the union,</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">6. bargaining history, and</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">7. admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">After analyzing each individually, their combined effect is considered. We note at the outset that in most decisions upholding the reasonable doubt defense the employer could point to at least one factor which was clearly referable to a decline in union support.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In many instances, this factor alone did not constitute sufficient evidence to justify the refusal to bargain, but did provide an unequivocal tie between the other evidence and the ultimate fact \u2014 whether union support had dwindled to a minority<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AhH\">All of the factors established by respondents are equivocal. They may represent a loss of union support, yet may be explained by other reasons. For example, low membership may show the union is losing support as bargaining representative, or it may simply indicate unwillingness to participate in union activities. The Board has consistently held that no single equivocal factor is sufficient to sustain the good faith doubt defense, but that each will be accorded some weight when the total effect of the evidence is assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">When the Board looks to the cumulative force of the evidence, the factors are reconsidered and weighed against the force of the presumption. If unexplained, the cumulative inferential weight of these equivocal factors might suffice to establish that the refusal to bargain was reasonable.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Derivative inferences of union minority status cannot be disregarded upon mere speculation; to ignore their cumulative effect would be irrational and unwarranted. We do not say the Board has deviated from its stated policy here, but merely outline the proper steps to ensure they are followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">In reviewing the facts, we are guided by several evidentiary considerations:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">1. Evidence manifesting declining union support is more pertinent than evidence showing union support is low.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">2. In gauging union support, the employer is often without direct evidence of minority status, and therefore he may properly rely on reasonable inferences from the available information. But that does not justify wishful speculation on the employer\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">3. When information signifying lack of union support would be readily available if union support had eroded, an insubstantial showing by the employer may be convincing proof the union has majority support.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">4. When the employer has consistently demonstrated impartiality regarding employee representation, his decision may be some evidence that the grounds relied on are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">With these thoughts in mind, we examine the particular facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">1. Employee Discontent</p>\n<p id=\"API\">Reports of employee complaints about the Union were one reason asserted by respondents for deciding the Union was in the minority. Much of the evidence to show employee dissatisfaction with the Union was speculative, conjectural, and vague. Often it was hearsay or based on management\u2019s evaluation of employee sentiment. Its probative weight is accordingly slight.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The dissatisfaction testified to here did not, for the most part, amount to repudiation.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Many an employee complains of his job without ever contemplating quitting, and remarks to management may be affected by a desire to curry the employer\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Absent other activity which would confirm that the reported complaints were expressions of repudiation, the two cannot be equated.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Here, the complaints were not vociferous, a petition for decertification had not been filed, and no organized opposition to the Union had formed.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Furthermore, the number of discontented employees was insubstantial.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In summary, the evidence was unreliable and the inference from it tenuous. Consequently, we afford it almost no weight.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The absence of more concrete evidence of employee discontent, particularly the filing of a decertification petition, is actually more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">2. Turnover</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">Respondents assert there is no basis for concluding that the present complement of employees shares the same attitude towards union representation as held by their predecessors a decade before. The annual turnover was consistently high for both employers. Thus, the work force at the time of the employers\u2019 refusal was completely different.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">High turnover, by itself, is insufficient to justify a refusal to bargain except when caused by employee discontent with the union.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The Board has adopted a presumption that new employees support the union in the same ratio as their predecessors.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Despite the legitimacy of this presumption, high turnover can be considered when other factors show declining union adherency.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>3. Union Inactivity</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In the years immediately preceding respondents\u2019 refusal to bargain, the' Union had not processed any grievances. The significance of this fact is questionable, since there was no testimony showing any grievances were warranted.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> When, as here, the union and the employer have established an amicable relationship over several years, contract violations may be the exception. Witnesses for both employers testified they abided by the collective bargaining agreement and were unaware of any contract violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">There was, however, other evidence of Union inactivity. Union agents inspected the business premises infrequently. No employees attended a meeting called by the Union<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> in the spring of 1974. Yet there is no evidence the Union failed to fulfill its responsibilities under the contract or breached its duty of fair representation.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Union inactivity is an objective ground which may contribute to an employer\u2019s conclusion that union support is lacking,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> but the showing here was de minimis.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">4. Low Membership</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Among bar and culinary employees in the Tahoe basin, Union membership was relatively low. For several reasons, this evidence is only marginally relevant.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Low membership was never tied to respondents\u2019 employees. Also, employees may favor union representation, but choose not to join, <em>NLRB v. Vegas Vic, Inc., </em>546 F.2d 828 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 818, 98 S.Ct. 57, 54 L.Ed.2d 74 (1978); this disparity is emphasized in a right-to-work state, such as Nevada. <em>See Terrell Machine Co. v. NLRB, </em>427 F.2d 1088, 1090 (4th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 929, 90 S.Ct. 1821, 26 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">5. Financial Difficulties of the Union</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">During 1974, the Union was placed in trusteeship, and a campaign to organize more workers was launched. This says little about support within the subject units. The Union was solvent. Its financial problems may have stemmed from overextension without sufficient financial support. Employees who desire representation may be unwilling to pay for it. The organizational campaign only shows a desire for more members, either within the units represented or from units as yet unrepresented. The record shows the Union undertook the campaign because higher membership would help the Union at the bargaining table; thus, the expanded organizing efforts were proper Union activity on behalf of the employees it then represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">6. Bargaining History</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">Relations between the Union and employer were amicable for many years. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>deemphasizing subjective motivation, we concomitantly discount the importance of this factor. Seger, <em>supra </em>note 25, at 994. Nonetheless, it may show the employer\u2019s decision was impartial and, by inference, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The history of employee-union ties may be more significant. There was no evidence here of employee-led challenges to the Union\u2019s representation or of abdication by the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">7. Admissions</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Neither the Union nor the employer had made damaging statements about their assessments of Union support.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In <em>Nevada Lodge, </em>respondent\u2019s attorney was \u201cto use any necessary method to get us disassociated from the union.\u201d This fact may be helpful in evaluating credibility, and it does imply subjective bad faith. Since the evidence was generally credited and this is not the unusual case where subjective motivation is an important factor, we find this evidence insignificant.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">8. Cumulative Effect of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">None of the evidence is wholly referable to a decline in Union support within the relevant units. Most of the evidence indicates the Union had equivocal support in the Lake Tahoe area. Some of the evidence is subjective; the inferences of loss of Union support are ambiguous. Before unilaterally disrupting the bargaining relationship, an employer must obtain more reliable evidence of lost support.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s determination that respondents violated sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act by refusing to bargain with the Union. After considering the record as a whole, we also affirm the Board\u2019s finding that respondent Nevada Lodge independently violated \u00a7 -8(a)(1) by unilaterally changing working conditions to induce its employees to abandon the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">The Board\u2019s Orders are enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\">.

However, if the destructive impact on employee organizational rights is comparatively slight, the employer may defend against the charge by introducing evidence showing that the conduct was motivated by business or other legitimate considerations. If the employer can produce such information, the aggrieved party may, in turn, submit evidence showing a substantial anti-union motivation. The showing of a substantial anti-union motivation is sufficient to support the charge, even if some legal motivating factors are present. Thus, substantial evidence from which the Board can infer the motivation of the employer at the time of the discharge may be essential to the defense to or proof of the charge.\u201d (footnotes omitted) Note, <em>The Labor Statute of Limitations: The Bryan Manufacturing Co.

Inferences are unnecessary. If the total of the employer\u2019s knowledge and ignorance is sufficient to support a reasonable doubt, the defense is established. On the other hand, when the Act prohibits conduct for an unlawful purpose, the Board must also infer why the employer acted. Theoretically, the good faith defense could require another strictly subjective finding based on inference, i. e., whether the employer actually believed certain facts which support the asserted reasonable doubt. But the Board has applied an objective test: the doubt is unreasonable if premised on unreliable evidence regardless of the employer\u2019s subjective belief. We think the converse is also true. We have found no case holding that an employer could not assert a reasonably based doubt because, though aware of the supporting facts when bargaining was refused, he unreasonably chose to disbelieve them. Thus, we think good faith is directed only to timing: the reasonable grounds must be known at the time the refusal occurs. Motivation and subjective belief are irrelevant except as they may shed light on the sufficiency of the evidence. See <em>NLRB v.

Kaase Co., </em>346 F.2d 24 (6th Cir. 1965), the Sixth Circuit did hold that withdrawal from a multi-employer unit vitiated the presumption despite the existence of a separate contract between the union and Kaase. But in that case the union\u2019s position as exclusive bargaining representative of the Kaase employees originated with an election in the multi-employer unit. No evidence showed the Kaase employees themselves ever favored the union; thus, the fact of majority status in the single-employer unit had never been established, as it had been here by the employer\u2019s voluntary recognition. There were other distinguishing facts. The union, the court noted, controlled Kaase employees through a union security clause and represented them in a highhanded manner. Kaase had been sold to new owners, and the size of its work force had been halved. Also the issue arose in the context of conflicting representational claims and blatant \u2022unfair labor practices by Kaase and the rival union.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">The court specified its holding was limited to the unusual circumstances presented.

When Respondent Nevada Lodge decided to enforce the company\u2019s anti-nepotism policy, the Union effected the rehire of five of the seven employees discharged.

The Union negotiated successive bargaining agreements with the Association; there was no evidence the Union had ever been charged with an unfair labor practice by respondents or any employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b369-20\">. <em>E. g., Ingress-PIastene v.

The testimony of Alfred Staff, President of the Union, from July 1973 to June 7, 1974, was material only to the question of the Union\u2019s actual majority; respondents were apparently unaware of the facts testified to by Staff when they refused to bargain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\">. Another ground relied on by respondents was that the collective bargaining agreement did not contain a clause authorizing dues checkoffs or a union security clause. This only confirms the Union lacked bargaining power with the employers, a fact the Union admitted. Respondents also contend the reduction in unit size consequent on withdrawal from the Association should be considered. Reduction in unit size is not sufficient to justify a refusal to bargain, <em>Zim\u2019s Foodliner, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>495 F.2d at 1140, and in light of the presumption\u2019s relation to the single employer unit discussed previously, this fact does not contradict the inference of majority support.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
