We accordingly vacate the orders under review and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings, in light of Commission precedent, with respect to Folkways\u2019 post-decisional efforts to amend its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b614-21\">In 1970, the Commission designated for hearing the mutually exclusive applications of Folkways and F. L. Crowder for a permit authorizing construction of a broadcast facility to provide the first FM radio service in Harriman, Tennessee. Further proceedings were held in abeyance, however, until release of the Commission\u2019s <em>Primer on </em>Ascertainment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in February 1971. Those with pending applications were then afforded 90 days within which to amend their ascertainment showings to comport with <em>Primer </em>standards, which Folkways endeavored to do. After a hearing, the Commission\u2019s Review Board declined to award the permit to Folkways because its ascertainment effort was unacceptable,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or to Crow-der because of (a) misrepresentation to the Commission, (b) earlier trafficking in broadcast licenses and (c) ascertainment defects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Folkways\u2019 petition for review by the Commission was rejected without specification of reasons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the same day, however, the Commission issued its decision in <em>Eastern Broadcasting </em>Company<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> granting reconsideration of a denial, which had been predicated on ascertainment grounds, of an application for a construction permit for a new FM radio station in Harlan, Kentucky. Relying on <em>Eastern, </em>Folkways sought reconsideration and leave to amend its application. This request was refused,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> essentially for fear of prejudicing potential <em>Ashbacker </em>rights<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of Crowder, who meanwhile had effected an appeal to this court. While Folkways\u2019 ensuing appeal to us was pending Crowder withdrew his own, whereupon Folkways unsuccessfully implored the Commission to seek a remand in view of the lapse of Crowder\u2019s cognizable interest in a prospective hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That order and the two preceding<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> now lie before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">II. FOLKWAYS\u2019 INITIAL DISQUALIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AZn\">We address initially Folkways\u2019 challenge to the Review Board\u2019s disapproval of its original ascertainment showing. The Board deemed the first of three asserted defects sufficiently severe to \u201crender[ ] [Folkways\u2019] survey fatally defective.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We sustain that ground, and thus need not consider the other deficiencies questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The critical shortcoming was Folkways\u2019 failure to assign principals, management-level employees or prospective management-level employees to conduct each of its interviews with community leaders.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Eleven of the 48 interviews were handled by two individuals employed at Folkways\u2019 AM station. The Review Board pointed out that Folkways had not demonstrated any \u201cspecific instances where either individual ha[d] participated in programming decisions,\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that Folkways\u2019 president and principal stockholder, Kenneth J. Crosth-wait, had testified that neither played any part in assembling the program proposal included in Folkways FM application.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Folkways challenges the Commission\u2019s insistence that interviewers have a role in deci-sionmaking as inconsistent with the <em>Primer </em>standard and not reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">We think the Review Board\u2019s construction of the <em>Primer </em>was substantively reasonable. The <em>Primer </em>report explains that the Commission requires as the applicant\u2019s representatives in community-leader interviews \u201cthose whose position is high enough in the organization to be an effective voice in the decisionmaking process.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Through consultation of \u201cthe principals and the management of an applicant . with community leaders\u201d it is hoped \u201cthat a dialogue [can] be established and maintained between the community and the decision-making personnel of the applicant.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, a filtering of community input through lower-level station advisors is the very technique the <em>Primer </em>was intended to short-circuit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <em>Primer\u2019s </em>reference to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201cvoice\u201d in the decisionmaking process<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 on which Folkways places much emphasis\u2014 does not compel a contrary conclusion. The operative phrase is <em>\u201ceffective </em>voice,\u201d which is fully consonant with the Review Board\u2019s interpretation that those who undertake ascertainment contacts on the applicant\u2019s behalf have authority to collaborate in deci-sionmaking in some forceful way.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">We think, too, that Folkways was fairly apprised of the governing standard. The Commission\u2019s report illuminating the <em>Primer </em>guidelines contained numerous references to \u201cdecisionmaking\u201d authority.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the Review Board\u2019s reading is in harmony with, if indeed it is not dictated by, the express purpose of the pertinent <em>Primer </em>provisions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These factors coalesce to render the standards \u201creasonably comprehensible\u201d to an applicant \u201cacting in good faith,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and no more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The Review Board\u2019s holding that Folkways had not met the requirement at issue enjoys substantial record support. Though testimony indicates that the two Folkways employees who conducted eleven of the interviews have in the past participated in pre-decision discussions concerning Folkways\u2019 AM station with Folkways\u2019 president \u2014 who reserved the final say \u2014 Folkways has pointed to no evidence tending to show that their role was more than merely advisory. As Folkways\u2019 president testified and the Review Board found, neither shared in the decisions leading to formulation of the programming proposed for the facility applied for.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These two employees thus completely lacked the \u201ceffective voice\u201d in program decisions demanded of those who conduct ascertainment interviews for the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">III. RECONSIDERATION AND REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">We find, however, that the Commission\u2019s denial of Folkways\u2019 petition for review has been seriously undercut by subsequent developments, and that a remand is necessary. Folkways attempted to obtain reconsideration by likening its case to Eastern,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in which the Commission accepted a post-decision ascertainment amendment on equitable grounds. Specifically, the applicant in <em>Eastern </em>had undergone lengthy administrative proceedings and, if successful, would have provided the second radio outlet in Harlan, Kentucky.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Folkways contended that it had been in a hearing status over two years longer than Eastern, that the defects found in its survey were less egregious than Eastern\u2019s and that it proposed to initiate the first night-time and first FM station in Harriman, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">Without addressing these circumstances, the Commission regarded Folkways\u2019 reliance on <em>Eastern </em>as misplaced for two principal reasons. The first was that the Commission had denied Folkways an administrative review without specifying reasons and that its procedural rules precluded reconsideration in such circumstances.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>second was that acceptance of Folkways\u2019 post-decision amendment would prejudice Crowder\u2019s potential <em>Ashbacker </em>rights to a full comparative hearing in the event that he prevailed on his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We think the Commission improperly invoked its procedural regulations as a basis for declining reconsideration. In <em>Eagle Broadcasting Company,</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we observed that \u201c[rjeliance by the Commission on its own rule against reconsideration would in itself be a clearly inadequate reason for the refusal to rehear.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We acknowledged no more than that \u201c[t]he rule may have some justification where the summary denial of review reflects a Commission judgment that the appeal was frivolous, and where the request for rehearing is only a rehash of the same, frivolous arguments.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Here, Folkways proffered an amended ascertainment survey, not \u201ca rehash of the same, frivolous arguments\u201d adduced when Commission review was first sought. To be sure, the Commission nonetheless could properly have snubbed a \u201cbelated attempt to repair [a] defective showing made at the hearing,\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> not involving newly discovered evidence<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> nor otherwise attended by good cause.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But the only consideration the Commission seemingly advanced as a detraction from good cause to grant Folkways\u2019 petition for reconsideration was possible prejudice to Crowder\u2019s <em>Ashbacker </em>rights<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u2014 the Commission\u2019s second ground for denying reconsideration. Thus the procedural rules bear no independent significance in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">We have difficulty, too, with the Commission\u2019s second decisional ground. Potential prejudice to a mutually exclusive applicant does not in the Commission\u2019s view warrant foreclosure of amendments \u2014 intended to prevent <em>disqualification </em>\u2014 during a hearing. The Commission has ruled that an applicant has no \u201cvested interest in the disqualification of a competing applicant . [sjince the public interest is best served by having as many qualified applicants as possible competing for each broadcast facility. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The same justification would seem to apply with equal force to post-decisional motions to amend. In any event, the Commission could have protected Crowder adequately, while enabling Folkways\u2019 beneficial participation, by accepting Folkways\u2019 amendment and deferring consideration of comparative issues<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u2014or indeed of all matters \u2014 until resolution of Crowder\u2019s appeal. The Commission has asserted no procedural interest that might legitimately have foreclosed that course.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">Even assuming that the Commission acted properly to ensure fair consideration of Crowder\u2019s competing application were he to succeed on his appeal, that ground for declining Folkways\u2019 request for reconsideration was totally removed by Crowder\u2019s withdrawal of the appeal, and the case thus seems ripe for remand to the Commission. As we declared in <em>Greater Boston Television </em>Corporation,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">[tjhis court\u2019s decisions in various cases . reflect a doctrine favoring remand, in the interest of a just result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>where there has been a change in circumstances, subsequent to administrative decision and prior to court decision, that is not merely \u201cmaterial\u201d but rises to the level of a change in \u201ccore\u201d circumstances, the kind of change that goes to the very heart of the case.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">It cannot be gainsaid that dismissal of Crowder\u2019s appeal was \u201ca change in \u2018core\u2019 circumstances\u201d underlying the Commission\u2019s refusal to reconsider. We have pointed out the Commission\u2019s error in relying upon its procedural rules as an independent basis for withholding review.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> And the Commission failed to reach Folkways\u2019 argument that the equitable grounds favoring reconsideration of its case are stronger than those in <em>Eastern.</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This is not the first time we have had to remind the Commission of the \u201cprinciple that agency action cannot stand when it is \u2018so inconsistent with its precedents as to constitute arbitrary treatment amounting to an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Though Commission counsel has undertaken to deal with the problem on appeal, we cannot rely on <em>\u201cpost hoe </em>rationalizations by counsel as the prime authority for the Commission decision.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">When the Commission was asked to seek a remand from this court, however, it insisted that the exigencies of administrative finality militated against that course, noting that it had been \u201cfour . years [since] the close of the record and issuance of the Initial Decision and one year after we denied Folkways\u2019 application for review.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Again we are unpersuaded by the Commission\u2019s reasoning. In <em>Greater Boston</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we carefully distinguished a \u201c \u2018final\u2019 administrative order \u2014 . ... an order which is no longer subject to appeal to the court, for which no administrative reconsideration is permitted by the regulatory statute\u201d \u2014 from an order still under judicial review.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> With respect to the former, we said that \u201c[t]he general interest of repose gains dominance,\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> but we admonished that \u201cprior to the effective date of a final administrative order, the interests of administrative flexibility, and securing of the right result in the particular case, have relative dominance \u2014 and they permit appellate direction for reopening of proceedings, in appropriate cases\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> even though the Commission opposes remand on finality grounds.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Here we deal with a clearly nonfinal order, and Folkways has invoked Commission precedent to buttress the claim that equitable considerations demand acceptance of. its amendment in the public interest. The sole ground possessing even colorable merit on which the Commission relied to distinguish that precedent has been eradicated by changed circumstances.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> We conclude that the policy of finality does not justify a refusal to confront squarely Folkways\u2019 assertion that acceptance of its amendment would advance the public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Moreover, we find the Commission\u2019s argument somewhat disingenuous. It attributes to Folkways delay resulting from unhurried issuance of its own decisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The Commission\u2019s position contrasts sharply, too, with its view in <em>Eastern, </em>where the fact that the applicant had undergone lengthy administrative proceedings was deemed an element equitably favoring reconsideration.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> To boot, the Commission has not articulated how the passage of time from its denial of Folkways\u2019 petition for reconsideration has made reassessment of Folkways\u2019 supporting equitable arguments inappropriate. Only finality as an abstract principle is advanced, and that, as we have indicated, has little weight during pendency of an appeal from the Commission\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">We conclude, then, that reexamination by the Commission of the applicability of its <em>Eastern </em>decision to Folkways\u2019 situation is fully merited. We cannot anticipate what result might be reached on grounds thus far unasserted. We simply hold that the issue is meet for Commission consideration. To that end, we vacate the orders appealed from and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AkP\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-13\">. <em>Folkways Broadcasting Co., </em>48 F.C.C.2d 723 (Rev.Bd.1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-14\">. <em>Folkways Broadcasting Co., </em>57 F.C.C.2d 609 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b614-15\">. \u2022 <em>Folkways Broadcasting Co., </em>61 F.C.C.2d 912 (1976).

It is necessary to vacate not only the order declining reconsideration but the other two orders appealed from as well.
