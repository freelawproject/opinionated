Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> funds the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) must apply a constitutional standard of intentional discrimination as delineated by the Supreme Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or whether the ESAA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>as supplemented by HEW regulations permits application of a disproportionate impact standard of discrimination. Appellants are respectively the Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York (the Central Board) and the Community School Board (CSB) of Community School District 11 (District 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The two school boards sued to enjoin HEW from holding them ineligible for ESAA assistance. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Jack B. Weinstein, Judge, initially upheld HEW\u2019s denial of ESAA funds. But upon the Central Board\u2019s motion for rear-gument, the district court vacated its prior decision and remanded the matter to HEW for \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to determine if the school boards\u2019 disqualification resulted from unconstitutional discrimination as well as from violations of the applicable regulations. After remand the district court affirmed HEW\u2019s conclusion that substantial evidence warranted a finding of both unconstitutional discrimination and discrimination in violation of the ESAA. Accordingly, it entered a final order granting judgment in favor of HEW. We affirm the judgment on the basis that the standards of the statute and regulation have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">I. <em>Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">On an annual basis, the ESAA provides special assistance to local educational agencies and other eligible organizations to achieve three basic statutory objectives:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">(1) to meet the special needs incident to the elimination of minority group segregation and discrimination among students and faculty in elementary and secondary schools;</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">(2) encourage the voluntary elimination, reduction, or prevention of minority group isolation in elementary and secondary schools with substantial proportions of minority group students; and</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">(3) to aid school children in overcoming the educational disadvantages of minority group isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(b). Thus, the ESAA is a program purposefully designed \u201cto aid in desegregating schools and support quality integrated schools.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Each year that an application for ESAA assistance is submitted, the application is evaluated and the eligibility of the applicant reviewed. ESAA funds are awarded to qualified applicants in the order in which their applications are ranked. The ranking depends on compliance with specified guidelines and criteria, the most important being \u201cobjective\u201d in nature. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 185.-14(a), (b) &amp; (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ESAA program is competitive in nature since the amount appropriated by Congress is less than the total amount of the grants sought; only those applications which meet ESAA objectives to the greatest extent possible are the ones which receive the awards. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 185.-14(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">In addition to filing applications which are timely<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and which meet the minimal technical/qualitative criteria, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1605(a), 1606-09;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 185.14,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the applicant must establish that it has not engaged in any of the four disqualifying acts, practices, policies or procedures condemned by the statutes and regulations. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(d)(1);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 185.13(f).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The Assistant Secretary for Education may not approve the application unless it is determined by the Secretary that the applicant is not ineligible. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(d)(4).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While the statute itself forbids discrimination in the hiring, promotion or assignment of teachers, note 8 <em>supra, </em>the pertinent regulation in this case is 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 185.43(b)(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In substance, the regulation makes ineligible for assistance an edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>cational agency which after June 23, 1972, has utilized a procedure resulting, <em>inter alia, </em>in the discriminatory \u201cassignment of full-time classroom teachers to the schools of such agency in such a manner as to identify any of such schools as intended for students of a particular race, color, or national origin.\"<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">II. <em>Underlying Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Teaching and supervisory appointments to public schools in New York City are now and have traditionally been made by the Chancellor of the Central Board. High School teachers are appointed by the Chancellor from a list of eligible candidates.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The list of eligible candidates is prepared by the Board of Examiners, which' ranks each candidate on the basis of a competitive examination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">In 1969 the New York City school system was \u201cdecentralized\u201d and thirty-two separate community school districts (CSDs) were established. Each CSD was vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>with primary authority over the operation of the elementary and junior high schools within its district.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the Chancellor alone appoints high school teachers, elementary and junior high school teachers may be appointed in either of two ways. One of these is the traditional method of assignment by the Chancellor. The community school boards must abide by the Chancellor\u2019s designation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, the Chancellor \u201cinsofar as practicable shall give effect to the requests for assignment of specific persons by the community board.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An alternative method is available for use only in those elementary and junior high schools whose students rank in the lower 45% on a comprehensive reading examination which is administered annually to students in schools within the jurisdiction of the local community districts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The community school districts may directly appoint teachers to such \u201c45% schools\u201d if the individual has passed either a qualifying examination prepared by the Board of Examiners or the National Teachers Examination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">Irrespective of how the teachers are appointed, ultimate control still remains with the Chancellor. He retains the power to rescind illegal teacher assignments and to compel a local board\u2019s compliance with all applicable provisions of law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In addition, he is vested with all powers and duties of the superintendent of schools of the city district<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which include \u201cthe power to transfer teachers from one school to another.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The ESAA applications here at issue were for grants in the 1977-78 school year. <em>See </em>note 34 <em>infra. </em>To analyze whether there was compliance with the statute and regulations, HEW used 1975-76 data. Racial and ethnic statistics<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> demonstrated that in school year 1975-76 62.6% of high school students were minority students whereas 8.2% of high school teachers were minority teachers.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Seventy per cent of minority high school teachers were assigned to high schools in which minority student enrollment exceeded 70%, even though these high schools employed only 48% of the system\u2019s high school teachers. Conversely, in high schools in which there were proportionately a low number of minority teachers, minority student enrollments were below 40%.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Similar correlations between the racial/ethnic composition of the faculty of community school districts and the racial/ethnic composition of the student bodies within those school districts exist. For the same school year, 14.3% of the teachers and 69.7% of the students in elementary schools were minority, and 16.7% of the teachers and 70.1% of the junior high school students were minority. Quite clearly, the schools with minority student enrollments over 90% identifiably had the highest percentage of minority faculty by a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>margin.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Similarly, community school districts with minority student enrollments under 50% contained a disproportionately low percentage of minority faculty.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Upon the \u201cremand\u201d to HEW, HEW found that the racial assignment of faculty in the central school district was, as HEW put it, \u201cstrikingly illustrated by the absence of minority teachers\u201d at certain academic, <em>Le., </em>nonvocational high schools. Ten of these were demonstrated to have a disproportionately low number of full-time minority teachers in the 1975-76 school year. All ten of these schools were among the thirteen academic high schools <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> with full-time faculties having a percentage of black teachers at or below two standard deviations <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which was 1.2%; the mean of <em>full-! </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>time black teachers in academic high schools systemwide was then 5.2%.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">To take another example for the same school year, 8.2% of academic high school teachers in the Central Board\u2019s employ were members of minority groups, black or Hispanic. Lafayette High School, for one, with a total of 166 teachers had only one minority teacher, even though it could have been expected based on systemwide statistics to have had fourteen minority teachers. Lafayette\u2019s proportion of minority students was 29.2%.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In contrast, for the same year Boys High School in Brooklyn had more than two and one-half times the number of full-time minority teachers than the expected rate; its student body was 99.9% minority.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">These substantial disproportions are not contested by the appellants, nor do they deny that the schools were statistically \u201cracially identifiable\u201d as a result of the significant disparities in staff assignments. The claim pressed below and on this appeal has been limited to the argument that the statute and regulation must be construed to require HEW to establish that the disparities resulted from purposeful or intentional discrimination in the constitutional sense. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">III. <em>Proceedings Before HEW and the District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Only one of the Central Board\u2019s three basic grant applications survived program merit competition and obtained a sufficient rank order standing to be considered for funding.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> On November 9, 1976, the Of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>fice for Civil Rights at HEW wrote to Chancellor Anker that it found that teachers, principals and assistant principals were assigned \u201cin a manner that has created, confirmed and reinforced the racial and/or ethnic identifiability of the system\u2019s schools . .\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> By letter dated July 1, 1977, HEW notified the Central Board and District 11 that their grant applications could not be funded because they did not establish their eligibility under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 185.-43(b)(2).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thereafter, HEW afforded an opportunity to the Central School Board and to District 11 to achieve voluntary resolution and compliance under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d \u2014 l,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.7(d).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <em>See Brown v. Weinberger, </em>417 F.Supp. 1215, 1221 (D.D.C.1976). On September 7, 1977, the Central Board and OCR entered into a Memorandum of Understanding. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Memorandum, the Central Board agreed to assign or reassign teachers to comply with federal standards by 1980. This agreement was subsequently vacated by Judge Wein-stein by order dated March 15, 1978, in a related proceeding sub judice before this court. <em>Caulfield v. Board of Education, </em>No. 78-6035 (2d Cir. filed Feb. 28, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Neither the Central Board nor District 11 contested the accuracy or the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s data and statistics but rather presented explanations to justify the disparities. Appellants contended, ultimately to no avail, that they had not intentionally discriminated. Rather, they argued that disparate assignments resulted from the state education law, from the requirements of collective bargaining agreements, and from demographic changes and other alleged \u201cneutral factors,\u201d including the wishes of black principals and the desires of individual parent-teacher associations and of the black and white communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">On September 27, 1977, the Central Board and District 11 filed a complaint in the district court. The district court reviewed the administrative record and, after a hearing, not only denied the Central Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, but granted the defendants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment affirming the denial of ESAA funds. As previously stated, however, the district court vacated its prior decision and remanded the matter to HEW for further consideration in light of constitutional criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Thereafter, HEW determined that the City School District discriminated on a racial basis in the assignment of teachers and maintained an illegally segregated system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the requirements of ESAA. It also determined that after June 23, 1972, the Central Board took no effective steps to desegregate the system. While the Central Board was given an opportunity to rebut the statistical prima facie case of discrimination, its explanations were not persuasive. HEW, therefore, held that the assignment of minority teachers could have \u201ccome about only through foreseeable acts of discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Similarly HEW determined that District 11 was ineligible for ESAA funds for having discriminated in its teacher assignments on the basis of race, color or national origin. HEW also found District ll\u2019s explanations inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Upon review of the administrative record and the submissions by the Central Board and District 11 and after argument, the district court affirmed the findings and conclusions of HEW as supported by substantial evidence and entered its order granting judgment from which these appeals are taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">IV. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">A. <em>Constitutional Standard versus Impact Standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">The principal argument raised by appellants is that in evaluating the distribution of teachers throughout the New York City schools HEW should have employed the constitutional test of intentional discrimination. <em>See </em>note 2 &amp; accompanying text <em>supra. </em>To find a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the constitutional standard requires a showing not only of disparate impact, but also of illicit motive. <em>See </em>Eisenberg, <em>Disproportionate Impact and Illicit Motive: Theories of Constitutional Adjudication, </em>52 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 36, 39 (1977)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">While appellants argue that HEW\u2019s decision to deny ESAA funds relies solely on statistical evidence of disparate impact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>contrary to Supreme Court cases construing the Fourteenth Amendment, we need not reach the question whether the evidence supports a finding of purposive segregative intent. Because we are dealing with an act of Congress, as amplified by HEW regulations, and not with a judicial determination whether certain acts have produced a Fourteenth Amendment violation, it is permissible for Congress to establish a higher standard, more protective of minority rights, than constitutional m\u00ednimums require.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> For example, Title VII cases have not required proof of discriminatory motive, at least where the employer is unable to demonstrate that requirements causing a disparate impact are sufficiently related to the job. <em>See International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 335-36 n.15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977); <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 432, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-06, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Here, Congress intended to permit grant disqualification not only for purposeful discrimination but also for discrimination evidenced simply by an unjustified disparity in staff assignments. This conclusion seems clear from the statute which expressly requires that all ESAA \u201cguidelines and criteria ... be applied uniformly . . . without regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>origin or cause of such segregation.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(a). Moreover, the ESAA proscription against employment discrimination forbids discriminatory acts and practices which violate statutory civil rights provisions such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> It is significant that Title VI findings of discrimination may be predicated on disparate impact without proof of unlawful intent. <em>See Lau v. Nichols, </em>414 U.S. 563, 568, 94 S.Ct. 786, 789, 31 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) (\u201c[discrimination is barred which has [disparate] <em>effect </em>even though no purposeful design is present . . . .\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Wade v. Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service, </em>528 F.2d 508, 516-17 (5th Cir. 1976) (\u201cstatistical evidence alone may enable . . . plaintiffs to satisfy their initial burden of showing discrimination\u201d); <em>cf. Griggs </em>v. <em>Duke Power Co., supra, </em>401 U.S. at 432, 91 S.Ct. 849 (Title VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">To effectuate the disparate impact test mandated by the ESAA, HEW regulations condition eligibility for ESAA funds upon teacher assignment patterns which do not identify schools \u201cas intended for students of a particular race or national origin.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 185.43(b)(2); <em>see ante </em>at p. 4522. The regulation appears consistent with the statutory purposes of ESAA and must be approved by the court if it is \u201creasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Mourning </em>v. <em>Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 369, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 1661, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973) (quoting <em>Thorpe v. Housing Authority, </em>393 U.S. 268, 280-81, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">B. <em>Application of Disparate Impact Standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">HEW\u2019s decision that teacher assignment disparities warranted a denial of ESAA funds was not arbitrary or capricious. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 415-17, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). Even if the appropriate standard of review were the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, the Secretary\u2019s denial must be affirmed since the data which we have reviewed above clearly support HEW\u2019s determination. It, therefore, follows a fortiori that the evidence precludes a finding of arbitrariness or caprice.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">In disregarding \u201cthe origin or cause of segregation,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(a), HEW determined that the Central Board failed to present a sufficient justification for the racial disparities in teacher and staff assignments. The proffered justifications for the substantial disparities in the predominantly ten nonminority academic high schools included (1) restrictions on the transfer of teachers written into the collective bargaining agreement, (2) the desirability of teaching assignments in those schools, (3) the unwillingness of many nonminority teachers to teach in predominantly minority schools and (4) the unequal distribution of licenses in specific areas. None of these explanations is adequate to justify the racial disparities in staff assignments. The unequal distribution of licenses resulted from the very examinations which OCR previously determined had produced a racially significant disparate impact. <em>See </em>note 14 <em>supra. </em>Leaving aside whether the remaining justifications are sufficient as a matter of law, they have not been supported by adduced facts appearing on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">In sum, our holding rests on both a con-gressionally mandated disparate impact test and nonarbitrary administrative findings of discrimination. <em>See Regents of the University of California v. </em>Bakke,-U.S.-, -, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (Powell, J.); <em>id. </em>at- &amp; n.42, 98 S.Ct. 2756 (Brennan, J.). Thus, the extent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>injury has been defined and the consequent remedy, here the denial of funds, specified. <em>See International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 347-48, 371-72, 97 S.Ct. 1843; <em>United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v.

The district court\u2019s remand to HEW was, therefore, erroneous, though immaterial here.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The judgment is affirmed, although on grounds different from those expressed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-11\">. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-12\">. <em>Dayton Bd. of Educ. v.

Funds granted under the ESAA are apportioned on a numerical basis, on \u201cthe relative number of minority group children enrolled in the elementary and secondary schools of each State . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2601. An important congressional objective, incorporated in the statute itself, is \u201cthe elimination of minority group isolation to the maximum extent possible\u201d in all the schools of a given district, <em>id., </em>thereby seeking with federal funding to carry out the longstanding commands of <em>Brown v. Board of Educ., </em>347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other tangible factors may be equal, deprives minority children of equal educational opportunities).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The House-Senate Conference Committee reported:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\"><em>Purpose. </em>\u2014 The House amendment stated the purpose of the title as providing <em>financial assistance to meet the special needs incident to desegregation </em>and <em>to encourage voluntary integration. </em>The Senate amendment stated the purpose as encouraging comprehensive planning for the elimination of minority group isolation, as providing financial assistance to establish stable, quality, integrated schools, as assisting in eliminating minority group isolation, and as aiding schoolchildren in overcoming the educational disadvantages of minority group isolation. The conference substitute retains the House provision with the one addition of the Senate reference <em>to aiding schoolchildren in overcoming the educational disadvantages of minority group isolation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\"><em>Policy with respect to the application of certain provisions of federal law. </em>\u2014 The House amendment stated the policy of the United States that guidelines and criteria established pursuant to this title <em>shall be applied uniformly in all regions of the United States </em>in dealing with conditions of segregation by race in the schools of the local educational agencies of any State without regard to the origin or cause of such segregation. The Senate amendment stated the policy of the United States that guidelines and criteria established pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, section 182 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1966, and this title <em>shall be applied uniformly in all regions of the United States </em>in dealing with conditions of segregation by race <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>whether de jure or de facto </em>in the schools of the local educational agencies of any State without regard to the origin or cause of such segregation. The conference substitute retains both the Senate and House provisions but deletes the reference in the Senate amendment to this title. The conference substitute\u2019s version of the Senate provision, therefore, restates the policy contained in section 2(a) of Public Law 91-230 and in no way supercedes [sic] subsection (b) of such section.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Conf.Rep.

Thus, superimposed upon the underlying purposes of the ESAA is a requirement of uniform application throughout the country, irrespective of the origin or cause of segregation.

In <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 496-97 &amp; n. 17, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977), a grand jury discrimination case, the Court adopted a statistical methodology used in the social sciences for the prediction of fluctuations from an expected value, known as the standard deviation, defined for the binomial distribution as the square root of the product of the total number in the sample (n) times the probability of selecting a minority (p) times the probability of selecting a non-minority (q), thus V npq. To express the standard deviation in proportionate terms, the formula is -&lt;/ E9- . The statistical approach was also utilized by the Court in a school segregation case, <em>Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, </em>433 U.S. 299, 308-09 &amp; n.14, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 2742, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977):</p>\n<p id=\"b646-91\">A precise method of measuring the significance of such statistical disparities was explained in <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 496-497, n.17, [97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498]. It involves calculation of the \u201cstandard deviation\u201d as a measure of predicted fluctuations from the expected value of a sample. Using the 5.7% figure as the basis for calculating the expected value, the expected number of Negroes on the Hazelwood teaching staff would be roughly 63 in 1972-1973 and 70 in 1973-1974. The observed number in those years was 16 and 22, respectively. The difference between the observed and expected values was more than six standard deviations in 1972-1973 and more than five standard deviations in 1973-1974. The Court in <em>Castaneda </em>noted that \u201c[a]s a general rule for such large samples, if the difference between the expected value and the observed number is greater than two or three standard deviations,\u201d then the hypothesis that teachers were hired without regard to race would be suspect. 430 U.S., at 497 n.17 [97 S.Ct. 1272],</p>\n<p id=\"b646-92\"><em>See id. </em>at 311-12 n.17, 97 S.Ct. 1272. In this case the standard deviation is 1.94% above or below 5.1%, or p, since the average size of academic high school faculties is 128 teachers, and 94.9% is the non-black force of teachers at those schools. The square root of a/ is 1.94%. Thus, in reference to the schools listed in note 28 <em>supra, </em>all have a standard deviation of two or more: 5.1% (minority teachers in all academic high schools) minus 1.94% (one deviation), 1.94% (a second deviation) = 1.2%. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the same calculations are made for the schools referred to in note 28 <em>supra </em>with respect to minorities in the teaching population system-wide (8.2%), the difference between the expected percentage of minority teachers to the actual percentage is of course higher. In the case of Lafayette, it would exceed three standard deviations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\">.</p>\n<p id=\"AX8\">\n<img class=\"footnote\" height=\"750\"

At least four schools within District 11 were racially identifiable. In two schools with less than 40% minority students, there were 3.4% minority teachers in one and none in the second. In two schools with minority student concentrations over 92%, there were 29.8% and 24.1% minority teachers. Data for 1977-78 reveal both a slight improvement and a substantial regression. While HEW removed one school from its unsatisfactory list, the other three remained racially identifiable and three additional schools were deemed in violation of ESAA criteria.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b647-86\">. The Central Board and various community school districts in the city filed a total of 32 applications for basic grounds, pilot project grants and bilingual project grants under the ESAA. Of the 32, 20 ultimately demonstrated sufficient program merit to warrant approval in competition with other applications; 3 were above minimum program quality, but were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>successful in competing with other applicants; and 9 applications were not minimally acceptable. The 20 applications that warranted approval initially could not be funded because all New York City applicants were disqualified under \u00a7 1605(d) of the Act. However, all applicants except the Central Board and CSDs 10 and 11 were able to establish their eligibility with the assistance and advice of the Office for Civil Rights either by providing additional material at show cause meetings pursuant to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 185.46(a)(2) or by taking corrective action and filing successful applications for waivers of ineligibility. The federal defendants were thus able to provide $13,509,079 in ESAA grants to eligible New York City community school districts for the 1977-78 school year. The basic grant total awarded New York City applicants comprises approximately 65% of the basic grants awarded to New York State.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The three New York City applicants unable to establish their eligibility did not take the necessary corrective action to obtain waivers of ineligibility. CSD 10 did not sue to challenge the denial of its ESAA application, but CSD 11 ($298,891) and the Central Board ($3,559,132) did sue. Thus the only plaintiffs in this action which have not received funds for which they applied are the Central Board and CSD 11.

By letter dated January 18, 1977, to Chancellor Anker OCR concluded that the Central Board had unlawfully failed to make available equal educational services to minority children. These preliminary findings were revised by a letter dated October 4, 1977, and became the subject of formal administrative adjudicatory hearings in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-l and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.8. The October 4, 1977, OCR letter stated, among other things, that students were being assigned in racially identifiable or isolated instructional settings in violation of Title VI. While this finding would also constitute a ground for ineligibility under ESAA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(d)( 1 )(C)-(D); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 185.43(c)-(d), the Central Board and HEW have settled their differences and entered into a Letter of Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\">.

Alternatively this case may be analyzed as an exercise of congressional spending power. Congress has not prohibited discrimination in schools generally under its Fourteenth Amendment Section 5 powers, but has simply attached strings on grants of federal funds. See <em>Lau </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>414 U.S. 563, 569, 94 S.Ct. 786, 789, 31 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cSimple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">(Quoting Senator Humphrey.) But \u201csimple justice\u201d aside, an exercise of the congressional spending power, here in aid of the Fourteenth Amendment, is afforded considerable latitude, <em>see Oklahoma v. United States Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>330 U.S. 127, 67 S.Ct. 544, 91 L.Ed. 794 (1947); <em>Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, </em>301 U.S. 548, 57 S.Ct. 883, 81 L.Ed. 1279 (1937), provided that Congress has not imposed unconstitutional conditions on the recipients of its appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The doctrine of \u201cunconstitutional conditions\u201d is not applicable in the present context. That doctrine provides that \u201cgovernment may not condition the receipt of its benefits upon the nonassertion of constitutional rights even if receipt of such benefits is in all other respects a \u2018mere privilege.\u2019 \u201d L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 10-8, at 510 (1978); <em>see Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) (state may not deny unemployment benefits to persons unwilling to work on Saturdays for religious reasons). No such condition appears here, unless it is the non-assertion of the \u201cright\u201d to have \u201cdisparate impact\u201d alone not trigger fund-grant denial. But in the exercise of its spending power Congress may be more protective of given minorities than the Equal Protection Clause itself requires, although the point at which given non-minorities or their members are themselves unconstitutionally prejudiced remains in doubt even after <em>Bakke. </em>Still, in the alleviation of discrimination, the effect of congressional findings is not insubstantial. <em>E. g., Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, </em>- U.S. -,---, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (Powell, J.); id. at---, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (Brennan, J.); <em>United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, </em>430 U.S. 144, 97 S.Ct. 996, 51 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b650-15\">. <em>See Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, supra, </em>- U.S. at -, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2758 n.44 (Powell, J.). In considering the opinion of Justices Brennan, White, Marshall and Blackmun, <em>id. </em>at-, 98 S.Ct. 2733, Mr. Justice Powell suggests that the other Justices are wrong \u201cwhen they suggest that \u2018disparate impact\u2019 alone is sufficient to establish\u201d a Title VII violation. <em>Id. </em>at-, 98 S.Ct. at 2758 n.44. But Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion appears to us to have a slightly different nuance from what Justice Powell attributes to it. Justice Brennan states that the Supreme Court\u2019s Title VII cases have sustained a statutory violation \u201ceven without a requirement of findings of intentional racial discrimination by those required or authorized to accord preferential treatment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at-, 98 S.Ct. at 2787, and \u201chave held under Title VII that where employment requirements have a disproportionate impact upon racial minorities they constitute a statutory violation, even in the absence of discriminatory intent, unless the employer is able to demonstrate that the requirements are sufficiently related to the needs of the job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 98 S.Ct. at 2780 (footnote omitted). The debate, then, would seem to turn on whether in all cases where the employment requirements are insufficiently related to the job there is necessarily discriminatory intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">.
