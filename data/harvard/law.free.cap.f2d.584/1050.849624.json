The Attorney General shall cause to be dismissed with . prejudice to the government all pending indictments for violations of the Military Selective Service Act alleged to have occurred between August 4,1964 and March 28,1973 with the exception of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">(a) Those cases alleging acts of force or violence deemed to be so serious by the Attorney General as to warrant continued prosecution; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">(b) Those cases alleging acts in violation of the Military Selective Service Act by agents, employees or officers of the Selective Service System arising out of such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">2. The Attorney General shall terminate all investigations now pending and shall not initiate further investigations alleging violations of the Military Selective Service Act between August 4, 1964 and March 28,1973, with the exception of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">(a) Those cases involving allegations of force or violence deemed to be so serious by the Attorney General as to warrant continued investigation, or possible prosecution; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-13\">(b) Those cases alleging acts in violation of the Military Selective Service Act by agents, employees or officers of the Selective Service System arising out of such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-14\">3. Any person who is or may be precluded from reentering the United States under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(22) or under any other law, by reason of having committed or apparently committed any violation of the Military Selective Service Act shall be permitted as any other alien to reenter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-18\">The Attorney General is directed to exercise his discretion under 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5) or other applicable law to permit the reentry of such persons under the same terms and conditions as any other alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-19\">This shall not include anyone who falls into the exceptions of paragraphs 1(a) and (b) and 2(a) and (b) above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-20\">4. Any individual offered conditional clemency or granted a pardon or other clemency under Executive Order 11803 or Presidential Proclamation 4313, dated September 16, 1974, shall receive the full measure of relief afforded by this program if they are otherwise qualified under the terms of this Executive Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-21\">/s/ Jimmy Carter</p>\n<p id=\"aby-dedup-0\">THE WHITE HOUSE, January 21, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-23\">Appellants, who describe themselves as twelve retired military officers and enlisted men, one active duty military officer, one civilian former prisoner of war, the minor child of a prisoner of war who died in captivity, one civilian, wives of two of the military appellants, and two members of the United States House of Representatives,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> filed this action against the President and the Attorney General seeking a declaratory judgment and injunction restraining the operation of the Presidential Proclamation and the Executive Order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although appellants challenge the Presidential Proclamation and Executive Order on multiple grounds, their principal contention is that the President exceeded the limits of his constitutional pardon power,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and usurped the power of Congress,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by directing the Attorney General to violate 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 (1976), which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>(a) the following classes of aliens . . . shall be excluded from admission into the United States:</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">(22) Aliens who are ineligible to citizenship, except aliens seeking to enter as nonimmigrants; or persons who have departed from or who have remained outside the United States to avoid or evade training or service in the armed forces in time of war or a period declared by the President to be a national emergency, except aliens who were at the time of such departure nonimmigrant aliens and who seek to reenter the United States as nonimmigrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Appellants contend that the unlawful entry into the United States of persons who remained outside or left this country to avoid military service necessarily results in a dilution of their right to vote.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the district court, appellants averred that 198 persons had entered the United States in violation of section 1182(a)(22),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but at oral argument, counsel for appellants suggested that the number of such persons entering this country may be in the thousands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">Appellants contended in the district court that persons who left or remained outside of the United States to avoid military service lost their citizenship by operation of law, and that the President unlawfully restored political rights to such persons.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, appellees argued that appellants apparently relied upon a provision, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(10) (1970),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that has been repealed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See </em>National Emergencies Act, Pub.L.No. 94-412, \u00a7 501(a)(1) &amp; (2), 90 Stat. 1255, 1258 (1976).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-18\">Appellants apparently do not now rely on their original assertion that persons who left or remained outside the United States to avoid military service became aliens by operation of law. Instead, they contend that the Presidential Proclamation and Executive Order restore full political rights, including voting rights to such persons, and that such persons are ineligible for restoration of such rights under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(22).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-19\">Appellants additionally allege that the Executive Order accomplished either an unlawful delegation of the pardon power to the Attorney General, or a suspension of provisions of the Military Selective Service Act, codified in scattered sections of titles 10, 37, and 50 App. of the <em>United States Code </em>(1976, 1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975), in cases involving force and violence that the Attorney General deems not serious.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> They contend that the Attorney General is violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5) (1976), by failing to impose conditions of parole on persons entering the United States under provisions of the Presidential Proclamation and Execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>tive Order.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Appellants also contend that the Proclamation and Executive Order are void because they invidiously discriminate among classes of potential recipients of the pardon.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Appellants sought a declaration that the Presidential Proclamation and Executive Order are void on the foregoing grounds, as well as a broad declaration that \u201c[t]he Congress alone has the power to declare the manner of acquiring, losing or reacquiring citizenship; . . . [e]xcept as to recipients of [the] Presidential Pardon, the penal provisions of the United States Code, wherever codified, are and remain in full force and effect; and . . . [t]he President has absolute pardon power over every offense against the United States excepting only impeachment.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Appellants asked the district court to enjoin the Attorney General \u201cfrom giving effect to so much of the Executive Order of January 21,1977 as suspends the effect of the Military Selective Service Act . . . and the effect of the Aliens and Nationality Act.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the alternative, appellants asked the court to order the Attorney General to conduct a hearing with respect to each person claiming eligibility for the pardon to determine whether the pardon applies to him and whether it restores to him full political rights.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">In reviewing the dismissal of appellants\u2019 complaint for lack of standing, we accept the material allegations of the complaint as true and construe those allegations in appellants\u2019 favor. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343, (1975).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Appellants have alleged three possible bases for standing: (1) as eligible voters, they are injured by the dilution of their votes necessarily resulting from the alleged unlawful entry of persons into the United States and restoration of full political rights to such persons; (2) as Congressmen, two appellants are injured by the President\u2019s usurpation of their lawmaking power; (3) as citizens, appellants are injured by the Attorney General\u2019s failure to enforce the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-19\">Appellants allege that their voting rights are diluted by the unlawful entry into the United States of persons excluded from entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(22) and the resulting exercise of full political rights by such persons.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Appellants recognize that the actual number of such persons is unknown but allege that the number may be in the thousands. <em>See </em>text <em>supra </em>at pp. ---of 190 U.S.App.D.C., pp. 1053-1054 of 584 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-22\">Appellants predicate their standing to sue squarely on <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In that landmark decision, the Supreme Court held that qualified voters of various Tennessee counties had standing to attack on allegedly unconstitutional statewide apportionment scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 204-08, 82 S.Ct. 691. The Court ruled that the plaintiffs in <em>Baker </em>stated \u201c \u2018a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 208, 82 S.Ct. 691, 705 (quoting <em>Coleman v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 433, 438, 59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>S.Ct. 972, 83 L.Ed. 1385 (1939)), by alleging that the apportionment scheme \u201cdisfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside, placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>voters in irrationally favored counties.\u201d 369 U.S. at 207-08, 82 S.Ct. at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">In <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. 208, 223 n.13, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 2933, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974), the Supreme Court again recognized that \u201ca concrete injury to fundamental voting rights\u201d can satisfy the injury in fact requirement for standing. In more recent years, a number of cases have assumed that an alleged dilution of voting rights may be sufficient injury to confer standing. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, </em>430 U.S. 144, 152-53, 97 S.Ct. 996, 51 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977) (principal opinion) (White, J.); <em>Creel v. Freeman, </em>531 F.2d 286, 286-89 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1066, 97 S.Ct. 797, 50 L.Ed.2d 784 (1977); <em>Locklear v. North Carolina State Board of Elections, </em>514 F.2d 1152, 1152-56 (4th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">However, in our opinion, <em>Baker v. Carr </em>does not make every alleged dilution of voting rights a sufficient injury to confer standing. In each case, \u201c[t]he determination [of] injury must necessarily proceed on an <em>ad hoc </em>scrutiny of the facts.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Bush, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. 45, 61, 553 F.2d 190, 206 (1977). Our examination of the allegations in this case convinces us that appellants have not stated an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d the first and foremost element of standing in federal court. <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 152, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970); <em>see Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. 208 at 218, 227 n.16, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706; <em>American Society of Travel Agents v. Blumenthal, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 566 F.2d 145, 148 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 947, 98 S.Ct. 1533, 55 L.Ed.2d 546 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">Appellants reside in various localities across the United States.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> They do not contend that their- votes are diluted in any particular election or in any particular geographical area, nor do they contend that they are an identifiable group of voters whose votes are disfavored <em>vis-a-vis </em>those of some other group.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> At best, the complaint can be read to claim that as qualified voters of political subdivisions anywhere in the United States, appellants\u2019 votes in elections for any office, whether national, state, or local, are being diluted as a result of the reentry into the United States of an admittedly unknown, relatively small number of persons who allegedly should be excluded, and who therefore should not be entitled to vote. We believe that appellants have failed to allege injury sufficient for standing in federal court because they have not presented a \u201cdiscrete factual context\u201d within which \u201cconcrete injury\u201d occurred. <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. at 220-22, 94 S.Ct. 2925. Moreover, the dilution of voting rights they have alleged is so diffuse, minute, and indeterminable that we must conclude the injury asserted is \u201ctoo speculative to support standing under the circumstances presented here.\u201d <em>American Society of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number><em>Travel Agents v. Blumenthal, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 285, 566 F.2d at 149; <em>see Massachusetts v. Mellon, </em>262 U.S. 447, 486-87, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">One of the purposes of requiring concrete injury in a discrete factual context is to ensure that broad constitutional adjudication such as that requested in this case \u201cdoes not take place unnecessarily.\u201d <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. at 221, 94 S.Ct. 2925. The appellants in this case have not alleged \u201csuch a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\u201d <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. at 204, 82 S.Ct. at 703, as would justify exercise of the court\u2019s remedial powers on their behalf. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 498-99, 95 S.Ct. 2197.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Two appellants, George Hansen, a United States Congressman from Idaho, and Lawrence McDonald, a United States Congressman from Georgia, base their standing to sue on the alleged \u201cusurpation of the legislative power conferred upon them and their fellow legislators by the Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This usurpation, appellants contend, consists of the de facto repeal of acts of Congress that results from the failure of the executive branch to enforce the laws.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Although appellants presented a slightly broader claim to the district court,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> they now limit their challenge to the failure of the Attorney General to enforce provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, codified in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1503 and scattered sections of titles 18, 22, 31, 49, and 50 App. of the <em>United States Code </em>(1976, 1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">Although injuries suffered by legislators may be different from those of other litigants, the manner of analyzing such injuries for standing purposes is the same. <em>Harrington v. Bush, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. at 59, 553 F.2d at 204. Thus we must determine whether the two congressional appellants have asserted a judicially cognizable injury in fact. <em>Id. </em>at 205-06. In <em>Harrington, </em>this court held that post-enactment impropriety in the administration of laws does not usurp the lawmaking power of an individual Congressman, and that an allegation of \u201cpost-enactment illegality\u201d does not state an injury in fact to an individual Congressman\u2019s law-making function. 553 F.2d at 213; accord, <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>National Petroleum Council, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. 31, 40, 553 F.2d 176, 185 (1977). Unlike the Congressman in <em>Harrington, </em>appellants do not contend that they actually voted for the legislation that is the subject of this suit. <em>See </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. at 58-59, 553 F.2d at 203-04. Their argument at best, can be read to allege either that through nonenforcement, the President has usurped their power to enact repealing legislation, or that as Congressmen, they have a unique interest in ensuring that congressional enactments are enforced. Both of these contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">The failure or refusal of the executive branch to execute accomplished legislation does not affect the legal status of such legislation; nor does it invade, usurp, or infringe upon a Congressman\u2019s power to make law. <em>See Harrington v. Bush, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. at 67-68, 553 F.2d at 212-13. Once a bill becomes law, a Congressman\u2019s interest in its enforcement is shared by, and indistinguishable from, that of any other member of the public. <em>Harrington v. Schlesinger, </em>528 F.2d 455, 459 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>accord, Harrington v. Bush, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. at 68, 553 F.2d at 213. Thus, in this case, the injury suffered by the congressional appellants is in no way unique to their status as legislators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>As we discuss in the following section, this generalized interest of all citizens in proper administration of the law lacks the specificity essential for standing.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">Appellants contend that the Attorney General has abdicated his responsibility to enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act, and has thereby violated their right to have the laws enforced.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> However, appellants\u2019 asserted interest in the proper administration of the laws is a generalized one shared by all other citizens. Such abstract injury is insufficient for standing. <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Reservists Committee to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. at 217, 219-21, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">In <em>Reservists, </em>the Supreme Court held that standing to sue may not be predicated upon an interest that is held in common by all members of the public, such as is present in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 226-27, 94 S.Ct. 2925. Although the proper administration of the laws serves the interests of all, \u201c[t]he proposition that all [laws] are enforceable by any citizen simply because citizens are the ultimate beneficiaries . . . has no boundaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 94 S.Ct. at 2935. In the absence of concrete injury to appellants resulting from the refusal of the executive branch to carry out provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, appellants lack standing.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">Because none of appellants alleged injury in fact, the district court properly dismissed the complaint for lack of standing to sue.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1114-22\">.

R.E. 7, at 2 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1116-16\">. The repealed section had provided explicitly for loss of nationality by any national of the United States who departed from or remained outside of this country during war or presiden- ' tially declared national emergency for the purpose of avoiding military service. Congress\u2019 repeal followed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that the section was unconstitutional. <em>Kennedy v.

In <em>Kennedy, </em>the Supreme Court held that the automatic deprivation of citizenship as a penalty for leaving or staying outside the country to avoid military service was unconstitutional because it did not afford the procedural safeguards guaranteed by the fifth and sixth amendments. 372 U.S. at 165-66, 83 S.Ct. 554.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1116-21\">.

Appellees contend that the interpretation given 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(22) (1976) by appellants would render it unconstitutional, and suggested in their brief and at oral argument that this court need not accept the correctness of appellants\u2019 interpretation in ruling upon their standing to sue. We do not consider the constitutionality of the statute under appellants\u2019 interpretation because the question of standing is preliminary to questions going to the merits of the controversy. <em>Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v.

Although the potential existence of an alternative course of action does not affect standing, we note that the congressional appellants may have a remedy in the legislative process.
