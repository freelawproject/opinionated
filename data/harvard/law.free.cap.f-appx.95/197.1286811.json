After finding that Robinson had three prior violent felony convictions, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), imposing a term of imprisonment greater than the statutory maximum allowed for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Robinson appeals, arguing that the ACCA does not apply because one of the convictions considered by the district court was actually a juvenile adjudication. He contends therefore that the sentence imposed by the district court violates due process. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, </em>120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt). Whether a juvenile adjudication qualifies as a prior conviction under <em>Apprendi </em>is a question that we answered in the affirmative in <em>United States v. Smalley, </em>294 F.3d 1030 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1114, 123 S.Ct. 870, 154 L.Ed.2d 790 (2003) (holding that a juvenile adjudication is a prior conviction for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes). Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-18\">. The Honorable Joan N.
