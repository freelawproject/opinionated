We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations, and will reverse the BIA\u2019s decision only \u201cif the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Melendez-Mozo contends that the IJ denied her due process by failing to give her advanced notice that she would be questioned about her date of entry into the United States at a status hearing that had been scheduled to address issues related to good moral character.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">This contention fails because the IJ acted within his authority by questioning the petitioner. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l) (authorizing IJ to \u201cadminister oaths, receive evidence, and interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses[ ]\u201d). Moreover, Melendez-Mozo has not shown that the proceedings were so fundamentally unfair that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case. <em>Cf Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that failure to allow the petitioner to present oral testimony constitutes a denial of right to due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">We do not consider the exhibits attached to Melendez-Mozo\u2019s supplemental record because they were not part of the administrative record. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 964 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">Because petitioner does not challenge the BIA\u2019s vacatur of the IJ\u2019s grant of voluntary departure, that issue is waived. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (concluding that petitioner waived an issue by failing <em>to </em>address it in the opening brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
