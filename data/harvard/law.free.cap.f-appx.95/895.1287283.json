R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b927-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">Otali Rodriguez-Horta challenges his sentence for violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">Rodriguez-Horta claims that the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence by 16 levels under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) violated equal protection. His argument depends on the premise that a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as used in USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), must also be an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). We rejected this premise in <em>United States v. Pimentel-Flores, </em>339 F.3d 959 (9th Cir.2003). <em>Pimentelr-Flores </em>held that \u201ca \u2018crime of violence\u2019 need[s] only to be a \u2018felony' as defined in the application notes \u2014 and not an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 as statutorily defined \u2014 to qualify for a 16-level enhancement\u201d pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>Id. </em>at 963. As \u201c[njothing in this definition requires that the prior offense have received a sentence in excess of a year or, for that matter, any custody term at all,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 964, it does not matter to Rodriguez-Horta\u2019s eligibility for the enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) whether he received a sentence of imprisonment for his prior offense, assault with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-23\">Rodriguez-Horta\u2019s equal protection claim is grounded on the assertion that \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) irrationally discriminates between defendants in states where probation requires a suspended sentence and defendants in states with no such requirement. As the sentencing enhancement would be the same under <em>Pimentel-Flores </em>had there been no suspended sentence, the equal protection claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b927-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
