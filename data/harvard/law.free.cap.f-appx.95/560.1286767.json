He argues that the district court erred by denying application of an adjustment for acceptance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. This court \u201cwill affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotations marks and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Hollander\u2019s contention that the Government\u2019s evidence produced at sentencing was incredible lacks merit. As there was an evidentiary foundation for the district court\u2019s denial of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
