Flores argues that the IJ failed to view Flores\u2019s rape in El Salvador as an act of persecution. She also argues that her attorney did not receive a copy of the motion to reinstate the deportation proceedings, which had been administratively closed, and that the failure to mail her attorney a copy of the motion constituted a due process violation. We construe the respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance as its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">The IJ\u2019s denial of Flores\u2019s application for asylum and for withholding of deportation was based upon a determination that Flores was not a credible witness. We will not disturb the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Flores did not raise in the proceedings before the BIA the issue of failure to be forwarded a copy of the motion to reinstate. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We will not address this issue, which Flores raises for the first time in her petition for review. <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 389-91 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-26\">The respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance and other motions are DENIED. Flores\u2019s motion to vacate the BIA decision and remand the case for additional proceedings is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED. MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b97-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
