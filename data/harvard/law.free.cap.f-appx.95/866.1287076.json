Birdwell contends that the California court violated his Due Process rights under the Fifth Amendment by excluding, on hearsay grounds, testimony about recent acts of abuse by Birdwell\u2019s stepfather toward his mother and sister. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, they are not recited here except as necessary to explain our analysis. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-18\">Denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition is reviewed de novo. <em>Killian v. Poole, </em>282 F.3d 1204, 1207 (9th Cir.2002). Birdwell\u2019s petition was filed after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996); consequently, the standards of review outlined in the AEDPA amendments to \u00a7 2254 apply. Under those amendments, a petitioner must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-19\">With regard to the question at issue in this appeal, the California Court of Appeal based its decision on <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), which held that constitutional errors do not require automatic reversal of a conviction if the reviewing court determines that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We must first review that harmless error analysis because it was on that ground that the state court decided the relevant portion of Birdwell\u2019s appeal. <em>See Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (holding that \u201cthe only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>question that matters\u201d under \u00a7 2254 is whether the state court decision \u201cis contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In choosing to apply <em>Chapman, </em>the California Court of Appeal selected the correct legal rule. However, a state court decision may still be an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established Supreme Court precedent where the decision \u201ccorrectly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 407-08, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The state court application of the governing legal rule must be \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d and not merely erroneous to merit habeas relief. <em>Andrade, </em>538 U.S. at 75, 123 S.Ct. 1166. Therefore, the question before us is whether the state court was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d in its determination that, beyond a reasonable doubt, any error in excluding the testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In this case, the harmless error evaluation turns on whether the excluded evidence was merely cumulative. <em>See Del. v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (holding that courts should consider the importance of evidence, its cumulative nature, presence or absence of corroboration or contradiction, extent of cross-examination, and strength of the prosecution\u2019s case in evaluating whether the exclusion of such evidence was harmless error). As far as the evidence may have tended to establish that the victim was a violent man, the evidence was most certainly cumulative. The more difficult question is whether the evidence was cumulative as support for Birdwell\u2019s claim that he committed the murder in the heat of passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">On the topic of \u201cSudden Quarrel or Heat of Passion and Provocation Explained,\u201d CALJIC 8.42 (4th ed. Supp.1987), in effect at the time of trial, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-8\">If there was provocation, but ... sufficient time elapsed between the provocation and the fatal blow for passion to subside and reason to return, and if an unlawful killing of a human being followed such provocation and had all the elements of murder ... the mere fact of ... remote provocation will not reduce the offense to manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Most of the victim\u2019s acts of violence about which Birdwell testified at trial had happened several years before the killing, and the jury undoubtably found that a sufficient cooling period had taken place with respect to those acts. In contrast, the conversation in which Birdwell learned of the victim\u2019s more recent abuse of Bird-well\u2019s mother and sister took place only five days before the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Birdwell points to <em>People v. Borchers, </em>50 Cal.2d 321, 325 P.2d 97 (1958), and <em>People v. Berry, </em>18 Cal.3d 509, 134 Cal.Rptr. 415, 556 P.2d 777 (1976), in an attempt to establish that a jury could have found that his passion had not cooled over the course of five days and consequently could have found him guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. At best, however, these cases establish that, as a matter of California law, five days is not too long of a period for a person to maintain a state of \u201cpassion\u201d sufficient for a finding of manslaughter. <em>Borchers </em>and <em>Berry </em>do not demonstrate that there is any real likelihood that the jury in Birdwell\u2019s case might have found that he was in such a sustained state at the time he killed his victim. The bare fact that five days passed between the provocation and the killing would be too much for most jurors. Additionally, there was some evidence at trial suggesting that Birdwell had in fact cooled off.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Because it is unlikely that the jury would have found that Birdwell was still in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>a heat of passion resulting from what he learned in the conversation with his mother five days before the killing, evidence of the substance of that conversation would have been cumulative despite the fact that it was so much more recent than any other evidence of the victim\u2019s violent acts. The California Court of Appeal was not objectively unreasonable when it held that exclusion of that evidence was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Birdwell\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
