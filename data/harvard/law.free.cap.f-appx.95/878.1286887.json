Both documentary evidence and the testimony of multiple experts, however, supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Cappa\u2019s alleged depressive disorder and pulmonary impairment failed, singly or in combination, to meet or equal a listed impairment under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpart (P), App. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Cappa also claims error in the ALJ\u2019s ruling that she was not an essential witness and that her hearing improperly proceeded in her absence. The ALJ found that Cappa was a non-essential witness because this hearing was held for the limited purpose of supplementing the record with additional expert testimony and medical evidence following a remand by the Appeals Council. Cappa had previously testified before the ALJ. She was not essential to this hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
