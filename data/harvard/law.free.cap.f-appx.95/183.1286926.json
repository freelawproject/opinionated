See \u00a7 4.102 of the Rules of the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision. Missouri informed Illinois that Mudloffs sentence does not end \u2014 and thus his parole supervision must continue \u2014 until July 14, 2004. Mudloff disagrees with that calculation of his release date and has elected to challenge it by seeking a writ of habeas corpus directed to Illinois officials. It is far from clear that the right respondent is one from Illinois rather than Missouri, the jurisdiction that has imposed the contested custody. Compare <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court, </em>410 U.S. 484, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973), with <em>al-Marri v. Rumsfeld, </em>360 F.3d 707 (7th Cir.2004). Mudloff does not contend that Illinois has imposed unjustified restrictions; instead his challenge concerns a subject that is within the control of Missouri. But it is unnecessary to pursue this issue, because there is an antecedent obstacle: appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The district court dismissed Mudloffs petition without prejudice because he had not exhausted his judicial remedies in Missouri. He appealed, and the clerk\u2019s office told Mudloff that he did not need a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). The appeal has been briefed without one. The advice, based on <em>Walker v. O'Brien, </em>216 F.3d 626 (7th Cir.2000), was erroneous. <em>Walker </em>holds that a certificate of appealability is unnecessary when a prisoner challenges the revocation of good-time credits because that administrative decision does not concern the validity or effect of the conviction. But see <em>Moffat v. Broyles, </em>288 F.3d 978 (7th Cir.2002). Someone who disputes the terminal date of the sentence, however, has called into question \u201cdetention [that] arises out of process issued by a State court\u201d, see \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), and therefore needs a certificate. Section 2253(c) creates a jurisdictional rule. See <em>United States v. Cepero, </em>224 F.3d 256 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc). Although we have disagreed with <em>Cepero </em>to the extent it holds that satisfying the substantive requirements of \u00a7 2253(c)(2) also is jurisdictional, see <em>Buie v. McAdory, </em>322 F.3d 980 (7th Cir.2003), we have never doubted that, when \u00a7 2253(c)(1) applies, there must be a certificate as a condition to appellate review. The topic therefore is one we must raise on our own, even though the parties have ignored the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Mudloff is not eligible for a certificate, which \u201cmay issue ... only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Whether particular remedies exist, and have been exhausted, is not a constitutional question. Substantial statutory issues may be appended to substantial constitutional ones, see <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), so we have treated Mudloffs appellate brief as an implied request for a certificate. Although he contends that the due process clause entitles him to an earlier end date, that claim is not substantial. Missouri\u2019s parole officials gave him an extra 14 months of good-time credit, precipitating his release. How good-time credits are applied\u2014 whether they speed the end of the sentence, as Mudloff believes, or just authorize earlier conditional release from an unchanged term \u2014 is a statutory rather than a constitutional matter. States could adopt either approach without violating any provision of the Constitution. Thus the standards of \u00a7 2253(c)(2) have not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Mudloff is not entitled to a certificate of appealability, so this appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
