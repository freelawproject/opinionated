In her complaint, she alleged that the New York City Transit Authority (\u201cNYCTA\u201d), which employed her as a train operator, \u201cha[d] implemented a custom, policy and practice of removing pregnant train operators from active work shortly after learning that the individual is pregnant and despite the fact that the pregnant individual is not disabled, all of which is done because such train operators are pregnant. Similarly situated non-pregnant train operators are permitted to continue working.\u201d [Complaint 115] The complaint alleges that this amounts to discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The parties eventually negotiated a settlement pursuant to which NYCTA would pay Ms. Rodriguez-Freytes back pay in the amount of $16,518.60, and damages for emotional distress in the amount of $25,000.00, for a total of $41,518.60. Judge Gleeson subsequently issued a \u201cSettlement and Order of Dismissal,\u201d which acknowledged the settlement agreement and dismissed the action subject to Ms. Rodriguez-Freytas\u2019s reservation of the right to apply for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Ms. Rodriguez-Freytes subsequently moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). In a Report and Recommendation, dated September 14, 2001, Magistrate Judge Azrack found that an award in the amount of $14,712.50 was appropriate. This figure was approved by Judge Gleeson in an Order, dated October 15, 2001 (\u201cthe October 15th Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Numerous federal statutes, including \u00a7 1988 and \u00a7 2000e-5(k), allow courts to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d In <em>Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), which was decided shortly before the October 15th Order was issued, the Supreme Court considered whether what is commonly known as \u201cthe catalyst theory\u201d may serve as a basis for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to these statutes. The catalyst theory asserts that a plaintiff may be considered a prevailing party in a case in which the defendant\u2019s voluntary action moots the lawsuit by providing the relief sought by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">The Supreme Court held that the catalyst theory may not serve as a basis of an award of attorney\u2019s fees because the phrase \u201cprevailing party\u201d does not \u201cauthorize[] federal courts to award attorney\u2019s fees to a plaintiff who, by simply filing a nonfrivolous but nonetheless potentially meritless lawsuit,\u201d achieves a desired result \u201cwithout obtaining any judicial relief.\u201d 532 U.S. at 606. Judicial relief is relief that amounts to a \u201cjudicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. Thus, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>lacks the necessary judicial <em>imprimatur </em>on the change.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">In <em>Buckhannon, </em>the voluntary action which mooted the lawsuit was the defendant State\u2019s unilateral decision to repeal the regulations being challenged in the suit. <em>Buckhannon, </em>however, has been read by our Circuit to be applicable to situations in which a lawsuit is mooted by bilateral voluntary action, such as the conclusion of a settlement agreement among the parties which disposes of all issues raised by the suit. Thus, <em>Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 200, 206 (2d Cir.2003), involved a situation in which the parties \u201cjointly reported [to the court] that they had \u2018settled all of the substantive issues in the case.\u2019 \u201d We held that even though the plaintiff \u201cmay have accomplished the objective it sought to achieve by initiating\u201d the lawsuit, \u201cits failure to secure either a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree renders it ineligible for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under <em>Buckhannon.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The instant case was also settled by an agreement negotiated by the parties. Although Ms. Rodriguez-Freytas received a monetary award pursuant to that settlement, it is uncontested that, as in <em>Needle-trades, </em>\u201c[t]he district court never granted [her] any relief on the merits,\u201d nor did \u201cthe district court order a consent decree or endorse, or retain jurisdiction over, [the] settlement agreement.\u201d 336 F.3d at 206. According to <em>Buckhannon, </em>she cannot be considered a prevailing party, and is therefore not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">We therefore vacate the October 15th Order. We are, however, sensitive to the fact that the settlement agreement in this case was negotiated <em>pre-Buckhannon, </em>when it would have been reasonable for Ms. Rodriguez-Freytas to believe that she was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. In the interests of fairness, we therefore remand this action to the district court with instructions that it afford the parties an opportunity to re-negotiate the settlement agreement in the form of a consent decree over which the district court would retain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcement. Should either of the parties decline this opportunity, Ms. RodriguezFreytas should be given the option to either: (1) cancel the settlement agreement and proceed toward an adjudication on the merits or (2) confirm the settlement agreement and forgo the attorney\u2019s fees awarded to her by the October 15th Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
