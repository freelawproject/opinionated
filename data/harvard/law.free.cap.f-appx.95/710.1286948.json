Where an applicant does not show past persecution and does not demonstrate that a national government is the persecutor, the applicant bears the burden of showing that the \u201cpersecution is not geographically limited in such a way that relocation within the applicant\u2019s country of origin would be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir.2001). Because Mengjesi failed to establish past persecution and did not demonstrate that the government was the persecutor, the IJ was not required to shift the burden to the INS. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-23\">Mengjesi next argues that she was denied due process when the IJ disallowed expert testimony because the expert\u2019s curriculum vitae and published articles were not provided to the Government and the court prior to the hearing. Mengjesi failed to make an initial showing of substantial prejudice to support her due pro-</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>cess claim. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Mengjesi argues for the first time in this court that the IJ erred by not applying a mixed motives analysis to her asylum claim. This court will not review claims Mengjesi first raises in her brief, as she has not exhausted her administrative remedies as to those claims. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir. 2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Although Mengjesi also requested withholding of deportation and protection under the Convention Against Torture, she does not raise these issues in her brief and they are deemed abandoned. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b742-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under file limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
