Where, as here, \u201cthe BIA adopts an IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion as if it were the opinion of the BIA.\u201d <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1999). The IJ held that Catabay did not show that she entered her marriage to a United States citizen in good faith. Catabay (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) challenges this determination on factual and constitutional grounds. Because the facts are known to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Catabay challenges the denial of the discretionary waiver. We review the denial for abuse of discretion. <em>Nyonzele v. INS, </em>83 F.3d 975, 979 (8th Cir.1996); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4) (1994). The factual findings underlying the IJ\u2019s decision are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). To overcome this deference, Petitioner must demonstrate that the evidence in the record is so compelling \u201cthat a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude\u201d in Petitioner\u2019s favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Petitioner does not meet this burden because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that there was no good faith intent to enter the marriage. The IJ had reason to doubt the credibility of Catabay because of testimonial inconsistencies, including where Catabay\u2019s ex-husband Leonardo lived before Petitioner moved to the United States, where Leonardo lived while Petitioner was at the Oreas address, whether Leonardo ever lived with Petitioner at the address on 51st Avenue, and whether Leonardo had been employed when Petitioner moved to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Moreover, the IJ found it inconsistent for Petitioner to have a joint checking account with Leonardo through February 1998 if, as she claimed, Leonardo was irresponsible with her money and gambled the money away. Petitioner\u2019s explanation that she was hoping for a reconciliation in early 1998 was contradicted by her testimony that there was no hope of reconciliation in 1997. Further, Petitioner did not seek to include Leonardo on her health insurance, nor marked that she was married on her tax forms. These facts constitute substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s adverse determination on the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">Petitioner next argues that the IJ violated her due process rights by being predisposed to rule against her, as evidenced by aggressive questioning by the IJ. Reviewing this issue de novo,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we recognize that Catabay has a right to due process in her removal proceedings, <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 693, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), and this includes her entitlement to a fair hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ing and the opportunity to present evidence before an impartial IJ. <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Catabay claims that the IJ had a \u201cclear predisposition\u201d against her, as demonstrated by the IJ\u2019s questions and comments on Petitioner\u2019s evidence, and the IJ\u2019s factual conclusions. The asserted facts do not show bias or prejudice. Although the IJ did not sit as a mute factfinder, he was not required to do so. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l) (\u201cThe immigration judge shall administer oaths, receive evidence, and interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses\u201d). An IJ need not examine a witness with kid gloves; aggressive questioning does not rise to a due process violation. <em>Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1072 (9th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Antonio-Cruz v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1129, 1131 (9th Cir.1998) (rejecting a due process claim when the IJ had conducted the \u201clion\u2019s share of cross-examination\u201d in a \u201charsh manner and tone.\u201d)). Indeed, the IJ asked questions that allowed Petitioner to reduce the inconsistencies in her testimony, or to clarify answers. Moreover, in other instances, the IJ was commenting on the evidence as he heard it, implying that he was weighing the evidence, rather than articulating a pre-hearing bias. Finally, far from showing prejudice, the IJ\u2019s questions alerted Petitioner to what the IJ was thinking and what further evidence Petitioner might offer to allay the IJ\u2019s concerns. In short, we conclude that there was no bias of or prejudging by the IJ in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The Petition for Review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\">. We review the due process claim de novo. <em>Sanchez-Cruz </em>v. <em>INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001).
