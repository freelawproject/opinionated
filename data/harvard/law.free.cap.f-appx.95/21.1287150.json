Keselica appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaints. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Keselica v. Moose, </em>No. CA-03-2703-1-AMD; <em>Keselica v. Gansler, </em>No. CA-03-2704-AMD (D.Md. Oct. 6, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
