Flanagan asserts that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his complaint without allowing him to conduct discovery. Flanagan reiterates his contention that Assistant Attorneys General Jeremy T. Hackman and S. Michael Bozarth perpetrated a fraud against the district court and this court by filing responses in the proceedings conducted on Flanagan\u2019s federal habeas petition although they had not taken and filed anti-bribery statements and oaths of office as required by the Texas Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A of Flanagan\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Flanagan has not established that Hack-man and Bozarth were required to take and file the oaths at issue. Flanagan has not challenged the district court\u2019s conclusion that the lack of proof of the filing of the oaths at issue falls short of establishing that Hackman and Bozarth did not take the required oaths. Flanagan\u2019s failure to identify error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if he had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Furthermore, a violation of state law, standing alone, does not establish a violation of federal constitutional law. <em>Giovanni v. Lynn, </em>48 F.3d 908, 912-13 (5th Cir. 1995). Flanagan has not explained how the conduct of which he complains entitled him to relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Flanagan\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Flanagan\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Previously, Flanagan accumulated a strike in <em>Flanagan v. Nacogdoches County Jail, </em>No. 97-41082, 1998 WL 526884 (5th Cir. Jul.29, 1998). <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387. Flanagan thus has accumulated at least three strikes and is subject to the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Accordingly, Flanagan may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
