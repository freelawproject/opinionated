On appeal, Galindo, who was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and eight years of supervised release, argues that the district court erred by admitting evidence of prior bad acts as character evidence which was prohibited by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM Galindo\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Galindo was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana after a jury trial. The conspiracy involved a shipment of marijuana from Texas via Roadway Express, a commercial freight company. Texas Border Patrol agents intercepted this shipment bound for Detroit, Michigan. They also identified and intercepted four additional packages from the same source \u2014 also containing marijuana\u2014 that were being shipped to Cicero, Illinois, near Chicago. Law enforcement agents arranged for controlled deliveries of these packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">Co-conspirator Gavin Gardner arranged with Roadway Express to pick up the Detroit-bound package in Toledo rather than in Detroit. Gardner and co-conspirators Hector Vellejo, Arturo Vallejo, and Ernesto Rodriguez \u2014 all of whom had been involved in the pick-up of the four Cicero-bound packages at the Chicago Roadway Express location \u2014 drove to Toledo in a green Chrysler automobile. Galindo and Ernesto Denis-Zuira, driving a pick-up truck, met the four co-conspirators at a gas station in Ohio. Gardner then drove the pick-up truck to the Toledo Roadway Express office and picked up the package. The pick-up truck (driven by Gardner), the Chrysler (containing a driver and two passengers), and a 1991 beige Mercury Marquis registered to Galindo (with three occupants) met in a Sears Department Store parking lot in Lincoln Park, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">At that point, Gardner, Deni-Zuira, and Hector Vallejo delivered the package to a house on Second Street in Ecorse, Michigan \u2014 the residence of Lauro Ordonez, who likewise was charged as a co-conspirator. They then returned to Sears, where Galindo and the other three individuals had remained. Galindo then drove Arturo Vallejo and Rodriguez to Galindo\u2019s friend and co-worker Justin Adkins\u2019s house in the Chrysler. Galindo asked Justin Adkins if his companions could drink some beer and smoke marijuana with Justin and his twin brother Jason. After visiting for between twenty minutes and an hour, Galindo and his two companions left the Adkins brothers\u2019 house, at which time they were arrested. The other conspirators had been arrested in the Sears parking lot. Various items of evidence not directly relevant to this appeal were seized on the persons of the co-conspirators and in the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Galindo\u2019s defense at trial was innocent presence. He argued that he had no idea that the truck he transported to Toledo was going to be used to transport 740 pounds of marijuana to the Detroit area.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Galindo complains that the district court allowed the Government to use impermissible character evidence when it allowed Justin and Jason Adkins to testify regarding prior bad acts. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Galindo does not specify which portions of the testimony were objectionable. At issue, it appears, is the testimony that Galindo had sold or given both Justin and Jason small quantities of marijuana on numerous occasions. The remainder of the testimony given by the two brothers either was not related to prior bad acts or was directly related to the charged conduct (i.e., testimony that Galindo and his companion had been traveling to Texas and Ohio and testimony regarding a proposed sale of marijuana by Galindo to Jason Adkins from the shipment). We review the district court\u2019s decision to admit the testimony for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>345 F.3d 928, 936 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The Government argues that the evidence of previous transactions is not 404(b) character evidence but \u201cbackground\u201d evidence. We have recognized the admissibility of \u201cbackground\u201d or <em>\u201cres gestae\u201d </em>evidence, but have said that \u201cthe \u2018background circumstances exception\u2019 to the general exclusion of other act evidence is not an open ended basis to admit any and all other act evidence the proponent wishes to introduce.\u201d <em>United States v. Hardy, </em>228 F.3d 745, 748 (6th Cir.2000). \u201c[Bjackground or <em>res gestae </em>evidence consists of those other acts that are inextricably intertwined with the charged offense or those acts, the telling of which is necessary to complete the story of the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cProper background evidence has a causal, temporal or spatial connection with the charged offense. Typically, such evidence is a prelude to the charged offense, is directly probative of the charged offense, arises from the same events as the charged offense, forms an integral part of a witness\u2019s testimony, or completes the story of the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is not enough for the Government to use the words of our previous opinions \u2014 \u201cprelude to the charged offense,\u201d \u201cdid not arise in a vacuum,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t spring out of dry water,\u201d \u201ccompletes the story of the crime\u201d \u2014 the Government must be able to articulate why they apply to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The Government\u2019s more general argument \u2014 that the small-time marijuana dealing in which Galindo engaged is itself intrinsic to the charged shipment and delivery of the large crate of marijuana \u2014 is easily rejected. The fact that Galindo was a small-time drug dealer to the Adkins brothers is simply not background context for the shipment and delivery of the marijuana in the charged offense: it does not show anything about the history and development of the conspiracy to smuggle the shipment, nor does it demonstrate how the conspiracy arose (i.e., that it did not arise \u201cout of a vacuum\u201d). The Government has offered no argument why we should consider this small-time drug dealing part of the \u201csame series of transactions\u201d as the shipment of a large quantity of marijuana across state lines. The Government refers to the drug dealing as \u201ca prelude to the charged offense\u201d but does not explain why that is so. If it is \u201ca prelude\u201d because small time dealers are, on average, more likely to get involved in larger drug smuggling, then that is exactly the type of propensity argument that F.R.E. 404 forbids. (\u201cA pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>lude\u201d is, for example, a robbery of a gun for use in the charged crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Thus, if the Government succeeds, it must succeed on the two more specific arguments that it makes. First, it argues that the testimony provides a \u201cbackground\u201d to the charged conduct because it demonstrates a previous connection between Galindo and the house to which the charged shipment of marijuana was delivered. Second, it argues that it explains why Galindo would feel comfortable going to the Adkins brothers\u2019 residence and discussing the marijuana shipment with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The Government\u2019s argument that the testimony demonstrates a previous connection between Galindo and the house to which the charged shipment of marijuana was delivered \u2014 although not made to the district court \u2014 is meritorious, at least as to Jason Adkins\u2019s testimony. Jason tied Galindo to the house on Second Street in Ecorse. He testified that when he wanted to buy marijuana from Galindo, Galindo would sometimes go to the house on Second Street. (J.A. 421). Jason also testified that \u201cLauro\u201d lived at the house. (J.A. 420-21). The house on Second Street was the location to which the co-conspirators ultimately delivered the crate of marijuana that was being carried on the truck that Galindo transported to Ohio. Thus, Jason Adkins\u2019s testimony is arguably \u201cbackground\u201d to the conspiracy in that it is evidence of a previous drug connection between Galindo and co-conspirator Lauro Ordonez and the house on Second Street. Justin Adkins\u2019s testimony includes no such connection, and his testimony recounted more drug transactions and in more detail than Jason\u2019s. (The connection between Galindo and the Second Street house also forms the basis of the Government\u2019s \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d argument. Since we conclude that this testimony was likely admissible as background evidence, and in any case, harmless error, we do not address the absence of mistake argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The Government\u2019s second argument is that the evidence of the prior small-scale marijuana dealing is \u201cbackground\u201d because it explains why Galindo was \u201ccomfortable\u201d going to the Adkins brothers with his two co-conspirators is not meritorious. The Government fails to assert why whether Galindo was \u201ccomfortable\u201d going to the Adkins brothers is background to the charged conduct. At best, it would be relevant because it slightly increases the probability the Adkins brothers were telling the truth when they testified that Galindo made various statements to them about the shipment because it does give a reason why Galindo would be even more comfortable talking to them about it (in addition to the fact the Justin was his friend and co-worker). However, this is not \u201cbackground\u201d to the charged offense, but merely background explanation of a relationship between Galindo and the witnesses that makes it more likely that Galindo would actually make the statements that the witnesses claim he made about the charged conduct. Thus it does not fall within the category of \u201cbackground\u201d or <em>\u201cres gestae\u201d </em>evidence described in <em>Hardy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Regardless, however, the admission of Justin Adkins testimony was harmless error. First, there was significant admissible testimony by the Adkins brothers \u2014 not relating to the prior drug dealing \u2014 that suggests that Galindo was aware of the contents of the package he helped pick up and deliver. Further, this admissible testimony included testimony that Galindo was prepared to sell drugs from this shipment to the Adkins brothers. Thus the fact that Galindo would sell drugs to the Adkins brothers was already properly before the jury</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Second, the jury would have known from Jason Adkins\u2019s testimony \u2014 tying Galindo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>to the Second Street house \u2014 that Jason had bought marijuana from Galindo on other occasions, as well. Given that the jury already had this information before it, a few further instances of small-scale drug sales between Galindo and his friend and co-worker Justin Adkins, although not helpful to Galindo, adds little in the way of additional prejudice. Further, the district court limited the prejudice by instructing the jury that Galindo was on trial only for the crimes charged in the indictment. To the extent that any of the testimony about specific instances of prior drug transactions was improperly admitted, such admission was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">For the reasons above, we AFFIRM Galindo\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
