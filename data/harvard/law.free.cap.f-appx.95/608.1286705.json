Wilson was found guilty following a bench trial of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). He argues that the district court\u2019s original order suppressing evidence of the firearms was correct and should be reinstated. Wilson concedes that his argument is foreclosed under the law of the case doctrine by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>306 F.3d 231, 237 (5th Cir.2002) (holding that the evidence was admissible and vaeating district court\u2019s order suppressing the evidence). He raises the claim solely to preserve the issue for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-23\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief. In its motion, the Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The unopposed motion is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-24\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
