Manriquez now appeals his conviction and sentence. He argues that the statutes of conviction, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, are facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Manriquez acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000), and he raises the issue only to preserve it for review in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\"><em>Slaughter </em>applies by analogy to the instant case because the statutes at issue are similar in structure and content. One panel of this court may not overrule another. <em>United States v. Fowler, </em>216 F.3d 459, 460 (5th Cir.2000). Consequently, Manriquez\u2019s arguments are, as he concedes, foreclosed by <em>Slaughter. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
