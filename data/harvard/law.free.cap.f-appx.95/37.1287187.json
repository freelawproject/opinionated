He ultimately received nine death sentences. We affirmed. <em>See United States v. Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281 (4th Cir.2003). In this appeal, Higgs challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial and new sentencing hearing based upon the government\u2019s failure to disclose favorable evidence in contravention of the rule announced in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">The facts and evidence pertaining to the triple murders in this case are fully set forth in our prior opinion. Thus, we summarize only those facts most pertinent to Higgs\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">On the evening of January 26, 1996, Dustin John Higgs, Willis Mark Haynes, and Victor Gloria traveled to Washington, D.C., and picked up Tanji Jackson, Tamika Black, and Mishann Chinn. Higgs knew Jackson, and they had arranged dates for Haynes and Gloria with Black and Chinn. The six returned to Higgs\u2019s apartment in Laurel, Maryland, to drink alcohol and listen to music. In the early morning hours of January 27, Higgs and Jackson began to argue violently, culminating in Jackson retrieving a knife from Higgs\u2019s kitchen. Gloria and Chinn were in the living room with Higgs and Jackson at the time. Haynes and Black were in the bedroom. Upon hearing the commotion, Haynes came out from the bedroom and broke up the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">Despite the early morning hour, the three women abruptly left Higgs\u2019s apartment on foot. As they were leaving, Jackson \u201cstopped at the door and said something like I am going to get you all f \u2014 ked up or robbed\u201d or made \u201csome kind of threat.\u201d J.A. 473. Higgs commented to Haynes and Gloria that Jackson \u201cdo know a lot of n-s.\u201d J.A. 474. Higgs, who was watching from inside the apartment, saw Jackson stop and appear to write down the license plate number of his Maz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>da van, and Higgs commented to Haynes and Gloria that Jackson was \u201cwriting down [his] sh \u2014 J.A. 474. Higgs then \u201csaid f \u2014 k that, and grabbed his coat and said come on.\u201d J.A. 474. As he was leaving, Higgs retrieved his .38 caliber firearm from the end table drawer and put it in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The three men got into Higgs\u2019s vehicle and Higgs drove to where the women were walking. At Higgs\u2019s direction, Haynes talked the women into getting in the van. Higgs then began driving away from the apartment complex. While en route, Gloria observed Higgs and Haynes, who were sitting in the front seat, leaning towards one another and whispering, but he could not hear what the two were saying. Instead of taking the most direct route to Washington, D.C., Higgs drove into the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and pulled over at a secluded location. When one of the women asked if they were trying to \u201cmake [them] walk from [t]here,\u201d Higgs responded, \u201csomething like that.\u201d J.A. 482. The women then got out of the van. Higgs handed his .38 caliber pistol to Haynes, who put it behind his back and also exited the vehicle. Within moments, Haynes shot and killed all three women.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Shortly after the killings, the bodies of the three women were discovered strewn about the roadway by a passing motorist. Law enforcement officers found Jackson\u2019s day planner at the scene. In it, Jackson had recorded Higgs\u2019s nickname (\u201cBones\u201d) and telephone numbers. The notation \u201c13801 \u2018MAZDA\u2019 769GRY\u201d \u2014 Higgs\u2019s address number and the tag number for his Mazda vehicle \u2014 had also been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">After the men left the crime scene, they stopped at a nearby river where they disposed of the gun. They then returned to Higgs\u2019s apartment, which they cleaned of any trace of the women\u2019s presence that evening, and dropped the trash by a dumpster. Higgs and Haynes then dropped Gloria off at a fast food restaurant, where he was told by Higgs to \u201ckeep [his] mouth shut.\u201d J.A. 489. Ultimately, Gloria did not abide by Higgs\u2019s order. In the fall of 1998, after he was arrested on federal drug charges, Gloria cooperated with the government in its drug distribution and murder investigations of Haynes and Higgs, ultimately providing eyewitness testimony regarding the murders and the events surrounding the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">On October 5, 1998, Haynes was arrested on a federal complaint for distribution of cocaine base. While in custody, Haynes gave several oral and written statements which largely corroborated Gloria\u2019s version of the events that evening. Haynes also admitted that he was the triggerman, but claimed that he shot the women because he was afraid of Higgs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>In December 1998, Higgs and Haynes were jointly indicted for first degree murder, kidnapping, and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, in connection with the abduction and murders of the three young women. The cases were severed for trial. Haynes\u2019s trial began in August 2000. He was convicted of the charges, but the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to the imposition of the sentence of death. Consequently, the court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. We affirmed his convictions and sentences on appeal. <em>See United States v. Haynes, </em>26 Fed. Appx. 123, 2001 WL 1459702 (4th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 979, 122 S.Ct. 1455, 152 L.Ed.2d 396 (2002). Higgs\u2019s trial began in September 2000. He was also convicted of the charges. However, at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of his trial, the jury imposed nine death sentences. His convictions and sentences were also affirmed on appeal. <em>See Higgs, </em>353 F.3d at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In the course of preparing his appeal to this court, Higgs\u2019s counsel reviewed the district court record from Haynes\u2019s trial and discovered that the government had identified two witnesses who had been incarcerated with Haynes at the Charles County Detention Center. Both witnesses professed to have had conversations with Haynes about the triple murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The first inmate, Gerald Vaughn, was called to testify at Haynes\u2019s trial. Vaughn testified that, shortly after Haynes\u2019s arrest in the fall of 1998, Haynes told Vaughn that he and his \u201ccousin\u201d were partners in drug dealing and that the women were murdered because one of them was holding \u201ca quarter of a million dollars\u201d of their drug money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> S.J.A 144. Haynes also told Vaughn that he tricked the women into getting into Higgs\u2019s van that evening and that Haynes used a .38 caliber weapon to kill them. <em>See Haynes, </em>26 Fed. Appx. at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The second inmate was Kevin Anderson. Although the government attorneys submitted under seal a copy of notes taken by them during an interview with Anderson in May 2000, as well as an outline prepared by the prosecutors in anticipation of questioning Anderson at Haynes\u2019s trial, Anderson was never called to testify during Haynes\u2019s trial and it appears that no further effort was made by Haynes\u2019s counsel to obtain copies of those notes or a <em>Brady </em>ruling regarding them. According to the notes, Anderson told the prosecutors that, while he and Haynes were incarcerated together, he witnessed a confrontation between Haynes and another inmate over the use of a telephone. In response to the inmate\u2019s comment that \u201cyou think [you\u2019re] big stuff because you killed [three] women,\u201d Haynes replied that \u201cI\u2019ll kill whoever the f\u2014 I want to kill.\u201d Supp.J.A.1. 124. Anderson also said that Haynes later told him that \u201cone of the girls may have set him up\u201d and he \u201chad to kill her.\u201d Supp.J.A.1.125.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Upon learning of these statements, Higgs moved for a new trial and new sentencing hearing pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Higgs asserted that the government\u2019s failure to identify Anderson as a potential witness and to provide Higgs with a copy of the Anderson interview notes violated his due process rights because Anderson\u2019s testimony would have been persuasive evidence that Haynes had his own motive for killing the women and was \u201cequally culpable\u201d with Higgs for the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The district court denied the motion, finding that Anderson\u2019s statements would have been neither exculpatory nor of impeachment value in the guilt phase of Higgs\u2019s trial. With regard to the sentencing phase of Higgs\u2019s trial, the district court found no reasonable probability that a juror would have found that Haynes was \u201cequally culpable\u201d with Higgs and that this mitigating factor, combined with the others, outweighed the aggravating factors so as to result in the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment instead of death. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Stokes, </em>261 F.3d 496, 502 (4th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 990, 122 S.Ct. 1546, 152 L.Ed.2d 471 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>the Supreme Court held that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose favorable evidence to an accused \u201cviolates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. In order to establish that the government\u2019s failure to turn over evidence constitutes a <em>Brady </em>violation, the defendant must demonstrate (1) that the undisclosed evidence was favorable, either because it was exculpatory or impeaching; (2) that the prosecution had the materials and failed to disclose them, either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) that the evidence was material to the defense. <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 280-81, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999); <em>Moore v. Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 794-95, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 33 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972). Evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d for purposes of the <em>Brady </em>inquiry \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). A \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, although \u201cthe term <em>\u2018Brady </em>violation\u2019 is sometimes used to refer to any breach of the broad obligation to disclose exculpatory [or impeachment] evidence\u2014 that is, to any suppression of so-called <em>\u2018Brady </em>material\u2019 \u2014 ... strictly speaking, there is never a real <em>\u2018Brady </em>violation\u2019 unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.\u201d <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 281, 119 S.Ct. 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">We begin with Higgs\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a new trial as to his guilt on the kidnapping, murder, and related charges. Like the district court, we have little difficulty rejecting this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">First, Haynes\u2019s statement that \u201cI\u2019ll kill whoever the f\u2014 I want to kill,\u201d made in the heat of a confrontation with another inmate, provides no information as to any specific motive on the part of Haynes in the murders and no information at all regarding Higgs\u2019s involvement in the mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ders. Haynes\u2019s later statement that \u201cone of the girls may have set him up\u201d and he \u201chad to kill her\u201d also does not serve to exculpate Higgs from involvement in the crime. The statements to Anderson do not indicate that Haynes acted alone or that Higgs was not involved. At most, it might be viewed as evidence that Haynes and Higgs had a joint motive to kill the women, but even that premise is not inconsistent with the theory that Higgs was involved in deciding to kill the women and carrying out that decision, perhaps to retaliate against Jackson for an earlier action or the threat she made \u201cto get you <em>all </em>f \u2014 ked up or robbed.\u201d J.A. 473 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Despite Higgs\u2019s claims to the contrary, Haynes\u2019s statement also had no impeachment value during the testimony of Victor Gloria or Ednisia Darby. With regard to Gloria, Haynes\u2019s statement to Anderson cannot be characterized as impeachment evidence because it does not contradict Gloria\u2019s account of the events that evening. Indeed, Higgs does not contend that it has direct impeachment value, asserting instead that it would only have allowed him to cast a \u201cdifferent light\u201d upon Gloria\u2019s testimony by arguing that the whispered conversation between Haynes and Higgs in the front seat of the van was Haynes telling Higgs that Haynes intended to kill the women instead of Higgs directing Haynes to kill them. With regard to Darby, the statement also carried no impeachment value. Darby testified that Higgs admitted to her that he was involved in the murders and that Jackson was \u201csnitching\u201d on someone. Supp.J.A.I. 293. Again, Higgs\u2019s statement to Darby is not contradicted by Haynes\u2019s statement to Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Finally, even if we were to assume that Higgs could have introduced Haynes\u2019s statements to Anderson and used them in some favorable way during the guilt phase of his trial, Higgs has not established a due process violation because he cannot establish the materiality component of the <em>Brady </em>inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">According to the uncontroverted evidence, Higgs and Jackson got into a heated argument that evening, which Haynes broke up. As he watched the women leave, Higgs believed Jackson was writing down his vehicle information. He retrieved the murder weapon, and told the other two men to come with him. After the men enticed the women to enter Higgs\u2019s van (most likely under the pretense of taking them home), Higgs drove the group into the deserted Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge where he gave the murder weapon to Haynes. Although primarily related by Gloria\u2019s eyewitness testimony, the events that evening and Higgs\u2019s involvement in them are corroborated in a number of ways. Jackson\u2019s day planner, which was found at the murder scene, contained Higgs\u2019s name and telephone numbers, as well as a notation of his address and vehicle license tag number. The next evening, before the names of the victims were released, Higgs commented in response to a television account of the murders that he knew \u201cthat Tanji girl.\u201d J.A. 672. Darby testified that Higgs confessed his involvement in the murders to her, told her that the women were killed because Jackson was \u201csnitching\u201d on one of them, and told her that the other two were \u201cjust for his friends.\u201d Supp.J.A.I. 293.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">In sum, the evidence of Higgs\u2019s guilt in the kidnappings and murders was overwhelming, and the evidence is not contradicted by Haynes\u2019s statement to Anderson. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>We are satisfied that there is no reasonable probability that the jury would not have convicted Higgs of the kidnappings and murders had they been aware of the undisclosed statements made by Haynes to Anderson. Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly denied Higgs\u2019s motion for a new trial on the issue of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Higgs next asserts that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because Haynes\u2019s statement to Anderson would have given him an additional basis upon which to argue that Haynes was \u201cequally culpable\u201d with Higgs in the kidnappings and murders, but only received a sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3592(a)(4) (West 2000) (providing, as a statutory mitigating factor, that \u201c[ajnother defendant or defendants, equally culpable in the crime, will not be punished by death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">During the sentencing phase of Higgs\u2019s trial, the jury found that the government had proven a total of six aggravating factors: (1) that the deaths occurred during the commission of another crime (kidnapping); (2) that Higgs had a previous conviction of a violent felony involving a firearm; (3) that Higgs had a previous conviction for a serious federal drug offense; (4) that the crimes for which he was on trial involved multiple killings in a single criminal episode; (5) victim impact; and (6) obstruction of justice. Some members of the jury also found the existence of three mitigating factors: (1) that Higgs was not the sole proximate cause of the victims\u2019 deaths (12 jurors); (2) that Higgs was impaired by alcohol and marijuana at the time of the murders (2 jurors); and (3) that a sentence of death would have an adverse impact on Higgs\u2019s minor son (4 jurors). Although submitted as an additional mitigating factor for consideration, no juror found the existence of the \u201cequally culpable\u201d mitigator. After weighing the aggravating factors against any mitigating factors individually found to exist, the jury unanimously found that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and imposed a sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Higgs contends that Haynes\u2019s statements to Anderson that \u201cone of the girls may have set him up\u201d and that he \u201chad to Mil her\u201d were of exculpatory value for purposes of the mitigation case and that, had the jurors known about them, it is reasonably probable that at least one juror would have voted against imposition of the penalty of death. We disagree. Even if we assume that the statements were favorable to Higgs for purposes of the mitigation case, Higgs has not demonstrated the requisite materiality to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">In order to establish the materiality of Haynes\u2019s statements to Anderson, Higgs was required to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the disclosure of the statements would have produced a different outcome in Higgs\u2019s sentencing hearing. In this case, the six aggravating factors found by the jury were largely undisputed as a factual matter and wholly unaffected by Haynes\u2019s alleged statements to Anderson. The statements also have no bearing upon any mitigating factor submitted to the jury, with the single exception of the \u201cequally culpable\u201d factor. Thus, to establish materiality, Higgs was required to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the evidence would have persuaded a juror to reach the conclusion that Haynes was \u201cequally culpable\u201d to Higgs in the murders, <em>and </em>that this mitigating factor, combined with the others, would have tipped the balance and led the juror to also conclude that the mitigating factors outweighed the aggravating factors so as to foreclose the sentence of death. \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>closed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 109-10, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). \u201cRather, the question is whether the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Strickler, </em>523 U.S. at 290, 118 S.Ct. 1244 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">As discussed above, the evidence of Higgs\u2019s involvement in the pursuit, kidnapping, and murders of the three women is overwhelming, as is the evidence of his predominant role in the events that took place that evening and early morning. Gloria\u2019s testimony, corroborated by Darby\u2019s testimony, evidence found at the scene, and other physical evidence, confirms that it was Higgs who set up the \u201cdates\u201d with the girls, Higgs who got into the violent argument with Jackson, Higgs who observed Jackson writing down his license plate number, Higgs who retrieved the .38 caliber murder weapon (which he owned) and told the other two men to come along, Higgs who told Haynes to \u201ctrick\u201d the women into getting into the van, Higgs who drove the van past the route back to their homes and into the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge, Higgs who handed the murder weapon to Haynes moments before Haynes shot and killed the women, and Higgs who orchestrated the destruction of the physical evidence at his apartment after the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Haynes\u2019s confession, given in the hours immediately after his arrest, corroborates the evidence presented at Higgs\u2019s trial, although his \u201creasons\u201d for actually shooting the women varied when he later talked to his co-inmates. In his confession, Haynes said that the women were killed because he thought Higgs would kill him if he did not do as he was told. He told co-inmate Vaughn that he killed the women because one of them owed him and his cousin \u201ca quarter of a million dollars.\u201d And, he told Anderson that he had to kill the girls because one of them \u201cmay have set him up.\u201d In this light, we can discern no reasonable probability that any juror would have viewed the single statement Haynes made to Anderson as sufficient to overcome the overwhelming evidence of Higgs\u2019s predominant role in the crimes and concluded that Haynes was \u201cequally culpable\u201d with Higgs in the kidnappings and murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In any event, we think Haynes\u2019s statement to Anderson might have been viewed (at most) as evidence that Haynes may have thought (or been told by Higgs) that Jackson intended to retaliate against \u201call\u201d of the men and, therefore, that he shared a motive to kill the women with Higgs. However, there is nothing in Haynes\u2019s statements to Anderson that contradicts the overwhelming evidence of Higgs\u2019s predominant role in the kidnappings and murders or the government\u2019s argument that Higgs was more culpable than Haynes.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Because we are satisfied that the evidence set forth at Higgs\u2019s trial provides \u201cstrong support for the conclusion that [Higgs] would have been convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, even if\u2019 Haynes\u2019s statement to Anderson had been introduced into evidence, <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 294, 119 S.Ct. 1936, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Higgs\u2019s motion for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Higgs\u2019s motion for a new trial and new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">. The following summary of Haynes\u2019s confession is set forth in our opinion affirming the kidnapping, murder, and related convictions of Haynes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">In [his] first written statement, Haynes maintained that he was partying with the three women at Higgs' apartment; that Higgs had a fight with one of the women; that Higgs offered to take them home; that Higgs pulled over on a dark road, got out of the vehicle and shot all three women; and that after the shooting Higgs drove to a place where the firearm was thrown into the Anacostia River. Originally, when describing the murders, Haynes wrote, \"I ran back to the van.\u201d During the question and answer period, Lieutenant Rule asked Haynes why he had written \"I ran back to the van,\u201d to which Haynes responded that it was a mistake and changed the \"I\" to \"he.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-13\"><em>United States v.
