Burton was convicted in 1996 in the Western District of Texas of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and cocaine and was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. He was later re-sentenced to 211 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-22\">The district court dismissed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, determining that Burton had not satisfied the criteria set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001), to support his claims under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Burton\u2019s brief does not address the district court\u2019s conclusion that he did not meet the criteria for raising his claims in this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Thus, he has abandoned the only issue on appeal by failing to brief it. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). This appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We warn Burton that the filing of frivolous pleadings in the future could subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-25\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
