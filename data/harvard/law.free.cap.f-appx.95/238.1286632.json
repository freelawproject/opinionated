We dismiss the petition for review in part and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">We lack jurisdiction over the IJ\u2019s denial of Reynoso\u2019s application for cancellation of removal because Reynoso did not timely petition this court for review of the IJ\u2019s finding regarding the 10-year continued physical presence requirement. <em>See Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1145 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, review would be futile because the IJ also found Reynoso ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had no qualifying relative as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D), and Reynoso never contested that finding before the BIA or this court. <em>See Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-17\">We pretermit review of Reynoso\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration because even were it successful, the IJ\u2019s denial of voluntary departure would still stand. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f); <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2002) (section 1229e(f) divests this court of all jurisdiction to review discretionary denials of voluntary departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-18\">We lack jurisdiction over Reynoso\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel contention, raised for the first time in his reply brief, because he failed to administratively exhaust this claim with the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Hernandez-Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-19\">We grant Reynoso\u2019s motion to file a late reply brief. The clerk shall file the reply brief received on March 5, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b271-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
