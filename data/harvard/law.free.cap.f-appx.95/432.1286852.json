Because we conclude that Olumuyiwa has failed to demonstrate that the Board abused its discretion in denying her motion to reconsider, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Olumuyiwa, a Nigerian Muslim, applied for asylum based on persecution by Nigerian Christians in her home state of Kaduna. On May 15, 1992, Olumuyiwa and her family were attending religious services in the Central Mosque in the town of Kabala, where she lived. Kabala, like much of Nigeria, has been the site of ethnic and religious riots. Christians entered the mosque, killed several people, and captured Olumuyiwa and various other Muslims in attendance. They then burned down the mosque. Olumuyiwa and the other prisoners were accused of having killed the secretary of Kabala\u2019s Christian association. They were taken to a cottage and forced to remove their clothing. Some were taken away and did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">Olumuyiwa escaped from the cottage. After walking naked for five miles, she was picked up by Muslims and driven to the village of Kesi, where she sent for a friend. Her friend informed her that her mother and brother had been hospitalized as a result of the riots. Moreover, she believed that Olumuyiwa\u2019s house had been burned down. With her friend\u2019s assistance, Olumuyiwa moved first to Lagos and thereafter to a remote village, where she received medical treatment. Of the six months she spent in Nigeria following her escape, two were in Lagos and four in the remote village.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">Olumuyiwa entered the United States in December 1992 and filed an application for asylum. She subsequently learned that her twin sister was killed in 1996, allegedly in a case of mistaken identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-16\">An Immigration Judge (\u201cLI\u201d) sitting in Philadelphia denied Olumuyiwa\u2019s application for asylum in January 1998. The IJ determined that Olumuyiwa was generally credible. He nonetheless found that she had failed to establish past persecution for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the purposes of section 101(a)(42) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). In addition, he found that Olumuyiwa did not have a reasonable fear of future persecution. His decision was based in part on the State Department\u2019s most recent country report for Nigeria, which contained no information on discrimination against the Muslim majority in that country. He also cited a July 1997 Profile of Asylum Claims &amp; Country Conditions for Nigeria (\u201cthe 1997 report\u201d), which concluded that Christians could safely relocate within Nigeria and noted that the Nigerian government had taken steps to stop the rioting by sending in troops to support the police. Finally, he concluded that the murder of Olumuyiwa\u2019s sister was not based on mistaken identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Olumuyiwa timely appealed to the Board on September 3, 1998. On August 21, 2002, the Board entered an order dismissing her appeal. After reviewing the IJ\u2019s findings <em>de novo, </em>the Board concluded that Olumuyiwa had in fact suffered past persecution as a result of her religion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It also recognized that once an alien has established past persecution, a presumption arises that she has a well-founded fear of continuing persecution. The burden thus shifts to the Government to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The Government may do so by demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, either a fundamental change of circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution or that the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating within her country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i) &amp;(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The Board found that Olumuyiwa could safely return to Nigeria. Specifically, it found that: (1) with the end of rioting, there were sufficient changes in conditions in Nigeria that Olumuyiwa no longer had a well-founded fear of persecution; (2) because Christians could safely relocate within Nigeria, Muslims could as well; and (3) the persecution suffered by Olumuyiwa did not present sufficiently compelling reasons for asylum absent a well-founded fear of persecution. In explaining its reasoning, the Board cited \u201cthe Immigration Judge\u2019s observation that if the report specifically states that Christians are able to safely relocate within Nigeria, the same must hold true for Muslims. In fact, the respondent in this case was able to relocate to Lagos.\u201d It also noted that newspaper articles submitted by Olumuyiwa (\u201cparticularly the later ones\u201d) indicated that the government had restored relative order in Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Olumuyiwa did not appeal the Board\u2019s decision to this Court. Instead, she moved to reconsider and remand and requested a stay of deportation. In her motion, she challenged the Board\u2019s finding that conditions in Nigeria had fundamentally changed, arguing that the 1997 report did not reflect current country conditions. She also argued that the Board had erred in determining that the documents were sufficient to rebut the presumption of well-founded fear arising from the Board\u2019s finding of past persecution. In support of this argument, she noted that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>introduced no documentary evidence on the issue and cited a current United Nations report detailing current instability in Nigeria. She urged the Board to remand the case for a determination whether conditions in Nigeria had fundamentally changed. In addition, she challenged the Board\u2019s application of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A-B), which governs discretionary grants of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The Board denied Olumuyiwa\u2019s motion on January 29, 2003 in a <em>per curiam </em>order. Olumuyiwa filed with us a petition for review of the denial of her motion to reconsider and remand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Because Olumuyiwa did not timely seek judicial review of the Board\u2019s initial decision, we have no jurisdiction to review it now. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). We may, however, review the Board\u2019s denial of Olumuyiwa\u2019s motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (holding that denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>Nocon v. INS, </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1033 (3d Cir.1986) (reviewing denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion). The Board abuses its discretion when it applies an incorrect legal principle or makes factual findings that are arbitrary and capricious or lacking in substantial evidence. <em>Tipu v. INS, </em>20 F.3d 580, 582 (3d Cir.1994). We may overturn the Board\u2019s decision only if it was \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Tipu, </em>20 F.3d at 582).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Olumuyiwa appeals the Board\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider. Specifically, she challenges its findings that (1) country conditions in Nigeria have fundamentally changed, (2) she can safely relocate within Nigeria, and (3) she has failed to demonstrate compelling reasons for a grant of asylum in the absence of a well-founded fear of persecution. We consider these arguments in turn, after considering the Government\u2019s argument that we lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">The Government contends that we lack jurisdiction to consider Olumuyiwa\u2019s claims on appeal because her motion to reconsider was limited in scope and because she neglected to seek judicial review of the Board\u2019s August 2002 decision. We conclude to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">In the initial proceeding before an IJ, the applicant has the burden of establishing that she qualifies for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). She may appeal an adverse decision by the IJ to the Board. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15. The Board\u2019s decision is final unless reviewed by the Attorney General. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(6). The applicant may, however, seek review of the Board\u2019s decision through various channels. First, she may seek judicial review of the decision within 30 days after the Board\u2019s order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The exclusive procedure for obtaining judicial review of a final deportation order is a \u201cpetition for judicial review ... filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order.\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(c). Alternatively, she may file a motion to reconsider or a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>reopen proceedings. The Board has \u201cbroad discretion to grant or deny such motions.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Filing a motion to reconsider or reopen, however, does <em>not </em>toll the time for filing a petition for review. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days after the mailing of the decision. To obtain reconsideration, the applicant must specify the \u201cerrors of facts or law\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision, supported by \u201cpertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(b)(1). A motion to reopen may be filed within 90 days after the Board\u2019s decision and must \u201cstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.\u201d It must be \u201csupported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(1). Regardless whether the applicant filed a petition for review of the Board\u2019s decision with a Court of Appeals, she may appeal the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider or reopen. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. at 394. The denial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323 (1992); <em>Nocon, </em>789 F.2d at 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Government argues that we lack jurisdiction over Olumuyiwa\u2019s claims because she has failed to allege any specific abuse of discretion by the Board with respect to its denial of her petition and has instead challenged its August 2002 decision. Our analysis of this issue has two parts. First, we must determine whether Olumuyiwa complied with the requirements for a motion to reconsider. While this inquiry is not formally jurisdictional in nature, a motion to reconsider that is procedurally infirm effectively forecloses judicial review because the Board does not abuse its discretion by denying such a motion. Second, we must consider whether Olumuyiwa adequately alerted the Government to her arguments on appeal and thereby exhausted her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">1. The scope of our jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">A motion to reconsider must specify the \u201cerrors of fact or law\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision and must be supported by \u201cpertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(b)(1). Olumuyiwa\u2019s motion to reconsider specifically challenged the Board\u2019s decision with respect to two of its central findings. First, she questioned the Board\u2019s finding that changed country conditions in Nigeria would permit her safe return, alleging that \u201c[t]he Board erred by determining that [the documents it considered] are sufficient to rebut the presumption by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well founded fear of persecution.\u201d Second, she noted that the Board had not complied with a regulation permitting her \u201cafter the presumption of a well founded fear is rebutted to demonstrate compelling reasons not to return to her country or that she would suffer serious harm upon removal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">In assessing whether Olumuyiwa\u2019s motion to reconsider satisfied the applicable procedural requirements, we look to <em>Nocon v. INS, </em>789 F.2d 1028 (3d Cir.1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case, we concluded that because the petitioners failed to comply with the procedures governing motions for recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>sideration, the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying their motion. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">[M]otions to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration and are to be supported by pertinent case precedent. In their motion, the petitioners failed to comply with these requirements. The petitioners not only offered conclusory statements as their reasons for reconsideration but also failed to support their reasons with appropriate case law. Because the petitioners were not in compliance with the prescribed regulations, the Board was justified in denying the motion on this ground and cannot be said to have abused its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1033.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">While Olumuyiwa might certainly have done more to support her petition with case law and might have identified more specifically the Board\u2019s errors, we conclude that her petition and attached memorandum were adequate to support review. In her memorandum to the Board, Olumuyiwa specifically noted that \u201c[a] Motion to Re-Consider must state with particularity the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, with appropriate citation to authority and the record.\u201d She proceeded to list several purported errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">For example, she noted that \u201c[t]he only documents contained in the record regarding the then current country conditions [were those] by the Lawyer\u2019s Committee for Human Rights submitted by Appellant as part of Group Exhibit 4 and Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for Nigeria which was introduced by the Court at the conclusion of the testimony as Exhibit 5.\u201d These documents, Olumuyiwa asserted, \u201care not sufficient to overcome the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Similarly, she argued in her motion to reconsider that she was denied the opportunity, conferred by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(I)(iii)(A-B), to demonstrate compelling circumstances precluding her safe return to Nigeria. Because the IJ had not recognized Olumuyiwa\u2019s past persecution, the presumption of well-founded fear never arose, and the IJ did not consider this issue. Olumuyiwa asserted that the Board should have remanded to permit her to develop the record. She buttressed her argument with the Board\u2019s prior decision in <em>In re Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 16, Interim Dec. 3104, 1989 WL 331860 (BIA 1989), in which the Board held that when eligibility is based on past persecution, the favorable exercise of discretion may be warranted even if there is little likelihood of future persecution, taking into account such factors as past persecution, lack of family ties, and the alien\u2019s physical and emotional health.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">We conclude that Olumuyiwa\u2019s identification of the Board\u2019s errors, while limited, complied with the procedural requirements applicable to motions for reconsideration. We therefore inquire whether the Board abused its discretion in rejecting her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">2. Olumuyiwa\u2019s relocation claim</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Though we review the Board\u2019s denial of Olumuyiwa\u2019s motion to reconsider, we may consider only those claims that have been administratively exhausted. The Government alleges that Olumuyiwa waived one of her principal arguments by failing to raise it before the Board. In her brief to this Court, Olumuyiwa suggests that the Board misapplied a regulation that denies an applicant asylum if she may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>safely relocate within her country. In addition, she suggests that the Board\u2019s decision on this issue was unsupported by the record. The Government asserts that Olumuyiwa\u2019s relocation argument has not been exhausted and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">We may not review a final order under the INA \u201cif the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) (1994).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This provision \u201cbars [judicial] consideration of particular questions not raised in an appeal to the Board.\u201d <em>Alleyne v. INS, 879 </em>F.2d 1177, 1182 (3d Cir.1989). An applicant must raise and exhaust her remedies as to each claim or ground for relief in order to preserve it for judicial review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We addressed when an applicant waives an argument by failing to exhaust her administrative remedies in <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587 (3d Cir.2003). In that case, an asylum applicant argued that the IJ applied the wrong standard of proof to his assertion of past persecution. We reasoned that because he \u201cfailed to raise that issue in his appeal to the Board, we [did] not have jurisdiction to consider the question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. We rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that his general assertion that the IJ \u201cerred as a matter of law and discretion\u201d alerted the Board to the specific issue raised on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Conversely, we concluded that the applicant had not waived a second issue-whether the IJ improperly acted as a witness at the removal hearing, reflecting bias in violation of his due process rights. We explained: \u201cWhile Abdulraham\u2019s appeal to the Board did not frame the matter in due process terms in so many words, both his notice of appeal and his later brief to the Board argued that the IJ impermissibly based her decision on her own speculative beliefs rather than on the evidence. As such, he adequately alerted the Board to the issue, thus preserving it for our review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">We must therefore determine whether the issues raised by Olumuyiwa before the Board adequately alerted the Board to her relocation argument. Olumuyiwa argues that the Board misapplied its regulation providing for the denial of asylum, despite past persecution, if \u201cthe applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country ... and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(B). She also argues that the evidence did not support the Board\u2019s finding that she could safely relocate within Nigeria. We conclude that Olumuyiwa\u2019s arguments more closely resemble Abdulraham\u2019s first (waived) claim than his second, which we deemed exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Olumuyiwa does not refer to the Board\u2019s application of the regulation in her motion to reconsider \u2014 nor does she even use the term \u201crelocate.\u201d The summary paragraph that concludes her motion specifically chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>lenges the Board\u2019s findings only as to changed country conditions and other compelling circumstances: \u201cAppellant through counsel respectfully requests] that the Board reconsider the decision dated August 21, 2002 and remand the record for further proceedings regarding the issue of changed country conditions and whether Appellant can demonstrate compelling reasons not to return her to Nigeria or that she would suffer serious harm upon removal.\u201d She did not request a remand on whether internal relocation was possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">To be sure, in suggesting to the Board that continuing violence would prevent her from safely returning to Nigeria, Olumuyiwa did not simply point to riots in her home town. Rather, she cited general political unrest in that country. Arguably, the Board should thereby have been alerted to her argument that she reasonably feared persecution upon return to <em>any </em>part of Nigeria. In finding that Olumuyiwa could relocate, however, the Board relied in part on Olumuyiwa\u2019s past relocation to Lagos.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because its finding of changed country conditions was unrelated (at least in part) to its conclusion that relocation would be reasonable, the Board could not adequately have been alerted to the relocation claim. Moreover, there was no hint in the motion to reconsider of a challenge to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its regulatory framework. None of Olumuyiwa\u2019s claims adequately alerted the Board to this highly nuanced and specific textual argument. In sum, we perceive no ground on which to base the conclusion that the Board was asked to reconsider its relocation determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">B. Did the Board abuse its discretion in denying Olumuyiwa\u2019s motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Our consideration of Olumuyiwa\u2019s appeal is therefore constrained to two issues: whether the Board abused its discretion in finding that country conditions in Nigeria had changed, and whether Olumuyiwa was impermissibly denied an opportunity to demonstrate compelling reasons why she should not be returned to Nigeria in the absence of a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, confers on the Attorney General discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is a \u201crefugee.\u201d For the purposes of the INA, a refugee is a person who is \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to return home \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">In order to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, an applicant must satisfy three requirements: (1) she has a fear of persecution in her native country; (2) there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution upon return to that country; and (3) she is unwilling to return to that country as a result of her fear. 8 C. F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i). A finding that the applicant has suffered persecution in the past results in a presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The Government then bears the burden of demonstrating either (1) a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>longer has a well-founded fear of persecution, or (2) that the applicant could avoid future persecution by \u201crelocating\u201d within her country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Finally, an applicant may be granted asylum in the absence of a well-founded fear of persecution if she shows \u201ccompelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country\u201d based on the severity of the past persecution, or \u201ca reasonable possibility\u201d that she may suffer other serious harm upon repatriation. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The Board found that although Olumuyiwa suffered past persecution, she was ineligible for asylum because country conditions in Nigeria had fundamentally changed and because she could safely relocate within the country. For the reasons given above, we may not review the Board\u2019s finding as to Olumuyiwa\u2019s ability safely to relocate. As the Government may demonstrate either changed country conditions <em>or </em>the possibility of relocation to rebut the presumption of past persecution, we need not consider the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We thus examine only the Board\u2019s determination that Olumuyiwa failed to show compelling reasons why she should not be returned to Nigeria in the absence of a well-founded fear of persecution. Olumuyiwa argued in her motion to reconsider that, in light of the Board\u2019s finding that the presumption of well-founded fear was rebutted, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A-B) required it to permit her to demonstrate either compelling reasons why she should not return to her country or that she would suffer serious harm upon removal. The regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">An applicant described in paragraph b(l)(i) of this section who is not barred from a grant of asylum under paragraph (c) of this section, may be granted asylum, in the exercise of the decision-maker\u2019s discretion, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">(A) The applicant has demonstrated compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">(B) The applicant has established that there is a reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Because the IJ found that Olumuyiwa had not suffered past persecution, he concluded no presumption of well-founded fear arose, and thus did not consider any part of this regulatory provision. The Board\u2019s disposal of this issue was therefore the first and only examination of whether discretionary asylum was appropriate. Olumuyiwa urged the Board to remand to permit the IJ to address the issue in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">In its August 2002 decision, the Board stated, \u2018We also find[] the respondent\u2019s detention and problems in Nigeria do not present compelling reasons for a grant of asylum in the absence of a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d It did not solicit input from the parties on this issue, nor did it explain the basis for its conclusion. Its consideration of \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d (part (A) of the regulation) was cursory, and it did not even invoke the possibility that Olumuyiwa might suffer serious harm upon removal (part (B) of the regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">We advise the Board, in future decisions, to explain in greater detail its findings with respect to discretionary asylum in order to facilitate judicial review. Nonetheless, we agree with the Government that there has been no suggestion, at any stage of Olumuyiwa\u2019s application or appeal, that extraneous factors warranting discretionary asylum exist. Although the Board ultimately remanded for further evidence in <em>In re H, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 337, 348, 1996 WL 291910 (BIA 1996), it noted in doing so that \u201cwhere cognizable issues of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>past persecution arise, in the interest of a fair and efficient adjudication of the case, the parties should ordinarily present sufficient evidence to allow the Immigration Judge to consider and resolve all relevant issues and avoid the necessity for remand if the Board ultimately determines that the applicant has shown past persecution.\u201d Though we do not hold that the Board is precluded from considering relevant evidence presented for the first time on appeal to it, there was no evidence before it or the IJ that points to the Board abusing its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Board\u2019s treatment of Olumuyiwa\u2019s case was not as careful and considered as it should have been. Olumuyiwa did not, however, seek judicial review of the August 2002 decision. Our review of the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is deferential, and we do not find an abuse of discretion in this case. We therefore deny Olumuyiwa\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-5\">. The Board explained: \"[W]e find that [Olumuyiwa] has demonstrated past persecution. While there was a general unrest at the time of these events, it appears the Respondent has suffered past persecution specifically on account of her Muslim faith. Further, the treatment described by [Olumuyiwa] rises to such level as to be considered persecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\">. On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an independent agency within the Department of Justice. <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L.

The subject matter and appellate jurisdictions of this Court are governed by the \"transitional rules\u201d under section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"HRIRA\u201d). The Board had jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(b)(3), now codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b)(3), and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a), now codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\">. Although <em>Nocon </em>was decided before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stone, </em>we held that timely filing of a motion to reconsider does not suspend the time period for seeking judicial review of a deportation order. We nonetheless reviewed for abuse of discretion the Board\u2019s denial of the petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">. We declined to review a denial of a motion to reconsider on similar grounds in our unpublished opinion in <em>Abraha v. Ashcroft, </em>57 Fed.Appx. 94 (3rd Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. The current version permits review \"if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">. <em>Alleyne </em>is also instructive. There the applicant\u2019s notice of appeal to the Board stated that: (1) the IJ erred in \"determining that said alien was deportable based upon his plea of guilty to a Statute which the plea covered various offenses some deportable some not\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">(2) \"The Court erred in premitting [sic] the service to go behind the plea\u201d; and (3) \"The Court erred in refusing to continue said matter.\u201d 879 F.2d at 1182-83. We concluded that \"[n]one of the errors asserted in that document even arguably raisefd] the issue\u201d before them \u2014 namely, \"whether the Immigration Judge made required findings of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1183.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\">. Olumuyiwa contests the Board\u2019s characterization of this issue. She notes that, of the six months that she purportedly had safely relocated in Lagos, four months were spent in a remote village. Furthermore, before the IJ, Olumuyiwa testified that she felt like a \"chicken in [a] cage\u201d during her stay in Lagos and that she \"[could not] go out.\u201d Because we find that Olumuyiwa did not challenge the Board\u2019s finding in her motion to reconsider, we need not consider the merits of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
