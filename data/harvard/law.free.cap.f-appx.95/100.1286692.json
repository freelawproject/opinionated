Lucas challenges the constitutionality of Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 411.148 and related sections, which require that certain inmates provide prison officials with blood samples for purposes of creating a DNA database.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-26\">Lucas\u2019s argument that the district court should not have applied the \u201cspecial needs\u201d exception to the warrant requirement to uphold the constitutionality of \u00a7 411.148 is without merit. The district court denied Lucas\u2019s complaint based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003). In <em>Velasquez, </em>this court rejected the argument that \u00a7 411.148 violates the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Velasquez </em>decision was not based on the \u201cspecial needs\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Lucas\u2019s argument that prison policies enforcing the collection of blood samples pursuant to \u00a7 411.148 are invalid under <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), because they infringe on his constitutional rights and serve no penological objective is also without merit. Because the collection of a blood sample from an inmate for DNA analysis is a reasonable search and does not violate the Fourth Amendment, the <em>Turner </em>analysis is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Lucas makes no argument regarding the claims he raised in district court that the collection of his blood for DNA analysis violates his Eighth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He, therefore, has waived these arguments. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b132-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
