Allen, Texas prisoner # 642038, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his civil-rights lawsuit, filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as malicious pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). The claims in Allen\u2019s instant lawsuit are duplicative of his claims in an earlier lawsuit that was dismissed in district court as frivolous. As his instant claims were duplicative, the district court properly dismissed them as malicious pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>See Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 994-95 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Bailey v. Johnson, </em>846 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-17\">As Allen\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, it is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Allen\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">The dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Allen\u2019s instant lawsuit both count as strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Allen previously received two strikes when his civil-rights lawsuits were dismissed as frivolous in <em>Allen v. Bluebird Bus Co., </em>No. 4:98\u2014 CV-3414 (S.D.Tex. July 29, 1999), and in <em>Allen v. </em>Weems, No. 6:02-CV-56 (E.D.Tex. Apr. 8, 2002). Because Allen has accumulated at least three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he is BARRED from proceeding <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). As Allen is not proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in the instant appeal, Allen is also WARNED that sanctions may be imposed in response to future frivolous filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b120-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
