In his petition, he sought to challenge his guilty-plea conviction for possession with the intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base. Mitchell argued that (1) his conviction was void because the statutes under which he was convicted were uncodified; (2) the indictment was defective because it failed to allege the essential elements of the offense; (3) the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the indictment failed to allege the essential elements of the offense; (4) he was actually innocent of the offense of conviction; and (5) the \u201cfair warning doctrine\u201d was violated because the indictment failed to allege the essential elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The district court correctly construed the petition as a successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because Mitchell was attacking the legality of his conviction rather than the manner of execution of his sentence. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Nor has Mitchell shown that his case fits within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).
