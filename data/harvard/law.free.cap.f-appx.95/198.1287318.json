The district court granted a certificate of appealability on Wilson\u2019s claims that trial counsel was ineffective. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-22\">We agree with the district court that Wilson\u2019s trial counsel adequately cross-examined government witnesses, using available evidence to impeach their credibility; and that counsel adequately investigated, declining to call one witness for reasonable strategic reasons. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (to establish ineffective-assistance claim, movant must show deficient representation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>prejudiced his case); <em>Graham v. Dormire, </em>212 F.3d 437, 440 (8th Cir.2000) (reasonable trial strategy does not constitute ineffective assistance). We also agree with the district court that Wilson did not show he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to call two additional witnesses, or by counsel\u2019s advice to Wilson not to testify on his own behalf. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (to establish prejudice, defendant must show reasonable probability that outcome of trial would have been different).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Accordingly, we grant Wilson\u2019s motions to amend his brief, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-23\">.
