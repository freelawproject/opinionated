The application is based upon the Board\u2019s assertion that the respondent did not file a timely answer to the complaint and therefore cannot contest the Board\u2019s decision and order before this court. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (\u201cNo objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-25\">The Regional Director issued a complaint against the respondent on June 27, 2002. The respondent did not file an answer. The Regional Director sent another letter on July 12, 2002, giving the respondent a second opportunity to file an answer, and informing the respondent that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>motion for default summary judgment would be filed with the Board if no answer was received. Because such an answer would be untimely, the respondent was also instructed to provide an explanation for its failure to file a timely answer. Again, there was no response, and General Counsel filed a motion for default summary judgment with the Board. Only after the Board issued a show cause order did the respondent, through counsel, file a response and an answer to the complaint. Therein, counsel argued that the respondent\u2019s president (Gene Miller) was a member of an Amish community which did not participate in adversarial-type proceedings, (2) that Miller did not understand the Board\u2019s procedures or role in labor disputes, and (3) that Miller mistakenly believed the Board was a union or affiliated with a union and thus ignored the notices sent to him. In its decision and order of August 27, 2003, however, the Board (with one member dissenting) found the respondent had failed to show good cause for its failure to file a timely answer, and granted the motion for default summary judgment. The present application for summary enforcement followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Although this court may review, for abuse of discretion, a Board determination that good cause does not exist to excuse the late filing of an answer to an unfair labor practice complaint, <em>Father &amp; Sons Lumber and Bldg. Supplies, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>931 F.2d 1093, 1095 (6th Cir.1991), the respondent has not sought judicial review of that determination by filing a petition for review of its own or a cross-petition for review in response to the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement. Neither has the respondent sought to raise that issue by filing an answer to the present petition under Rule 15(b)(2), Fed. R.App. P. This application therefore comes to us in the same posture as a case in which no answer was filed to the original charges. Under these circumstances, we conclude the Board is entitled to summary enforcement under \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">It therefore is ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the Board\u2019s decision and order of August 27, 2003, in Case No. 7-CA-44949, 2003 WL 22047064 is hereby enforced. The respondent, Country Lane Construction, Inc., its officers, agents, successors, and assigns, shall abide by the provisions of said decision and order.
