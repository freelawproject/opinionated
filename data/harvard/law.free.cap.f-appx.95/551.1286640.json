The district court dismissed the petition and Castro timely appealed. Castro argues that his prior convictions were improperly used to enhance his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. Castro has failed to identify a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense. His claim, therefore, does not satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and he is not entitled to utilize 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 903-04 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">This appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. See <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Additionally, Castro\u2019s petition is repetitious. Castro has previously filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging this same conviction and raising identical claims. <em>Castro v. Chandler, </em>31 Fed.Appx. 160 (5th Cir.2001) (unpublished) (affirming dismissal of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition). Castro is warned that any future frivolous pleadings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging this conviction will invite the imposition of sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
