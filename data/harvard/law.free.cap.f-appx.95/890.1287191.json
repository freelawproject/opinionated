Hovsepian, </em>359 F.3d 1144, 1165 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (hold that proceedings do not commence until INS actually files charging document). Thus, we need not reach the issue whether the policy directive was violative of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>Martinez-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 732 (9th Cir.2004) (declining to reach APA issue where no Order to Show Cause was filed prior to IIRIRA\u2019s effective date because IIRIRA rendered OSC procedures obsolete).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The Navarros\u2019 other argument, that the BIA\u2019s streamlining regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7), violated their right to procedural due process, is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Falcon Carriche v.
