Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. DC-315H-03-0018-I-1, 2003 WL 21684890 (M.S.P.B. July 10, 2003) <em>(\u201cFinal Decision\u201d). </em>We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-20\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-21\">Mr. Ware was appointed by the Department of Health &amp; Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) to the position of Administrative Associate, GS-9, on November 4, 2001, subject to a one-year probationary period. On September 30, 2002, HHS notified Ware that he would be terminated from his position effective October 4, 2002, as a result of unacceptable performance. Asserting that the agency \u201cdemonstrated sexual bias and possibly religious bias,\u201d Ware appealed his termination to the Board on September 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-22\">On December 17, 2002, the Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) issued an Order to Show Cause, explaining that probationary employees who have less than one year of current, continuous service in the same or similar position have limited rights of appeal to the Board under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806 and that the burden was on Ware to prove that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal. Ware responded by arguing that \u00a7 315.806 is not applicable, but that the Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3, 5 C.F.R. part 432, and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303(e). Several days later, Ware also submitted a motion to disqualify the AJ, asserting that she had demonstrated \u201cpersonal bias regarding the issue of jurisdiction,\u201d and requested certification of the jurisdictional issue to the full Board as an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>On December 30, 2002, the AJ issued an Initial Decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and denying Ware\u2019s motion for disqualification and interlocutory appeal. <em>Ware v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. DC-315H-03-0018-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Dec. 30, 2002) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). </em>The Initial Decision explained that terminated probationary employees have no statutory right of appeal to the Board, and that a limited regulatory right has been provided only for such employees who allege that the agency\u2019s action was based on partisan political reasons or marital status. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 3. Ware filed a petition for review of the Initial Decision by the full Board. The Board denied that petition, <em>Final Decision, </em>slip op. at 2, and the Initial Decision became final pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113(b). Ware timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). However, Congress has expressly limited the scope of our review in appeals from the Board. <em>Phillips v. U.S. Postal Sero., </em>695 F.2d 1389, 1390 (Fed.Cir.1982). Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it was \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">On appeal, Ware argues that \u201c[t]he conditions for jurisdiction are A. issues dealing with a reduction in grade [and] B. removal for unacceptable performance according to the Federal Code of Regulations,\u201d and that \u201cPart B applies\u201d to his case. He again cites 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3, 5 C.F.R. part 432, and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303(e). Ware also argues that the Board \u201cignore^] the fact that the probationary requirements were not applicable\u201d because he had seven years of prior employment by HHS and the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">None of the provisions cited by Ware supports Board jurisdiction over his appeal, and we are aware of no alternative provisions that would do so. First, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3 states, in relevant part, that</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">The Board has jurisdiction over appeals from agency actions when the appeals are authorized by law, rule, or regulation. These include appeals from the following actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-11\">(8) Termination of employment during probation ... when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-12\">(i) The employee alleges discrimination because of partisan political reasons or marital status; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-13\">(ii) The termination was based on conditions arising before appointment and the employee alleges that the action is procedurally improper (5 CFR 315.806, 38 U.S.C. 4214(b)(1)(E)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3(a) (2003). Because Ware did not allege \u201cdiscrimination because of partisan political reasons or marital status\u201d or procedurally improper action \u201cbased on conditions arising before appointment,\u201d that regulation has no application here.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">Second, the relevant portion of 5 C.F.R. part 432 states: \u201cThis part does not apply</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>to: ... (2) The reduction in grade or removal of an employee in the competitive service who is serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 432.102(b). Ware does not dispute the AJ\u2019s finding that he was employed in the competitive service. <em>See Initial Decision, </em>slip op. at 2. Further, despite Ware\u2019s assertion to the contrary, the Initial Decision reflects that the AJ considered his argument that he was not subject to a probationary period as a result of his prior federal employment. In particular, the AJ found that Ware had submitted a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stating that he had previously been employed by various government agencies. <em>Id. </em>at 4. However, she also found that Ware\u2019s prior employment had ended in June 2001, which was more than thirty days before his November 2001 appointment, <em>id., </em>and she correctly concluded that that prior employment could therefore not be counted toward completion of the probationary period required by HHS. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.802(b) (2003) (\u201cPrior Federal civilian service ... counts toward completion of probation when the prior service: ... (3) Contains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 calendar days.\u201d). Ware does not contest the AJ\u2019s finding that there was a break in his service from June 2001 to November 2001. Thus, because Ware was employed in the competitive service and was removed during his probationary period, 5 C.F.R. part 432 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Finally, although subsection (e) of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303 provides that an \u201cemployee who is ... in the competitive service ... and has been reduced in grade or removed under this section is entitled to appeal the action to the Merit Systems Protection Board,\u201d subsection (f) of the same section explains that \u201c[t]his section does not apply to ... (2) the reduction in grade or removal of an employee in the competitive service who is serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment....\u201d For the reasons stated in the above discussion of 5 C.F.R. part 432, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303(e) is likewise inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">We have considered Ware\u2019s other arguments and find them unpersuasive. As appellant, Ware had the burden of proving that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2). The Board found that he did not meet that burden. The Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence; was not obtained without any procedures required by any law, rule, or regulation having been followed; and is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\"> By citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3, Ware likely intended to rely on subsection (a)(1) of that regulation, which provides that the Board has jurisdiction where \"authorized by law, rule, or regulation\u201d over appeals from \"(1) Reduction in grade or removal for unacceptable performance (5 CFR part 432; 5 U.S.C. 4303(e)).\u201d As explained <em>infra, </em>however, neither 5 C.F.R. part 432 nor 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303 authorizes the Board to exercise jurisdiction over appeals brought by probationers removed during the probationary period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
