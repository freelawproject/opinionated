He argues that his prior Texas state conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle was not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d and, therefore, did not warrant an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). He also contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him because the felony and aggravated felony provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Magallanes concedes that these arguments are foreclosed but seeks to preserve further review by the Supreme Court. This court has previously held that a conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 and will support the aggravated felony enhancement in \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Galvan-Rodriguez, </em>169 F.3d 217, 220 (5th Cir.1999). We are bound by this court\u2019s precedent absent an intervening Supreme Court decision or a subsequent en banc decision. <em>See United States v. Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d 142, 151 n. 1 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Magallanes\u2019 <em>Apprendi </em>argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, Magallanes\u2019 conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
