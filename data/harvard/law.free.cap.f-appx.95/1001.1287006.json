We also stated that \u201c[n]o further extensions will be granted and if the briefs are not filed within that time, Jones\u2019s appeals will be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-29\">When the court states \u201cno further extensions,\u201d it means it. These words are not lightly or routinely added to orders. Because Jones did not file her briefs within the explicit deadline set by the court in its December 16, 2003 order, the motions are denied and the appeals are dismissed. <em>See Julian v. Zeringue, </em>864 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir.1989) (court may dismiss for failure to file a brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-30\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-31\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-32\">(1) Jones\u2019s motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-33\">(2) These appeals are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-34\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1033-22\"> Jones received extensions totaling 165 days. In the second and third orders, Jones was warned that no further extensions should be anticipated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
