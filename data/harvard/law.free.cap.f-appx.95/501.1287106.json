He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Benenhaley noted a timely appeal, arguing his sentence and conviction were unconstitutional. In a published opinion, Benenhaley\u2019s convictions were affirmed, but his sentence was vacated in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the case was remanded to the district court for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Benenhaley, </em>281 F.3d 423 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 869, 123 S.Ct. 275, 154 L.Ed.2d 116 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On remand, the district court sentenced Benenhaley to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Benenhaley has again timely appealed his conviction and sentence to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In this second appeal, Benenhaley\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he argues Benenhaley\u2019s conviction, based on an indictment lacking a specific drug quantity, is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi. </em>In the alternative, he argues, based on the indictment\u2019s lack of a specific drug quantity, Benenhaley\u2019s offense level could be no greater than twelve. Finally, counsel argues Benenhaley\u2019s 210-month sentence is unconstitutional because powder methamphetamine is a Schedule III drug, and because no specific drug quantity was found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Benenhaley\u2019s sentence cannot exceed five years\u2019 imprisonment. Benenhaley filed a pro se supplemental brief raising several additional issues. The Government has elected not to file a formal brief. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have considered the briefs and examined the entire record for meritorious issues. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">We review Benenhaley\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument de novo. <em>See United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.) (holding if defendant makes timely and sufficient <em>Apprendi </em>objection in trial court, and preserves the objection, this Court employs de novo review), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1045, 123 S.Ct. 2099, 155 L.Ed.2d 1083 (2003). Under <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1098, 122 S.Ct. 2296, 152 L.Ed.2d 1053 (2002), while a sentence increased beyond the statutory maximum sentence and based on an indictment that charges an unspecified drug quantity violates <em>Apprendi, </em>it nonetheless suffices to support a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000). Thus, we find Benenhaley\u2019s argument that his conviction is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">Benenhaley\u2019s alternative argument, that his offense level, which the district court found to be thirty-six, could be no greater than twelve, resulting in a maximum sentence of sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment, also fails. Under <em>Promise, </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), the section under which Benenhaley was convicted, relates to \u201cunaggravated\u201d drug trafficking offenses, for which no specific drug quantity need be specified in the indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, a defendant convicted under this section and who, as Benenhaley, has a prior felony drug conviction, is subject to a maximum sentence of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. Further, the district court\u2019s finding that Benenhaley was responsible for 1.9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>grams of pure methamphetamine corresponds to an offense level of thirty-six under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we find the district court did not err in its calculation of Benenhaley\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Next, Benenhaley argues the district court erred by classifying powder methamphetamine as a Schedule II controlled substance, as opposed to a Schedule III controlled substance, in calculating his sentence. We review legal issues de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). Benenhaley does not dispute the United States Attorney General promulgated changes in Schedule II to include methamphetamine, without regard to its form. However, he argues because Schedule III, which initially contained powder methamphetamine, has not been amended, it remains a Schedule III controlled substance, thereby resulting in a maximum term of imprisonment not to exceed five years under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). We find this argument meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">First, there is no evidence \u00a7 841 was drafted with regard to the particular schedule of the drug at issue. Furthermore, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 (2000) conveys authority to the Attorney General to transfer a drug from one schedule to another under certain enumerated circumstances. Moreover, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (2000), which establishes the schedules of controlled substances, notes that the schedules shall be updated and republished annually. The revised schedules are published in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations at \u00a7 1308. According to 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.12(d)(2) (1999),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[mjethamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers\u201d are Schedule II controlled substances. Thus, contrary to Benenhaley\u2019s argument, methamphetamine, regardless of its form, is a Schedule II controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Benenhaley raises several issues in his pro se supplemental brief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, because he raises them for the first time on appeal after remand and resentencing, they are foreclosed by the mandate rule. <em>See United States v. Bell, 5 </em>F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993) (holding the mandate rule \u201cforecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court,\u201d as well as \u201cissues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal\u201d). Because Benenhaley did not raise these issues in his initial appeal, and because this Court remanded the case to the district court for resentencing based solely on the <em>Apprendi </em>issue, they are foreclosed by the mandate rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s amended judgment sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Benenhaley to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this Court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">. The Supreme Court held in <em>Apprendi </em>that \"other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\">.
