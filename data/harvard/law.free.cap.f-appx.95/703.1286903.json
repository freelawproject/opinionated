Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Saenz argues that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction because, although she was charged with offenses involving more than 500 grams of cocaine, a DEA lab analysis of the substance seized showed a net weight of 493.2 grams and a pure drug amount of 399.4 grams. Saenz stipulated at trial that the amount of drugs at issue was 566 grams. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Jaramillo, </em>42 F.3d 920, 923 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>see also United States v. Branch, </em>46 F.3d 440, 442 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Saenz next argues that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by stipulating to a drug quantity in excess of 500 grams. We decline to reach the merits of Saenz\u2019s argument on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Navejar, </em>963 F.2d 732, 735 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Bounds, </em>943 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Saenz argues that the district court erroneously determined her base offense level without reference to the 399.4-gram weight of the pure drugs. Saenz did not make this argument to the district court, and we conclude that there was no plain error in the district court\u2019s calculation of the base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), Note (A) <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.l): <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 643 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">Finally, Saenz argues that the district court erroneously imposed a supervised release term of four years instead of three years. The district court determined for sentencing purposes that the amount of cocaine at issue was 493 grams, which is less than the 500 grams necessary for a four-year term of supervised release under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The Government concedes that Saenz should have been sentenced to three years of supervised release. Therefore, we modify the district court\u2019s judgment to reflect a three-year supervised release term and affirm the judgment as modified. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 244 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160,165 n. 2 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">Reyes argues that the district court erroneously admitted evidence under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b) of an extraneous conviction imposed upon her for possession of marijuana that occurred two weeks after the events charged in the indictment in this case. She further argues that the district court failed to make the required probative-value-versus-prejudicial-effect analysis on the record. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the extraneous offense evidence. <em>See United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1561 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>619 F.2d 379, 383 (5th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (1978) (en banc). Because Reyes did not request that the district court make the probative value/prejudice analysis, the district court was not required to make the analysis on the record. <em>United States v. Alarcon, </em>261 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>The district court\u2019s judgment as to Saenz is AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. The district court\u2019s judgment as to Reyes is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
