Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states there are no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>meritorious issues for appeal, but presenting two issues for our review. Although notified of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Patterson has not done so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">First, Patterson argues that his guilty plea was not valid. Because Patterson did not object in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). We have reviewed the district court\u2019s thorough plea hearing and have found no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Patterson also contends that his sentence was unconstitutional. We have reviewed the record and disagree. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Patterson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
