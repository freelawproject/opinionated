Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997). The district court dismissed Todd\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint and denied permission to proceed IFP based on its conclusion that Todd\u2019s claims of negligence failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">Todd has failed to address the district court\u2019s conclusion in his brief. Therefore, he effectively has waived the only issue relevant to his entitlement to IFP status on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Even if Todd had briefed this issue, we conclude that an appeal would be frivolous. To the extent that the defendants\u2019 conduct was negligent, the district court correctly held that negligence claims are not cognizable in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 848-49, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998). To the extent that Todd alleges that the defendants\u2019 conduct amounted to deliberate indifference to an unsafe working condition, he has not alleged facts that would show that prison officials were aware of an \u201cexcessive risk\u201d that the machinery would fall and injure someone or that they deliberately disregarded that risk. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-24\">The district court\u2019s certification that Todd\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, his motion for IFP is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 and n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Todd\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel also is DENIED. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). The dismissal of Todd\u2019s complaint in the district court and the dismissal of this appeal count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Todd that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>IFP DENIED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b115-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
