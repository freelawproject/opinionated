Villarreal-Fuentes acknowledges that his appellate arguments are foreclosed. He raises the issues to preserve them for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-23\">Villarreal-Fuentes\u2019s first argument, that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219,140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. 523 U.S. at 235. The Court held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">Villarreal-Fuentes\u2019s second argument, that the provision of the written judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>prohibiting him from possessing \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d should be stricken because it conflicts with the sentence orally imposed by the district court, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 938 (5th Cir.2003). In <em>Torres-Aguilar, </em>this court held that if a \u201cdistrict court orally imposes a sentence of supervised release without stating the conditions applicable to this period of supervision, the judgment\u2019s inclusion of conditions that are mandatory, standard, or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines does not create a conflict with the oral pronouncement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further held that if a defendant has been convicted of a felony, a prohibition from possessing any \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is a standard condition of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
