For the reasons set out below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">ORDERED that the petition for review be denied. Substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings that Fuller was aware of illegal trading by the CEO and President of Vista 2000, Inc. (Vista) and the lack of independence of one of its auditors. <em>See Wonsover v. SEC, </em>205 F.3d 408, 412 (D.C.Cir.2000). Even if the Commission misapplied the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d in concluding that Fuller was notified of the illegal trading, see <em>Lepre v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>275 F.3d 59, 69-71 (D.C.Cir.2001) \u2014 a doubtful proposition in light of the numerous mailings and evidence presented by the Commission, see <em>Williams v. First Gov\u2019t Mortgage &amp; Investors Corp., </em>225 F.3d 738, 751 (D.C.Cir.2000); <em>Cook v. Providence Hosp., </em>820 F.2d 176,179 &amp; n. 3 (6th Cir.1987) \u2014 the Commission\u2019s finding that Fuller was also alerted to the trading by virtue of a phone call from one of Vista\u2019s brokers is readily supported by the record and the administrative law judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Fuller\u2019s attempt to shift responsibility to Vista\u2019s CFO for purposes of evaluating the independence of the company\u2019s accountants is equally unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
