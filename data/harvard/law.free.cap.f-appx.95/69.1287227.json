The district court dismissed her claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it found the claim time-barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401(b) and 2675(a). Because this finding was contrary to Waggoner\u2019s undisputed allegations and affidavit testimony, we REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Mrs. Waggoner\u2019s husband, a sixty-two-year-old smoker with high cholesterol, began to suffer chest pains in August 1996. He went to a VA hospital for treatment and was given a stress test and an electrocardiogram (\u201cEKG\u201d). A later stress test was scheduled but never given. Mrs. Waggoner asserts that the EKG showed signs of heart disease that should have been noticed by the doctors, but the doctors assured her that Mr. Waggoner was not suffering from heart disease. Instead, the doctors diagnosed Mr. Waggoner with degenerative joint disease in the spine. He was given medication to alleviate his chest pains, but it persisted. Mr. Waggoner returned to the VA hospital in late 1997, where again he and Mrs. Waggoner were told that he did not suffer from heart disease. He suffered a major heart attack on December 13, 1997, and died on January 4, 1998. Mrs. Waggoner received her husband\u2019s death certificate four days later on January 8, 1998, which indicated the cause of death as congestive heart failure and coronary heart disease. She filed an administrative claim with the Office of Regional Counsel for Veteran\u2019s Affairs on January 6, 2000, more than two years after her husband\u2019s death but less than two years after her receipt of the death certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Based on these allegations, Waggoner asserts that while she knew of her husband\u2019s injury on the day of his death, she did not know, and could not have reasonably known, the alleged cause of his injury \u2014 the doctors\u2019 failure to diagnose and treat Mr. Waggoner\u2019s coronary heart disease. Considering the doctors\u2019 various assurances that her husband did not suffer from heart disease, and in light of the other possible causes of Mr. Waggoner\u2019s heart attack, Mrs. Waggoner asserts that she could not have known of the cause until she received the death certificate on January 8, 2004. In her view, this is the day her cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The district court rejected her allegations, finding that-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">[she] was armed with the facts about the harm done prior to 8 January 1998, even if she was not certain that the Alexandria VA had been negligent when treating her husband.... At [the time Mr. Waggoner suffered his heart attack], plaintiff had knowledge of her husband\u2019s heart problems and reason to believe that the Alexandria VA had failed to treat those problems correctly.... Considering the history of her husband\u2019s illness, [] Waggoner cannot claim she had no knowledge of the existence and cause of his injury until ... she received the death certificate on 8 January 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">Based on this finding, the court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it was not presented within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the applicable two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the extent that a court rests its dismissal on a resolution of disputed facts, we review the court\u2019s fact findings for clear error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will hold a fact finding to be clearly erroneous when we \u201chave a firm conviction, based on a review of the entire record, that a mistake has been made.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The FTCA requires a plaintiff to present her claim to the appropriate federal agency within two years of the actions\u2019s accrual.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIt is well-settled that these limitation periods are jurisdictional,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201c[wjhile substantive state law determines whether a cause of action exists, federal law determines when that claim accrues.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No provision of the FTCA explains when a cause of action accrues. The Supreme Court, however, explained in <em>United States v. Kubrick </em>that a claim under the FTCA accrues when a plaintiff knows or reasonably should have known \u201cthe existence and the cause of his injury,\u201d although a plaintiff need not know that the injury was the result of negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">After a review of the complaint, answer, and affidavits, we can find no reason why Mrs. Waggoner knew or should have known the alleged failure to properly diagnose and treat her husband\u2019s heart disease. Mrs. Waggoner presented evidence and allegations indicating that she could not have reasonably known of the improper diagnosis and treatment until she received the death certificate. Namely, Waggoner provided affidavit testimony that the doctors assured her that her husband did not suffer from heart disease, as well as testimony that she believed a person could die of a heart attack for many reasons. She provided evidence that her husband was a sixty-two-year-old smoker with high cholesterol, and finally, she states the obvious \u2014 a heart attack can result from a variety of factors and causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-18\">The government provided no evidence to rebut her allegations and evidence. Instead, the government assumed the cause of action accrued on the day of death and focused solely on responding to Waggoner\u2019s alternative assertion that the cause of action should not accrue until an expert advised her of the possible negligence. By doing so, the government ignored Waggoner\u2019s argument that the cause of action accrued on the day she received the death certificate, which placed her claim within the statute of limitations. The government presents no evidence and does not explain why a reasonable person in Mrs. Waggoner\u2019s position could have known or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>suspected the medical malpractice when Mr. Waggoner suffered his heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Although the district court correctly held that the accrual date could not be tolled until she knew the injury resulted from negligence, the facts indicate that the court erred in finding that Waggoner knew the cause of her husband\u2019s death at the time of his heart attack. Mrs. Waggoner\u2019s allegations are uncontroverted. The facts indicate that a reasonable person in her situation could not have reasonably known or suspected the medical malpractice. After undergoing various tests, the doctors repeatedly assured Mrs. Waggoner that her husband did not suffer from heart disease. Considering the allegations and evidence presented, and the government\u2019s failure to present any evidence disputing her allegations, we find that the district court clearly erred in finding that Waggoner knew of the cause of her husband\u2019s injury. Her claim did not accrue until she was \u201carmed with the facts about the harm done,\u201d giving her knowledge, suspicion, or the ability to discover the cause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This could have occurred no earlier than January 8, 1998, when the death certificate first brought to her attention that her husband had heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
