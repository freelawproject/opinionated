On appeal, Stephens has briefed only his challenge to the dismissal of his FTCA and <em>Bivens </em>claims seeking monetary damages for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. He has therefore abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of his other claims. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-23\">Stephens sought monetary damages in his FTCA and <em>Bivens </em>claims to compensate him for alleged mental suffering he attributed to the defendants\u2019 actions. As he did not allege a physical injury, his claims were barred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). His challenged claims were therefore properly dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-24\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
