We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Springfield, who was 15 years old at the time of his arrest, contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of a tape-recorded statement he made to police violated his rights because it was not voluntary. We conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that the statement was voluntary because it was not coerced was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Springfield also contends that the statement was not made upon a knowing and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that Springfield validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights under the totality of the circumstances was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 724-27, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b279-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
