The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) assigned Perez a final offense level of 38, based on the following calculations: (1) a base offense level of 38, because the conspiracy involved more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d), <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 201.1(c)(1); (2) a three-level enhancement, based on Perez\u2019s role as a manager or supervisor of a criminal activity involving five or more participants, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b); and (3) a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>former U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b)(2). In May 2001, Perez challenged various of the PSR\u2019s factual findings, prompting the district court (Mukasey, <em>C.J.) </em>to hold a hearing pursuant to <em>United States v. Fatico, </em>579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">At that hearing, after receiving testimony from a cooperating witness and law enforcement personnel, the district court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish that at least 1.5 kilograms of crack were involved. With respect to the three-level role enhancement, however, the court found that, while the evidence clearly established that Perez was a manager or supervisor, it did not suffice to show that the conspiracy involved five or more participants, as required. Consequently, Perez was given a iwo-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (\u201cIf the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity [involving fewer than five participants and not otherwise extensive], increase by two levels\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His final offense level was set at 37 and, in November 2001, the district court sentenced him to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">On appeal, Perez makes two arguments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, he submits that he was not a manager or supervisor within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.1, but rather simply \u201cone amongst equals,\u201d and therefore the two-level enhancement is improper. Second, Perez asserts that the district court erred in declining to give him a \u00a7 5K2.0 downward departure based on <em>United States v. Cordoba-Mwrgas, </em>233 F.3d 704, 709 (2d Cir.2000). In <em>Cordoba-Murgas, </em>this Court indicated that such a departure would be appropriate where an upward adjustment was required on the basis of conduct proved only by a preponderance, but about the existence of which the district court had \u201csubstantial doubts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reject both of Perez\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">First, with respect to the two-level enhancement, we examine the district court\u2019s conclusion that Perez deserved the \u00a7 3B1.1 adjustment <em>de novo, </em>but review the court\u2019s factual findings supporting this conclusion for clear error. <em>See United States v. Paccione, </em>202 F.3d 622, 624 (2d Cir.2000); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). The court below found, based on the testimony of another participant in the conspiracy, that Perez gave orders, filled in for the leader when the leader was away, acted \u201clike a second manager,\u201d and ultimately established his own company. We find no clear error in these determinations, which were bolstered by the testimony of a law en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>forcement official.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given these findings, a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) was proper. <em>See United States v. Blount, </em>291 F.3d 201, 217 (2d Cir.2002) (a \u201cmanager or supervisor [under \u00a7 3B1.1] exercised some degree of control over others involved in the commission of the offense ... or played a significant role in the decision to recruit or to supervise lower-level participants\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Second, Perez\u2019s downward departure argument is likewise unavailing. <em>Cf. Cordobar-Murgas, </em>233 F.3d at 709. While <em>Cordobar-Murgas </em>stated that a district court \u201cwould be authorized\u201d and \u201cretains discretion\u201d to depart downward, 233 F.3d at 709, some opinions have indicated \u2014 at least with respect to multiple adjustments \u2014 that district courts \u201cshould\u201d depart downward in certain circumstances. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Outen, </em>286 F.3d 622, 627 n. 1 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201c[Wjhere multiple adjustments, each based on a mere preponderance, resulted in a significant upward adjustment, \u2018a sentencing judge should require that the weight of the factual record justify a sentence within the adjusted Guidelines range\u2019 and depart downwardly if the record did not so justify.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Gigante, </em>94 F.3d 53, 56 (2d Cir.1996)); <em>see also United States v. Norris, </em>281 F.3d 357, 361-62 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201c[T]he court may examine whether the conduct underlying multiple upward adjustments was proven by a standard greater than that of preponderance, ... [and] where a higher standard, appropriate to a substantially enhanced sentence range, is not met, the court should depart downwardly.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We need not decide, however, whether there may be some situations in which a downward departure is required, because the basic prerequisites of <em>Cordobar-Murgas </em>are not present here. Therefore, we will not disturb the denial of Perez\u2019s downward departure motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and find them meritless. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-5\">. Perez also argued, in advance of the <em>Fatico </em>hearing, that the substance in which he trafficked did not meet the Guidelines\u2019 definition of crack, and that his proffer statements had been used improperly to increase his sentence. He does not press these objections on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\">. In other sentencing submissions, Perez had argued for downward departures based on his cooperation, his acceptance of responsibility, and extraordinary family circumstances, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. He further asserted that he should not have been placed in Criminal History category III. Like certain of the arguments he made prior to the <em>Fatico </em>hearing, these are not part of his present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">. Perez insists that much of this testimony should be disregarded as based on hearsay. But it is well-settled that at sentencing the district court is entitled to rely on evidence which would otherwise be inadmissible, so long as it reasonably concludes that the evidence is reliable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Reese, </em>33 F.3d 166, 174 (2d Cir.1994) (\"[Wjhen determining sentence, a sentencing court is free to consider hearsay evidence, evidence of uncharged crimes, dropped counts of an indictment and criminal activity resulting in acquittal.\u201d). Here, the district court permissibly concluded that the testimony was reliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
