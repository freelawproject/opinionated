Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d), who misappropriated approximately $5,000,000 from his brokerage firm\u2019s clients while acting as a stockbroker.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 7, 2000, the district court entered a permanent injunction pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>hibiting Smith from disposing of any of his assets and ordering Smith to disgorge all ill-gotten gains from his securities fraud. On October 18, 2000, the district court appointed Phillip S. Stenger (\u201cThe Receiver\u201d) as the Receiver over Smith\u2019s assets so as to marshal them for the benefit of the defrauded investors. On March 15, 2001, the Receiver filed a motion to rescind a Real Property Purchase Agreement that Smith had entered into with U.G. and Barbara Haynes (\u201cthe Hayneses\u201d) on August 14, 2000, when Smith had been under investigation by the SEC and the FBI and had been suspended from trading as a licensed broker by his firm. Under the terms of the Real Property Purchase Agreement, Smith agreed to purchase the \u201cCowpen\u201d property, which comprises the Hayneses\u2019 home and various rental properties located in Pike County, Kentucky, for a purchase price of $680,000. In particular, Smith agreed to pay the Hayneses $200,000 immediately, $100,000 on August 1st of years 2001 through 2003, and a payment of the balance of the $680,000 purchase price on August 1, 2004. Smith also agreed to permit the Hayneses to remain in their home rent-free for a period of four months following the date of the agreement. In exchange, the Hayneses agreed to give Smith a deed to the property and immediate possession of the property, including any rent owed for that property. The Hayneses acquired a vendor\u2019s lien on the property to insure Smith\u2019s payment of the remaining balance. Smith took possession of the deed and the vendor\u2019s hen, both of which were never recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In a memorandum opinion and order dated April 2, 2002, the district court granted the Receiver\u2019s rescission motion on the ground that the Real Property Purchase Agreement was a preferential conveyance in violation of Kentucky Revised Statute \u00a7 378.060.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court ordered the rescission of the Real Property Purchase Agreement as well as the invalidation of both the deed and the vendor\u2019s lien. In that memorandum, the district court, without expressly ordering so, held that the Hayneses must repay the Receiver the $200,000 down payment minus offsets for a donation that the Hayneses made to their church in reliance upon the sale, the insurance premiums that they paid to insure the property, and their expenses in beginning construction on a new home. The district court did not specify the exact amounts of these offsets. On April 15, 2002, the district court entered a final judgment: 1) ordering the title to the Cowpen Property to remain in the Haynes name, the rescission of the Real Property Purchase Agreement, and the invalidation of both the deed and the vendor\u2019s lien, per its April 2, 2002, order; and 2) ordering the Hayneses to pay the Receiver $183,025.28, an amount based upon the $200,000 down payment minus $10,000 for the church donation, $904.80 for the paid insurance premium, and $6,069.92 for construction expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">On April 25, 2002, the Hayneses filed a motion, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), for reconsideration of the Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ceiver\u2019s motion for rescission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the first time, the Hayneses argued that the Receiver did not specifically plead the applicability of KRS \u00a7 378.060 in its motion for rescission and, alternatively, that the Receiver\u2019s filing of that motion was untimely under the applicable statute of limitations. For the first time, the Hayneses also requested additional offsets for their loss in rent resulting from the Receiver\u2019s failure to collect such rent and for the cost of repairs to the Cowpen property \u201cdue to the Receiver\u2019s failure to take physical control of ... [such] property upon his appointment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">On July 25, 2002, the district court issued an order partly denying and partly granting the Hayneses\u2019 reconsideration motions. The district court declined to consider the Hayneses\u2019 arguments as to the particularity of the pleadings and the statute of limitations on the ground that they had failed to raise them in a timely manner. Yet, the court permitted the offsets for the rent that the Receiver failed to collect and the costs to repair the Cowpen property due to the Receiver\u2019s failure to take physical control of it. Without specifying the particular amounts of these additional offsets, the district court ordered the amendment of its April 15, 2002, disgorgement order to include them.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Hayneses appeal: 1) the district court\u2019s April 2, 2002, order rescinding the Real Property Purchase Agreement; 2) its April 15, 2002, judgment ordering the Hayneses to disgorge a portion of the $200,000 downpayment; 3) and its July 25, 2002, order denying their reconsideration motion\u2019s claims that the application of KRS \u00a7 378.060 was time-barred and that the Receiver had failed to plead this legal theory properly. The Hayneses also appeal the district judge\u2019s participation in the action on the ground that he should have <em>sun sponte </em>recused himself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). The Receiver, in turn, cross-appeals the district court\u2019s July 25, 2002, order partly granting the Hayneses\u2019 reconsideration motion by permitting the offsets for lost rent and property repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">We must first assure ourselves of our jurisdiction over these-appeals, even if the litigants have not raised the issue. <em>United States v. Jolivette, </em>257 F.3d 581, 583 (6th Cir.2001). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 provides, in part, that we have jurisdiction over \u201cappeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d Generally, a judgment is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1291 \u201cwhen the assessment of damages remains.\u201d <em>Woosley v. Avco Corp., </em>944 F.2d 313, 316 (6th Cir.1991) (citing <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 744, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976). which held that a grant of partial summary judgment on the limited issue of liability was not final under \u00a7 1291 \u201cwhere assessment of damages or awarding of other relief remains to be resolved\u201d). However, a judgment may be \u201cfinal if only ministerial [and uncontroversial] tasks in determining damages remain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316-17 (holding that an order granting recovery for the defendant employer\u2019s failure to reinstate the plaintiffs to their former positions but ordering the parties to stipulate to the requisite amount of backpay was a final decision within \u00a7 1291 because the stipulation concerning damages was \u201cministerial and uncontroversial\u201d); <em>see Durkin v. Mason &amp; Dixon Lines, </em>202 F.2d 425, 425 (6th Cir. 1953) (holding that an order granting recovery for the defendant\u2019s failure to pay overtime wages but providing that the particular amount of that recovery was subsequently to be determined based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>parties\u2019 previously-filed stipulation was a \u201cfinal order\u201d under \u00a7 1291 because it, nevertheless, \u201csettled all the equities between the parties and finally determined their rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Here, however, the assessment of the amounts of the offsets for property repairs and lost rent is neither ministerial nor uncontroversial. Thus, the district court\u2019s amended April 15, 2002, order permitting offsets for property repairs and lost rent is not a final decision with the meaning of \u00a7 1291. Additionally, neither Federal Rule of Civil 54(b) applies so as to render this decision final for purposes of \u00a7 1291, <em>see Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>424 U.S. at 743, nor 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 applies to afford us jurisdiction in limited cases of interlocutory decisions. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to hear the Hayneses\u2019 appeals or the Receiver\u2019s cross-appeal. We also lack jurisdiction to entertain the Hayneses\u2019 companion claim that the district judge should have recused himself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). <em>See Collier v. Picard, </em>237 F.2d 234, 234 (6th Cir.1956) (holding that jurisdiction exists to review an appeal from an order rejecting disqualification under \u00a7 455(a) only upon the proper appeal of an interlocutory order or a final decision in the proceeding in which the disqualification motion was filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">For the preceding reasons, we DISMISS the present appeals for a lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-17\">.
