In the instant petition Luna-Perez does not challenge the denial of her application for cancellation of removal, therefore, she has abandoned that argument. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-22\">Without citation to any authority, Luna-Perez argues that she did not make an \u201centry\u201d as required by \u00a7 1227(a)(a)(l)(E)(i), because she was not \u201cadmitted,\u201d as that term is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A). She asserts that under \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C), as a lawful permanent resident, she is not subject to being \u201cadmitted\u201d unless she, <em>inter alia, </em>committed an illegal activity after departing from the United States. She asserts that the evidence that she departed the United States to engage in an unlawful activity was inadmissible and that its admission without affording her an opportunity for cross-examination violated her right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-23\">The BIA rejected Luna-Perez\u2019s argument that \u201centry\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(E)(i) means \u201cadmission\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(13). Luna-Perez does not address the BIA\u2019s determination that for \u00a7 1227(a) (1) (E) (i), \u201centry\u201d means \u201cany entry within the commonly-understood meaning of that term,\u201d <em>ie., </em>crossing the border into the United States. Nor does Luna-Perez challenge the BIA\u2019s factual finding that she made an \u201centry\u201d based on her admission that she crossed the border into the United States before her arrest for alien smuggling. Because Luna-Perez has not briefed any argument challenging the BIA\u2019s decision, she has abandoned the only issue before this court. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833; <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-24\">The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Luna-Perez had made an \u201centry\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E) was not based on any evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>dence which would show that she engaged in illegal activities after departure. Thus, this court will not address whether the challenged evidence was admitted improperly or whether its use violated Luna-Perez\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Luna-Perez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. The Respondent has filed a motion for summary affirmance of the BIA\u2019s decision and various motions regarding briefing. The motions are DENIED as UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">PETITION DENIED; MOTIONS DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b98-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
