He also appeals the BIA\u2019s April 2003 denial of his motion to reconsider its November 20, 2002, decision. We hold that (1) this court lacks jurisdiction to hear his appeal of the November 20, 2002, decision, and (2) the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Petitioner is a native and citizen of Iran who sought admission to the United States at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport on November 1, 1999, when he was 14 years old. He was carrying a false passport. Petitioner applied for asylum, restriction on removal, and protection under the Convention against Torture, stating that if returned to Iran, he would be persecuted because of his father\u2019s job with the Iranian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">At a hearing on August 30, 2000, the IJ denied Petitioner\u2019s applications, finding no evidence that he would be persecuted if returned to Iran. Petitioner appealed the ruling to the BIA in September 2000; and on May 26, 2001, he requested the BIA to reopen his case and remand for a renewed asylum application based on his recent conversion to Christianity. He submitted no evidence of his conversion other than his own affidavit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">trines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">On November 20, 2002, the BIA issued an order (1) dismissing the appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision denying relief and (2) denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen and remand his case. The BIA concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence provided in support of [Petitioner\u2019s] motion does not persuade us that it [would] be worthwhile to develop this issue further at a plenary hearing on reopening.\u201d R. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">On December 20, 2002, Petitioner filed with the BIA a motion to reconsider its November 20, 2002, decision, alleging that his father had been granted asylum in this country and that he was eligible for derivative asylum. He also attached documents supporting his claim of a conversion to Christianity: (1) a certificate of baptism dated January 14, 2001; (2) a confirming letter from the minister; and (3) a statement by his father. On April 30, 2003, the BIA denied the motion. It concluded that the motion \u201cdoes not present any additional arguments, changes in law, or aspects of the case that were overlooked that would warrant reconsideration of our previous decision.\u201d R. 2. On May 30, 2003, Petitioner filed a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">A. Jurisdiction to Review Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">In his brief to this court, Petitioner asks us to consider the merits of the BIA\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">these proceedings, he has been identified as Mehran Mohtashemi. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>November 20, 2002, denial of his applications for asylum, restriction on removal, and protection under the Convention against Torture, as well as the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen proceedings. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), \u201cThe petition for review [of an order of removal] must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d A failure to file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decisions deprives us of jurisdiction. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 406, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>see also Nahatchevska v. Ashcroft, </em>317 F.3d 1226, 1227 (10th Cir.2003) (holding \u00a7 1252(b)(l)\u2019s 30-day time period to petition for review to be jurisdictional under Stone).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The BIA\u2019s decision became final, and the 30-day review period began running, on November 20, 2002. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.31 (order of deportation becomes final upon dismissal of appeal by BIA); <em>Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998, 1000 (10th Cir.2003) (applying \u00a7 1252(b)(l)\u2019s predecessor, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a, in holding that 30-day limitations period began to run on date of BIA\u2019s order, despite filing of motion to reconsider); <em>see also Onwuneme v. INS, </em>67 F.3d 273, 274 (10th Cir. 1995) (finding jurisdiction to review denial of motion to reopen because denial of motion constitutes final order of deportation). Petitioner did not file his petition for review until May 30, 2003, well beyond the 30-day review period. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the BIA\u2019s November 20, 2002, order, including both the affirmance of the IJ and the denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">B. Review of Denial of Motion to Reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Because Petitioner filed his petition for review with this court within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider, we have jurisdiction to review that order. We review a denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Belay-Gebru, </em>327 F.3d at 1000 &amp; n. 5. We hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Petitioner moved the BIA to reconsider its decision so that he could pursue derivative asylum under INA \u00a7 208(b)(3), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3), based on his father\u2019s recent grant of asylum in this country. Derivative asylum under \u00a7 1158(b)(3), however, is discretionary. \u201cA spouse or child ... of an alien who is granted asylum ... <em>may </em>... be granted the same status.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added). We therefore have no basis for overturning the BIA\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Petitioner argues before this court that he is entitled to <em>mandatory </em>derivative status under 8 C.F.R. 207.7 because his father was granted refugee status in addition to asylum. But Petitioner never raised this argument to the BIA in his motion for reconsideration. Thus, we will not consider it on appeal from the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">As for Petitioner\u2019s additional evidence concerning his conversion to Christianity, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider new evidence when there was no reason to believe it could not have been produced in support of Petitioner\u2019s initial motion for remand. <em>Cf </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2) (restricting relief from judgment on ground of newly discovered evidence to cases in which evidence could not have been discovered by due diligence in time for motion for new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">We DISMISS Petitioner\u2019s appeal of the BIA\u2019s order of November 20, 2002, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>AFFIRM the BIA\u2019s order of April 30, 2003.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.
