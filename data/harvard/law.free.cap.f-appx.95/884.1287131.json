We deny the petition for review. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">1. We have rejected the contention that the Affirmance Without Opinion (AWO) or \u201cstreamlining\u201d procedure, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7), violates due process. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850 (9th Cir.2003). Nor did streamlining deny petitioner the regulatory right to an administrative appeal conferred by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b). An affirmance without an opinion <em>is </em>a form of appeal. Finally, petitioner\u2019s claim that \u00a7 1003.1(b) requires appeal to a three-judge panel of the BIA has no basis in the language of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">2. Portillo argues that his case could not, and that no asylum or withholding of removal case could, properly be streamlined, because such cases invariably involve a \u201cnovel fact situation.\u201d \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii)(A). As we explained in <em>Falcon Carriche, </em>this argument misunderstands what \u201cnovel fact situation\u201d means. <em>See Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 852 (\u201c[Wlhile the facts of each case are different, the legally significant facts often fall into recognizable patterns, and ... where this occurs, a novel fact situation may not be presented.\u201d (quoting 64 Fed.Reg. at 56,140 (Oct. 18, 1999))). Moreover, the regulation allows affirmance without opinion when an appeal <em>either </em>does not present a novel fact situation <em>or </em>when \u201cthe factual and legal questions raised on appeal are so insubstantial that three-Member review is not warranted,\u201d \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii)(B), so even novel fact situations can be streamlined under the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\">3. In AWO cases, we review the decision of the immigration judge (IJ) as the decision of the Board. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii); <em>Carrillo-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>353 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir.2003). Because the IJ denied relief on the basis of her adverse credibility finding, we review that finding for substantial evidence. <em>Id.; Singh v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1017, 1020 (9th Cir.2002). As the IJ found several elements of Portillo\u2019s application and testimony not credible, we must examine each such element. <em>See Cardenas v. INS, </em>294 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>F.3d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.2002) (finding basis for relief in credible claims notwithstanding incredible ones).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Having reviewed the record, we determine that, while some of the inconsistencies cited by the IJ might have been immaterial or otherwise not probative of Portillo\u2019s credibility, the large number of inconsistencies within the petitioner\u2019s testimony, and between his testimony and his application, in particular with respect to the most important elements of his testimony, are such as a \u201creasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d that the petitioner was not credible. <em>See Bonnichsen v. United States, </em>357 F.3d 962, 977 n. 19 (9th Cir.2004) (defining the substantial evidence standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Portillo repeatedly testified that the protest at which he was arrested was held in late July 1993, even though the president he claimed to have been protesting left office by June 5 of that year. His testimony regarding his political affiliation, on the one hand, and that of President Jorge Serrano, on the other, against whom he stated he was protesting, was self-contradictory. Further, his testimony contradicted his prior asylum application regarding the nature of his political views.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Given these contradictions, we cannot say that the IJ lacked substantial evidence for her conclusions that Portillo was never wounded by agents of the Guatemalan government, that he therefore had no well-founded fear of persecution, and that he did not likely face torture upon his return to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">There was substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Without the testimony the IJ declined to credit, the petitioner failed to provide substantial evidence that he is entitled to any of the forms of relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">4. Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to the filing of the motion for stay of removal, and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
