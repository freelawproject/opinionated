Because he did not move for a judgment of acquittal below, our review is limited to a determination whether there was a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>87 F.3d 133, 136 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotation and citation omitted). We conclude that the testimony of Wilson\u2019s co-defendants was not factually insubstantial or incredible, and therefore it was sufficient to support his convictions. <em>See United States v. Medina, </em>161 F.3d 867, 872-73 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Greenwood, </em>974 F.2d 1449, 1458 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cAssessing the credibility of witnesses and weighing the evidence is the exclusive province of the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-23\">Because the cocaine was found in a hidden compartment of a vehicle, Wilson argues that the district court erred by not including an instruction on guilty knowledge. Plain error review applies because counsel did not request the instruction and did not object to the instructions given. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>281 F.3d 168, 183 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1105, 122 S.Ct. 2313, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002). Because the instructions given followed this court\u2019s Pattern Jury Instructions, and because the jury was properly instructed on the substantive offenses, we conclude that Wilson has not shown that the district court plainly erred. <em>See United States v. Cano-Guel, </em>167 F.3d 900, 905 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-24\">Appellant\u2019s brief also includes several pro se issues briefed by Wilson rather than counsel. Although included with counsel\u2019s brief, counsel has not adopted these issues. Wilson does not have a \u201cconstitutional right to hybrid representation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ogbonna, </em>184 F.3d 447, 449 n. 1 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>5th Cir. R. 28.7 (\u201cUnless specifically directed by court order, pro se motions, briefs or correspon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>dence will not be filed if the party is represented by counsel.\u201d). Therefore, we do not consider these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b96-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
