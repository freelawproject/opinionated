Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-21\">This controversy is again before this court after our remand directing the district court to allow discovery on whether Seldowitz could seek changes to internal review records compiled by the State Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General. As the facts of this case are thoroughly recounted in our previous decision, <em>Seldowitz v. Office of the Inspector General, </em>No. 00-1142, 2001 WL 1742098 (4th Cir. Nov. 13, 2000) <em>cert. denied </em>534 U.S. 813, 122 S.Ct. 38, 151 L.Ed.2d 11 (2001), we will sketch them only briefly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">Seldowitz is a veteran Foreign Service Officer in the United States Department of State. In 1990, the Office of Audits of the State Department\u2019s Inspector General reviewed travel vouchers submitted by a delegation to the Nuclear Space Talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Seldowitz and his wife were a part of this Geneva delegation. Based on its review, the Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) investigated Seldowitz for submitting a false claim against the United States as a result of amounts claimed on his travel voucher. The findings of the investigation were turned over to the United States Attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of Virginia, and in 1995, the United States Attorney notified Seldowitz that he was contemplating a civil prosecution under the False Claims Act. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3729-33 (West 2003). After meeting with officials from the State Department, the OIG, and the United States Attorney\u2019s office to discuss the possible civil prosecution, Seldowitz entered into a settlement agreement with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-23\">Seldowitz later requested copies of his travel vouchers from the National Finance Center and, in March 1998, after reviewing these materials, he requested that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>State Department records be amended pursuant to the Privacy Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552a (West.1996 &amp; Supp.2003). Specifically, Seldowitz requested that the records \u201cbe amended in order to accurately reflect that Mr. Seldowitz properly followed all Department procedures when submitting his voucher requests.\u201d <em>Seldowitz, </em>2000 WL 1742098 at <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>2 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Office of Information Resources Management responded that it would be improper to consider amending the records because the Integrity Committee of the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency was investigating a complaint filed by Seldowitz regarding the OIG investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">On April 19, 1998, Seldowitz filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and amended the complaint on August 13, 1998.* Seldowitz alleged that the government violated the Privacy Act by failing to maintain accurate records, wrongfully threatening a False Claims act prosecution and coercing a settlement, and improperly refusing to amend records. The records Seldowitz sought to amend were: (1) the OIG records compiled while the OIG was investigating Seldowitz for a possible False Claims Act violation; (2) the records compiled by the OIG Office of Audits; and (3) the OIG internal review records responding to allegations of OIG misconduct regarding its investigation of the Geneva delegation\u2019s travel vouchers. The district court dismissed two counts on statute of limitations grounds, and later granted summary judgment in favor of the government as to all three sets of records that Seldowitz sought to amend. Seldowitz appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">On appeal, this court affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that two of Seldowitz\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations. We further affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to the audit records and records of the investigation. However, we reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the internal records and remanded for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">On remand, the district court directed discovery on the issues identified by this court. On October 18, 2001, Seldowitz filed a motion to amend his complaint to add, as an additional count, an allegation that he was improperly forced to accept a settlement to avoid possible liability under the False Claims Act. A magistrate judge granted Seldowitz\u2019s motion, but the OIG appealed that decision to the district court. The district court reversed the magistrate judge\u2019s decision and denied the motion to amend because the proposed count exceeded the limited scope of the case on remand and because the amendment would be a nullity in that the proposed claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">During the proceedings that followed, Seldowitz conducted discovery on the issues identified by this court in its remand. While discovery was proceeding, Seldowitz noticed a deposition under Rule 30(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. According to the notice, the deposition was to take place on February 15, 2002. Some time before the deposition was to occur, counsel for the OIG informed Seldowitz that she would be unable to attend because she was scheduled to appear before the district court on another matter. Despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>being informed of this fact and receiving a copy of the government\u2019s motion for a protective order under Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Seldowitz convened the deposition and incurred the costs incident thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">On March 8, 2002, Seldowitz filed a motion seeking an award of sanctions \u2014 equal to the cost associated with convening the deposition \u2014 under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(d). Under questioning by the magistrate judge, however, Seldowitz confessed that he convened the deposition despite his foreknowledge of opposing counsel\u2019s inability to attend and that he did so to make a point. Based on these facts, the magistrate judge determined that sanctions were inappropriate. Upon review, the district court concurred, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">[t]he record demonstrates that the Defendant notified the Plaintiff at least three times prior to the deposition date that Defendant could not attend. Plaintiff never attempted to reschedule the date. There is no indication of bad faith or fault on the Defendant\u2019s part that caused Plaintiff harm. Any financial injury incurred by the Plaintiff was purely by his own design.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Supp. J.A. 397 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Following discovery, a non-jury trial on the claims involving the internal records was held. The district court entered an order for the OIG, finding that, as a matter of fact, the Internal Review Records of the Special Inquiry had been destroyed, and concluding that the Special Inquiry Seldowitz sought to amend was not retrievable within a \u201csystem of records\u201d as that term of art is used in the context of the Privacy Act. Thus, the court held that Seldowitz was not entitled to amend any of the OIG\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Seldowitz thereafter sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees, ai'guing that he \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d in the case below. The district court denied Seldowitz\u2019s motion, finding that Seldowitz</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">did not receive any relief for his claims under the Privacy Act, nor did he receive the relief requested in his Amended Complaint. [Seldowitz] sought to compel the amendment of a record which contained the suggestion that he violated the False Claims Act \u2014 he did not meet this objective as judgment was for [the OIG]. [Seldowitz] received absolutely no judicial relief on his Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">J.A. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">On appeal, Seldowitz contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to amend the complaint, denying his motion for sanctions, and denying his motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We have carefully reviewed the record and considered the parties\u2019 arguments, as set forth in their briefs and as made at oral argument. For the reasons given by the district court in its various rulings, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-5\"> The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on June 30, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
