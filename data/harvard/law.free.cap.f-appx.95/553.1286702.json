In his petition, Davis argued that he was actually innocent of the assault charge because he lacked the requisite <em>mens rea </em>and that he was denied due process during the plea proceedings because the district court participated in plea negotiations. Because these challenges involve errors occurring at trial, the district court properly construed the petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Davis contends that he is entitled to proceed under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because he has shown he was actually innocent of the assault offense. Davis has not met his burden of showing that he meets the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He has not pointed to a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that he may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law. <em>See Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 950, 157 L.Ed.2d 763 (2003). Davis also has not shown that his claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his conviction, appeal, or prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>Davis\u2019s reliance on <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 326-27, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995), is unavailing; the district court did not rely on a state procedural bar to deny relief on Davis\u2019s claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b586-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
