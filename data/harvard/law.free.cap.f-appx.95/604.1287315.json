Stevenson urges this court to reconsider the constitutionality of suspicionless roadblock stops in light of Justice Thomas\u2019s dissent in <em>City of Indianappolis v. Edmond, </em>531 U.S. 32, 56, 121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting). He also argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 was rendered facially unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Stevenson concedes that his arguments are foreclosed, and he raises the issues only to preserve them for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">A panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999). No such decision exists. Accordingly, Stevenson\u2019s arguments are indeed foreclosed. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief. In its motion, the Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b636-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
