Jefferson contends that his motion raises issues which may be raised at any time because they put at issue the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Because Jefferson\u2019s Motion for Writ of Mandamus attacked errors that occurred at trial or sentencing, it was properly construed by the district court as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1998). Jefferson has already applied for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to no avail, and this court has refused to permit Jefferson to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Jefferson has not obtained leave of this court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Jefferson\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
