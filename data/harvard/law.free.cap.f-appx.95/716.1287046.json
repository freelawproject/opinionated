We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">The district court did not err in denying Wahab\u2019s challenge to his 2003 deportation proceeding as Wahab had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See also Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 385-86 (5th Cir.2001). Nor did the district court err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction over Wahab\u2019s challenge to his 1998 deportation. The transitional rules of the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) apply to Wahab\u2019s 1998 deportation order because the removal proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997, and concluded more than thirty days after September 30, 1996. <em>Goonsuwan, </em>252 F.3d at 386. Under the preIIRIRA law that was incorporated into the transitional rules, district courts were deprived of subject-matter jurisdiction to review orders of deportation after the alien was deported. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 491-92 (5th Cir.2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c)(1994)(repealed 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-24\">There was no gross miscarriage of justice in Wahab\u2019s 1998 deportation proceeding and his subsequent deportation. <em>Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 491-92. The district court therefore lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Wahab\u2019s challenge to his 1998 deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
