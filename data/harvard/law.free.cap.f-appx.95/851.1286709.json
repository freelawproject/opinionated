We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-26\">The facts are known to the parties and are recited only briefly. The Reillys brought an action alleging that they suffered monetary losses as a result of defendants\u2019 violations of federal securities laws and various California state laws. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration. A panel of National Association of Securities Dealers conducted an arbitration hearing and issued an award denying the Reillys\u2019 claims. The district court confirmed the arbitration award. The Reillys now appeal the district court\u2019s confirmation award, arguing that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they agreed to arbitrate. The Reillys contend that there is a factual dispute as to whether they saw or received Page 2 of the \u201capplication to open an investment account,\u201d which contained the actual arbitration clause. The Reillys do not dispute that they signed their names on Page 3, under a statement that acknowledges that they had \u201cread, received, and agreed to the predispute arbitration section\u201d of the investment account agreement. The Reillys contend that the arbitration panel\u2019s decision should be vacated and a jury trial convened to determine whether the parties had an enforceable agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">A district court\u2019s confirmation of an arbitration award is reviewed \u201clike any other district court decision ... accepting findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous but deciding questions of law de novo.\u201d <em>Coutee v. Barington Capital Group, </em>336 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Barnes v. Logan, </em>122 F.3d 820, 821 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The Federal Arbitration Act provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. Courts have interpreted 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 to require a jury trial \u201conly if there is a triable issue concerning the existence or scope of the agreement.\u201d <em>Saturday Evening Post Co. v. Rumbleseat Press, </em>816 F.2d 1191, 1196 (7th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">\u201cTo evaluate the validity of an arbitration agreement, federal courts \u2018should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ingle v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1165, 1170 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>First Options of Chi, Inc. v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995)). The Reillys commenced this action in California. We therefore evaluate the arbitration agreement under California law. <em>See id.; Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Mantor, </em>335 F.3d 1101, 1106 n. 9 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">In response to the defendants\u2019 motion to confirm the arbitration award, the Reillys contend there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they agreed to arbitrate. The defendants produced a copy of the investment account agreement, which contains the Reillys\u2019 signatures acknowledging that they had \u201cread, received, and agreed to the predispute arbitration section\u201d of the agreement. The burden is then upon the Reillys to produce specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether they agreed to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The Reillys have failed to produce specific facts showing a triable issue of material fact regarding the validity of the arbitration agreement. The Reillys submitted declarations stating that they had never seen, read, or approved the disputed page containing the actual arbitration clause. Assuming the truth of these declarations, no triable issue exists. Under California law, a party can be bound by an arbitration clause even if he failed to read or understand it. <em>Bolanos v. Khalatian, </em>231 Cal.App.3d 1586, 283 Cal.Rptr. 209, 211, (1991); <em>Madden v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, </em>17 Cal.3d 699, 131 Cal.Rptr. 882, 889, 552 P.2d 1178 (1976). The Reillys do not dispute that the disputed page exists; instead, they claim that the arbitration agreement is invalid because they did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>not receive a copy of the page containing the actual arbitration clause. Under California law, the terms of an incorporated contract provision must be easily available to the contracting parties. <em>Slaught v. Bencomo Roofing Co., 25 </em>Cal.App.4th 744, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 618, 621 (1994). The record indicates that copies of the arbitration agreement were easily available to the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The district court\u2019s order confirming the arbitration award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b883-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
