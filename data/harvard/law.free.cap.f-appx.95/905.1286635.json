The petitioner\u2019s sole contention is that the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cwithout opinion\u201d does not comport with due process. This contention is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-51 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that the BIA does not violate due process by affirming pursuant to its streamlining regulations an immigration judge\u2019s decision without issuing an opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741(9th Cir.2004) petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was granted, or continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b937-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
