This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely filed notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite to appellate review. <em>Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">More than ten days after the entry of judgment, but within the 30-day time for filing a notice of appeal, Robertson filed a \u201cMotion to Rescind,\u201d construed as a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Robertson simultaneously filed a \u201cNotice of Appeal,\u201d which stated that Robertson wished to appeal the district court\u2019s judgment only in the event that his \u201cMotion to Rescind\u201d was not granted. Thus, the primary relief sought in Robertson\u2019s \u201cMotion to Rescind\u201d and in his \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d was reconsideration of the district court\u2019s judgment. Robertson\u2019s \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d was not a sufficient notice of appeal, as it did not clearly evince Robertson\u2019s intent to appeal. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660. Because there was no timely notice of appeal, this court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal and it is DISMISSED. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-18\">APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b136-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
