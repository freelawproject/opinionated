Mr. Kim is also a high school graduate and a veteran of the Korean Army. In 1984, the Korean government appropriated Mr. Kim\u2019s land for public use. He received compensation in the amount of $300,000. Instead of relocating within Korea, he and his family decided to emigrate to the United States. On the advice of a fellow veteran of the Korean army, Mr. Kim visited a travel agency in Seoul to obtain the necessary documentation. He ultimately paid the agency $25,000 and provided it with a copy of his most recent Korean census papers. The agency, in turn, filled out an immigrant visa and alien registration application for Kim. The application contained questions written in both English and Korean. Representatives of the agency transcribed the answers in English, a language the Kims neither spoke nor read. The application stated that Mr. Kim was the beneficiary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>a P4-1 petition (as the married son of a United States citizen) and that his wife was the beneficiary of a P4-2 petition (as the spouse of an alien classified as a P4-1). The application stated that the Kims intended to join Mr. Kim\u2019s mother in New York City, and that they were being sponsored by Mr. Kim\u2019s sister. However, Mr. Kim did not have any relatives in the United States. Nonetheless, both Mr. and Mrs. Kim signed the application, and the agency provided them with P4-1 and P4-2 visas respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The Kims subsequently entered the United States in January 1985 and eventually settled in the Philadelphia area. Thirteen years later, in 1998, the Immigration and Nationalization Service<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> initiated removal proceedings against the Kims, alleging that they were inadmissible at the time of entry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A), and that they procured their visas through fraud or willful misrepresentation in violation of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). After a hearing on the matter, the IJ found that the Kims were removable on both grounds. He also found that the Kims did not provide credible testimony and therefore lacked the moral character necessary for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For these reasons, the IJ ordered the Kims removed from the United States. The Kims appealed to the BIA, which issued a <em>per curiam </em>order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7) (2002), thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). The Kims filed this timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The Kims raise several issues on appeal and we will deal with each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">A. Recusal</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">First, the Kims assert that the IJ erred by denying their motion to recuse. The motion was based on the fact that the IJ had presided over an earlier removal proceeding against their daughter. Specifically, the Kims argue that the IJ had already made up his mind as to the admissibility of several State Department documents <em>(see infra </em>Section IIC), which prevented him from taking a fresh look at the evidence and properly considering their challenges to its admissibility. We review the denial of a recusal motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom Inc., </em>224 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Under ordinary circumstances, \u201can [IJ\u2019s] rulings in the same or similar cases do not ... form a basis upon which to allege bias.\u201d <em>Matter of Exame, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 303, 306, 1982 WL 190694 (BIA 1982). As the BIA noted in <em>Exame:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">As a general rule, in order to warrant a finding that an immigration judge is disqualified from hearing a case it must be demonstrated that the immigration judge had a personal, rather than judicial, bias stemming from an \u201cextrajudicial\u201d source which resulted in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the immigration judge learned from his participation in the case. An exception to the general rule that bias must stem from an \u201cextrajudicial\u201d source may arise where \u201csuch pervasive bias and prejudice is shown by otherwise judicial conduct as would constitute bias against a party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In this case, there are no allegations of extrajudicial or personal bias. Moreover, there is no evidence of \u201cpervasive bias and prejudice\u201d arising out of the IJ\u2019s judicial conduct. In fact, during the hearing, the IJ listened to the objections made by the Kims\u2019 counsel, but ultimately found that the evidence was admissible. Although we find that the IJ\u2019s ruling was incorrect in this instance <em>(see infra </em>Section IIC), that conclusion can not be interpreted as suggesting that the IJ harbored any bias against the Kims. Accordingly, we conclude that the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying the recusal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">B. Statute of Limitation</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">For the first time in this petition, the Kims also assert that the government is time barred from instituting removal proceedings against them pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256(a), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">If, at any time <em>within five years </em>after the status of a person has been otherwise adjusted under the provisions of section 1255 or 1259 of this title or any other provision of law to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the person was not in fact eligible for such adjustment of status, the Attorney General shall rescind the action taken granting an adjustment of status to such person and cancelling removal in the case of such person if that occurred and the person shall thereupon be subject to all provisions of this chapter to the same extent as if the adjustment of status had not been made. Nothing in this subsection shall require the Attorney General to rescind the alien\u2019s status prior to commencement of procedures to remove the alien under section 1229a of this title, and an order of removal issued by an immigration judge shall be sufficient to rescind the alien\u2019s status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">(emphasis added). Before addressing the merits of the Kims\u2019 claim, we must first determine our own jurisdiction. Ordinarily, \u201cif a petitioner wishes to preserve an issue for appeal, he must first raise it in the proper administrative forum.\u201d <em>Tejedar-Mata v. INS, </em>626 F.2d 721, 726 (9th Cir.1980) (citations omitted). While there is a limited exception for constitutional due process claims that cannot be resolved at the administrative level, \u201c[d]ue process is not a talismanic term which guarantees review in this court of procedural errors correctable by the administrative tribunal.\u201d <em>Marrero v. INS, </em>990 F.2d 772, 778 (3d Cir.1990) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted in <em>Liu v. Waters, </em>55 F.3d 421, 426 (9th Cir.1995): \u201cIf the exhaustion requirement is to serve its purpose, we must not allow the exception for constitutional questions to swallow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>rule. The key is to distinguish the procedural errors, constitutional or otherwise, that are correctable by the administrative tribunal from those that lie outside the BIA\u2019s ken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In this case, although the Kims argue that their statute of limitation claim raises due process concerns, there is no question that the issue could have initially been raised and resolved at the administrative level. In <em>Bamidele v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 557 (3d Cir.1996), the petitioner entered the country legally as a non-immigrant visitor. He subsequently participated in a sham marriage and, on that basis, was granted an adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident. More than five years thereafter, the INS initiated deportation proceedings against the petitioner based on the fraudulent marriage. Following a hearing on the matter, an immigration judge ordered the petitioner deported, and the decision was upheld by the BIA. The petitioner then sought review in this court, and for the first time raised a statute of limitation claim under \u00a7 1256(a). We initially remanded the case, in part, because the issue of the applicability of the limitation period \u201chad not [been] fully briefed and considered by the [BIA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560. Upon remand, the BIA determined that the five-year limitation for recession of adjustment of status under \u00a7 1256(a) did not preclude initiation of deportation proceedings, and the petitioner again sought appellate review. Because he had exhausted his administrative remedies at that point, we were able to consider the merits of his claim and ultimately determined that the limitation period did in fact prohibit the INS from initiating deportation proceedings based exclusively on fraud in obtaining an adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">This case, of course, poses a significantly different question than the one raised in <em>Bamidele. </em>Unlike the petitioner in <em>Bamidele, </em>the Kims did not obtain an adjustment of status; rather, they are charged with being inadmissible at the time of entry. Therefore, the outcome of this case is not mandated by our prior decision. Although we may ultimately disagree with the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1256(a), as we did in <em>Bamidele, </em>the issue is not properly before us, and we will not usurp the agency\u2019s authority by considering the issue in the first instance. Therefore, we will remand the case to the BIA for a determination of the applicability of the five-year limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">C. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The Kims challenge the admission of two pieces of evidence submitted by the Government, which they contend were unauthenticated and unreliable. First, the Kims object to the admission of a November 23, 1994 letter from John H. Good, the acting official in charge of the United States Embassy in Seoul, Korea. The Good letter describes a \u201cvisa scam\u201d operating out of the Embassy in the mid-1980s. The letter goes on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">A variation of the scam involved the cancellation of an immigrant visa by [a Foreign Service National] employee, informing the U.S. Consular Officer of such cancellation (explaining that the visa had been typed incorrectly or perhaps had been mangled in the printing process) and would record such in the immigration log book. However, unless the U.S. officer physically cancelled the visa, the FSN employee would then deliver the document to an immigration agency who would \u201cissue\u201d the \u201ccan-celled\u201d visa to their client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Reply Brief, Appendix. The letter states that this scheme was used to procure the fraudulent visas provided to the Kims. The second piece of evidence is a faxed copy of a March 6, 1998 letter from Robert H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Seibold of the Immigration Visa Branch, Consular Section, American Embassy, Seoul, Korea. The letter indicates that the visa numbers assigned to the Kims were invalid. A page from the Embassy log book is attached to the faxed letter. The IJ admitted both pieces of evidence with little discussion, simply stating that the Good letter was on \u201cgovernment stationary\u201d (A.R. 221)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that both documents were \u201ccommuniques from the United States Embassy.\u201d A.R. 215. Whether these documents were properly admitted is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Valansi v. Ashcroft, </em>278 F.3d 203, 207 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We begin with the general premise that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in the immigration context. Rather, \u201c[t]he test for admissibility of evidence ... is whether the evidence is probative and whether its use is fundamentally fair so as not to deprive the alien of due process of law.\u201d <em>Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, </em>325 F.3d 396, 405 (3d Cir.2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTherefore, our analysis as to whether an individual\u2019s constitutional rights are violated turns on whether the evidence considered by the BIA is reliable and trustworthy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On several occasions we have held that State Department letters, such as the ones submitted here, cannot sustain an adverse decision by the BIA. <em>Li Wu Lin v. INS, </em>238 F.3d 239, 246 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he Board\u2019s decisions cannot be sustained simply by invoking the State Department\u2019s authority.\u201d); <em>Ezeagwuna, </em>325 F.3d at 407 (same). As we noted in <em>Li Wu Lin, </em>the procedural safeguards ensured by appellate review \u201cwould be destroyed if the [BIA] could justify its decisions simply by invoking assertions by the State Department that themselves provide no means for evaluating their validity.\u201d 238 F.3d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">This case demonstrates the problematic nature of unsubstantiated State Department letters. As an initial matter, we cannot verify the scope of Messrs. Good and Seibold\u2019s duties, how they obtained the information communicated in their respective letters, or whether their sources were reliable. For that matter, we cannot even confirm that they actually authored or approved the letters. These are fundamental issues that go to the heart of the letters\u2019 reliability and trustworthiness. Such fundamental questions can not be resolved simply by relying on the fact that the letters are on State Department letterhead.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we find that the Good and Seibold letters are inadmissable, and the IJ should not have relied upon them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">D. Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">Credibility findings must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Balasubramanrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. ...\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>other words, \u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In this case, the IJ found that both Mr. and Mrs. Kim failed to provide credible testimony and therefore lacked the moral character necessary for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In order to fully appreciate the credibility determinations of the IJ, it is necessary to quote his opinion in some detail. The IJ explained his adverse credibility ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">The male respondent is an intelligent man. He is a high school graduate, a former soldier, and a businessman who owned a gas station. It is not plausible to the Court that he would not investigate the possibility of coming to the United States and inquire into the way of legally entering this country. It is not credible to the Court when he tells me that he put all of his faith and trust as well as 25,000 dollars in the hands of a travel agent which was recommended to him by an army buddy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">It only makes sense that an individual such as respondent would want to know how this travel agency he was utilizing was going to proceed on his behalf in return for the 25,000 dollars paid to them. Moreover, I would imagine that the respondent would be suspicious that such a large amount of money would be required to emigrate to the United States, if, indeed, he had no idea that what he was about to embark on was illegal. His testimony that he knew nothing about how to come to the United States is dubious. His testimony that he made no attempt to find out about the proper method of coming here other than by contacting a travel agent is even more in doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">The Court finds that the respondent\u2019s testimony that he did not read the printed warning written in Korean language before signing the visa application is implausible. The respondent, after all, was a businessman and surely would not sign documents without first reading them. If he had read the warning about false and misleading statements, it is reasonable to believe [that] he would have someone in the travel agency review the document with him to make sure that the contents were correct. It is not plausible to the Court that the respondent would not have reviewed the portion of the application which he could read in Korean. This is a document which he was to sign and whose preparation [cost] 25,000 United States Dollars, a substantial sum today in the United States and even a more substantial sum in Korea in the year 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">Had the respondent reviewed his application, he surely would have noted that there were names filled in in response to Questions 16 and 17. He would likewise have read in Korean that these questions relate to who he was going to join in the United States and who had petitioned for [him]. This should have led to questions from the respondent as to what answers were filled in in response to these questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>A.R. 108-10. Although the IJ\u2019s reasoning satisfies the substantial evidence standard with respect to Mr. Kim, it is woefully inadequate insofar as supporting an adverse credibility ruling as to Mrs. Kim. In contrast to the detailed reasons specified for disbelieving Mr. Kim, the IJ\u2019s rejection of Mrs. Kim\u2019s testimony is cursory in the extreme. The IJ simply states: \u201cThe respondent\u2019s wife basically testified the same as her husband had testified.\u201d A.R. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We would have trouble with dismissing Mrs. Kim\u2019s testimony in such a summary fashion even if the summary were an accurate description of Mrs. Kim\u2019s testimony. However, the IJ\u2019s rationale for ruling against Mrs. Kim is even more tenuous. The explanation is simply wrong. The IJ either completely ignores her testimony or simply misstates it.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Mrs. Kim\u2019s testimony is certainly not \u201cthe same as her husband\u2019s\u201d as the IJ declares. Mrs. Kim testified that she did not know how much her husband paid for the visas until he testified at the hearing, because she was not involved with the family\u2019s finances. This directly undermines one the IJ\u2019s primary reasons for doubting the Kims\u2019 credibility: the fact that a substantial amount of money was paid for the visas, which, according to the IJ, should have triggered some suspicion as to the legality of the documents. In addition, the IJ failed to take into account cross-cultural differences that may explain Mrs. Kim\u2019s limited knowledge of the circumstances under which the family\u2019s visas were obtained. <em>See Perez-Alvarez v. INS, </em>857 F.2d 23, 24-25(1st Cir.1988); <em>Chouchkov v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1077, 1083 n. 15 (9th Cir.2000). Specifically, Mrs. Kim testified that in Korea, when a man does something, his wife does not question his actions. On its face, that testimony can hardly be characterized as incredible or surprising. Yet, the IJ merely rejected Mrs. Kim\u2019s testimony because he had reason to disbelieve her husband. The IJ did this without so much as considering Mrs. Kim\u2019s description of the male-dominated culture of South Korea. We therefore find that the IJ\u2019s rejection of Mrs. Kim\u2019s credibility is not supported by substantial evidence on this record, and we will remand the case for a credibility finding as to Mrs. Kim.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The IJ\u2019s inquiry into her credibility will, of course, give appropriate consideration to any factual and cultural circumstances surrounding her involvement in obtaining her visa. Moreover, the IJ must separately determine her eligibility for relief under \u00a7 1229b(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Based on the foregoing analysis, we will remand the Kims\u2019 petition to the BIA for a determination as to the applicability of the five-year limitation period under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256(a) and an individualized inquiry into Mrs. Kim\u2019s credibility. With respect to the latter, the Board must \u201cprovide a comprehensible reason for its decision sufficient for us to conduct our review and be assured that [Mrs. Kim\u2019s] case received individualized attention,\u201d and inquiry. <em>Paramasamy v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 1047, 1050-01 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is, of course, exceedingly important that the inquiry not be affected by any subliminal residual taint from Mr. Kim\u2019s testimony. Therefore, although \u201c[w]e recognize that the assignment of an immigration judge is within the province of the Attorney General,\u201d <em>id., </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>1055, n. 4, we strongly recommend that Mrs. Kim\u2019s hearing on remand will be reassigned to a different IJ. \u201cThe parties would be far better served by the assignment to those proceedings of a different IJ.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\">.

There is no question that the Kims\u2019 visas were fraudulent, because they were based on a falsity (i.e., that they had United States citizen relatives petitioning for their admission). Thus, the Kims were inadmissible at the time of entry, which makes them removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A). The question in dispute is whether the couple made willful misrepresentations, which also make them removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). If they are removable based on the latter provision, they would be ineligible for relief under \u00a7 1229b(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">.
