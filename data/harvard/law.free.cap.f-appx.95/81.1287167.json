The district court\u2019s dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo. See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 274-75 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-24\">To establish that he has been denied access to court, a prisoner must show actual prejudice in his ability to pursue a legal claim. <em>See Walker v. Navarro County Jail, </em>4 F.3d 410, 413 (5th Cir.1993). Morris has not shown that his position as a litigant has been prejudiced in any way, and, as the district court determined, his claim fails. <em>See id. </em>The appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Both the district court\u2019s dismissal and this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Morris is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
