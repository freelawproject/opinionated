We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-26\">On October 11, 2002 this court dismissed Cooper\u2019s appeal because, as a fugitive, he was not entitled to an appeal as of right. <em>See United States v. Freelove, </em>816 F.2d 479, 480 (9th Cir.1987). Nevertheless, the court granted Cooper 42 days to self-surrender and move for reinstatement of his appeal. <em>See id. </em>The court subsequently reinstated Cooper\u2019s appeal, but ordered further briefing on whether this appeal should be dismissed because Cooper was arrested and did not self-surrender. We conclude that this appeal should be dismissed. <em>See Parretti v. United States, </em>143 F.3d 508, 511 (9th Cir.1998) (recognizing court\u2019s discretion to dismiss appeal by fugitive as a matter of equity, out of concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>for enforcement of judgment, and for deterrent effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">DISMISSED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b263-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-20\">.
