For the first time on appeal, Hernandez-Simental argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be treated as an element of the offense, charged in the indictment, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-24\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Hernandez-Simental acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-25\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief, the Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, for summary affirmance, or alternatively, for an extension of time to submit an appellee\u2019s brief. The Government\u2019s request for a summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government need not file an appellee\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
