The district court determined that Harwood failed to satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause to allow him to raise his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-23\">Harwood argues that, in light of <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), he was convicted based upon conduct no longer criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>claim was foreclosed by Tenth Circuit precedent at the time of his conviction; and that he cannot raise the claim in a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion because <em>Bailey </em>did not create a new rule of constitutional law. Harwood filed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions in 1996 and 1998, after <em>Bailey </em>was decided. He has not shown that the claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time he filed his prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions, and he therefore has not shown that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
