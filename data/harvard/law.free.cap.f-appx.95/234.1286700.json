We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because we may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>see Weaver v. Thompson, </em>197 F.3d 359, 362 (9th Cir.1999), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-25\">Blum contends the district court erred in denying his request for early termination because it did so without considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as directed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3564(c). Because the district court lacked jurisdiction, we decline to address the merits of this contention. Blum\u2019s motion was time-barred by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 (1983). <em>See United States v. Stump, </em>914 F.2d 170, 172 (9th Cir.1990). The 120-day limit for filing a Rule 35 motion is jurisdictional and, unless met, bars a court from jurisdiction to alter a sentence. <em>See United States v. Minor, </em>846 F.2d 1184, 1189 (9th Cir.1988). Blum\u2019s Rule 35 motion, filed twenty years after his original sentence, was time-barred and thus dismissal by the district court was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-26\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b266-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-28\">.
