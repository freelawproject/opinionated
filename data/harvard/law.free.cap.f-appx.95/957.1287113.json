ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-14\">Robert Owen Taylor filed a motion to suppress evidence, claiming the gun he had thrown out of the car he was driving was obtained by police in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Following a hearing, the district court denied the motion. Taylor then entered a conditional guilty plea to a charge of possession of a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), and was sentenced to sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, and assessed a fine of $1000. As permitted by the plea agreement, Taylor now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">At approximately 2:30 a.m. on June 30, 2001, a Sunday morning, Tulsa Police Department officers arrived at the parking lot of the Northridge Shopping Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in response to a call from the Shopping Center\u2019s owner, Thomas Riley. Riley asked the police to help him clear the parking lot of loiterers who did not have business at either of two Shopping Center establishments (a restaurant and a community center) that remained open at that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>made an announcement on their public address system, directing those present who were not at the restaurant or the community center to return to their vehicles and head for the exits. The police located their police cars behind the mass of people present, and as vehicles moved towards the exit, the police slowly followed behind them.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">According to the hearing testimony of Officer Hart, one of the police officers present, Taylor, who was driving his girlfriend\u2019s Cutlass while she sat in the passenger seat, initially got \u201csort of in fine\u201d to leave the parking lot. Order at 5, R. Vol. I, tab 19. For reasons not disclosed by the record, another police officer, Officer Moyer, whose police car was directly behind the Cutlass, turned his car\u2019s spotlight on. At that point, Taylor left the exiting line of cars and \u201cheaded toward the northeast corner of the parking lot, where no businesses were open at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Officer Moyer and Officer Hart, in separate cars, followed in pursuit with their lights and sirens on. Taylor then turned around and drove south, passing the restaurant, and reached the far southeast corner of the parking lot. Officer Hart testified that the Cutlass reached a speed of thirty-five miles per hour while passing pedestrians near the restaurant. As Taylor brought the Cutlass to a stop in the southeast corner, from which there is no exit, he threw a gun out of the passenger window. Police recovered the gun, a loaded 9 mm Ruger, approximately five feet away from the passenger\u2019s door and estimated that the vehicle had moved two to three feet after the gun was thrown, in the course of stopping. After finding that Taylor had previously been convicted of a felony, police charged him with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), as noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Ruling on Taylor\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aox\">Defendant\u2019s actions of initially complying with the officers\u2019 orders, which he had no obligation to do if he was, in fact, conducting business at the [restaurant], and then getting out of the exit line and pulling behind the officers to an area of the parking lot that had already been cleared by the officers and where no businesses were open, leads to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. As such, the officers were justified in pursuing and eventually stopping the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-7\">.... Therefore, when Defendant threw the gun out of the passenger window as he was coming to a stop, he effectively and voluntarily abandoned the gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Order at 5-6, R. Vol. I, tab 19 (footnote omitted). Holding that the police\u2019s seizure of the gun was thus reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, the district court denied Taylor\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">On appeal, Taylor argues that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him and that the district court therefore should have held the seized gun inadmissible as fruit of the poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">\u201cIn reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Flynn, </em>309 F.3d 736, 738 (10th Cir.2002). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the ultimate question of whether a search or seizure was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">As an initial matter, we reject the government\u2019s argument that the district court should have denied Taylor\u2019s motion for lack of standing because Taylor failed to assert a possessory interest in the gun prior to the government\u2019s presentation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>evidence. We have held that \u201ca defendant lacks standing to complain of an illegal search or seizure of property which has been abandoned\u201d because he has no expectation of privacy in the property. <em>United States v. Garzon, </em>119 F.3d 1446, 1449 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201c \u2018The test for abandonment is whether an individual has retained any reasonable expectation of privacy in the [discarded] object.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>707 F.2d 1169, 1172 (10th Cir.1983))). However, this rule only applies where the abandonment did not result from an earlier Fourth Amendment violation. \u201c[A]n abandonment that results from a[n earlier] Fourth Amendment violation cannot be voluntary,\u201d and the police\u2019s seizure of property involuntarily abandoned is unreasonable as a matter of law. <em>United States v. Austin, </em>66 F.3d 1115, 1118 (10th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Hernandez, </em>7 F.3d 944, 946-47 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Here, Taylor claims his abandonment of the gun was involuntary because it resulted from the police\u2019s unreasonable seizure of the Cutlass. It is undisputed that Taylor, as the Cutlass\u2019s driver, has standing to challenge his own seizure during the stop of the Cutlass. We therefore consider first whether the Cutlass, and thus Taylor, was seized at the time Taylor threw the gun out the window, and, if so, whether that seizure was reasonable. Only if we determine that no prior Fourth Amendment violation occurred would the issue of standing in regard to the gun\u2019s seizure come into play. Here, of course, Taylor asserts no retained expectation of privacy in the gun. Thus, we will hold the government\u2019s seizure of the gun reasonable as long as we conclude that Taylor\u2019s abandonment of the gun was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">We first consider whether Taylor was seized at the time he threw the gun out of the car window. A seizure occurs where a defendant submits to the assertion of authority by the government. <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991). Here, the government argues there was no assertion of authority because the police officers, pursuing Taylor with their sirens and flashing lights on, \u201cdid not intend to seize\u201d Taylor but \u201cmerely wanted him to leave\u201d the parking lot. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 10. The government cites nothing in the record in support of this proposition, and we believe a police car\u2019s flashing lights and sirens provide a clear direction to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">The government next argues that Taylor\u2019s stop was not an act of submitting to the police\u2019s assertion of authority but rather resulted from his \u201ctrapping] himself in a corner of the parking lot from which he could not escape.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 11. At least part of the reason Taylor was trapped, however, was that the pursuing police cars did not allow him to leave the corner of the parking lot once he got there. We believe making a distinction of the sort the government suggests would be drawing \u201ctoo fine a line.\u201d <em>Brower v. County of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 598,109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">The government finally argues that Taylor was not actually stopped at the time he threw the gun out the window. The district court found that Taylor threw the gun \u201cas he was coming to a stop.\u201d Order at 6, R. Vol. I, tab 19. Given Officer Hart\u2019s testimony that the car moved only two to three feet after the gun was thrown and that the gun was found within seven feet of the car, we do not consider this finding clearly erroneous. We do not consider the two- or three-foot gap between throwing the gun and coming to a complete stop significant in light of the inevitable mechanical delay between Taylor\u2019s decision to stop and making his vehicle fully comply with that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>We therefore hold the Cutlass and Taylor were seized at the time Taylor threw the gun out the car window.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">We next consider whether the seizure of the Cutlass was reasonable. In performing this analysis, we \u201cexamine the events that occurred leading up to the stop to determine whether the \u2018historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to reasonable suspicion or probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vercher, </em>358 F.3d 1257, 1261 (10th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 184 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). A stop is valid if \u201c \u2018this particular officer had reasonable suspicion that this particular motorist violated any one of the multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations of the jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Botero-Ospina, </em>71 F.3d 783, 787 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Here, the district court determined the police had \u201ca reasonable suspicion of criminal activity\u201d without reference to any specific violation of law. Order at 6, R. Yol. I, tab 19. We have previously reversed a denial of a motion to suppress where there was no \u201cspecific factual basis for suspecting that a <em>particular crime </em>was being committed by [the defendant] at the time he was detained.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>94 F.3d 1465, 1470 (10th Cir.1996) (emphasis added). We need not consider whether the court\u2019s ruling warrants reversal on that basis here, however, because we believe the factors listed by the district court in support of its ruling gave the police reasonable suspicion to believe Taylor was violating the City of Tulsa trespass ordinance. The ordinance defines the offense of trespassing as \u201c[r]emaining upon the premises of another, whether public or private, and refusing to leave the premises forthwith after demand by the owner or occupant,\u201d or, alternatively, \u201c[r]emaining on private property at any time other than during posted hours of business operation after having been directed to vacate such premises by a police officer.\u201d Tulsa, Okla., Penal Code, tit. 27, \u00a7 2106(E) <em>&amp; </em>(G). In this case, police officers, at the request of the property owner, gave the order to all those in the Shopping Center parking lot who were not using either of the two open businesses to leave. We agree with the district court that Taylor\u2019s initial compliance with the police officers\u2019 direction to leave the parking lot gave the officers reason to believe he was not using an open business and thus had no legitimate reason to remain on the property. When Taylor then left the exit line and drove toward an area of the parking lot where no businesses were open, the officers had reasonable suspicion to believe he was unlawfully trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Taylor argues that his actions could as easily have been understood as \u201cboth innocuous and understandable\u201d as the result of his unfamiliarity with the area and his desire \u201cto leave without having to deal with the police.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9. However, we have previously explained that \u201can officer with reasonable suspicion need not \u2018rule out the possibility of innocent conduct\u2019 as long as the totality of the circumstances suffices to form \u2018a particularized and objective basis\u2019 \u201d for a stop. <em>Vercher, </em>358 F.3d at 1261 (quoting <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 277-78, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002)). We believe the totality of circumstances here is sufficient to give officers reasonable suspicion of trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">We thus hold that the stop of the Cutlass was reasonable and that Taylor\u2019s abandonment of the gun was therefore voluntary. Accordingly, the police\u2019s seizure of the gun did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Taylor\u2019s motion to suppress is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-17\">. The record indicates that it was not uncommon for people to congregate in the Shopping Center parking lot on weekend evenings and for police to help clear the parking lot if a disturbance occurred. In this instance, Riley testified that he called the police after someone had tried to run him over.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
