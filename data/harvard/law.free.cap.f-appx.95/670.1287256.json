Benitez-Benitez complains that his sentence was improperly enhanced pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) based on a prior conviction. He argues that the sentencing provision is unconstitutional. Benitez-Benitez thus contends that his sentence should not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment prescribed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Benitez-Benitez acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief.
