The pleas were taken separately. There was a written plea agreement in the alien-transporting case; there was no plea agreement in the illegal reentry case. Because the alien transportation offense is a \u201cspecific offense characteristic\u201d of illegal reentry under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), the offenses were grouped pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c), and the sentence was based on the guidelines for illegal-reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Uribe contends that the Government breached the written plea agreement by not orally recommending a downward departure for Uribe\u2019s early cooperation. Absent any objection in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). The inclusion of the Government\u2019s recommendation in the Presentence Report fulfilled the Government\u2019s plea-agreement obligation to recommend a downward departure for that offense. <em>See United States v. Cates, </em>952 F.2d 149, 153 (5th Cir.1992). Moreover, a downward departure as promised in the alien-transporting case would not have affected Uribe\u2019s substantial rights because it would have had no effect on the overall sentence, which was based on the illegal reentry offense. Uribe shows no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">For the first time on appeal, Uribe argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He thus contends that his sentence is invalid and argues that it should not exceed the two-year maximum term of imprisonment prescribed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Uribe acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
