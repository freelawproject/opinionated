Jin claims that he was persecuted because of his resistance to China\u2019s family planning policies and that the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) erred in denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We disagree and will affirm the I J\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Jin alleges that he and his girlfriend<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attempted to register their marriage with the proper Chinese authorities on November 10, 1999. The authorities declined to register the marriage until Jin\u2019s girlfriend was physically examined. The examination revealed that Jin\u2019s girlfriend was two months pregnant. According to Jin, the authorities ordered an immediate abortion. After Jin and his girlfriend protested that she was unwell, they were able to leave the hospital. Jin\u2019s girlfriend went into hiding, successfully eluding the authorities until their son was born in China on June 22, 2000. Claiming it was too dangerous for him to remain with her, Jin returned to his home. He alleges that the police arrested him and took him to their office. He was fined 30,000 renminbi (approximately $3,600) and informed that the police wanted his girlfriend to return to the village. Jin testified that he managed to pay only 100 renminbi and escape from police custody that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Jin hid from Chinese officials, learning from his father that the birth control officials continued to come to his home. Jin alleged that the officials seized household furniture as an inducement to produce Jin\u2019s girlfriend so that she could be forced to have an abortion. Jin testified that on another occasion the officials injured his father\u2019s back.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">Jin obtained a visa for transit from a former employer. He boarded a plane from Shanghai to Los Angeles, where he was taken into custody. Jin requested asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and the Torture Convention. The IJ conducted a hearing regarding Jin\u2019s application on July 18, 2000. The IJ issued a decision, denying Jin\u2019s application on January 22, 2001. The IJ declined to make a credibility finding, but held that even if Jin\u2019s testimony were believed, he would not be entitled to asylum or withholding of removal. The IJ determined that Jin \u201ccould not meet the legal definition of the term \u2018refugee.\u2019 \u201d Because Jin was not married to his girlfriend at the time the Chinese officials urged her to have an abortion, the IJ determined that there was no provision for asylum or withholding of removal for Jin. Furthermore, the IJ determined that Jin had no reasonable, objective fear of persecution should he be returned to China. The IJ, therefore, denied Jin\u2019s petition. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion on March 12, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>This timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Jin contends that the IJ improperly read the definition of refugee narrowly, failing to recognize that any person who has been persecuted for his resistance to China\u2019s family planning policy may be entitled to asylum or withholding of removal. Further, Jin urges that the IJ improperly held that he has not suffered persecution, and that he does not have a reasonable fear of future persecution should he return to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Asylum is proper where an alien demonstrates that he qualifies as a refugee who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of \u201cpersecution] or who has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUX\">a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">A refugee claiming a well founded fear of persecution must show both that he is subjectively afraid that upon returning to his home country he will be persecuted and that this fear is objectively reasonable. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). If an applicant cannot meet the standard for asylum, then <em>a fortiori </em>he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477 (3d Cir.2001); <em>Janusiak v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 46, 47 (3d Cir.1991).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the IJ\u2019s determination that Jin, even if believed, has failed to show that he was persecuted, or that he has a reasonable fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">An IJ\u2019s determination that the petitioner did not meet his burden is reviewable subject to a substantial evidence standard. <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir. 2003)(en <em>banc); Abdille, </em>242 F.3d at 483. We may reverse only where the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that of the IJ. <em>Id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>contrary\u201d). Here, nothing in the record supports a conclusion contrary to that of the IJ.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Not every unjust or unfair action by a foreign government qualifies as persecution. Instead, \u201cpersecution connotes extreme behavior, including \u2018threats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u2019\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 214, 217 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993)). Here, Jin testified that the only adverse consequences he experienced as a result of his girlfriend\u2019s failure to undergo an abortion were that he was detained for an evening and required to pay a 30,000 renminbi fine. He also testified that his father had an altercation with the local officials.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As to the latter consequence, Jin did not indicate that he feared physical harm himself, or that he feared such actions would be repeated. As to the former, Jin acknowledged that the 30,000 renminbi fine has now been paid and provided no evidence that he would be jailed for his resistance to China\u2019s family planning policy were he to return. The IJ properly concluded that this evidence does not rise to the level of persecution. Jin does not, therefore, meet the qualifications of a refugee as defined in \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). We will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A4d\">. Jin\u2019s brief consistently uses the word fiancee and the government uses the word \"girlfriend.\u201d Jin's affidavit presented to and testimony before the Immigration Judge both consistently use the word \"girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">. The IJ had jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.2(b)(2002). The BIA had appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b). We exercise appellate jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s order pursuant to \u00a7 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b); <em>see also Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 548-49 (3d Cir.2001). When the BIA defers to the IJ, however, we \u201cmust review the decision of the IJ.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir.2002)(citing <em>Abdulai, </em>239 F.3d at 549 n. 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-14\">. Withholding of removal is appropriate where \"the Attorney General determines that such alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)(1). An applicant for withholding of removal under the Torture Convention bears the burden of establishing \"that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174-75 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\">. We note that the plain language of \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) extends protection to \"a person ... who has been persecuted for ... resistance to a coercive population control program.\u201d <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>356 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (where the statute is clear the Courts and agency must \u201cgive effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b476-24\">. Because the IJ found that Jin was not of age at the time that he applied for a marriage license, he determined that Jin was not permitted to marry because of age, not resistance to China\u2019s family planning policy. We find no error in this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
