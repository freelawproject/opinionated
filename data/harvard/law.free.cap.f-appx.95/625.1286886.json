California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Rodriguez has filed a response, arguing that he received excessive criminal history points for his prior convictions, his criminal history score overrepresents the seriousness of his criminal history, the district court should have downwardly departed, and he should not have received a 16-level increase in his offense level for having a prior conviction for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-26\">Our independent review of the brief, Rodriguez\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused <em>from </em>further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
