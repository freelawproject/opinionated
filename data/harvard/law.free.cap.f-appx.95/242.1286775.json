We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">Stone contends that the district court erred in using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11 (precursor chemicals) to determine her base offense level for sentencing. Because the district court determined that the amount of controlled substance seized did not reflect the scale of the offense, it was required to approximate the quantity of the controlled substance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12. The district court did not err by using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11 as part of its methodology for approximating the drug amount because all of the <em>Culps </em>criteria were satisfied. <em>See United States v. Culps, </em>300 F.3d 1069, 1076-81 (9th Cir. 2002) (stating that when a district court approximates drug quantity it must error on the side of caution, rely upon information that has a sufficient indicia of reliability and conclude that the defendant is more likely than not responsible for at least the quantity approximated).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b274-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
