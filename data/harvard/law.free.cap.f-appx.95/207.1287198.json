We conclude that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(2)(B) obligated the LAU to consider the Soto affidavit, and remand for the LAU to consider it in the first instance. In view of this disposition, Orozco\u2019s appeal from the denial of his cancellation of removal application is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Section 1160(e)(2)(B) governs the LAU\u2019s review of the initial denial of Orozco\u2019s SAW application. It provides that agency appellate review \u201cshall be based solely upon the administrative record established at the time of the determination on the application <em>and upon such additional or newly discovered evidence as may not have been available at the time of the determination.\u201d 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Section 1160(e)(2)(B) required the LAU to consider additional evidence that the regional processing facility had not considered in its preliminary determination, but that Orozco had submitted prior to the LAU\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">We may not affirm the LAU on an alternative rationale upon which it might have relied, but did not, in deciding Orozco\u2019s appeal. <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 658 n. 16 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947)). The court can only uphold a decision based on a rationale that the LAU itself offered. <em>Id. </em>The LAU did not address the Soto affidavit; the rationales that the Government proposes on appeal are not based on any rationale the agency itself had offered. Accordingly, we must remand to the LAU to consider the Soto affidavit in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Because we remand the SAW application to the LAU for further consideration, the appeal of the cancellation of removal application is now moot and the order of removal is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">We grant the Government\u2019s pending motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-21\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
