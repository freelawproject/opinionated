We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (\u201c[t]he petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b289-24\">PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACQ\">Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-26\">We have recognized that \u201cwhere there has been official misleading as to the time within which to file a notice of appeal, the late notice may be deemed to have been constructively filed within the jurisdictional time limits.\u201d <em>Hernandez-Rivera v. INS, </em>630 F.2d 1352, 1355 (9th Cir.1980) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-27\">The BIA\u2019s Order of Removal is date-stamped September 16, 2002, ostensibly making the Petition for Review due on October 16, 2002 \u2014 \u201c30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). But the transmittal notice/cover letter from BIA Clerk\u2019s office, on which Petitioner\u2019s counsel relied to determine the date the Petition was due, states that the <em>\u201cD </em>ate of this notice\u201d is September 17, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similarly, the Exec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>utive Office of Immigration Review\u2019s automated phone tree system (1-800-898-7180), which Petitioner\u2019s counsel used to verify the status of Petitioner\u2019s case, told counsel that the BIA\u2019s Order was dated September 17, 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The majority ignores <em>Hemandez-Rivera </em>and faults Petitioner for filing his Petition for Review one day late. I dissent because Petitioner was \u201cofficially] misle[d]\u201d by the Attorney General as to the date of the BIA\u2019s Order of Removal and the deadline for filing the Petition for Review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-18\">. During the calendar week in which this matter was heard, we considered appeals in 22 additional immigration matters. In every one, the dates of the BIA\u2019s order and the transmittal notice/cover letter are the <em>same.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-29\">The date on the BIA\u2019s orders is stamped with a rubber stamp that uses dials to change the month, day, and year. The date on the transmittal notice/cover letter is generated by computer. The only logical explanation for the differing dates in this case appears to be that whoever stamped the BIA\u2019s order forgot to turn the day dial from \"16\u201d to \"17.\u201d Were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>it provable that this actually happened, the effective date of the BIA\u2019s Order of Removal would be September 17, 2002, and the Petition for Review would have been timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. The \"Index\u201d to the Certified Administrative Record, prepared by the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Immigration Litigation, states that the \"Decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u201d was September 17, 2002 \u2014 not September 16, 2002. Petitioner did not detrimentally rely on the Index\u2019 representation that the BIA\u2019s Order was dated September 17, 2002 because the Certified Administrative Record was prepared on March 20, 2003 \u2014 \u2022 over five months after Petitioner filed his Petition for Review. Nevertheless, the Index is strong evidence that the differing dates on the BIA\u2019s Order and transmittal notice/cover letter are misleading. Even the Department of Justice's Office of Immigration Litigation, which is in a much better position than Petitioner to properly interpret BIA documents, was misled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
