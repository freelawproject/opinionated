Ursua originally brought the action in state court, and Miller removed the action to federal court on the ground that federal question issues were raised under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Family Medical Leave Act. The district court remanded based on Miller\u2019s failure to provide copies of all process, pleadings, and orders that were served upon each of the removing defendants, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-22\">At the time of the remand, this Circuit had not yet decided whether a district court had authority to make a <em>sua sponte </em>remand based on a non-jurisdictional procedural defect. In our recent decision, <em>Kelton Arms Condominium Owners Association, Inc. v. Homestead Insurance Co., </em>346 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (9th Cir.2003), we held that a district court lacks the authority to make such a remand. Because the district court\u2019s remand was based on a procedural defect, the district court did not have the authority to make a <em>sua sponte </em>remand. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s remand order, and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-23\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b267-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
