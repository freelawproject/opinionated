This court must raise, <em>sua sponte, </em>the issue of its own jurisdiction, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a mandatory precondition to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. <em>Nelson v. Foti, </em>707 F.2d 170, 171 (5th Cir.1983). Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1) requires that the notice of appeal in a civil action be filed within 30 days of entry of the judgment or order from which appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-21\">Johnson did not file his notice of appeal within 30 days of the entry of the order closing his case. The October 14, 2003, notice of appeal is timely only as to the denial of his second motion to reopen. However, Johnson makes no argument challenging the denial of his motion to reopen and has thus waived the sole ground for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Consequently, the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
