His platform urged a more open and accountable county government, reform of the county\u2019s family services agency, and an overhaul of the county attorney\u2019s office. Honan won the election, and was sworn in as county attorney in January 1999. After the election, but pri- or to Honan taking office, the county board reduced the salary of the county attorney and eliminated a rent subsidy that had been part of the office\u2019s budget during the term of Honan\u2019s predecessor. Honan believed that these actions were taken in retaliation for statements he made during his campaign. During the year after Honan was sworn in, there were personnel problems in the county attorney\u2019s office. These problems prompted investigations, which Honan also believed were retaliatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-18\">Honan brought suit against the county board and its members, along with others involved in the various events that he believed violated his rights. He alleged that he was retaliated against for exercising his constitutional rights to freedom of speech and association, and to petition the government. Honan claimed that his rights to equal protection and due process, and his constitutional right \u201cto pursue the career for which he was trained,\u201d were violated. He further alleged that appellees conspired against him in an attempt to prevent him from taking, holding, and discharging the duties of his office, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(1). Honan included several state law claims over which the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exercised supplemental jurisdiction. The district court granted appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss Honan\u2019s federal claims, which the district court treated as motions for judgment on the pleadings, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), and dismissed the state law claims without prejudice, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c). Honan timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">After carefully reviewing the record <em>de novo, see Burton v. Richmond, </em>276 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>973, 975 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review), we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Honan\u2019s action. The issues are thoroughly discussed in the district court\u2019s 24-page order. Having nothing to add, we summarily affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-16\">. The Honorable Joan N. Ericksen, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
