We have reviewed the administrative record and the order of the immigration judge and conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Liu is statutorily ineligible for the relief sought. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994);<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(e)(2)(A) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-25\">Accordingly, we deny Liu\u2019s motion for oral argument and petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-20\"> Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104 \u2014 128, 110 Stat. 3009, effective April 1, 1997, because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
