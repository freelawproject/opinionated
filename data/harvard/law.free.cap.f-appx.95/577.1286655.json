He argues, for the first time on appeal, that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats a prior conviction for a felony or aggravated felony as a sentencing factor and not as an element of the offense. He also contends that his sentence is illegal because his indictment did not allege that he committed an aggravated felony before he was deported. Lazo-Raya\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule that decision. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, the district court did not err in sentencing Lazo-Raya under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
