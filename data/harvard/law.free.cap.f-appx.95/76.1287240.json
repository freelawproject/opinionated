Guerrero contends that the district court erred by failing to treat his prior state-court assault convictions as \u201crelated cases\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). Among other things, Guerrero contends that the evidence demonstrated the \u201cfunctional consolidation\u201d of the cases based on an agreement among the parties and the court to dispose of them in the same proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">A district court\u2019s determination that cases were consolidated for trial or sentencing is reviewed only for clear error. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Arredondo, </em>255 F.3d 198, 203 n. 10 (5th Cir.2001). \u201c[A] finding that prior cases were \u2018consolidated\u2019 will require either some factual connexity between them, or else a finding that the cases were merged for trial or sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Huskey, </em>137 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">As Guerrero concedes, his prior assault convictions constituted separate offenses that occurred on different dates. The cases were filed under separate cause numbers, which they respectively retained through sentencing; the cases were not consolidated under a single docket number. Despite Guerrero\u2019s argument to the contrary, \u201c[t]his court has [ ] rejected the proposition that cases must be considered consolidated simply because two convictions have concurrent sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>962 F.2d 479, 482 (5th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>abrogated on a different ground by Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 63-66,121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001). Furthermore, the mere fact that both assaults stemmed from domestic disputes is insufficient to make the offenses factually related since more is required than a showing that the crimes were similar. <em>See id. </em>Given these circumstances, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Guerrero\u2019s prior assault offenses were not \u201crelated\u201d to one another. <em>See Moreno-Arredondo, </em>255 F.3d at 203 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">Guerrero also contends that the felony conviction that resulted in his increased sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was an element of the offense that should have been charged in the indictment. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of the decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Guerrero\u2019s contention lacks merit because <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres.
