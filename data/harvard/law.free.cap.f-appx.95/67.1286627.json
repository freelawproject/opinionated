Petty\u2019s motion for an injunction to preserve medical records is DENIED. Petty contends that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because he was not attempting to invalidate the result of any disciplinary hearing; that an interoffice memorandum attached to his appellate brief demonstrates that he did invalidate the results of his disciplinary hearing; and that the use of force against him violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-24\">Petty does not contend that the district court erred by finding that his second 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action was duplicative of his first 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action and dismissing the action because it was malicious. Petty has failed to brief a dispositive issue for appeal and has abandoned that issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-25\">Petty\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). This court, on June 24, 2003, imposed the three-strikes sanction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) on Petty. <em>Petty v. Kelly, </em>No. 02-41231, 3-4 (5th Cir. Jun. 24, 2003). We remind Petty that he may not proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b99-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
