Lopez argues that he is entitled to an adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident alien and that this court has jurisdiction over his claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">As Lopez did not properly raise his claims before the BIA and exhaustion is statutorily mandated, this court does not have jurisdiction over the present petition. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) (1994). As Lopez has not filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus, this court does not have jurisdiction pursuant to that statute. Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b112-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
