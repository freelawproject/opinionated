California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Castillo has filed a response in which he requests to represent himself on appeal. Castillo\u2019s motion to proceed <em>pro se </em>on appeal is DENIED as untimely. <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998). Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, Castillo\u2019s response, and the record discloses no non-frivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">We decline to address Castillo\u2019s argument that counsel did not adequately explain to him the provision in his plea agreement waiving certain appellate rights. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 369 (5th Cir.1996). Our decision is without prejudice to Castillo\u2019s right to raise this claim in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-06, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities .herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
