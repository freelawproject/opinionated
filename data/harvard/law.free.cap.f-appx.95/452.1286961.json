Even though Deborah McCauley died on April 11, 1997, and her husband is prosecuting these proceedings, as a matter of convenience we refer to the plaintiff-appellant simply as McCauley. The parties are familiar with the facts so we do not set them forth at length. The appeal is unusual in that the Commissioner confesses error and requests that we remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">The following procedural steps were taken in this case. McCauley applied for disability benefits on January 18, 1995. The Commissioner denied her application initially and on reconsideration following which McCauley requested a hearing which was held on July 8, 1996. After an ALJ made a decision that McCauley was not disabled she successfully sought review from the Appeals Council which remanded the matter. Subsequently, on December 17, 1998, there was a new healing before a different ALJ who on June 17,1999, issued a new decision denying benefits at the second step of the familiar five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is under a disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; <em>Williams v. Sullivan, </em>970 F.2d 1178, 1180 (3d Cir. 1992). McCauley then again sought review before the Appeals Council but this time she was not successful and thus the ALJ\u2019s decision became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">McCauley then instituted an action in the district court seeking review of the final decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Eventually the district court entered an order affirming the Commissioner on March 11, 2003, following which McCauley appealed to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the order of the district court, <em>see Knepp v. Apfel, </em>204 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir.2000), and plenary review over legal questions, <em>see Krysztoforski v. Chater, </em>55 F.3d 857, 858 (3d Cir.1995). While we routinely review the factual component of a decision of the Commissioner to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 390, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1422, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), that principle is of limited significance here as the ALJ denied McCauley\u2019s claim at the second step of the sequential evaluation process and we are reversing the district court\u2019s decision affirming that disposition and directing a remand to the Commissioner for further proceedings. Thus, except for the finding at the first step of the sequential analysis, <em>i.e., </em>McCauley was not engaging in substantial activity, a finding she obviously accepts, we do not have factual findings to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The determination that we must make is whether we should direct the district court to order an award of benefits, as McCauley urges, or whether we should direct that court to remand the case to the Commissioner for further proceedings, as she urges. We are satisfied that even though there has been a substantial record developed here, still the record should be expanded further by the retention of a medical expert by the ALJ, because, as the Commissioner acknowledges, and as our opinion in <em>Newell v. Commissioner, </em>347 F.3d 541 (3d Cir.2003), makes clear, the date of McCauley\u2019s disability if she is found to be disabled is potentially significant. Appellee\u2019s br. at 12. <em>See also </em>Appellant\u2019s br. at 43 n. 10. Moreover, the Commissioner in the first instance should consider the impact of McCauley\u2019s morbid obesity which she acknowledges is a germane factor. Appellee\u2019s br. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In reaching our result we point out that our opinion in <em>Newell </em>was not rendered before the district court\u2019s disposition of this case and thus the parties did not have the benefit of it at any stage of the proceedings in this case prior to this appeal. Indeed, we had not even decided the earlier case of <em>Beasich v. Commissioner, </em>66 Fed.Appx. 419 (3d Cir.2003), a not precedential opinion on which McCauley relies and which is similar to <em>Newell, </em>until after the district court ruled in this matter. Certainly on the remand the Commissioner should consider <em>Newell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">For the foregoing reasons we will vacate the order of March 11, 2003, and will remand the case to the district court which in turn should remand it to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
