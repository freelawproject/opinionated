Salinas attacks the constitutionality of his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), contending that there was no evidence that the firearm he possessed was in or substantially affected interstate commerce. He submits that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), require that the firearms possession have a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-21\">Salinas concedes that his arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent, but he wishes to preserve them for Supreme Court review. This court has determined that \u201cneither the holding in <em>Lopez </em>nor the reasons given therefor constitutionally invalidate \u00a7 922(g)(1).\u201d <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996). This court has also determined that \u201c[n]either <em>Jones </em>nor <em>Morrison </em>affects or undermines the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g).\u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001). This court repeatedly has affirmed \u00a7 922(g)(1) convictions on evidence similar to that presented in the instant case. <em>See id. </em>at 518 <em>&amp; </em>n. 12 (concluding that \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s interstate commerce element is satisfied by the defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm that was manufactured in a different state or country).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-22\">Because the arguments raised on appeal are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
