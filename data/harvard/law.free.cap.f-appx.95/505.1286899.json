Collins appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence under former Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(a). We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35(a) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Stump, </em>914 F.2d 170, 172 (9th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. McQuiston, </em>307 F.3d 687, 689 (8th Cir.2002). A motion challenging an illegal sentence under former Rule 35(a) may be brought only when the sentence imposed exceeds the statutory limits, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, or is ambiguous or internally contradictory. See <em>United States v. Pavlico, </em>961 F.2d 440, 443 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Coffins asserts the district court erred when it concluded his claim that he received an improper sentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (1982) was not cognizable under Rule 35(a). Coffins argued he did not have three requisite predicate convictions because he had been unlawfully denied access to an attorney for one of the offenses, in violation of <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). Because Coffins has not asserted his sentence, as enhanced under \u00a7 924(e), exceeds statutory m\u00e1ximums, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, or is ambiguous or internally contradictory, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Collins\u2019s Rule 35 motion on this claim and affirm this aspect of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">Collins also argues his sentence violates the Double Jeopardy Clause because he was sentenced on two counts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon even though both firearms were seized at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">We do not address Collins\u2019s Double Jeopardy claim because Collins\u2019s two convictions and sentences under \u00a7 922(g) violate the rule in <em>Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985). In <em>Ball, </em>the defendant was convicted of both receiving a firearm in violation of \u00a7 922(h) and possessing a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1). <em>Ball, </em>470 U.S. at 864, 105 S.Ct. 1668. The Supreme Court examined the legislative intent of the two statutes and determined that Congress did not intend for simultaneous prosecution under both. 470 U.S. at 864, 105 S.Ct. 1668. The court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-15\">Having concluded that Congress did not intend petitioner\u2019s conduct to be punishable under both \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and 1202(a), the only remedy consistent with the congressional intent is for the District Court, where the sentencing responsibility resides, to exercise its discretion to vacate one of the underlying convictions. The remedy of ordering one of the sentences to be served concurrently with the other cannot be squared with Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>gress\u2019 intention. One of the convictions, as well as its concurrent sentence, is unauthorized punishment for a separate offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>Ball, </em>470 U.S. at 864, 105 S.Ct. 1668.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In <em>United States v. Dunford, </em>148 F.3d 385, 390 (4th Cir.1998), this court held that the unlawful possession of more than one firearm at the same time supports only-one conviction under \u00a7 922(g). The court reached this conclusion by applying the rule that \u201cif Congress does not fix the punishment for a federal offense clearly and without ambiguity, doubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u201d <em>Dunford, </em>148 F.3d at 390 (quoting <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 84, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955)) (internal quotations omitted). Under <em>Dunford, </em>the district court erred when it sentenced Collins on two separate counts of\u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We therefore conclude the district court abused its discretion in denying Collins\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence on this ground. Under <em>Ball, </em>the appropriate remedy is to remand the case to the district court to allow the district court to exercise its discretion to vacate one of the convictions and resentence the defendant. <em>See Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 864-65, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 84 L.Ed.2d 740, (1985). Accordingly, we remand this portion of the district court\u2019s order for it to vacate one of the \u00a7 922(g) convictions and resentence Collins. The balance of the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, and remand in part for the district court to vacate one of Collins\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) convictions and resentence Collins consistent with this opinion. Because a certificate of appealability is not required for this appeal, we deny Collins\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability as unnecessary. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
