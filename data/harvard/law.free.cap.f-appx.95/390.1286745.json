We address the FMLA issue in an accompanying <em>per curiam </em>opinion and dispose of the remainder of the claims in this summary order. The parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the law is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, see Smith ex rel. Estate of Smith v. Fed. Reserve Bank, </em>346 F.3d 264 (2d Cir.2003), and \u201cdetermine whether the record reveals the existence of any material issue of fact that would bar such relief.\u201d <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Alitalia Airlines, S.P.A., </em>347 F.3d 448, 456 (2d Cir.2003). We are particularly cautious in employment discrimination cases about affirming grants of summary judgment in favor of defendants. <em>See Mandell v. County of Suffolk, </em>316 F.3d 368, 377 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cIn discrimination cases where state of mind is at issue, we affirm a grant of summary judgment in favor of an employer sparingly because careful scrutiny of the factual allegations may reveal circumstantial evidence to support the required inference of discrimination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The district court granted summary judgment for the DOT on plaintiffs\u2019 claims of national origin discrimination because it found that they failed to meet their obligation under the third prong of the burden-shifting test derived from <em>McDonnell Douglas v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and that \u201cthere [was] little to no evidence that [plaintiffs\u2019] removal was based upon their Italian ethnicity.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The district court also held that Potenza could not demonstrate that he was \u201cdisabled\u201d under the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. In order to establish a prima facie case under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must fulfill a tripartite test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHVx\">[P]laintiff must first show that [he] suffers from a physical or mental impairment. Second, plaintiff must identify the activity claimed to be impaired and establish that it constitutes a \u201cmajor life activity.\u201d Third, the plaintiff must show that her impairment \u201csubstantially limits\u201d the major life activity previously identified. In addition, the Supreme Court has recently clarified that the identified major life activity must be \u201cof central importance to daily life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\"><em>Weixel v. Bd. of Ed. of the City of New York, </em>287 F.3d 138, 147 (2d Cir.2002) (internal citations omitted). In this case, Potenza alleged that injuries to his foot and knee substantially impaired his ability to perform his work and to walk. Athough \u201cmajor life activities\u201d include both working and walking, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h)(2)(i), Potenza cannot show that these life activities were \u201csubstantially limited\u201d by his injury. When the major life activity involved is working, \u201csubstantially limits means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3); <em>see also Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 491-92, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (discussing the meaning of \u201csubstantially limits\u201d in the context of work). Likewise, the effect on a plaintiffs ability to walk must be fairly significant before he or she will be determined disabled. <em>See, e.g., Kelly v. Drexel Univ., </em>94 F.3d 102, 106 (3d Cir.1996) (observing that \u201cboth the regulations and the manual make clear that comparatively moderate restrictions on the walk are not disabilities\u201d). Potenza\u2019s injury does not appear, from the evidence he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>adduced, to have substantially affected his ability to perform his work and walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Finally, the district court did not err in rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-1999 claims on the grounds that they were time-barred and did not fall within the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d exception to the time limits imposed by Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-1999 claims and its grant of summary judgment to the DOT as to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of national origin discrimination and as to Potenza\u2019s claim under the Rehabilitation Act</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
