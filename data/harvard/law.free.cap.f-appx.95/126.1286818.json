(\u201cReliance\u201d), brings this appeal challenging the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment finding that Reliance was the primary insurer of Harry and Christine Pilling (\u201cPillings\u201d). Because the district court did not err in interpreting the insurance contracts, and because the substitution of the Virginia Fund does not alter the priority of the insurance policies in question, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">On May 3, 1997, Kenneth Charles drove his pickup truck the wrong way on 1-64 near Louisville, Kentucky, and collided head-on with a tractor trailer driven by the Pillings. Mr. Charles and his passengers were killed, the Pillings tractor trailer was destroyed, and the Pillings sustained serious physical and mental injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Because the Pillings anticipated that their damages would exceed the $100,000 policy maximum which they had already received from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer (USAA), they initiated an action in Kentucky state court seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaratory judgment establishing the UIM coverage levels provided under insurance policies issued to their carrier-lessee by Travelers Indemnity Co. (\u201cTravelers\u201d) and to the Pillings by Reliance, and the priority of the policies providing that UIM coverage. The action was removed to federal court by Travelers based on diversity of citizenship between the plaintiffs, who are residents of Virginia, and the defendants: Travelers, which is a Connecticut corporation, and Reliance, which was a Pennsylvania corporation. The district court found, and it is not challenged on appeal, that the Pillings were entitled to $750,000 in UIM coverage from Travelers based on a policy issued to the carrier-lessee of the Pillings\u2019 truck, and $1,000,000 in UIM coverage from Reliance for the Pillings\u2019 own policy on their truck. The district court also found, and it is not challenged on appeal, that these policies are non-stacking, and that the total which is due to the Pillings must be reduced by the $100,000 coverage from USAA, thereby leaving the Pillings with a total of $900,000 in potential UIM coverage from Travelers and Reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">The district court entered summary judgment finding Reliance to be the primary UIM insurer, and Travelers the excess UIM insurer. Three separate appeals were timely filed in this court: one by the Pillings (Case No. 01-5558), one by Travelers (Case No. 01-5559), and one by Reliance (Case No. 01-5176). While the appeals were pending, Reliance was declared insolvent by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, and this court issued a stay in light of the insolvency. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>subsequently granted the motion of Reliance to lift the stay and, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(b), to substitute Virginia Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cVirginia Fund\u201d) for Reliance in all three pending cases, because the Virginia Fund had assumed Reliance\u2019s obligations. At the same time, we denied without prejudice the requests of the Fillings and Travelers to remand the case to the district court for that court\u2019s consideration of issues related to the Virginia Fund\u2019s assumption of Reliance\u2019s obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">On the eve of oral arguments, the Pillings and Travelers entered into a settlement and dismissed their respective actions (Nos. 01-5558 and 01-5559). Accordingly, all that remains before this court is the appeal originally filed by Reliance, for which the Virginia Fund has been properly substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">As an initial matter, we must determine whether this court retains jurisdiction after the substitution of the Virginia Fund for Reliance. Subject matter jurisdiction was predicated upon diversity of citizenship, however following the substitution of the Virginia Fund, a Virginia nonprofit corporation, and the settlement by Travelers, the only remaining litigants are Virginia residents. Notwithstanding the Virginia Fund\u2019s objection to the contrary, it is well established that \u201cdiversity of citizenship is assessed at the time the action is filed,\u201d and subsequent action including substitution of parties does not defeat jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. <em>Free-port-McMoRan, Inc. v. K.N. Energy, Inc., </em>498 U.S. 426, 428, 111 S.Ct. 858, 112 L.Ed.2d 951 (1991); <em>accord Napletana v. Hillsdale College, </em>385 F.2d 871, 872 (6th Cir.1967) (noting that diversity of citizenship is determined at the time the complaint is filed). Because the parties were diverse at the time that this action was filed, this court retains subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Accordingly, we will consider first whether the district court erred in finding Reliance\u2019s coverage primary to Travelers. We will then address whether the substitution of the Virginia Fund alters this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">We review de novo a district court order granting a motion for summary judgment. <em>Faughender v. City of North Olmsted, </em>927 F.2d 909, 911 (6th Cir.1991). In determining which insurer is primary, the district court began by looking to the policies, which contain identical language identifying what coverage is deemed to be primary and what coverage is excess. Specifically, Section V(B)(5)(c) of the UIM coverage states \u201cthis Coverage Form provides primary insurance for any covered \u2018auto\u2019 you own and excess insurance for any covered \u2018auto\u2019 you don\u2019t own.\u201d The district court therefore found that under the terms of the contracts, the Reliance insurance policy obtained by the Pillings as owner of the truck was primary, and the Travelers insurance obtained by the carrier-lessee of the truck was excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The district court then examined whether the MCS-90 compliance statement \u2014 a form required by the United States Department of Transportation for carrier-lessees \u2014 which is attached as an endorsement to the Travelers policy altered this priority determination. The MCS-90 statement contains boxes the insurer may mark to designate the carrier\u2019s insurance as primary or excess. The MCS-90 form attached to the Travelers policy reflects that the \u201cprimary\u201d coverage box was checked.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The court nonetheless found that the MCS-90 did not alter the priority in this case, because the MCS-90 endorsement addresses only \u201cliability for negligence, and leaves \u2018all terms, conditions, and limitations\u2019 in the policy \u2018in full force.\u2019 \u201d We think that the district court was correct. The MCS-90 form states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">The insurance policy to which this endorsement is attached provides automobile liability insurance.... In consideration of the premium stated in the policy to which this endorsement is attached, the Insurer (the company) agrees to pay, within the limits of liability described herein, any final judgment recovered against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence in the operation, maintenance or use of motor vehicles [under the motor carrier act].... Such insurance as is afforded, for public liability, does not apply to injury to or death of the insured\u2019s employees while engaged in the course of their employment.... However, all terms, conditions, and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The MCS-90 form clearly states that it makes primary the carrier-lessee\u2019s insurance for judgments arising from the negligent operation of the vehicle, but otherwise leaves in full force and effect the insurance contract, including the contract\u2019s terms, conditions and limitations regarding UIM coverage. We find that the district court was correct in ruling that the insurance policy offered by Reliance is primary to the Travelers policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Having concluded that the district court correctly determined that Reliance is the primary insurer, we next consider whether the substitution of the Virginia Fund alters that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Following Reliance\u2019s insolvency, the Virginia Fund was substituted to fulfill Reliance\u2019s obligation. The Virginia Fund was formed as a non-profit organization to pay claims of insolvent insurers pursuant to the Virginia Property and Casualty Guaranty Association Act (\u201cGuaranty Act\u201d). Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-1600 <em>et seq. </em>The parties agree that the Virginia Guaranty Act is the appropriate law for determining the coverage questions arising from the Virginia Fund\u2019s substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The Virginia Fund is not intended merely to \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of an insolvent insurer, <em>Virginia Property and Casualty Ins. Guar. Assoc. v. International Ins. Co., </em>238 Va. 702, 385 S.E.2d 614, 616 (1989). Rather, it is part of a unique legislative scheme to protect policyholders from the consequences of an insurer\u2019s insolvency by providing for limited payments from a fund maintained by fees paid by insurers who practice in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">The Virginia Fund asserts two significant restrictions relevant to the instant case: first, the Virginia Fund is obligated to pay only covered claims \u201cnot exceeding $300,000 per claimant.\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2 \u2014 1606(A)(l)(a)(ii). Because Mr. and Mrs. Pilling are both potential claimants, the fund\u2019s cumulative obligation cannot exceed $600,000. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-1603 (defining claimant as \u201cany insured making a first party claim ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">The second significant restriction on claims payable by the fund is an Exhaustion of Remedies provision, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-14\">Any person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy ... shall be required to first seek recovery under the policy covered by the insurer which is not insolvent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under the insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-1610(A). The Virginia Fund argues that the Travelers policy, even if excess, is \u201cany\u201d provision in an insurance policy for the purposes of the exhaustion provision, and that therefore the Pillings must seek payment from Travelers before the Virginia Fund is obligated to make any payment. By focusing on \u201cany provision in an insurance policy,\u201d however, the Virginia Fund misses the other key phrase: \u201cAny person having a claim against an insurer.\u201d While the Virginia Supreme Court has not ruled on the application of this statute in a dispute between an excess insurer and the fund, the Virginia statute makes it clear that if a person has a claim against a solvent insurance company, he must seek recovery from that solvent insurance company before he can seek recovery from the Virginia Fund. <em>See id. </em>The pivotal question, then, is whether the Pillings \u201chave a claim against a [solvent] insurer under any provision in an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the question is whether, given the insolvency of their primary insurer, the Pillings have a claim in the first instance against Travelers, their \u201cexcess insurance\u201d carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Virginia law provides that \u201cthe law of the place where an insurance contract is written and delivered controls issues as to its coverage.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Doe, </em>246 Va. 67, 431 S.E.2d 289, 291 (1993). In this case, the \u201cexcess insurance\u201d policy underwritten by Travelers was written and delivered in Ohio. Accordingly, Virginia law directs this court to examine the law of Ohio to determine whether the Pillings have an available claim against Travelers. In other words, this court must determine whether, under Ohio law, an \u201cexcess insurance\u201d policy provides primary coverage when an insured\u2019s primary insurance carrier becomes insolvent. *</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The Travelers policy provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any other collectible uninsured motorists insurance providing coverage on a primary basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In <em>Revco D.S., Inc. v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>791 F.Supp. 1254 (N.D.Ohio 1991), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio noted that, under Ohio law, excess insurers do not have a duty to \u201cdrop down\u201d and assume coverage in the event of the insolvency of an underlying carrier unless, of course, the excess carrier expressly agrees to provide \u201cdrop down\u201d coverage. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">The two leading cases in Ohio on the drop down issue are: <em>Value City Inc. v. Integrity Ins. Co., </em>... 30 Ohio App.3d 274, 508 N.E.2d 184 [(1986)] and <em>Wurth v. Ideal Mut. Ins. Co., </em>... 34 Ohio App.3d 325, 518 N.E.2d 607 [(1987)]. The Court of Appeals for Warren County, in <em>Wurth, </em>provided a detailed discussion of the drop down issue and how such an issue is handled in the Ohio courts. The Court in that case indicated that cases from various jurisdictions addressing the issue have generally found drop down liability in one of several ways. First, some courts have found that, as a matter of public policy, excess insurers should be held liable to drop down in the event of insolvency of an underlying carrier. In <em>Wurth, </em>this public policy notion was rejected. The Court explained that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">[t]o adopt, due to public policy, a theory of \u201cdrop down\u201d liability would fundamentally alter the risk an excess coverage provider is obligated to provide by agreeing to issue excess liability insurance protection. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>we hold \u201cdrop down\u201d liability protection should not be judicially imposed on Ohio excess insurance providers as a matter of public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The <em>Wurth </em>Court also noted that parties to an insurance agreement can enter into an express agreement whereby the excess liability insurer agrees to drop down and assume coverage in the event of the insolvency of an underlying carrier. The Court stated that \u201cwe recognize that the inclusion of specific policy language manifesting an agreement by the excess insurer to \u2018drop down\u2019 and become the primary insurer, due to the insolvency of the primary insurer, may be expressly written into an excess liability policy.\u201d In such an instance, the court would enforce the clear intention of the parties to the insurance agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Finally, the <em>Wurth </em>Court noted that there may be instances in which insurance policies are ambiguous with respect <em>to </em>the drop down issue. The Court explained first, that if language in a policy is unambiguous, \u201cthe plain meaning ... [of such language] in an insurance policy should be enforced as written.\u201d If policy language is ambiguous, however, it should be construed against the insurer because the insurer \u201cmust accept responsibility for the wording chosen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\"><em>Revco D.S., Inc. v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>791 F.Supp. 1254, 1265 (N.D.Ohio 1991) (internal citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In <em>Wurth, an </em>excess insurer appealed the district court\u2019s holding that the insurer\u2019s liability \u201c \u2018dropped down\u2019 and became primary coverage when [the insured\u2019s] actual primary insurer ... became insolvent.\u201d 518 N.E.2d at 610. The policy provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he insurance afforded by this policy shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The Ohio Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">It seems to us, by definition and longstanding principle, that an excess insurer is not generally liable for any part of the loss or damage which is covered by other insurance (be it collectible or uncollectible), but is hable only for the amount of loss or damage in excess of the coverage provided by all other applicable insurance policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 610. The court rejected the argument that the policy was ambiguous because it did not explicitly provide for the situation in which other insurance is valid but <em>uncollectible, </em>such as when a primary insurer becomes insolvent. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12. The court examined the entire contract and stated that the term \u201c \u2018collectible\u2019 does not refer to the actual payment of a sum of money, but instead refers to the existence of other applicable insurance coverage based on the particular occurrence in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612. The court held that neither the insured nor persons injured by the insured had any right under the \u201cexcess insurance\u201d policy \u201cuntil [the insured\u2019s] underlying policy\u2019s limits were exhausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">In this case, the \u201cexcess insurance\u201d policy does not contain an express agreement in which Travelers agreed to \u201cdrop down\u201d and assume coverage in the event of the insolvency of the underlying carrier. Furthermore, the language of the policy is nearly identical to the language the Ohio Court of Appeals held to be unambiguous in <em>Wurth. </em>That language clearly states that the coverage provided by Travelers shall be <em>excess over </em>the coverage of the Pillings\u2019 primary insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">As Virginia law directs the application of Ohio law in this instance, and as the Pillings have no claim against Travelers under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Ohio law \u201cuntil [their] underlying policy\u2019s limits [are] exhausted,\u201d <em>Wurth, </em>518 N.E.2d at 613, the Pillings have no duty to seek recovery from Travelers before they seek recovery from the Virginia Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We find that the substitution of the Virginia Fund, while altering the potential coverage required by the primary insurer, does not alter the priority of the insurers. The decision of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED, and the case REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
