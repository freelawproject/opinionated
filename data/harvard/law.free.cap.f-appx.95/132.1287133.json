(\u201cPure Tech\u201d) operates a waste oil processing and recycling facility. In 1999, Pure Tech accepted a pair of 55-gallon drums of waste from a customer. One of the drums, unknown to Pure Tech, contained polychlorinated biphenyls, commonly termed \u201cPCBs.\u201d When Pure Tech processed the waste. Pure Tech\u2019s oil separation/water reclamation system was contaminated. Pure Tech then submitted a claim for losses from the PCB-contamination under property insurance policies issued by defendants-appellees Mt. Hawley Insurance Company and General Star Indemnity Company (together, the \u201cInsurers\u201d). The Insurers denied Pure Tech\u2019s claim based on a pollution exclusion clause in the policies, and Pure Tech filed suit. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Insurers, ruling that the pollution exclusion applied to the loss from PCB contamination. Pure Tech appealed. Because the pollution exclusion unambiguously excludes coverage for the loss incurred in this case, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\n<em>1. The Policies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Pure Tech operates a waste oil processing and recycling facility at 2655 Transport Road. Cleveland. Ohio (the \u201cFacility\u201d). At all times relevant to this suit, the Facility was insured by a pair of property insuranee policies issued by Mt. Hawley and General Star respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">The policies contain an identical pollution exclusion clause,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">1. Discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of \u201cpollutants\u201d unless the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape is itself caused by any of the \u201cspecified causes of loss\u201d. But if the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of \u201cpollutants\u201d results in a \u201cspecified cause of loss\u201d, we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that \u201cspecified cause of loss\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">The policies define \u201cpollutants\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">\u201cPollutants\u201d means any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste. Waste includes materials to be recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">Finally, the policies define \u201cspecified causes of loss\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">Fire; lightening; explosion; windstorm or hail; smoke; aircraft or vehicles; riot or civil commotion; vandalism; leakage from fire extinguishing equipment; sinkhole collapse; volcanic action; falling objects; weight of snow, ice or sleet; water damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">\n<em>2. The Loss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">Pure Tech entered into an agreement with North East Chemical Corporation (\u201cNEC\u201d) pursuant to which Pure Tech would receive waste material for process<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ing and recycling at the Facility. The agreement expressly forbade the acceptance of waste material containing PCBs.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">On August 4, 1999, NEC entered into an agreement with the I-X Convention Center, I-X Center Warehousing Corporation, and Park Corporation (collectively, the \u201cIX Center\u201d) for the treatment/disposal of several drums of waste material profiled as \u201cSoap Detergent \u2014 50%-60%: and Water, 50%-60%.\u201d On August 20 1999, pursuant to the agreement, NEC received two 55-gallon drums from the I-X Center. The drums were accompanied by a uniform hazardous waste manifest describing the waste as \u201cDOT Non-Regulated Material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On August 31, 1999, NEC emptied the drums received from the I-X Center into a Pure Tech tanker transport using the on-board vacuum pumping equipment contained within the tanker itself. In addition to the contents of the two 55-gallon drums, NEC consolidated other waste streams into the tanker. The resultant 4.700 gallons of waste material contained within the tanker was shipped to the Facility on August 31, 1999. Upon arrival at the Facility, the waste material was pumped from the tanker directly into a self-contained oil/water storage tank, where the material was subjected to an oil separation/water reclamation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On September 3, 1999, Pure Tech discovered the presence of PCBs above 50 ppm throughout the oil separation/water reclamation system at the Facility. The PCBs were contained entirely within the oil separation/water reclamation system and associated equipment. After an investigation, it was determined that the PCBs originated in one of the two 55-gallon drums that NEC received from the I-X Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The introduction of the PCBs into the oil separation/water reclamation process at the Facility resulted in the contamination of the Facility\u2019s storage tanks, pipes, pumps, and associated waste processing and recycling equipment. Consequently, Pure Tech submitted property damage and business interruption claims under the policies for (1) the removal and disposal of PCB-contaminated waste from the physical plant and equipment of the Facility, and (2) the decontamination and/or replacement of the Facility\u2019s PCB-contaminated storage tanks, pipes, pumps, and associated waste processing and recycling equipment. Pure Tech did not submit any claims for the removal and disposal of PCB-contaminated waste from any land, air, or water external to the physical plant and equipment of the Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\n<em>3. The Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">On February 8, 2000, Pure Tech filed suit against Mt. Hawley and General Star in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, seeking monetary damages for breach of contract and for bad faith handling and payment of Pure Tech\u2019s claims. On April 4, 2000. General Star filed a cross-claim against Mt. Hawley, and, on July 3, 2000, Mt. Hawley filed a cross-claim against General Star. On August 14, 2000, Mt. Hawley and General Star filed a third-party complaint against NEC and the I-X Center. The cross-claims and third-party claims seek indemnification and/or contribution in the event that Mt. Hawley or General Star is found liable for monetary damages to Pure Tech.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">On May 8, 2001, a magistrate judge filed a Report and Recommendation, which recommended that the district court deny Pure Tech\u2019s motion for summary judgment against the Insurers and grant the Insurers\u2019 motion for summary judgment against Pure Tech. The magistrate judge reasoned that the pollution exclusion applied to Pure Tech\u2019s claim, as the introduction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>PCBs into Pure Tech\u2019s facility constituted a \u201cdispersal\u201d or \u201cmigration\u201d of pollutants. On August 10, 2001, the district court entered an order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. In particular, the court stated that the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe mixing of the PCBs with other waste material and subsequent spreading of the material through Pure Tech\u2019s recycling system constituted \u2018dispersal\u2019 is well-reasoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On June 4, 2002, the district court certified its judgment as a final order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), finding that, because the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Insurers resolved all of the cross-claims and third-party claims, there was no just reason to delay an appeal of the summary judgment order. On June 20, 2002, Pure Tech filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>1. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Williams v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>187 F.3d 553, 560 (6th Cir.1999). Summary judgment will be granted where there exists no genuine issue of material fact. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The court views the evidence, all facts, and any inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skousen v. Brighton High Sch., </em>305 F.3d 520, 526 (6th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\n<em>2. Canons of Construction for Insurance Contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">\u201cIn Ohio, normal rules of contract construction apply to the interpretation of insurance policies.\u201d <em>St. Marys Foundry v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>332 F.3d 989, 992 (6th Cir.2003). Courts must give the words and phrases of an insurance policy their ordinary and usual meaning unless something in the contract indicates a contrary intention. <em>Ambrose v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas., </em>70 Ohio App.3d 797, 592 N.E.2d 868, 870 (1990). \u201cWhen words used in a policy have a plain and ordinary meaning, it is neither necessary nor permissible to construe a different meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Olmstead v. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., </em>22 Ohio St.2d 212, 259 N.E.2d 123, 126 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">At the same time, an insurance contract prepared by the insurer \u201cmust be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer if the language used is doubtful, uncertain or ambiguous.\u201d <em>Am. Fin. Corp. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>15 Ohio St.2d 171, 239 N.E.2d 33, 35 (1968). In particular, \u201c[w]hen an insurance policy includes ambiguous exclusions, \u2018a general presumption arises to the effect that that which is not clearly excluded from the operation of such contract is included in the operation thereof.\u2019\u201d <em>St. Marys, </em>332 F.3d at 992 (quoting <em>Moorman v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>4 Ohio St.3d 20, 445 N.E.2d 1122, 1124 (1983)). The insurer bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exclusion in a policy. <em>Cont\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Louis Marx Co., Inc., </em>64 Ohio St.2d 399, 415 N.E.2d 315, 317 (1980). In the final analysis, though, \u201c[cjourts should not ... construe an insurance contract against the insurer in the absence of ambiguity in its language.\u201d <em>St. Marys, </em>332 F.3d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">\n<em>3. The \u201cDispersal\u201d of the PCBs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">Applying these canons of construction, we conclude that the pollution exclusion applies to Pure Tech\u2019s claim. Under the language of the exclusion, the insurers are not liable to Pure Tech for damage resulting from (1) a discharge, dispersal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>seepage, migration, release or escape, (2) of pollutants, (3) not caused by a specified cause of loss. This appeal turns on the first element because Pure Tech has stipulated that the PCBs at issue are \u201cpollutants\u201d and because, as discussed <em>infra, </em>Pure Tech has waived any argument that the PCB damage resulted from a \u201cspecified cause of loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">As the district court properly concluded, the PCBs at issue were \u201cdispersed.\u201d The term \u201cdisperse,\u201d as ordinarily understood, means \u201cto cause to break up and go in different ways,\u201d \u201cto cause to become spread widely,\u201d or \u201cto spread or distribute from a fixed or constant source.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>653 (2002). According to the stipulated facts, the drum of waste material, which was contaminated by PCBs, was emptied into a tanker transport vehicle, where the waste material was consolidated with other waste material. Later, the waste material was pumped from the tanker into a self-contained oil/water storage tank at the Facility and subjected to an oil separation/water reclamation process. Thus, applying the usual meaning of the term, as the rules of interpretation require, the PCBs were \u201cdispersed\u201d throughout the waste material contained in the tanker, and later throughout Pure Tech\u2019s oil separation/water reclamation system and associated equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Pure Tech offers a pair of \u201cplain language\u201d arguments in response. First, it contends that, by its plain language, the exclusion applies only to \u201ctraditional environmental contamination,\u201d on the theory that \u201cdischarge,\u201d \u201cdispersal,\u201d \u201cseepage,\u201d \u201cmigration,\u201d \u201crelease,\u201d and \u201cescape\u201d are environmental terms of art. However, Ohio law mandates that the court give policy terms \u201ctheir ordinary and usual meaning.\u201d <em>Ambrose, </em>592 N.E.2d at 870. Second, Pure Tech argues that the district court\u2019s ruling \u201crendered meaningless the terms \u2018discharge, dispersal, release, escape\u2019 because every pollutant becomes introduced to the premises in some fashion.\u201d But the use of a series of broad overlapping terms does not necessarily imply that there exists a residual category to which they do not extend. Such a list of terms may just as well have been intended to be comprehensive. In any event, the terms in question, as ordinarily understood, have ascertainable meanings, which the district court applied in its summary judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Pure Tech raises a bevy of additional arguments, most of which ignore the language at issue and none of which are convincing. In support, Pure Tech relies extensively upon <em>Anderson v. Highland House Co., </em>93 Ohio St.3d 547, 757 N.E.2d 329 (2001), a decision of the Ohio Supreme Court released after the district court\u2019s ruling in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">In <em>Anderson, </em>the owner of an apartment complex was sued when a resident of the complex died after inhaling carbon monoxide fumes from a faulty heating unit. <em>Id. </em>at 331. The owner sought indemnification under a commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy, but its insurer denied covered based on a pollution exclusion similar in wording to the exclusion at bar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 331-32. In concluding that the exclusion did not apply, the court held that \u201ccarbon monoxide emitted from a malfunctioning residential heater is not a pollutant under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the pollution exclusion of a comprehensive general liability policy unless specifically enumerated as such.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Though <em>Anderson </em>seemingly resolved a narrow question, it arguably bespeaks a general method of interpreting pollution exclusions. Citing the rule that ambiguous terms \u2014 particularly ambiguous exclusions \u2014 are construed against the insurer, the court stressed that \u201cif a policy does not plainly exclude a claim from coverage, then an insured may infer that the claim will be covered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332. The court then observed that the pollution exclusion was written into CGL policies in order to shield insurers from \u201cthe enormous expense and exposure resulting from the explosion of <em>environmental </em>litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334 (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis in the original). The court concluded that \u201c[b]ased on the history and original purposes for the pollution exclusion, it was reasonable for [the insured] to believe that the policies purchased for their multiunit complex would not exclude claims for injuries due to carbon monoxide leaks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Invoking these passages, Pure Tech contends that <em>Anderson </em>\u201cconclusively establishes that the district court erred in its attempt to determine how Ohio courts would apply the \u2018absolute\u2019 pollution exclusion.\u201d But <em>Anderson </em>does not require us to strain the language of the exclusion to find coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Pure Tech contends that <em>Anderson </em>\u201cimplicitly held that the \u2018absolute\u2019 pollution exclusion was so overly broad as to effectively be ambiguous.\u201d This assertion, as best we can decipher, subsumes two interrelated arguments: (1) <em>Anderson </em>establishes that the exclusion, as applied to the facts at bar, is ambiguous; and (2) <em>Anderson </em>branded the language of the exclusion so broad and general as to be meaningless and, hence, unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Neither argument withstands scrutiny. The <em>Anderson </em>court held that a particular element of the exclusion \u2014 \u201cpollutant\u201d\u2014 was ambiguous as applied to the facts at issue \u2014 carbon monoxide emitted from a faulty heating unit. <em>Anderson </em>hardly mandates the conclusion that a separate element \u2014 \u201cdispersal\u201d\u2014is ambiguous as applied to dissimilar facts \u2014 the introduction of PCBs from outside the premises. Likewise, the <em>Anderson </em>opinion by its terms does not hold that the exclusion was so broad as to be meaningless. There is therefore no basis for us to take the drastic step of holding that the exclusion, a standardized term routinely included in insurance contracts, is unenforceable on the ground of overbreadth. <em>See Stiriz v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co., </em>No. F-01-010, 2002 WL 479826, at *5 (Ohio Ct.App. Mar. 29, 2002) (holding that the exclusion, as incorporated in a property insurance policy, was not \u201cso broad and general as to eliminate all pollution coverage, thereby rendering the coverage language meaningless, against public policy, or unenforceable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Pure Tech also argues that Anderson \u201cimplicitly recognized the reasonable-expectations doctrine in the context of the pollution exclusion.\u201d Under the reasonable-expectations doctrine, customers who adhere to standardized agreements \u201care not bound to unknown terms which are beyond the range of reasonable expectation.\u201d Anderson, 757 N.E.2d at 333 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 211 cmt. f (1981)). However, although the <em>Anderson </em>court observed that \u201cthis rationale could apply to the case at bar,\u201d it made \u201cno determination on the merits of the reasonable-expectations doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333. And in a subsequent decision, the Ohio Supreme Court observed that \u201cthere is not yet a majority on this court willing to accept the reasonable-expectations doctrine.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Balint, </em>94 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>182, 761 N.E.2d 598, 606 (2002). Thus, we would overstep our role as a federal court sitting in diversity if we applied the reasonable-expectations doctrine, a rule that Ohio Supreme Court has recently declined to adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Pure Tech next advances a pair of arguments based on the \u201chistory\u201d of the exclusion. Citing <em>Anderson </em>and other decisions interpreting CGL policies. Pure Tech explains that \u201cthe predominant motivation in drafting an exclusion for pollution-related injuries was the avoidance of the enormous expense and exposure resulting from the explosion of <em>environmental </em>litigation.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>757 N.E.2d at 334 (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis in original); <em>see also Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>74 Ohio Misc.2d 144, 660 N.E.2d 746, 750 (1993) (\u201cIt is evident that the standard pollution exclusion was developed over twenty years ago in response to insurers\u2019 concerns over <em>environmentally </em>related losses and liabilities.\u201d (emphasis in original)) This history, Pure Tech insists, demonstrates that the exclusion applies only to \u201ctraditional environmental contamination.\u201d Likewise, Pure Tech continues, courts reading the exclusion in light of its history have held that the exclusion does not preclude coverage of \u201cinjuries caused by toxic substances confined within the area of their intended use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The \u201chistory\u201d of the exclusion does not compel this court to disregard the plain language of the exclusion. First, the court is not at liberty to graft an additional term onto the exclusion based on the exclusion\u2019s history, especially a term as vague and potentially unworkable as \u201ctraditional environmental contamination.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See St. Mar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>ys, </em>332 F.3d at 992 (explaining that, under Ohio law, a court \u201ccannot look to evidence outside of the policy where the contract is clear and unambiguous\u201d). Second, even if we assume for the sake of argument that the exclusion does not apply to \u201cinjuries caused by toxic substances confined within the area of their intended use.\u201d this qualification does not rescue Pure Tech\u2019s claim. Pure Tech\u2019s agreement with NEC expressly forbade the acceptance of waste materials containing PCBs and, hence, the PCBs were not \u201cconfined within the area of their intended use.\u201d <em>Compare Meridian Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kellman, </em>197 F.3d 1178, 1184 (6th Cir.1999) (holding that fumes from toxic chemicals used to seal a floor at a school, which injured a teacher in the room below sealed floor, were \u201cconfined within the general area of their intended use\u201d): <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. S-W Indus., Inc., </em>39 F.3d 1324, 1336 (6th Cir.1994) (holding that fumes from the plant\u2019s rubber fabricating processes, which injured an employee working in the area, were \u201cconfined within the area of their intended use\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Finally, Pure Tech argues that the district court\u2019s interpretation of the exclusion \u201cresults in the absurd \u2014 virtually no coverage to Plaintiff.\u201d Pure Tech asserts that because the exclusion defines \u201cpollutant\u201d as encompassing \u201cwaste\u201d (which includes \u201cmaterials to be recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed\u201d), and because its business involves the movement, processing, and circulation of waste oil, the district court\u2019s interpretation \u201cvirtually eliminates all coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Pure Tech\u2019s argument is unconvincing. This case does not present the issue of whether the waste material regularly accepted by Pure Tech in the course of its business qualifies as a \u201cpollutant,\u201d and we decline to reach the issue. Further, the policies do cover damage resulting from the \u201cdispersal\u201d etc. of pollution if any one of the specified \u201ccauses of loss\u201d causes the damage. Finally, from our reading, it appears that the policies cover a wide range of \u201cproperty damage\u201d having no arguable connection to \u201cpollution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In sum, the pollution exclusion at issue unambiguously precludes coverage of the loss from PCB contamination, and this court must enforce the policies as written. <em>St. Marys, </em>332 F.3d at 993 (cautioning that, if a policy term is unambiguous, the insured \u201cmay not have the benefit of interpretative doctrines that require [a court] to read an ambiguous exclusion in favor of coverage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">4. <em>Vandalism as a \u201cSpecified Cause of Loss\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">On appeal, Pure Tech argues, for the first time, that the PCB contamination resulted from vandalism, a \u201cspecified cause of loss\u201d under the policies. Pure Tech maintains that it preserved this argument in the parties\u2019 Stipulation of Undisputed Facts on their Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment on the Application of the Pollutants Exclusion, which reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">By stipulating to those facts relevant to the determination of the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the \u201cpollutants exclusion,\u201d the parties to this Stipulation do not intend to, nor do they[,] waive the later presentation of any other claim or defense they might have against each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Pure Tech requests that this court either find that the PCB contamination was the product of vandalism or remand the issue to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Pure Tech has waived its \u201cvandalism\u201d argument. Pure Tech concedes that it did not present this argument to the district court, and we conclude that Pure Tech did not preserve this issue in the stipulation. Quite plainly, the question of whether the loss in question was caused by a \u201cspecified cause of loss\u201d \u2014 and, hence, not subject to the pollution exclusion \u2014 is part of \u201cthe determination of the application of the \u2018pollutants exclusion\u2019 \u201d and not simply \u201cany other claim or defense,\u201d as Pure Tech argues. The Insurers moved for summary judgment on the ground that the pollution exclusion precluded coverage of the damage from PCB contamination, and Pure Tech should have raised its argument that the clause did not apply because the damage was caused by vandalism \u2014 an argument based on the language of the clause itself \u2014 at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In fact, during the proceedings below, Pure Tech was alerted to the necessity of presenting any \u201cspecified cause of loss\u201d argument in response to the Insurers\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In its motion, the Insurers asserted that the PCB contamination was not caused by a \u201cspecified cause of loss.\u201d Similarly, in recommending that summary judgment be granted to the Insurers, the magistrate judge noted, \u201cNone of the parties appear to contend that the PCB contamination was a result of any of the specified causes of loss.\u201d Yet Pure Tech did not raise its \u201cvandalism\u201d argument at any point.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Finally, Pure Tech contends that, even if it did not preserve its \u201cvandalism\u201d argument, \u201cjustice\u201d requires that the court consider the argument anyway. We are not persuaded that the instant cases presents \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d compelling us to depart from our general practice of refusing to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See In re Allied Supermarkets, Inc., </em>951 F.2d 718, 725 (6th Cir.1991) (\u201cAlthough as a general rule federal appellate courts do not consider issues not passed on below, deviations are permitted in exceptional circumstances.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-20\">. The clause uses standardized language promulgated by an insurance industry group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">. Specifically, the exclusion provided that the policy did not apply to \" \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants.\u201d Id. at 331. The policy defined \u201cpollutants\u201d as \"any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b170-5\">. Though by no means clear, it appears that Pure Tech would define \"traditional environmental contamination\u201d as the \"discharge ...\u201d of \"pollutants\u201d <em>into or upon the land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water. </em>The initial version of the exclusion drafted by the insurance industry contained the italicized language, and Pure Tech contends that the deletion of this language from the exclusion did not change its meaning. None of the cases cited by Pure Tech, however, warrant a departure from fundamental canons of construction by adding the \"into or upon the land\u201d clause-or some other formulation of \"traditional environmental contamination\u201d-to the version of the exclusion at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The <em>Anderson </em>court does quote the following passage from a decision of the Illinois Supreme Court: \"We would be remiss ... if we were to simply look at the bare words of the exclusion, ignore its raison d'etre, and apply it to situations which do not remotely resemble traditional environmental contamination.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>757 N.E.2d at 332 (quoting <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Koloms, </em>177 Ill.2d 473, 227 Ill.Dec. 149, 687 N.E.2d 72, 81 (1997)). However, the <em>Anderson </em>court quotes this passage during its explication of the rule that ambiguous terms are construed in favor of the insured, and it would stretch <em>Andersons </em>holding to conclude that Ohio law requires the court to add the element of \"traditional environmental contamination\u201d to the unambiguous language of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">The majority of the other decisions cited by Pure Tech simply stand for the proposition that toxic substances that cause injury while confined to their area of intended use have not been \"discharged, dispersed, released or escaped\u201d; these decisions apply the language of the exclusion to a particular scenario and do not read the element of \"traditional environmental contamination\u201d into the exclusion. <em>See Meridian Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kellman, </em>197 F.3d 1178, 1183 (6th Cir.1999) (applying Michigan law) (holding that movement of fumes from chemicals used to seal a floor to the room below the floor being sealed did not constitute a \"discharged, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape\u201d); <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. S-W Indus., Inc., </em>39 F.3d 1324, 1336 (6th Cir.1994) (applying Ohio law) (holding that fumes created by a rubber fabricating processes confined to that portion of the plant where the processes occurred were not \"discharged, dispersed, released or escaped\u201d); <em>Ctr. for Creative Studies v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>871 F.Supp. 941, 946 (E.D.Mich. 1994) (applying Michigan law) (holding that fumes from chemicals used to develop film, which injured a student developing film, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>not \"discharged, dispersed, released or escaped\u201d). The remaining decisions either apply the original version of the exclusion, which contained the \"into or upon land\u201d clause, or do not interpret Ohio law. <em>West Am. Ins. Co. v. Tufco Flooring East, Inc. </em>104 N.C.App. 312, 409 S.E.2d 692, 699 (1991), <em>overruled, on other grounds by Gaston County Dyeing Mach. Co. v. Northfield Ins. Co., </em>351 N.C. 293, 524 S.E.2d 558 (2000) (holding that, under North Carolina law, the exclusion applies only to discharges into the environment); <em>Owens-Coming, </em>660 N.E.2d at 754 (holding that asbestos fibers \"released\u201d into the air inside a building were not \"released\u201d \"into the atmosphere\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
