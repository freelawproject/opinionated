Substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) determination that Teka was not credible, and that Teka has not shown that he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">Abebe Teka is a 34 year-old Ethiopian native and citizen. As a professional singer and songwriter, he uses his songs to plead for peace and cooperation. He states that his songs express support for the All Amhara People\u2019s Organization (\u201cAAPO\u201d), a recognized opposition group. He also contends that because of his support for the AAPO, Ethiopian officials imprisoned him, once for four months in 1992 and once for nine months in 1997. He alleges that prison officials tortured him and that the government shut down the nightclub he owned during both periods of imprisonment. After recording a new album in 1997, Teka claims to have left Ethiopia to escape further persecution. Teka arrived at the Los Angeles International Airport on January 25, 1998. During his airport interview with INS officials, he presented a false Italian passport and told his interviewers, \u201cI want to come here to meet my Mend and the reason I left Ethiopia is because the government closed my restaurant.\u201d Teka failed to mention being in prison or being beaten while in Ethiopia.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">The IJ found that Teka was not credible. An adverse credibility finding will be upheld if it is \u201c \u2018supported by a specific, cogent reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>De Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Berroteran-Melendez v. INS, </em>955 F.2d 1251, 1256 (9th Cir.1992)). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by \u201csignificant and relevant\u201d inconsistencies in the record. <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). Teka\u2019s airport interview calls into doubt his true motives for leaving Ethiopia and coming to the United States. When asked if he feared returning to Ethiopia, he did not mention his imprisonments but responded, \u201cI\u2019m concerned because I didn\u2019t have a legal passport and that when I go back I might be in trouble.\u201d When asked if he would be harmed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Ethiopia, he responded, \u201cI can return, it\u2019s no problem.\u201d Teka\u2019s presentation of a fake Italian passport to INS airport officials further erodes his credibility. <em>Sarvia-Quintanilla v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1387, 1393 (9th Cir.1985) (concluding that an IJ reasonably questioned a petitioner\u2019s credibility where the petitioner admitted to carrying a fake Mexican passport and lying to INS officials to avoid deportation). Specific, cogent reasons supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding; the evidence presented does not \u201ccompel[] a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary result.\u201d <em>Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 911 (9th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Abedini v. INS, </em>971 F.2d 188, 191 (9th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Teka cannot establish his eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation. A petitioner for asylum must show that he has a well-founded fear of persecution by demonstrating that \u201chis fear of persecution is both objectively reasonable and subjectively genuine.\u201d <em>Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000). Teka cannot show that his fear of persecution is subjectively genuine. Because Teka cannot demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, he necessarily cannot meet the higher burden of showing a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d required for withholding of removal. <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b924-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
