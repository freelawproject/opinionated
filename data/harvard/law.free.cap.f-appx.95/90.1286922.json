For the first time on appeal, Summers alleges that he attempted to comply with the district court\u2019s order but was unable to do so because prison officials did not timely respond to his request for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">This court will not consider factual allegations raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
