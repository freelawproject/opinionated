The complaint requested damages and injunctive relief. On November 12, 2002, Officer Gulley moved for summary judgment. On February 26, 2003, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois granted Officer Gulley\u2019s motion and entered judgment in his favor. The Wiggins timely appealed. For the reasons set forth in this order, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">Roy Wiggins has been diagnosed since 1989 as suffering from acute light sensitivity. Mr. Wiggins and his wife own two vehicles: a 1999 Ford Mustang and a 1994 Honda Accord. Both of these vehicles have tinted windows. Andrea Wiggins, Roy\u2019s daughter, is a college student who lives at home with her parents. She sometimes drives these vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-17\">Section 12-503(a) of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/12-503(a), prohibits any person from driving \u201ca motor vehicle with any ... tinted film upon the front windshield ... or side windows immediately adjacent to each side of the driver.\u201d This prohibition became effective on January 1, 1998. There is a medical exception to this prohibition located in \u00a7 12-503(g); this exception phases out on January 1, 2008. Section 12-503(g) excludes motor vehicles when the tint was applied \u201cbefore the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997 [January 1, 1998],\u201d and either (1) the vehicle is owned by someone suffering from a condition which requires that their eyes be \u201cshielded from the direct rays of sun,\u201d or (2) the vehicle is used in transporting someone who \u201cresides at the same address\u201d as a person with the condition. 625 ILCS 5/12-503(g)(l)-(2). The tint on both of the Wiggins\u2019 vehicles was applied after January 1, 1998. <em>See </em>R. Wiggins Dep. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Beginning in February of 2001 and ending in January of 2002, nine citations were issued to Roy and Andrea Wiggins under \u00a7 12-503 as a result of the tint. These tickets were issued by Officer Gulley and two other ISP officers, Nathan Douglas and Richard White. All tickets were adjudicated in the Circuit Court for the First Judicial Circuit, Saline County, Illinois.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No appeal was ever taken from any of the circuit court\u2019s dispositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The first ticket (# 01 TR 542) was issued on February 17, 2001, by Officer Gulley to Andrea while she was driving the 1999 Ford. Andrea pleaded guilty to violating \u00a7 12-503. The next ticket (# 01 TR 806) was issued on March 10, 2001, by Officer Gulley to Andrea while she was driving the 1999 Ford. A trial was held, and the circuit court found Andrea guilty of violating \u00a7 12-503(a) and not exempt under \u00a7 12-503(g). On March 20, 2001, Officer Gulley issued a ticket (# 01 TR 879) to Roy while he was driving the 1999 Ford. Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Lowell Tison, Jr., filed a motion to dismiss the ticket, specifying no reason. The court granted the motion without explanation. On April 4, 2001, Officer Douglas issued Roy a ticket (# 01 TR 1028) while he was driving the 1999 Ford. Tison again filed a motion to dismiss, again specifying no reason; the court again granted the motion, again without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">On May 23, 2001, Andrea received a ticket (# 01 TR 1500) from Officer Gulley while driving the 1999 Ford. On August 10, 2001, Andrea\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss this ticket. The motion argued that \u00a7 12-503 was \u201cunconstitutional as applied to vehicles registered to Illinois residents with a medical need to protect their eyes from the sun after January 1, 1998, under the equal protection clause of the Illinois and federal constitutions.\u201d R.33, Ex.E II 6. On August 20, 2001, the circuit court held a hearing on the motion. Officer Gulley did not attend the hearing due to another assignment. Saline County State\u2019s Attorney Rod Wolf appeared for the State and told the court: \u201cIt\u2019s [sic] not a lot at stake here. With respect to this case, I\u2019m not going to object to it on a Motion to Dismiss on a tinted window.\u201d R.33, Ex.0 at 2. Judge Lockwood responded: \u201cOkay. Then the motion will be granted.\u201d Id. The record contains a sheet which merely notes: \u201c8/20/01 Trooper did not appear \u2014 Motion is not resisted \u2014 Motion to Dismiss is granted.\u201d R.33, Ex.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">On August 6, 2001, Andrea received a ticket (# 01 TR 2420) from Officer Gulley while driving the 1999 Ford. Andrea\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss, again alleging that \u00a7 12-503, as applied to the Wiggins, violated equal protection. On September 28, 2001, the circuit court issued a written opinion declaring \u00a7 12-503 unconstitutional \u201cas applied to vehicles registered to Illinois residents with a medical need to protect their eyes from the sun after January 1, 1998.\u201d R.33, Ex.H 115. The court explained: \u201c[T]here is no [sic] absolutely no rational basis ... for treating citizens such as Mr. Wiggins dissimilarly from others similarly situated whose window tints antedate January 1, 1998.\u201d Id. 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">On August 23, 2001, Officer Gulley issued a ticket (# 01 TR 2621) to Roy while he was driving the 1994 Honda. Roy\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss on August 31, 2001. The motion claimed: \u201cUnder 625 ILCS 5/12 \u2014 503(g)(1), the prohibition against tinted side windows does not apply to this 1994 Honda automobile.... \u201d R.33, Ex.I H 4. The record sheet for this ticket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>states: \u201c9/26/01 Vacate Judgment \u2014 Motion to Dismiss filed \u2014 Motion to Dismiss is granted.\u201d R.33, Ex.I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">On September 17, 2001, Andrea, while driving the 1999 Ford, received a ticket (# 01 TR 2868) from Officer Gulley. On October 1, 2001, Andrea\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss again challenging \u00a7 12-503\u2019s constitutionality as applied to the Wiggins. Then, on October 11, 2001, her counsel filed a \u201cSUPPLEMENTAL MOTION TO DISMISS.\u201d R.33, Ex.J. This motion argued: \u201cOn September 28, 2001, in Case No.2001-TR-2420, this Court entered its order deciding this identical issue, and ruled that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied.... This prosecution-and any further prosecution of this defendant for this charge based on driving this vehicle-are barred by collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>11111-2. The record sheet for this ticket notes: \u201cDismissed.\u201d R.33, Ex.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The last ticket (# 02 TR 147) was issued on January 10, 2002, by Officer White to Roy while he was driving the 1994 Honda. On this day, White was a probationary officer riding with Officer Douglas, his supervising officer, on field training. Officer Douglas saw Officer Gulley\u2019s car parked, and Douglas and White pulled over so that White could meet Gulley. Officer White testified that, as they were talking, \u201cone of them said, \u2018Do you want to get a ticket for window tint. There goes a car with tinted windows.\u2019 \u201d White Dep. at 14-15. The car turned out to be Roy\u2019s 1994 Honda. Officer White approached the car, which was parked in a handicap space, and Roy gave him the medical excuse for the tinted windows. Officer White returned to the squad car to write Roy a ticket for parking in the handicap space; however, he was unsure if the medical excuse constituted a valid exemption from \u00a7 12-503(a). <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. His first instinct was to \u201clet him slide\u201d on the tinted windows violation because he had an excuse. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">At some point after Officer White got back in the car, Officer Gulley pulled up on the passenger side, where Officer Douglas was sitting. Officer White testified that he overheard Gulley tell Douglas that \u201c[y]ou guys should write him a ticket ... because that is not valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25. Officers White and Douglas pulled \u00a7 12-503 up on a computer in the squad car, and they read it together. Officer White explained that he concluded Roy should be ticketed under \u00a7 12-503 \u201cwith a combination of reading that and with my training officer [Douglas] telling me the way he looked at it that it was not \u2014 it was not a valid excuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Officer Douglas described the January 10, 2002 stop in a similar manner. He testified that he heard Gulley tell White that the medical excuse was not valid, \u201cwhich I [Douglas] reiterated was correct.\u201d Douglas Dep. at 25-26. However, he also testified that neither he nor Gulley directed White to write Roy a tinted windows ticket, <em>id. </em>at 33, and that the ultimate decision was White\u2019s alone, <em>id. </em>at 25, 27, 33. Officer Gulley testified that he pulled up for \u201ca matter of seconds and left.\u201d Gulley Dep. at 93. He elaborated that, after he drove up beside Officer Douglas, \u201cthey told me that he had an excuse. And I said, Well [sic], it\u2019s not valid, and I drove off. That\u2019s \u2014 it was Trooper White\u2019s ticket. Trooper Douglas was the [Field Training Officer], He was doing the instructing so I didn\u2019t want to interfere with his teaching.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 92. Finally, Roy testified that, while he was stopped, Officer Gulley circled them \u201clike a buzzard,\u201d but Roy also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>explained that he had no knowledge of the conversation between the officers. R. Wiggins Dep. at 44. On January 16, 2002, Roy\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss the January 10 ticket. This motion argued that the prohibition against tinted windows was inapplicable to the 1994 Honda under the medical exception in \u00a7 12-503(g). The record sheet for this ticket states: \u201cDismissed.\u201d R.33, Ex.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">In a memorandum and order dated February 26, 2003, the district court granted Officer Gulley\u2019s motion for summary judgment. R.41. Beginning with the Wiggins\u2019 Fourth Amendment claim, the court explained that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs argue ... that probable cause no longer existed once the Saline County Circuit Court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to Roy Wiggins\u2019s vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. The court concluded this argument was \u201cmisguided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. The court explained that a Fourth Amendment claim for an unreasonable seizure will lie against an arresting officer who arrests a suspect pursuant to a constitutionally infirm statute only if the officer could not have reasonably relied on the constitutionality of the statute, \u201cand such an action is based upon the specific constitutional infirmity of the statute \u2014 not necessarily upon the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u2018unreasonable seizures.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court held, the Wiggins\u2019 challenge was analyzed properly under equal protection doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The district court then inquired into the Wiggins\u2019 equal protection claim under the two-part qualified immunity test of <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). The court explained that, under <em>Saucier, </em>\u201c[Qirst a court must consider whether the undisputed facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the party asserting injury, indicate that the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right. [Saucier; 533 U.S. at 201]. Only once a court has found, under the appropriate standard, the existence of a constitutional violation, must a court consider whether the undisputed facts indicate that the right violated was clearly established. <em>[Id.].\u201d Id. </em>at 7-8. The court considered two possible theories through which the Wiggins\u2019 equal protection rights were violated by Officer Gulley: \u201c(1) that Gulley\u2019s conduct (enforcing \u00a7 12-503) was not rationally related to any legitimate state interest, and (2) that Gulley singled out the plaintiffs for differential treatment solely because of his personal animus for the plaintiffs [the so-called \u201cclass of one\u201d challenge].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Beginning with the first, the district court held that, \u201c[b]ecause there is no dispute that the plaintiffs actually violated \u00a7 12-503, the question is really whether the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The court concluded it did not.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court noted that, because the Wiggins were not members of a suspect or quasi-suspect class, \u00a7 12-503 was appropriately considered under a rational basis standard. Section 12-503 passed this standard, the court held, because it advanced the legitimate purpose of protecting police officers, and the \u201clegislature could have reasonably determined that this incremental approach would be less burdensome on Illinois automobile owners than an outright ban on all tinted windows.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. Finally, the court concluded that, even assuming \u00a7 12-503 did vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>late equal protection principles, and thus the Wiggins\u2019 equal protection rights were violated by Officer Gulley, \u201c[a]ny constitutional right violated was not clearly established at the relevant time.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Turning to the Wiggins\u2019 \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claim, the district court noted that the Wiggins failed to offer any evidence that they were treated differently from similarly situated people. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Specifically, \u201c[t]he plaintiffs have not directed the Court\u2019s attention to any evidence that Gulley or his alleged cohorts failed to stop other cars with tinted windows.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court held, the Wiggins\u2019 \u201cclass of one\u201d challenge also had to be dismissed for failure of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of grant summary judgment de novo. <em>See Cerutti v. BASF Corp., </em>349 F.3d 1055, 1060 (7th Cir.2003). In conducting this inquiry, we are obliged to construe all facts, and draw all reasonable inferences from those facts, in favor of the non-moving party, in this case, the Wiggins. <em>See id. </em>Summary judgment is proper when the \u201cpleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see <em>also Lewis v. Holsum of Ft. Wayne, Inc., </em>278 F.3d 706, 709 (7th Cir.2002) (\u201cIf the nonmoving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because \u2018a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the [nonmovant\u2019s] case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986))). In order to present a <em>genuine </em>issue of material fact, the non-moving party must \u201cdo more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no \u2018genuine issue for trial.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 587,106 S.Ct. 1348 (citing <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv. Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">The parties agree that, because Officer Gulley has claimed qualified immunity, our inquiry is governed by <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). Under <em>Saucier, </em>the \u201cthreshold question\u201d is: \u201cTaken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. The Wiggins have argued to this court that the district court misconstrued their legal theory. They claim that, when a court of jurisdiction holds a statute unconstitutional as applied to a certain citizen, an officer\u2019s subsequent traffic stop and ticketing of that citizen under that constitutionally infirm statute violates the citizen\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Even assuming this is true, which we shall do for purposes of this appeal, we hold that the Wiggins have failed to present sufficient evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>to create an issue of triable fact as to whether Officer Gulley caused a violation of their federal rights. <em>See id.; see also Brokaw v. Mercer County, </em>235 F.3d 1000, 1012 (7th Cir.2000) (explaining that to \u201cestablish personal liability in a \u00a7 1983 action, the plaintiff must show that the government officer caused the deprivation of a federal right\u201d (quotations marks and citation omitted)). Specifically, the Wiggins have failed to present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Officer Gulley issued, or caused to be issued, a ticket to them under \u00a7 12-503 after the Saline County Circuit Court ruled that \u00a7 12-503 was unconstitutional as applied to them. For this reason, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment must be affirmed, albeit on different grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The first question we must determine is when the clock started for purposes of the Wiggins\u2019 legal theory, which requires us to determine the time at which the circuit court held \u00a7 12-503 unconstitutional as applied to the Wiggins. The circuit court issued its only written opinion declaring \u00a7 12-503 unconstitutional as applied on September 28, 2001, in response to the motion to dismiss Andrea\u2019s August 6, 2001 ticket (# 01 TR 2420). R.33, Ex.H. However, the Wiggins argue that the circuit court actually held \u00a7 12-503 unconstitutional as applied on August 20, 2001. This is the date on which the circuit court held a hearing on Andrea\u2019s motion to dismiss the May 23, 2001 ticket (# 01 TR 1500), which argued \u00a7 12-503 was unconstitutional as applied to the Wiggins. As noted above, State\u2019s Attorney Wolf, who appeared at that hearing, told the court that there is \u201cnot a lot at stake here. With respect to this case, I\u2019m not going to object to it on a Motion to Dismiss on a tinted window\u201d; Judge Lockwood responded: \u201cOkay. Then the motion will be granted.\u201d R.33, Ex.0 at 2. The record contains a sheet which merely notes: \u201c8/20/01 Trooper did not appear. Motion is not resisted. Motion to Dismiss is granted.\u201d R.33, Ex.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Based on this evidence, we cannot conclude that the circuit court held \u00a7 12-503 unconstitutional as applied on August 20, 2001. The most plausible reading is that the court was dismissing the May 23 ticket because Officer Gulley did not appear and the motion was not resisted. This reading is reinforced by the fact that the court issued a separate opinion on September 28, 2001, declaring \u00a7 12-503 unconstitutional as applied, and this opinion does not in any way reference the August 20 disposition. It is also telling that Andrea\u2019s counsel, in an October 11, 2001 \u201cSUPPLEMENTAL MOTION TO DISMISS,\u201d argued that collateral estoppel principles precluded any enforcement of \u00a7 12-503 against the Wiggins because \u201c[o]n September 28, 2001, in Case No.2001-TR-2420, this Court entered its order deciding this identical issue, and ruled that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied.\u201d R.33, Ex.J 111. Finally, we note that any theory which would hold an officer hable for enforcing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>constitutionally infirm statute would have to include the condition that the officer be put on some sort of notice of the statute\u2019s unconstitutionality. <em>See Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 555, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967), <em>overruled, on other grounds as stated in Hill v. Shelander, </em>992 F.2d 714, 716-17 (7th Cir.1993); <em>Foster v. Zeeko, </em>540 F.2d 1310, 1313 (7th Cir.1976). The circuit court\u2019s terse statements in its August 20 disposition cannot reasonably be said to put Officer Gulley on any form of notice that the statute was held unconstitutional as applied to the Wiggins. For these reasons, we must reject the Wiggins\u2019 contention and hold that the clock started on September 28, 2001, when the circuit court issued its opinion declaring \u00a7 12-503 unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">After the clock started on September 28, 2001, only one more ticket was issued to the Wiggins: the January 10, 2002 ticket (# 02 TR 147) issued by Officer White, then a probationary officer, to Roy. The Wiggins argue that this ticket is attributable to Officer Gulley because he \u201ccaused\u201d Officer White to issue it. <em>See Brokaw, </em>235 F.3d at 1012 (\u201cAn official causes a constitutional violation if he sets in motion a series of events that defendant knew or reasonably should have known would cause others to deprive plaintiff of constitutional rights.\u201d). However, after a careful review of the record, we must conclude that the evidence is insufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Officer Gulley \u201ccaused\u201d this ticket to be issued to Roy.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">As noted in our rendition of the facts, the deposition testimony of all three officers reveals that Officer White heard Officer Gulley state that Roy\u2019s medical exception was not valid and that a ticket under \u00a7 12-503 was warranted. <em>See </em>White Dep. at 25-26; Douglas Dep. at 25-26; Gulley Dep. at 92-93. However, their testimony also reveals that the decision to issue the ticket under \u00a7 12-503 was either Officer White\u2019s alone, or, at most, Officer White\u2019s and Officer Douglas\u2019. <em>See </em>White Dep. at 26 (\u201cI concluded by \u2014 with a combination of reading that and with my training officer [Douglas] telling me the way he looked at it that it was not \u2014 it was not a valid excuse.\u201d); Douglas Dep. at 25, 27, 33; Gulley Dep. at 92-93. Furthermore, Mr. Wiggins\u2019 testimony does not undercut this conclusion. He notes that Officer Gulley\u2019s car circled them \u201clike a buzzard,\u201d but he also concedes he has no knowledge of the conversation between the officers. R. Wiggins Dep. at 44. Neither this testimony, nor any other evidence we have located in the record, is sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude Officer Gulley \u201ccaused\u201d Officer White to issue the January 10, 2002 ticket. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus., </em>475 U.S. at 587. Because this was the only ticket issued after the September 28, 2001 opinion, the Wiggins, under their own legal theory, have failed to produce evidence which creates a genuine issue of fact under the threshold inquiry of <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we must affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-10\">. This case was originally filed in Illinois state court. Officer Gulley then removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">. Although it is not entirely clear from the record, the parties appear to agree that Judge Brocton Lockwood presided over the disposition of all of the tickets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">. Officer Gulley did not have any supervisory responsibilities over then-Probationary Officer White on January 10, 2002. <em>See </em>Gulley Dep. at 92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. The district court considered the Saline County Circuit Court's determination that \u00a7 12-503 violated equal protection irrelevant. It reasoned that the Wiggins could not use \u201cthe doctrine of collateral estoppel offensively against Gulley\" because he did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the criminal proceedings. R.41 at 8 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">. The district court noted that the Saline County Circuit Court\u2019s decision on \u00a7 12-503\u2019s constitutionality was also irrelevant to this inquiry because \"[t]rial courts do not make 'clearly established law.\u2019 \u201d R.41 at 10 (citing <em>Anderson v. Romero, </em>72 F.3d 518, 525 (7th Cir.1995)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b871-6\">. \" 'We may affirm a summary judgment on any ground that finds support in the record' where the ground has been 'adequately presented in the trial court so that the non-moving party had an opportunity to submit affidavits or other evidence and contest the issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawshe v. Simpson, </em>16 F.3d 1475, 1483 (7th Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>Box v. A &amp; P Tea Co., </em>772 F.2d 1372, 1376 (7th Cir. 1985)). In this case, Officer Gulley argued in his summary judgment motion that summary judgment was appropriate because \"[o]nly a single ticket, not written by Defendant, was issued after the September 28, 2001 finding of unconstitutionality.\u201d R.32 at 3 H 9(b). The Wiggins responded to this argument in their memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, citing various portions of the record. R.34 at 4-6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
