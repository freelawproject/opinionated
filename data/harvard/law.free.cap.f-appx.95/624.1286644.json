He argues that the district court plainly erred by characterizing his state felony conviction for simple possession of cocaine as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), when that same offense was punishable only as a misdemeanor under federal law. This issue, however, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1997), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>and, therefore, Osorio has not demonstrated plain eiTor.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Osorio also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) constitute an unconstitutional sentencing provision. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Osorio concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v.
