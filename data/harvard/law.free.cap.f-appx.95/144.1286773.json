When the plant shut down, both Parson and Huckaby were on approved medical leave. Both eventually applied for, and were denied, disability retirement benefits under the company\u2019s pension plan, prompting them to sue Union Underwear and its pension plan under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>(ERISA) to compel the payment of these benefits. The district court dismissed without prejudice Parson\u2019s claim, citing failure to exhaust available administrative remedies, and affirmed the pension plan committee\u2019s denial of benefits to Huekaby. Parson and Huekaby appeal these decisions. We reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Parson\u2019s claim and affirm the decision upholding the denial of Huckaby\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">A. Parson</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Parson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his cause of action based on his failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We review the district court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. <em>Stevens v. Employer-Teamsters Joint Council No. 84 Pension Fund, </em>979 F.2d 444, 459 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Union Underwear\u2019s pension policy specifies that \u201c[a]ny claim for benefits which are not received shall be made in writing to the Committee.\u201d Parson concedes that although he submitted several requests for disability retirement benefits to company employees, he never submitted claims to the pension plan committee. The parties stipulated, however, that Parson \u201cmade requests for disability retirement benefits under the Union Underwear Pension Plan\u201d and that his \u201crequests were denied, and those denials were reviewed and confirmed.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 5 (noting stipulations).) These stipulations of fact bind the parties as well as courts. <em>H. Hackfeld &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>197 U.S. 442, 447, 25 S.Ct. 456, 49 L.Ed. 826 (1905); <em>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>942 F.2d 1032, 1038 (6th Cir.1991) (\u201cStipulations voluntarily entered by the parties are binding, both on the district court and on [the appellate court].\u201d). Furthermore, by agreeing to these stipulations, Union Underwear both waived the exhaustion requirement and signaled the futility of requiring Parson to resubmit his claim for benefits. <em>See Stevens, </em>979 F.2d at 459 (\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion is not absolute in cases involving challenges to pensions. Courts have held that despite the usual applicability of the exhaustion requirement, there are occasions when a court is obliged to exercise its discretion!,] the most familiar example!] perhaps being when resort to the administrative route is futile.\u201d (citation and internal punctuation omitted)). Thus, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Parson\u2019s claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">B. Huekaby</p>\n<p id=\"Auj\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Huekaby argues that the district court erred in applying the arbitrary and capricious standard of review to the pension plan committee\u2019s decision denying him disability retirement benefits. This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s determination of the proper standard of review. <em>Yeager v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>88 F.3d 376, 380 (6th Cir.1996). A district court reviews de novo an ERISA plan administrator\u2019s decision regarding benefits, \u201cunless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). If the administrator has such discretionary authority, the court applies the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The parties agree that Union Underwear\u2019s plan gives the administrative committee this discretionary authority. Huekaby contends, however, that because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>committee delayed in responding to his claim, the district court should have applied the de novo standard. We find it unnecessary to decide this issue because under either standard, Huckaby does not satisfy the plan\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">2. Huckaby Does Not Meet the Plan\u2019s Criteria</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s decision affirming the pension plan committee\u2019s denial of Huckaby\u2019s claim. <em>Yeager, </em>88 F.3d at 381. Defendants concede that Huckaby (as well as Parson, whose claim is, on the merits, essentially the same as Huckaby\u2019s) satisfies two of the plan\u2019s four criteria for disability retirement benefits-age and length of service-but argue that Huckaby does not satisfy either of the remaining two criteria: (1) severance of service because of a disability as defined by Union Underwear\u2019s plan, and (2) determination of eligibility for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration while on approved medical leave or while receiving long-term disability benefits under a company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">To be eligible for disability retirement benefits, an employee\u2019s \u201clast Severance from Service [must] occur by reason of Disability.\u201d Under the plan\u2019s definitions, an employee is \u201cdisabled\u201d when \u201cthe Committee finds, on the basis of the opinion of a physician selected by the Committee\u201d that the employee \u201chas become so disabled by reason of a bodily injury or disease (whether occupational or nonoccupational) as to prevent him from engaging in any occupation or employment for renumeration or profit\u201d and \u201csuch disability will be permanent and continuous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Huckaby argues that he satisfies the \u201cseverance from service by reason of disability\u201d criterion because the Social Security Administration (SSA) found that he was disabled. The SSA did find that Huckaby was entitled to receive disability benefits and that he became disabled before the Campbellsville plant closed. That Huckaby was disabled under the SSA\u2019s rules, however, does not necessarily mean that he was disabled under the rules of Union Underwear\u2019s private pension plan. <em>See Hurse v. Hartford Life and Accident Ins. Co., </em>77 Fed.Appx. 310, 316 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Union Underwear distributed to its employees materials clearly stating that entitlement to SSA disability is only one of the requirements for disability retirement benefits under the company\u2019s plan. The brochure entitled, \u201cYour Pension Plan: 21 Important Points About Your Future,\u201d tells employees that to be eligible for disability retirement benefits, \u201cyou must meet the plan\u2019s definition of disabled\u201d and \u201c[i]n addition you must receive a social security disability award.\u201d At the time the plant closed, the pension plan committee had not found Huckaby to be disabled; thus, he did not meet the plan\u2019s definition of disabled and was not severed from service because of a disability. Because Huckaby does not satisfy this requirement, we need not consider the final requirement, whether the SSA determined that Huckaby was eligible for disability benefits while he was on approved medical leave or was receiving long-term disability benefits under a company plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Parson\u2019s claim and, because Parson\u2019s claim suffers from the same defects as Huckaby\u2019s, we remand for entry of judgment in favor of defendants. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment upholding the pension plan\u2019s decision to deny Huckaby disability retirement benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
