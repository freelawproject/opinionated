We deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817; <em>see also Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995). Credibility determinations are judged by the same basic standard. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002); <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000); <em>de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). In that area, however, we have added that the determination \u201c \u2018must be supported by a specific, cogent reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>de Leon-Barrios, </em>116 F.3d at 393 (citation omitted); <em>see also Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Here, A1 Badwan\u2019s claims fail because the IJ\u2019s decision was the final agency determination, and the IJ found that A1 Bad-wan was not credible. We are unable to say that the IJ\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. On the contrary, the record shows that A1 Badwan\u2019s testimony regarding the very core of his asylum claim (for example, the effect of alleged threats on his activities during the many years thereafter) was riddled with holes and inconsistencies. Moreover, even the somewhat more collateral circumstances, which might not be enough in themselves to show a lack of credibility, had sufficient inconsistencies that his overall story was entirely deprived of verisimilitude. Certainly, we cannot say that \u201cno reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d him credible. <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 484, 112 S.Ct. at 817. Thus, we must uphold the determination to deny Al Badwan relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Petition DENIED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b285-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-16\">.
