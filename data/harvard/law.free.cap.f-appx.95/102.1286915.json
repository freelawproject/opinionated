She asserts that the district court erred in determining that her base offense level was 20 on account of a prior state felony conviction for residential arson. She also asserts that the district court erred in failing to grant her a downward departure from the United States Sentencing Guidelines sentencing range because she purchased a firearm in order to protect herself from threatened harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-23\">Inasmuch as McElrath-Bey concedes that her prior state felony conviction was for arson, an enumerated crime of violence under the relevant sentencing guideline, the district court did not err in determining that the base offense level was 20. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) and \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) and comment. (n.l). The district court determined that the facts of the case did not warrant a downward departure, and therefore this court does not have jurisdiction to review the refusal to depart. <em>United States v.
