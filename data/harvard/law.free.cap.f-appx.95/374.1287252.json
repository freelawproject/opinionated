We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of appellate issues, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">Although under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 309(a); 110 Stat. 3009-625, circuit courts may not exercise \u201cjurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony,\u201d <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we retain jurisdiction to review claims raised in habeas petitions seeking review of orders of removal, <em>Calcano-Martinez v. INS, </em>533 U.S. 348, 351, 121 S.Ct. 2268, 150 L.Ed.2d 392 (2001). Reviewing Brito-Batista\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition <em>de novo, see Rankine v. Reno, </em>319 F.3d 93, 98 (2d Cir.2003), we agree that he was subject to removal as an aggravated felon and ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">Section 240(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), provides that the Attorney General may cancel removal for an alien who is inadmissible or deportable if the alien has (1) been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than five years; (2) has resided in the United States continuously for seven years after having been admitted in any status; and (3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony. On appeal, Brito-Batista contends that his 1997 conviction, following a plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>for possession of cocaine was not an aggravated felony, and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>was eligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to \u00a7 240(a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In August 1997, Brito-Batista was convicted in a Rhode Island state court, following a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea, of criminal possession of cocaine with intent to manufacture or deliver. <em>See </em>R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 21-28-4.01(A)(2)(a). Under the INA, \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d is defined by \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) to include \u201ca drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d Title 18, \u00a7 924(c)(2), in turn, defines a drug trafficking crime as any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>Because the criminal possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute is a punishable felony under the CSA, and Brito-Batista was convicted under Rhode Island\u2019s criminal statute of possession of cocaine with intent to manufacture or deliver, the offense constituted an aggravated felony for purposes of the INA. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43); <em>see also Sol v. INS, </em>274 F.3d 648, 651 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[C]ocaine possession is a controlled substance offense within the scope of the [INA].\u201d). Accordingly, Brito-Batista\u2019s conviction rendered him subject to removal and ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to \u00a7 240(a). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) (reserving cancellation of removal to resident aliens \u201cwho ha[ve] not been convicted of any aggravated felony\u201d); <em>St. Cyr v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 406, 412 (2d Cir.2000), <em>affd, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (\u201c[Petitioner] was ineligible to apply for \u2018cancellation from removal\u2019 by its terms because he was convicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">To the extent that Brito-Batista argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), because this provision was in effect at the time of his underlying plea and conviction, such a contention is unavailing. Brito-Batista is statutorily ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because his 1997 conviction, following a plea of <em>nolo confedere, </em>was entered after the April 1, 1997 effective date of IIRIRA. <em>See Mohammed v. Reno, </em>309 F.3d 95, 102-03 (2d Cir.2002) (concluding that \u00a7 212(c) relief was not available to petitioner who entered a guilty plea after the applicable statute\u2019s effective date). Thus, Brito-Batista\u2019s conviction for an aggravated felony forecloses all statutory avenues for removal relief, and the district court properly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
