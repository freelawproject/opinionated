Ambrose moves the court to \u201creconsider\u201d his untimely petition for review and \u201crequest[s] a court-appointed legal representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-16\">On September 26, 2003, the Merit Systems Protection Board issued a final decision in Ambrose\u2019s case, specifying that its decision was final and that any petition for review must be filed with this court within 60 days of receipt of the Board\u2019s decision. Ambrose states that he did not receive a copy of the decision until October 24, 2003, because he was out of town and his representative failed to contact him upon receiving notice of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-17\">The court received Ambrose\u2019s petition for review on December 30, 2003, more than 60 days after either Ambrose\u2019s or his representative\u2019s receipt of the Board\u2019s decision. On January 6, 2004, the court returned Ambrose\u2019s petition for review because it was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-19\">Our review of a Board decision is governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1), which provides that \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, any petition for review must be filed within 60 days after the date the petitioner received notice of the final order or decision of the Board.\u201d This filing period is \u201cstatutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Monzo v. Dept. of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed.Cir. 1984). Thus, under the time provision of the statute, Ambrose\u2019s petition for review was due in this court within 60 days of his representative\u2019s receipt of the Board\u2019s final decision. <em>See Gragg v. United States, </em>717 F.2d 1343 (Fed.Cir.1983) (service upon a representative \u201cis legally equivalent to service upon the litigant himself\u2019). Even if the time for filing were deemed to run from the date Ambrose states he received notice of the Board\u2019s decision, i.e., October 24, 2003, his petition was filed more than 60 days after receipt of the decision. Thus, this court must dismiss Ambrose\u2019s petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-20\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-21\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-22\">(1) Ambrose\u2019s petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-23\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-24\">(3) Ambrose\u2019s request for legal representation is moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
