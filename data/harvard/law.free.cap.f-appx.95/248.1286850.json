Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, our review focuses on the merits of IJ\u2019s decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7)(iii). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We reverse the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because the inconsistencies perceived by the IJ were minor and did not to the heart of petitioner\u2019s application. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that minor discrepancies, inconsistencies, or omissions that do not go to heart of applicant\u2019s claim do not constitute substantial evidence to support adverse credibility finding). Nevertheless, we find that petitioner, a deserter from the Russian Army, has not demonstrated that his claim for political asylum rises to the level of persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Accordingly, the petition for asylum and withholding of removal is DENIED.
