Johnson argues that the district court erred in denying him the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. He argues that he admitted that he possessed the heroin and that the truthfulness of his statement concerning the reason for his trip to Brieger\u2019s house is irrelevant. He also argues that the evidence in the record was insufficient to show that he possessed the heroin discovered in the back seat of the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The record of Johnson\u2019s interview with the probation officer shows that Johnson, despite the fact that he pleaded guilty, was attempting to distance himself from responsibility for his conduct comprising the offense. Johnson did not admit that he went to Brieger\u2019s house for the purpose of delivering heroin in response to Brieger\u2019s call. Johnson did not admit that he possessed the heroin; he stated that the truck was Brieger\u2019s and that he knew heroin was in the truck. Johnson\u2019s statements were a sufficient foundation for the district court to conclude that he had not truthfully admitted the conduct comprising the offense of conviction and thus had not clearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and comment, (n.l(a)); <em>United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 121 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">Johnson also argues that the district court\u2019s reliance on the fact that he received an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 for reckless endangerment during flight was erroneous because the guidelines limit the denial of acceptance of responsibility based solely on conduct arising under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. He argues that because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 specifically mentions U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, it excludes U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">Reckless endangerment during flight is included in the general guidelines section on obstruction, and a district court would be within its discretion to determine that a defendant who engages in conduct warranting an upward adjustment for reckless endangerment during flight has not clearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility, especially when he later denies the conduct warranting the obstruction adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
