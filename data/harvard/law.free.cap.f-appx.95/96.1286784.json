Santiago asserts that the appellees conspired to retaliate against him because he complained about Parole Officer Arnita Martin. Santiago contends that the appellees ensured that his parole was revoked, and he argues that the revocation process violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the Court held that to recover damages for unconstitutional imprisonment, a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that his conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by an authorized state tribunal, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Heck </em>applies to parole revocation proceedings and to Santiago\u2019s request for injunctive relief. <em>See Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 190-91 (5th Cir.1998) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>Jackson v. Vannoy, </em>49 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Santiago has not challenged the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his complaint. Santiago thus has abandoned the only issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d, 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Santiago\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, is frivolous and is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Santiago\u2019s complaint counts as a strike under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Santiago is WARNED that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED, SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b128-42\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
