Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s decision be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2002). This court generally reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influences or affects the BIA. <em>Id.; Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 816 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">Ibrahim asserted in his application and in hearing testimony that, at the age of 13, he fled Somalia for Kenya during the 1991 civil war, after rebels from the Hawiye clan murdered most of his family and his uncle\u2019s family. Ibrahim maintained that, in Kenya, his father\u2019s best friend, who had also lost his family in the civil war, took care of him in Kenya from 1991 to 2000, when Ibrahim entered the United States. The BIA affirmed the denial of Ibrahim\u2019s asylum application, concluding that he did \u201cnot merit a favorable exercise of discretion for a grant of asylum\u201d because of his \u201cunforced, unexplained departure from Kenya,\u201d where he had lived \u201cfree from harm for almost 9 years.\u201d Given the circumstances of the case, Ibrahim has failed to demonstrate that the BIA\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence or that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the application for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1); <em>INS v. Cardo</em>za-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 427, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Ibrahim has cited no regulatory or decisional authority that prohibited the BIA from considering Ibrahim\u2019s having lived safely in a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>country for almost a decade as a discretionary basis upon which to deny an application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The BIA also did not err in concluding that Ibrahim had not established a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d sufficient to warrant withholding of removal. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 667 (5th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). The BIA concluded that Ibrahim had not satisfied his burden of proof because he had failed to corroborate his identity with documentary proof of any kind and had failed to explain this shortcoming satisfactorily. Although an applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain his burden of proof without corroboration, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b), this court gives great deference to the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determinations of an alien\u2019s credibility. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). The BIA\u2019s finding regarding credibility was based on a \u201creasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). For the same reasons, Ibrahim has not demonstrated that he was entitled to relief under the CAT, as he failed to establish that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon a return to Somalia. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
