Ward contends that the district court erred in dismissing his case because Agnew deprived him of his Sixth Amendment rights. This court reviews the district court\u2019s dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">The district court concluded that Ward\u2019s lawsuit was foreclosed by <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981), because Agnew was not acting under the color of state law for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 liability. The district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Dodson </em>was appropriate; and it is uncontested by Ward on appeal. Since the allegations in Ward\u2019s complaint were squarely foreclosed by <em>Dodson, </em>the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing his lawsuit as frivolous. <em>See Siglar, </em>112 F.3d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-20\">Because Ward has not shown that there is a nonfrivolous appellate issue, his appeal is also dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Brinkmann v. Johnston, </em>793 F.2d 111, 112-13 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-21\">The dismissal of the appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ward\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous both count as \u201cstrikes\u201d under the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Therefore, Ward is warned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b121-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
