Generally, questions of contract construction, including the issue of whether a contract is ambiguous, are questions of law for the court and are reviewed de novo. <em>See Clardy Mfg. Co. v. Marine Midland, Business Loans Inc., </em>88 F.3d 347, 352 (5th Cir.1996); <em>FDIC v. McFarland, </em>33 F.3d 532, 539 (5th Cir.1994); <em>American Totalisator Co. v. Fair Grounds Corp., </em>3 F.3d 810, 813 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">2. We hold as a matter of law that the critical language of the rider, excluding coverage for injury to \u201cthe cervicothoracic regions of the spine,\u201d unambiguously excludes coverage for appellee Burford\u2019s injury. Burford\u2019s accident indisputably resulted in a broken spine and a severed spinal cord between two thoracic vertebra. While the term \u201ccervicothoracic\u201d is not a common one, the medical and general dictionaries in the record consistently define the term as relating to the neck and thorax. By this universally recognized definition the injury occurred in the thoracic area of the spine and therefore occurred in the \u201ccervicothoracic regions\u201d of the spine. One reputable medical dictionary offered a second, alternative definition of cervicothoracic as relating to the transition between the neck and thorax, and Burford offered expert testimony that this definition is the only one used in the medical community. Under this definition Burford\u2019s injury did not occur at the transitional region. However, this alternative definition necessarily refers to a single transitional area and the rider refers to \u201cregions\u201d in the plural. This alternative definition is simply inconsistent with the plain wording of the rider. The expert\u2019s testimony that the use of \u201cregions\u201d was a \u201cmisnomer\u201d and was \u201cnot proper English\u201d was an improper attempt to rewrite the key language of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">3. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and we hereby render a take nothing judgment in favor of appellant Great-West.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">REVERSED and RENDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
