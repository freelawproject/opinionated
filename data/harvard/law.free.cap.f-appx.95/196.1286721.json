The plea agreement contained the following appeal waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-19\">The defendant has been fully apprised of his right to appeal by his attorney and fully understands that he has a right to appeal his sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742. In the event the District Court accepts the plea agreement, the defendant understands that as part of this agreement, both the defendant and the government hereby mutually agree to waive all rights to appeal whatever sentence is imposed, including any issues that relate to the establishment of the Guidelines range, reserving only the right to appeal from an upward or downward departure from the Guidelines range that is established at sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-22\">The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> drew Morris\u2019s attention to the appeal waiver at his change-of-plea and sentencing hearings. Morris was sentenced to 138 months in prison and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-23\">Morris appeals, raising an issue \u2014 the calculation of his criminal history score\u2014 that relates to the establishment of his Guidelines range. Because we conclude that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence, and that his appeal falls within the scope of the appeal waiver, we grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-90 (8th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 501, 157 L.Ed.2d 398 (2003).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-20\">.
