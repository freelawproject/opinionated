Rikhy filed a complaint against AMC Computer Corp., his former employer, and various of its employees, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. He alleged discrimination based on his race, national origin, ethnicity, religion and/or age, as well as retaliation, and claimed violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>the New York Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 290 <em>et seq., </em>and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-101 <em>et seq. </em>Among other things, Rikhy asserted (1) that he had been treated less favorably\u2014 in terms of salary and working conditions \u2014 than similarly situated employees who were not members of a protected class, and (2) that he was ultimately fired for discriminatory reasons and out of retaliation for his complaints of discrimination. The district court (Pauley, <em>J.) </em>granted AMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding no genuine disputes of material fact with regard to Rikhy\u2019s job performance and to the legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for his termination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (setting forth a three-part test for discrimination claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Burt Rigid Box, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Corp., </em>302 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder would be \u201ccompelled to accept the view of the moving party.\u201d <em>This is Me, Inc. v. Taylor, </em>157 F.3d 139,142 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is the situation before us: Looking at the record, including the plaintiffs assertions and the defendants\u2019 explanations, we conclude that no jury could reasonably find that Rikhy\u2019s working conditions or his dismissal were based on discrimination or any attendant retaliation. <em>See Fisher v. Vassar College, </em>114 F.3d 1332, 1336 (2d Cir.1997) (en banc) (stating that, after the defendant proffers a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the action, \u201c[t]he question becomes the same question asked in any other civil case: Has the plaintiff shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant is liable for the alleged conduct?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and find them meritless. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
