We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-24\">The IJ did not abuse her discretion by denying Salazar-Malagon\u2019s request for an indefinite continuance pending the adjudication of his mother\u2019s motion to reopen because several continuances had already been granted. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (permitting IJ to \u201cgrant a motion for continuance for good cause shown\u201d); <em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that denial of request for continuance based on unpredictable events was not an abuse of discretion after multiple continuances had already been granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Salazar-Malagon\u2019s request for voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f); <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that section 1229c(f) divests the court of jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s voluntary departure determinations). Further, we lack jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s interpretation of INA \u00a7 240B(a) because he did not raise it on appeal to the BIA. <em>See Cortez-Acosta v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number><em>INS, </em>234 F.3d 476, 480 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cFailure to raise an issue in an appeal to the BIA constitutes a failure to exhaust all administrative remedies available ... and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Our decision in <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001), forecloses Salazar-Malagon\u2019s contention that the jurisdictional bar violates the due process and separation of powers clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Salazar-Malagon\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedure violates due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 852 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b932-26\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-19\">. We grant the motion of the American Immigration Law Foundation for leave to file an amicus curiae brief in support of petitioner.
