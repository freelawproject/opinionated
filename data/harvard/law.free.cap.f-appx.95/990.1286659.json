The appellant, Joseph Ca\u00f1\u00f3les, was denied an enhanced retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336(c) on the grounds that he was not transferred from a primary firefighting position into a secondary firefighting position. Because we agree that Ca\u00f1\u00f3les was not transferred from a primary to a secondary firefighting position and because any primary firefighting duties he undertook were the result of training for his secondary firefighting position, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">The facts of this case are uncontroverted. Ca\u00f1\u00f3les enlisted in the Air Force on September 12, 1962 and was assigned as a firefighter on the K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base at that time. After being discharged from the Air Force, he joined the Marquette, Michigan Fire Department and remained there for 11 months before accepting a civil service position as a Supervisory Firefighter at the K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base on August 1, 1967. During his first six to eight months as Supervisory Firefighter, Ca\u00f1\u00f3les underwent a firefighting training period. On April 1, 1973, Ca\u00f1\u00f3les accepted a civil service position as a Fire Chief on the Pease Air Force Base. He resigned from that position on August 24, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Prior to Canoles\u2019s resignation, the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) determined that he was not eligible for service credit as a firefighter under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336(c). Ca\u00f1\u00f3les requested reconsideration of that decision. On July 2, 1992, the OPM again denied Ca\u00f1\u00f3les firefighter credit. Ca\u00f1\u00f3les appealed that determination to the MSPB. After the MSPB first erroneously concluded that Ca\u00f1\u00f3les had untimely filed for the enhanced firefighter retirement annuity, the case was remanded by this court for a decision on the merits. In June of 2003, the MSPB decided the case on the merits. In its opinion, the MSPB found that no qualifying transfer from a primary to a secondary firefighting position occurred during Canoles\u2019s tenure as Supervisory Firefighter. The MSPB therefore denied Ca\u00f1\u00f3les the enhanced firefighter retirement annuity on this basis. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) and must affirm a final decision of the MSPB unless it is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-13\">(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-14\">(2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">(3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">Section 8336(c)(1) of Title 5 grants enhanced retirement annuities to those serving as \u201cfirefighter[s]\u201d that are \u201cseparated from the service after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service.\u201d In this context, a firefighter is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-18\">an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily to perform work directly connected to the control and ex-tinguishment of fires or the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(21). Further, the relevant regulations define the types of transfers from primary firefighting positions to administrative or supervisory firefighting positions that qualify for the enhanced retirement annuity. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 831.902, 831.904(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Ca\u00f1\u00f3les concedes that he neither retired from a primary firefighting position nor was hired into a primary position when he was hired by the Department of the Air Force in 1967. Rather, he argues on appeal (as he argued before the MSPB) that he qualifies for an enhanced annuity based on the primary firefighting duties he performed during his initial training for his civil service position as a Supervisory Firefighter. Specifically, he maintains that \u201cthe nature of his [training] duties during the first six to eight months of his civil service employment allows him to meet the transfer requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(21) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.904.\u201d Final Decision at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The MSPB rejected Canoles\u2019s argument on a variety of grounds. First, it noted that there is no precedent that permits the bifurcation of service performed in the context of one position between \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d service. <em>Canoles v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>AT0831000446-M-3 at 6 (\u201cFinal Decision\u201d). Rather, the MSPB noted, recent service credit cases adopt more of a \u201cposition-oriented\u201d approach. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Watson v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>86 M.S.P.R. 318 (2000), <em>ajf\u2019d, </em>262 F.3d 1292 (2001)). Further, the Administrative Judge noted that this court has stated that a \u201ctransfer\u201d from one position to another in the federal service \u201cdoes not cover mere temporary detail to other jobs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Morgan v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>773 F.2d 282 (Fed.Cir.1985)). Using the precedent set in <em>Morgan </em>as well as the fact that Ca\u00f1\u00f3les continued in a secondary firefighter position while completing his training, the MSPB found that there was no transfer from a primary to a secondary firefighting position after Canoles\u2019s initial training period. <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Our examination of the case law and the relevant statutes leads us to conclude, as did the Administrative Judge, that Canoles\u2019s period of training for his supervisory position does not qualify him for an enhanced retirement annuity. What is clear from our review of the relevant law is that in order to qualify for an enhanced retirement annuity, one must either retire in a primary firefighter position or retire from a secondary firefighter position after having been transferred (i.e. promoted) from a primary position. The temporary performance of primary firefighting duties by one serving in a supervisory position does not create eligibility for an enhanced firefighter\u2019s retirement annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">The relevant case law supports this conclusion. No precedent permits the bifurcation of service in one position between primary and secondary firefighting service. As the MSPB rightly recognized, the recent trajectory of our case law emphasizes more the rationale behind the creation of a certain position over actual incidental duties performed. <em>See Watson v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>262 F.3d 1292 (Fed.Cir.2001) (placing emphasis on the reason for a position\u2019s existence in analyzing early retirement coverage questions for law enforcement officers). As the MSPB has held, for an employee to qualify for firefighter service credit, the \u201cprimary duties of his position must be directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires.\u201d <em>Dodd v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>94 M.S.P.R. 174 (2003). It is not enough that \u201che performed some fire control duties, among his other position duties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>Furthermore, this case law is amply supported by the language of the relevant statute, which speaks of firefighters qualifying for the enhanced retirement annuity as being employees \u201cwhose <em>position^] </em>are <em>primarily </em>to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(21) (emphases added). Thus, the statute speaks in direct reference to whether or not the <em>position </em>involves a primary duty directly to perform firefighting work \u2014 not whether the work actually done at a discrete period in time was primary firefighting work. The civil service Supervisory Firefighter position to which Ca\u00f1\u00f3les was hired was defined by the OPM to be a secondary position whose main duties were supervisory. Therefore, Ca\u00f1\u00f3les did not meet the statutory definition of \u201cfirefighter\u201d at any point from the time he re-entered the Air Force in August 1967 to the time he resigned from the Air Force in August 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">In addition, this court cannot disregard the importance of the transfer requirement in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(21). The transfer requirement, as imposed by Congress, works to prevent the judicial bifurcation of service that Ca\u00f1\u00f3les seeks. The text of the statute is clear \u2014 one can qualify for an enhanced retirement annuity either by being in a position where one\u2019s work is \u201cdirectly connected to the control and extinguishment of fires\u201d or by <em>transferring </em>from such a position to a supervisory position. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(21). A temporary detail involving other duties is not a transfer. <em>Cf. Morgan, </em>773 F.2d at 285. Likewise, training for a supervisory position is not a transfer. And, as the MSPB noted, Canoles\u2019s \u201cfailure to perform supervisory duties during the first six to eight months of his tenure did not operate as a \u2018transfer\u2019 to a supervisory position.\u201d Final Decision at 7. Congress created only two paths to the enhanced firefighter retirement annuity \u2014 serving in a position directly connected to firefighting or transferring from such a position to a supervisory firefighting position. It did not say, although it was perfectly free to do so, that any person who undertook firefighting responsibilities would receive the annuity regardless of position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Finally, Canoles\u2019s cited cases are all distinguishable from this case. The case most favorable to Canoles, <em>Ellis v. United States, </em>222 Ct.Cl. 65, 610 F.2d 760 (1979), differs in that the firefighter in that case spent his entire career fighting fires, he lived on the base in question fighting fires and fought more fires than anyone else during his tenure at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center Fire Department. <em>Id. </em>at 764. Thus, there was no question of bifurcation in <em>Ellis. </em>Rather, the court in that ease found that despite his title, Ellis was in fact serving full-time in a primary firefighting position. <em>Ellis </em>was, in essence, a misclassification case instead of a bifurcation case. Canoles\u2019s other cited case, <em>Perske v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>25 F.3d 1014 (Fed.Cir.1994), is inapposite. <em>Perske </em>involved a firefighter who, unlike Ca\u00f1\u00f3les, entered service in a primary firefighter position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">The statutory text, the relevant case law and the facts all support the MSPB\u2019s decision to deny Ca\u00f1\u00f3les an enhanced retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(c). The MSPB\u2019s decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
