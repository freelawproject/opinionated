McAlister\u2019s only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>contention is that the government breached its plea agreement by acting in bad faith and refusing to recommend a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Because McAllister validly waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">There is no support for McAllister\u2019s contention that the government was under any legal obligation to move for a downward departure in good faith or otherwise. <em>Cf. United States v. Khoury, </em>62 F.3d 1138, 1142 (9th Cir.1995) (noting that whether the government acted in bad faith was irrelevant to whether the court could compel the government to move for a downward departure; rather, the court could only do so if the government refused to file such a motion on an unconstitutional or arbitrary basis). The plea agreement leaves it to the government to decide, in its sole discretion, whether to recommend a downward departure for substantial assistance. Thus, any such failure by the government to move for such a departure could not be considered a breach of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Schuman, </em>127 F.3d 815, 817-18 (9th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (finding no breach where plea agreement did not obligate government to file substantial assistance motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">In the absence of a breach by the government, or the district court\u2019s rejection of a provision within the plea agreement, the appellate waiver must be enforced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b904-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-9\">. Appellant\u2019s March 15, 2004 Motion to Proceed Under Seal is granted. The Clerk shall seal all court documents and records in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
