Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817; <em>see also Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995). Credibility determinations are judged by the same basic standard. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002); <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000); <em>de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). In that area, however, we have added that the determination \u201c \u2018must be supported by a specific, cogent reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>de Leon-Barr</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>ios, 116 F.3d at 393 (citation omitted); <em>see also Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Here, the IJ based her determination that Kaur was not credible on the IJ\u2019s own speculation about what would have motivated the police officer who sexually attacked Kaur and demanded that she marry him. More particularly, the IJ\u2019s speculation led her to decide that Kaur was not credible because Kaur thought that the officer wanted to marry her in order to ultimately dishonor her, whereas the IJ thought that the officer could have more easily gone ahead and brought his sexual assault to fruition, if dishonor of Kaur was his motive. But speculation is no substitute for evidence. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1017, 1024-25 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1227; <em>Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 912 (9th Cir.1996). Thus, the IJ\u2019s finding was not based upon a cogent reason. As a result, we must grant the petition, set aside the finding of lack of credibility, and remand for a determination of Kaur\u2019s asylum and withholding claims. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355-56, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002); <em>Arulampalam v.
