Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817; <em>see also Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995). Where an asylum claim is involved, an alien must show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution that is \u201cboth subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir. 1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">While the BIA had found that Ali had been subjected to past persecution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it then also found that, due to changed country conditions, he did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. We are unable to say that the evidence compels a different conclusion. The relevant portions of the Country Report from the United States Department of State could properly be interpreted to show that the political conditions, as they related to Ali\u2019s particular political problem, had markedly changed in his favor so that Ali would no longer be in danger. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998-99 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Marcu v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1078, 1081-82 (9th Cir.1998); <em>see also INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355-56, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).

Aparajeeta Ali and Fahim Tanzim Ali did not submit separate individual asylum applications, but were included in Mohammed Ali's application. Because Mohammed Iskander Ali is the lead petitioner, all references to Ali are to him. Moreover, what we hold as to him applies to them as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-14\">. The BIA so decided when the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision was appealed to it at an earlier time. The IJ later expressed doubt about that determination and took evidence on the issue, in case the BIA wanted to change its mind, but did accept the BIA's determination. In any event, nothing in the procedural rules within the agency precluded the IJ from exploring the issues further. <em>See In re Patel, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 600, 601 (BIA 1978); <em>see also Johnson v. Ashcroft, </em>286 F.3d 696, 702-03 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b915-19\">.
