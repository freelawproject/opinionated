He appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his \u201cwrit of error\u201d as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. Goins does not challenge the propriety of the district court\u2019s denial. Rather, he argues the merits of his \u201cwrit of error,\u201d specifically, that the district court lacked jurisdiction due to a defective indictment. Because Goins has failed to address the basis of the district court\u2019s denial, he has waived the only appealable issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-23\">Goins\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Goins\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Goins is WARNED that the filing of future frivolous appeals may result in sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
