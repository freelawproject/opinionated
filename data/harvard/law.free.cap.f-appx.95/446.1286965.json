Carter pleaded not guilty but a jury convicted him on all three counts at the ensuing trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">In calculations, which neither party challenges on this appeal, the district court concluded that Carter\u2019s total offense level was 37 which, when combined with his criminal history category of IV, yielded a sentencing range of 292 to 365 months. The court sentenced Carter to a custodial term of 292 months to be followed by a ten-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-18\">Carter appeals, summarizing his argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-19\">Appellant challenges the amount of drugs attributed to him during the course of the conspiracy. This challenge is two fold. Appellant contends that in his diminished role as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d he should not be deemed as culpable as the others. Essentially that there should be a further departure for this diminished role pursuant to U.S.S.G. Section 5K2.0.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-20\">Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on Count two and Count three of the indictment. Appellant\u2019s presence during the planning of the robbery/murder plot and wiping of bullets was insufficient to establish his participation as a co-conspirator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Appellant\u2019s br. at 10. We note, however, that notwithstanding Carter\u2019s request for \u201ca further departure\u201d from the guideline range, the court never departed in the first place, though it did make calculations in establishing that range that were in part favorable to Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Our standards of review on this appeal are well settled. On the sufficiency of the evidence argument we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government as the verdict winner and will sustain the conviction if there was substantial evidence to support it so that the jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Pungitore, </em>910 F.2d 1084, 1129 (3d Cir.1990). With respect to the departure argument because, as Carter acknowledges, he did not raise the contention in the district court we review the claim on a plain error basis. <em>See United States v. Couch, </em>291 F.3d 251, 252-53 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We have reviewed this matter and have concluded that there is no merit to either of Carter\u2019s contentions. Indeed the evidence shows that Carter was at the heart of the conspiracy and thus <em>United States v. Pressler, </em>256 F.3d 144, 153 (3d Cir.2001), which he correctly cites for the proposition that tangential connections among various persons are not sufficient to establish the existence of a conspiracy, appellant\u2019s br. at 21, is not helpful to him. Finally, the court did not commit a plain error or any error at all in not departing downward. Moreover, as the government suggests, <em>see </em>appellee\u2019s br. at 34, \u201cthere is no basis for meaningful appellate review of a district court\u2019s failure to grant an unrequested departure,\u201d at least to the extent that the appellant\u2019s argument is based on factual contentions as determinations of fact can be reviewed only for clear error. <em>See United States v. Carr, 25 </em>F.3d 1194, 1207 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The judgment of conviction and sentence entered May 28, 2002, and the order denying Carter\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial entered July 29, 2002, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
