We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The Commissioner denied Buddemeier benefits in 1986 because her condition would not keep her from working for 12 consecutive months. In 1995, at Buddemeier\u2019s request, her case was reopened, but the Commissioner again denied benefits. An administrative law judge found in 1999 that the case was improperly reopened, and reinstated the 1986 denial as the final agency determination. When Buddemeier sought judicial review, the district court found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Upon de novo review, <em>see Boock v. Shalala, </em>48 F.3d 348, 351 &amp; n. 2 (8th Cir.1995), we conclude dismissal was proper because the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to reconsider a previously denied claim is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d and is unreviewable absent a constitutional violation, <em>see Robertson v. Sullivan, </em>979 F.2d 623, 625 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">. The Honorable John F.
