Estes\u2019s arguments concern the amount of methamphetamine contained in items seized at his home and at the home of Robert Melton. However, the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which was adopted by the district court, based Estes\u2019s sentence on evidence of Estes\u2019s production of 3.18 kilograms of methamphetamine during the prior seven months, rather than the amount of methamphetamine seized at the two residences. Because Estes has failed to brief the issue whether the use of the 3.18 kilograms in determining his sentence was accurate, the issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-23\">Furthermore, to the extent that Estes does argue that he was not responsible for the 3.18 kilograms of methamphetamine attributed to him, the district court did not clearly err in relying on information contained in the PSR because Estes did not meet his burden of proving that the information was \u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3; <em>United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>1 F.3d 341, 344 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
