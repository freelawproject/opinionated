The district court\u2019s determination that Gama-Antuniz has the future ability to pay the fine through prison earnings is not plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414-17 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">Also for the first time on appeal, Gama-Antuniz argues that his guilty plea is invalid because the district court failed to comply with the requirements of Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 in failing to explain the nature of the offense and determine that there was an adequate factual basis for his plea. Gama-Antuniz contends that the district court should have admonished him that his prior aggravated felony conviction would be used to enhance his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">The requirement of Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(G) to inform the defendant of the nature of the charge is fulfilled when the defendant is informed of the elements of the offense charged. <em>United States v. Lujano-Perez, </em>274 F.3d 219, 224 (5th Cir. 2001). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>sions, and not elements of the substantive crime set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Gama-Antuniz\u2019s indictment set forth the requisite elements of his violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). His indictment was read at his rearraignment and he affirmed that he understood the charge and that he had discussed the charge with his attorney. Also at Gama-Antuniz\u2019s rearraignment, the Government prosecutor recited the factual basis for Gama-Antuniz\u2019s plea, which included all of the elements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), and Gama-Antuniz admitted to the facts as true. There was no error. <em>See Lujano-Perez, </em>274 F.3d at 225-26; <em>United States v. Gobert, </em>139 F.3d 436, 439 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Gama-Antuniz argues further that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He argues further that because his indictment did not allege the fact of his prior aggravated felony conviction as a separate element of the offense, the indictment charged him only with an offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) rather than 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), and his maximum punishment is limited to two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Gama-Antuniz attempts to distinguish <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>factually on the ground that the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 487-88, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), limited its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to cases in which the defendant specifically pleaded guilty to the predicate felony used to enhance his sentence under \u00a7 1326. Gama-Antuniz contends that he has not pleaded guilty in this case to having committed an aggravated felony prior to his deportation. Alternatively, Gama-Antuniz asserts that, if we should decide that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>he wishes to preserve the issues for Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>which he maintains cast into doubt the continued validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>or limit its holding to cases in which the defendant admits having committed the predicate felony prior to pleading guilty. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 487-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>see also United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court therefore must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Accordingly, Gama-Antuniz\u2019s arguments based upon <em>Apprendi </em>are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Thus, Gama-Antuniz has not established error, plain or otherwise, with respect to his conviction or sentence under \u00a7 1326, and his conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
