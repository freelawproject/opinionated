This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of an inmate\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Richardson v. Spurlock, </em>260 F.3d 495, 499 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Santos admits that he \u201cdid nothing as far as a[n] appeal\u201d before he filed the instant complaint. Santos alleges that he could not exhaust his administrative remedies because he feared for his life. Santos, however, admitted that he informed the disciplinary committee of the allegations giving rise to this suit, refuting his claim of fear. Santos has not shown that the district court erred in its ruling. Thus, judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
