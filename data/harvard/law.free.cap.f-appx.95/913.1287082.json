R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">Plaintiffs appeal from the district court\u2019s order awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs in favor of defendant Michael B. Terry. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">The parties are familiar with the facts, and we will summarize them only briefly. On October 3, 2002, Terry moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court heard arguments on the attorney-fee issue. Finding that plaintiffs had acted in bad faith in their interactions with Terry, it entered an order awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Terry in the amount of $12,055.50, from which the plaintiffs filed an amended notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-18\">Although Terry had requested that the district court award fees and costs against both plaintiffs and their attorneys, S. Austin Johnson and Johnson Law Firm P.C. (hereafter referred to collectively as \u201cJohnson\u201d), the district court\u2019s order did not specify whether it was plaintiffs or Johnson who are responsible for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs. In any event, Johnson did not file an appeal in his own name from the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-19\">Nearly a year later, in December 2003, Terry filed a motion asking the district court to clarify that its order awarding fees and costs ran against Johnson as well as plaintiffs, and that Johnson was jointly and severally liable for the fees and costs. On January 14, 2004, the district court granted Terry\u2019s motion to clarify and amended its previous order to state that plaintiffs and Johnson are jointly and severally liable for the $12,055.50 awarded to Terry for fees and costs. Johnson did not appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-20\">1. Johnson\u2019s failure to appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b946-21\">Plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal from the order imposing attorney\u2019s fees and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>failed to name Johnson as a party. Johnson did not appeal from the district court\u2019s later order clarifying Johnson\u2019s responsibility for the fees and costs. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the attorney fee and cost awards against Johnson. <em>See Jane L. v. Bangerter, </em>61 F.3d 1505, 1513 n. 3 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">2. Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The district court awarded fees to Terry under its inherent power to sanction conduct that abuses the judicial process. While \u201cthe so-called \u2018American Rule\u2019 prohibits fee shifting in most cases ... a court may assess attorney\u2019s fees when a party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 45-46, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (quotation omitted). We review the district court\u2019s award of fees under this \u201cbad faith exception\u201d for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. McCall, </em>235 F.3d 1211, 1216 (10th Cir.2000). \u201cThe bad faith exception is drawn very narrowly and may be resorted to only in exceptional cases and for dominating reasons of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">The district court explained the reasons for its award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Terry as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-8\">Based on [their] representations [in the letter to Terry], plaintiffs obtained a default judgment against an unrepresented Mr. Terry. In effect, plaintiffs conspired with an unsuspecting Mr. Terry to obtain a judgment that, despite plaintiffs\u2019 suggestions, was completely personal and individual to Mr. Terry. At oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel ... stated that plaintiffs\u2019 intent was <em>to help </em>Mr. Terry. Plaintiffs\u2019 actions did not help Mr. Terry in any way but led him to incur legal bills in excess of ten thousand dollars. Plaintiffs\u2019 scheme and treatment of Mr. Terry can only be described as bad faith, oppressive, and beyond the boundaries of appropriate litigation practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">Aplt.App., No. 03-4041, at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Plaintiffs advance the following arguments in opposition to the district court\u2019s findings: (1) they did not mislead the court in their arguments concerning the default judgment; (2) the letter to Terry was written by an associate of the Johnson firm who was later fired for writing letters without Johnson\u2019s knowledge; (3) they did not conspire with Terry to obtain a judgment; (4) they never counseled Terry to default in the case, and in fact sought a default judgment against him only when he failed to respond to their attempts to communicate with him; and (5) their intention was to offer Terry a stipulated judgment that would protect him from any personal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Upon review, having considered these arguments and reviewed the record in light of the applicable standards, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Terry. We therefore affirm the order of the district court awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
