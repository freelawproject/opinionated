At trial, Ford\u2019s motion for judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 was denied after the Government presented its case. Ford\u2019s renewed motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of trial was also denied by the district court. The district court sentenced Ford to seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment, and Ford timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Ford\u2019s appellate counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief raising one issue: whether the Rule 29 motion was properly denied. Ford filed a supplemental pro se brief in which he alleges the following points of error: (1) the magistrate judge had no constitutional or statutory authority to issue Ford\u2019s arrest warrant; (2) the arrest warrant was defective; (3) the criminal complaint was defective; (4) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper because it bolstered the credibility of witnesses; (5) the in-eourt identification of Ford was flawed; and (6) the jury charge was defective. Ford has moved in this court for leave to file an amended pro se brief to add one more substantive claim of reversible error, namely, that the government did not have jurisdiction over his weapons possession offense. We grant the motion. The matter is now ripe for <em>Anders </em>review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We have reviewed the testimony adduced at trial and conclude the district court properly denied Ford\u2019s Rule 29 motions. When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, a reasonable jury could readily conclude that Ford committed both of the crimes charged in the indictment. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996). We further conclude from the record that the additional issues asserted by Ford in his pro se briefs are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">We have independently reviewed the entire record in this case in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Ford\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> <em>Anders v.
