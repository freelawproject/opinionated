Brown, </em>No. 00-7254, 2000 WL 1707272 (4th Cir. Nov. 15, 2000) (unpublished). In the alternative, Brown requests this court allow him to file a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). In his petition, Brown alleges that he is entitled to the relief sought because the district court and this court did not apply the standard announced in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003), in determining whether to grant a certificate of appealability on his claims. Our review of his petition leads us to conclude that Brown has failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances justifying recall of the mandate. <em>Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 549-50, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998). Accordingly, although we grant Brown\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his petition for writ of error. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
