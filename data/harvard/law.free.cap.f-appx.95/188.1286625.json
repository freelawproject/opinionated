In her August 1999 applications and related documents, Bry alleged disability, since January 1999 for DIB and May 1999 for SSI, from recurring incisional hernias, depression, and back problems. After a February 2001 hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Bry\u2019s back-related and mental impairments were not severe, and that her history of incisional hernia repairs was a severe impairment but not of listing-level severity. The ALJ further found that Bry had the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform her past relevant work as a fine-arts coordinator, salesperson, flower processor, administrative assistant, waitress, or cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Bry first argues that she met the listing-level requirements for former Listing 1.05C (other vertebrogenic disorders), and that certain of her other impairments also constituted listed impairments. We disagree. Treating physician Larisa Meleks\u2019s opinion that Bry met 1.05C\u2019s requirements is not persuasive, because we find no indication in her treatment notes of the requisite significant limitation of spinal motion, or of significant motor loss with muscle weakness and sensory and reflex loss. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 1.05C (2001); <em>cf. Holmstrom v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 715, 720 (8th Cir. 2001) (treating physician\u2019s opinion will be granted controlling weight if it is well supported by accepted diagnostic techniques and is consistent with other substantial evidence). Also, we find no listings under sections 1 (Musculoskeletal System) or 5 (Digestive System) \u2014 the sections Bry cites \u2014 that would apply to her other impairments. <em>See Dunahoo v. Apfel, </em>241 F.3d 1033, 1037 (8th Cir.2001) (determination as to whether claimant meets specific listing may be upheld if record supports it).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">We also reject Bry\u2019s contention that the ALJ erred by adopting the physical RFC findings of a Social Security Administration (SSA) reviewing physician. First, the ALJ properly discredited Bry\u2019s subjective complaints. <em>See Lowe v. Apfel, </em>226 F.3d 969, 972 (8th Cir.2000) (if adequately explained and supported, credibility findings are for ALJ to make). Second, the ALJ properly discounted Dr. Meleks\u2019s RFC findings by noting the inconsistencies between her findings and those of other physicians as well as the objective medical evidence, and also by noting the inconsistencies in Dr. Meleks\u2019s own findings as to Bry\u2019s ability to use her legs. <em>See Pearsall v. Massanari, </em>274 F.3d 1211, 1219 (8th Cir.2001) (ALJ may reject opinion of any medical expert, where it is inconsistent with medical record as whole; it is ALJ\u2019s function to resolve conflicts). Third, contrary to Bry\u2019s assertion on appeal, the SSA reviewing physician referenced diagnostic test results as well as the examination findings of a consulting physician, and the reviewing physician\u2019s findings were consistent with those of two treating physicians as to lifting and strenuous work; Bry\u2019s reliance on the statements of a psychologist as to her physical RFC is also misplaced. <em>See id. </em>at 1217-18 (it is ALJ\u2019s responsibility to determine RFC based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>medical records, observations of treating physicians and others, and claimant\u2019s own description of her limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Bry\u2019s remaining arguments provide no basis for reversal. Accordingly, we conclude the ALJ\u2019s opinion is supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Cox v. Barnhart, </em>345 F.3d 606, 608 (8th Cir.2003) (standard of review), and we affirm. We decline to consider the new evidence Bry has attached to her brief, and we deny her motion to supplement the record. <em>See Delrosa v. Sullivan, </em>922 F.2d 480, 483-84 (8th Cir.1991).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\">. The Honorable Rodney S.
