We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo purely legal questions and claims of due process violations, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-25\">The petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA\u2019s streamlining decision fails to comport with the requirements of due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>The petitioners\u2019 contention, that because they filed their application for asylum before the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act took effect, they had a settled expectation that denial of their application would result in deportation proceedings, is foreclosed by <em>Vasquez-Zavala, </em>324 F.3d at 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004) petitioners\u2019 motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b933-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
