The IJ denied relief because she found Aktar to be not credible, stating, \u201cI do not believe the respondent and I have noted the material variances between the application and the cross and redirect examinations.\u201d We are troubled by many of the IJ\u2019s remarks, and some of her comments are insupportable as well as offensive. Nevertheless, substantial evidence in the record supports the negative credibility determination, namely the material inconsistencies between Aktar\u2019s application and her testimony relied upon by the IJ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Aktar testified that she was raped because of her involvement in government-sponsored family planning activities. She testified that she started volunteering for family-planning work after two years of college, but she also testified that in 1989, she was 15 and attending college. Based on this discrepancy, the IJ found that she had not been engaged in family planning activities at the time of her rape. Additionally, Aktar stated in her application that she was arrested in 1994 but not charged with any crime. In her testimony, she stated that she was charged with a crime as part of that incident. These inconsistencies \u201cinvolved the heart of the asylum claim and support the negative credibility finding.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-18\">In light of the IJ\u2019s negative credibility finding, we hold that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that Aktar failed to prove that any persecution she may have suffered in Bangladesh was <em>because of </em>her gender or political opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The remaining evidence would not \u201ccompel any reasonable factfinder to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution has been shown\u201d by Mrs. Aktar.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">Because Aktar has not proven eligibility for asylum, the IJ correctly held that she cannot show eligibility for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-20\">We decline to consider Aktar\u2019s assertion that the BIA improperly denied her Convention Against Torture<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claim because she failed to adequately brief this claim on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>appeal, and we deem it waived.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aey\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b288-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-13\">. <em>See Gui v.
