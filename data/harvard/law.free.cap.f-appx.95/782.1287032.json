In this appeal he challenges the eighty-seven month sentence imposed. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-19\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b816-20\">The case was previously heard in this Court and remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Chilingirian, </em>280 F.3d 704 (6th Cir.2002). We incorporate the facts of the case by reference here, and supplement as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-21\">On April 29, 1999, after a bench trial, the district court found Defendant guilty as to one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in violation of 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a) &amp; (h) (\u201cCount 33\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) used the money laundering guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 (1998), which called for a base offense level of 23, plus five levels as the value exceeded $1,000,000.00. With a total offense level of 28 and a Criminal History Category I, the PSR recommended a guideline range of seventy-eight to ninety-seven months. Instead, the district court used the fraud guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, and calculated a total offense level of 20 and Criminal History Category I, which resulted in a guideline range of thirty-three to forty-one months. The district court imposed a term of thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, two years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount $335,167.50. Defendant appealed on various grounds. The Government filed a cross-appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s use of the fraud guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, instead of the sentencing guideline for money laundering, \u00a7 2S1.1. This Court rejected Defendant\u2019s challenges to his conviction and sentence. However, regarding the cross-appeal, we determined that money laundering guidelines should have been used in imposing sentence in light of the fact that \u201c[t]he money laundering in this case was not minimal nor incidental, and it appears to have been funneled through the client trust account in order to make it appear legitimate and to further the radar technology/fraud scheme.\u201d <em>Chilingirian, </em>280 F.3d at 714. We remanded with instructions to resentence Defendant in accordance with the money laundering guideline. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">On April 9, 2002, after remand, the probation office supplemented the original presentence report (\u201cSPSR\u201d). The SPSR noted that, on remand, the first task was to determine which version of the guidelines to apply. The SPSR noted that the last date of the offense of conviction is the controlling date for <em>ex post facto </em>purposes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11 (providing that the district court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced, unless its application would violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause, in which case the last date of the offense of conviction is controlling). Here, the offense conduct for Count 33 ended in October 1996, thus the 1995 edition of the Guidelines Manual and the 2001 version would be the two applicable versions. The SPSR calculated Defendant\u2019s sentence under both editions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>SPSR calculated a total offense level of 29 under \u00a7 2S1.1 of the 1995 guidelines, and a total offense level of 32 under \u00a7 2S1.1 of the 2001 version. Because it produced a more favorable guideline level, the SPSR used the 1995 guideline. Thus, with a total offense level of 29 and a Criminal History Category I, the guideline range was eighty-seven to one hundred eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Defendant filed objections to the SPSR. The district court held a resentencing hearing on May 23, 2002. Over Defendant\u2019s objection, the court applied the 1995 version of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The district court next ruled that the amount of laundered funds was $2.7 million. The court also rejected Defendant\u2019s attack on the restitution order. The court set the total offense level at 29. Combined with a Criminal History Category score of I, the guideline range was eighty-seven to one hundred-eight months. The district court resentenced Defendant to a custodial term of eighty-seven months, all other terms to remain unchanged from the original judgment. Defendant filed his <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Defendant, represented by counsel, presents three issues on appeal: (1) whether Defendant\u2019s statutory sentence of eighty-seven months violates <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002); (2) whether the district court erred in calculating Defendant\u2019s sentence; and (3) whether the district court erred in requiring Defendant to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">A. <em>Apprendi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The gist of Defendant\u2019s first argument is as follows. The offense-defining statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, has a maximum sentence of twenty years. However, the operation of the offense-defining statute in conjunction with \u00a7 2S1.1 of the sentencing guidelines results in a relevant maximum sentence of twelve months. The guidelines must be considered in determining the relevant maximum sentence because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A) mandates the application of the sentencing guidelines. In other words, every factor which increases a defendant\u2019s sentence, including the application of the guideline sentencing enhancements, must be charged in the indictment and proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory <em>maximum </em>must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490 (emphasis added). In <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), the Supreme Court held that anything that increases the statutory <em>minimum </em>is a sentencing factor and not an element, and not subject to the rule of <em>Apprendi. </em>The majority in <em>Harris </em>stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-13\">[wjhether chosen by the judge or the legislature, the facts guiding judicial discretion <em>below the statutory maximum </em>need not be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. When a judge sentences the defendant to a mandatory minimum, no less than when the judge chooses a sentence within the range, the grand and petit juries already have found all the facts necessary to authorize the Government to impose the sentence. The judge may impose the minimum, the maximum, or any other sentence within the range without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>seeking further authorization from those juries-and without contradicting <em>Apprendi</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 565 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Relying on <em>Harris, </em>this Court has already ruled <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to sentencing enhancements within the guideline range. <em>United States v. Stines, </em>318 F.3d 912, 916 (6th Cir.2002) (stating that \u201c[ajlthough it is true that the quantity determined by the district court elevated the mandatory guideline minimum sentence, <em>Harris </em>tells us that <em>Apprendi </em>does not invalidate that increase\u201d; holding that sentencing enhancements based on drug type and quantity factors did not affect the statutory maximum and therefore <em>Apprendi </em>was not implicated); <em>see also United States v. Copeland, </em>321 F.3d 582, 603 (6th Cir.2003) (same); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>249 F.3d 366, 380 (5th Cir.2001) (rejecting the defendant money-launderer\u2019s argument that an enhancement under the money laundering guideline based on the value of funds laundered must be submitted to the jury; upholding the twenty-year sentence imposed by the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\"><em>Ring, </em>issued the same day as <em>Harris, </em>does not support Defendant\u2019s argument. <em>Ring </em>was a capital sentencing case. The Arizona statute made first degree murder punishable by life imprisonment or death. However, the death penalty could be imposed only in accordance with a separate state statute which required further fact findings to be made by the judge alone. The Supreme Court held that, because the aggravating factors increased the available sentence from life in prison to death, they could not be found by the trial judge but had to be determined by the jury. <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 609. <em>Ring </em>is therefore distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">In short, this contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">B. Sentence Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Defendant argues in the alternative that the district court miscalculated his offense level under both the 1995 and 2001 Guidelines. Specifically, Defendant argues that his guideline range, rather than being computed at level 29 under the 1995 version, or 32 under the 2001 version, should have been calculated at level 26 under both versions. He makes several arguments in support of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">1. 1995 Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">As noted, Defendant claims that his total offense level under the 1995 guideline should have been 26, not 29, because his conviction should be construed as a <em>conspiracy </em>to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), not the <em>substantive </em>offense of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i). Defendant therefore claims that the district court should have applied \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(2) for a base level of 20 for other violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, because he was found guilty only of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). Instead, the district court determined Defendant\u2019s base offense level by applying \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">The 1995 version provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-18\">(a) Base Offense Level:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-19\">(1) 23, if convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A);</p>\n<p id=\"b819-21\">(2) 20, otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-22\">(b) ...</p>\n<p id=\"b819-23\">(2) If the value of the funds exceeded $100,000, increase the offense level as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number><em>Value </em>(Apply the Greatest) <em>Increase in Level</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">(F) More than $1,000,000 add 5</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">(G) More than $3,500,000 add 6</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">We find no error. Under \u00a7 1956(h), \u201c[a]ny person who conspires to commit any offense defined in this section or section 1957 shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) (West 2003). Thus, in determining Defendant\u2019s sentence, we look to the object offense and use its base offense level. <em>See United States v. Haehle, </em>227 F.3d 857, 862 (7th Cir.2000) (stating that \u201cfor a person who conspires to violate \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A), the sentence under \u00a7 1956(h) must be the same as for the person who commits the substantive offense\u201d; similarly, \u201c[f]or a person who conspires to violate \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B), the sentence follows that substantive offense\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 861-62 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the use of level 23 was wrong because he pleaded guilty to a violation of \u00a7 1956(h), not \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Count 33 explicitly charged Defendant and Jack Rashid with engaging in a conspiracy to both promote and conceal the proceeds of their fraudulent radar technology scheme through the use of client trust accounts established by Defendant for this purpose. The indictment twice specifically referenced \u201cTitle 18, United States Code, Sections 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), 1956(a)(1)(B)\u00ae and 1956(h).\u201d In its \u201cGeneral Finding Pursuant to Rule 23,\u201d the district court specifically found Defendant guilty of the charge of \u201cCOUNT THIRTY-THREE (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae, 1956(a)(1)(B)\u00ae, and 1956(h)-CONSPIRACY TO LAUNDER MONETARY INSTRUMENTS).\u201d The amended judgment states that Defendant was found guilty of \u201c18 USC 1956(a)(l)(A)(I), 1956(a)(l)(B)(I), and 1956(h).\u201d Finally, at resentencing, the district court specifically noted that \u201c[o]n April 29, 1999, the Court issued a general finding pursuant to Rule 23 finding the defendant guilty of Count 33, alleging a violation of \u2014 the following sections of \u2014 18 U.S.C.1956(a)(l)(A)(i), 1956(a)(1)(B)\u00ae, and 1956(h).\u201d Thus, the district court correctly looked to \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae and \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)\u00ae, the object offenses of the conspiracy count in determining the base offense level for Defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1956(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">The district court also did not err in using the base offense level of 23 set forth in \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(1), based on the violation of \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae, rather than the base offense level of 20 under \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(2), based on the violation of \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)\u00ae. Section lB1.2(d) states that \u201ca conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more than one offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted on a separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(d) (1995). The commentary explains that</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">[sjubsection (d) provides that a conviction on a conspiracy count charging conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy for each offense that he conspired to commit. For example, where a conviction on a single count of conspiracy establishes that the defendant conspired to commit three robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit the first robbery, one count of conspiracy to commit the second robbery, and one count of conspiracy to commit the third robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2, cmt. n.4 (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Thus, here, for sentencing purposes it was proper to treat Defendant as having been convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit a violation of \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae, and one count of conspiracy to commit a violation of \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)\u00ae. Next, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d) directs that we group together the \u201ctwo counts.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d) (stating that \u201c[ojffenses covered by [\u00a7 2S1.1] are to be grouped under this subsection\u201d). <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, cmt. n.6 (stating that \u201c[a] conspiracy ... to commit an offense is covered under subsection (d) if the offense that is the object of the conspiracy ... is covered under subsection (d)\u201d). <em>See generally </em>U.S.S.G. ch 3, pt. D, introductory cmt. (1995) (stating that \u201c[t]he rules in this Part are to be used to determine the offense level for such composite offenses [e.g. conspiracy] from the offense level for the underlying offenses\u201d). Finally, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3 directs that \u201c[i]n the case of counts grouped together ' pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.2(d) ... [w]hen the counts involve offenses of the same general type to which different guidelines apply, apply the offense guideline that produces the highest offense level.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(b) (1995). Here, the highest offense level is 23. In sum, the district court did not err in setting Defendant\u2019s base offense level at 23 rather than 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Defendant also asserts that Count 33 cannot be construed to charge substantive money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae because it fails to describe sufficiently conduct that would constitute such a violation. He adds that the three paragraphs of that count parrot the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae and (B)(i), without providing any reference to specific conduct by the defendants that would constitute violations of those provisions. Thus, he claims that this paragraph is insufficient to charge a violation of any part of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 because it fails to apprise him of the underlying conduct. In addition, Defendant argues that Count 33, as a single count, cannot constitutionally charge both violations of the substantive crime of money laundering <em>and </em>conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">As the Government points out, the foregoing arguments are veiled attempts at arguing vagueness and duplicity in the indictment, and should have been raised in pretrial motions rather than as sentencing issues. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B); <em>United States v. Adesida, </em>129 F.3d 846, 849 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that duplicity must be raised prior to trial or waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">2. 2001 Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">Defendant also claims that the district court miscalculated his sentence under the 2001 sentencing guidelines, to arrive at a total offense level of 32, rather than 26. He finds several errors. First, he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>tends that the district court calculated his base offense level under the wrong guideline because it erroneously found him responsible for the underlying mail and wire fraud. Second, he argues that the district court made a new, higher loss calculation than utilized at his initial sentencing, without any evidence to support the change. Third, he asserts that the district court erred in applying an enhancement for making a false statement during the course of a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The 2001 version of \u00a7 2S.l.l(a) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">(a) Base Offense Level:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">(1) The offense level for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived, if (A) the defendant committed the underlying offense (or would be accountable for the underlying offense under subsection (a)(1)(A) of \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)); and (B) the offense level for that offense can be determined; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">(2) 8 plus the number of offense levels from the table in \u00a7 2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) corresponding to the value of the laundered funds, otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(a) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">a. Relevant Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">At resentencing, over Defendant\u2019s objection, the district court sentenced Defendant under \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l), reasoning that Defendant was responsible for the underlying mail and wire fraud under the Relevant Conduct provision, \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A). Defendant contends that the district court failed to make sufficient findings to hold him responsible for the underlying offense and thus application of \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l) is unsupported by the record. Thus, Defendant claims that his base offense level should have been calculated under \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">The SPSR noted that the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived is fraud. Stating that Defendant \u201ccommitted the underlying offense or would be accountable for the underlying offense under the relevant conduct provisions of \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A),\u201d the SPSR applied \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l). Under the fraud guidelines, \u00a7 2B1.1, the base level is 6, plus eighteen levels for more than $2,5000,000 in funds, \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(J), plus four levels for more than fifty victims, \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B), and two levels as the offense involved a misrepresentation during the course of a bankruptcy proceedings, \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(7)(B). This resulted in a total offense level of 30. Because Defendant was convicted under \u00a7 1956(h), an additional two points were added, resulting in a base offense level of 32. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">Had Defendant been sentenced under \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(2), his base offense level would be 8, plus 18 for the value of funds involved, \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(J), plus two more levels under \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(B) because Defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). This would set his total offense level at 28, with a corresponding sentencing range of seventy-eight to ninety-seven months. U.S.S.G., Ch. 5, Pt. A (2001). Thus, the sentencing range would be lower than that obtained under the 1995 version, and it would be possible for Defendant to receive less than eighty-seven months, his current sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">Section lB1.3(a)(l)(A) makes a defendant accountable for \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.\u201d At the time of Defendant\u2019s resentencing, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1) provided that \u201c[a]t the sentencing hearing ... [f]or each matter controverted, the court must make either a finding on the allegation or a determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>no finding is necessary because the controverted matter mil not be taken into account in, or will not affect, sentencing.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court requires sentencing courts to make independent findings on any controverted matters. <em>United States v. Tackett, </em>113 F.3d 603, 613 (6th Cir.1997). This Court requires \u201c \u2018literal compliance\u2019 with this provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the district court fails to make a factual finding, \u201cthis court must remand for resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Edgecomb, </em>910 F.2d 1309, 1313 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In response to Defendant\u2019s objection, the district court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">Objection 5 of the defendant is overruled on the law. And I make as to objection 5 the following comment. As the defendant was involved in the underlying offense and the facts in this case show that he either committed, aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or wilfully caused the underlying offense, guideline of Section 2Sl.l(a)(2) cannot be utilized in setting the base offense level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The Government claims that the record supports sentencing Defendant under \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l) as a direct money launderer for purposes of calculating his offense level under the 2001 guidelines. However, the district court\u2019s conclusory statement fails to meet Rule 32\u2019s requirement of independent or particularized findings of fact. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>291 F.3d 908, 911-12 (6th Cir.2002) (district court\u2019s summary acceptance of presentence report was insufficient to dispose of the defendant\u2019s challenge to presentence report\u2019s finding holding him responsible for a specified amount of methamphetamine); <em>United States v. Corrado, </em>227 F.3d 528, 540-41 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that district court erred in failing to set out findings as to any of the controverted issues; noting that the district court \u201ceither summarily adopted the findings of the presentence report or simply declared that the enhancement in question was supported by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d); <em>Tackett, </em>113 F.3d at 614 (holding that mere recitation of the presentence investigation report\u2019s findings does not satisfy Rule 32 and that the record must reflect an independent evaluation of the evidence). Upon remand, the district court will have to conform its ruling on this aspect of its sentencing calculation to the dictates of Rule 32 and our caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">b. Amount of Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">Next, Defendant argues that the district court erred in setting the value of funds at $2.7 million under the 2001 guidelines at resentencing. At the initial sentencing the Government alleged, and the district court found, that Defendant was responsible for $2,267 million in laundered funds. Defendant alleges that this Court\u2019s earlier remand for resentencing was not a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>remand. Second, he argues that the sentencing court failed to provide objective reasons for imposing a more stringent sentence at resentencing, without providing an objective basis for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Under the 1995 version of the guideline, a specific-offense enhancement of six is required where the amount of laundered funds is between $2 million and $3.5 million. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 (b)(2)(G) (1995). Thus, the precise amount of the funds in excess of $2 million was not relevant. However, under the 2001 money laundering guideline, the cross-reference to the calculations set forth in \u00a7 2B1.1 now contains a break between $1 million (sixteen-level increase) and $2.5 million (eighteen-level increase). Thus, the Government filed a resentencing memorandum, with exhibits, establishing the total amount of money laundered through both of Defendant\u2019s trust accounts as totaling over $2.7 million.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Even if we consider the issue, Defendant\u2019s claim should fail. To begin, our remand order simply states that \u201cwe REVERSE the district court\u2019s sentencing order and REMAND the case to the district court with instructions to re-sentence Jack Chiligirian in accordance with the money laundering guideline.\u201d <em>Chilingiricm, </em>280 F.3d at 714 (emphasis in original). In <em>United States v. Helton, </em>349 F.3d 295 (6th Cir.2003), we held that \u201c[wjhere [ ] an appellate court simply vacates a sentence and remands to the district court for \u2018resentencing, that order is considered a general one that allows the district court to resentence the defendant <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 299 (citations omitted). Further, even if it is deemed \u201ca remand order that is limited by its terms to a discrete issue [and] the district court obtains jurisdiction to address only that issue,\u201d the \u201cdiscrete\u201d issue is proper application of the money laundering guidelines, of which the amount of funds is a component. <em>Id. </em>Defendant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">We note that Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1) (now, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B)) requires that for any controverted issue, the district court make specific factual findings to support its conclusion. Here, the court satisfied this requirement. At the resentencing hearing, the district judge made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">The majority of the funds that the defendant is being held accountable for comes from the first client trust fund. The review of funds show payments of 345 thousand and some odd dollars to the defendant, $1,788,000 and some odd dollars to Jack Rashid, and 600 thousand and some odd dollars related to Rashid brought, for a total of two thousand \u2014 2,736,052.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Defendant also argues that the district court was required to provide objective reasons for the increase in his sentence upon remand, citing <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), <em>overruled on other grounds by Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989). The district judge complied with this requirement, by citing objective information, such as the fact that co-conspirator Jack Rashid was found guilty of laundering $2.7 million. Also, on remand, the Government submitted a memorandum with a detailed financial spreadsheet supporting the higher figure. The district court clearly stated its reasons for the higher figure, and these reasons have objective support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>c. False Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Defendant argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for misrepresentation or fraudulent action made in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 231.1(b)(7)(B) (2001). He argues that the district court did not apply the enhancement at the initial sentencing and therefore cannot apply it at resentencing. The offense level enhancement for misrepresentation during a bankruptcy proceeding, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(7)(B), did not exist until November 1, 2001.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In the re-sentencing remand in 2002, Defendant never objected to the enhancement, before the district court. Under plain error review, it is not clear and obvious that the enhancement was erroneous. Defendant also attempts to invoke the <em>Pearce </em>requirement that the judge must cite objective reasons for increasing the sentence on remand. But it is not clear and obvious that this requirement applies in a case, such as the present one, where a defendant\u2019s appeal failed and the remand was granted solely on the basis of a successful cross-appeal by the government. <em>See Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 725 (\u201cDue process of law, then, requires the <em>vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction </em>must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">C. Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Defendant argues that the district court erred in imposing restitution in the amount of $335,167.50. The Government counters that Defendant waived the issue because he did not raise this objection at the time of his first sentencing in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">Although the transcript of the original sentencing hearing does not reflect an explicit objection to the order of restitution, the Addendum to the Presentence Investigation Report filed on October 13, 1999, reveals that Defendant actually objected to the <em>amount </em>of restitution, claiming that it was \u201cinaccurate.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the other hand, at the original sentencing, defense counsel contended that \u201cthe correct amount of restitution in this case is $335,167.50\u201d which represented only \u201cchecks that were issued from [Chilingirian\u2019s] trust account to [Chilingirian] personally.\u201d The district court assessed restitution in the same amount. Defendant did not challenge this amount on direct appeal. Having forfeited the claim in the previous appeal, it is not cognizable now. <em>See Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number><em>ed States v. McKinley, 221 </em>F.3d 716, 718-19 (6th Cir.2000); <em>cf. United States v. Hebeka, </em>89 F.3d 279, 284-85 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s sentencing order and REMAND the case to the district court for the limited purpose of recalculating Defendant\u2019s sentence under the 2001 version of the guidelines in accordance with this opinion. If that calculation results in a lower total offense level than the current calculation under the 1995 version, the district court is further instructed to resentence Defendant in accordance with the 2001 guideline. Otherwise, Defendant should be resentenced under the 1995 version. SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-5\">.

Defendant also objected to the restitution order in briefs submitted to the court before resentencing. (Pro Se Motion by Chilingirian for Judgment of Acquittal, dated March 15, 2002, at 15).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b826-6\">GWIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANa\">Concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">I agree with the majority\u2019s disposition of this case and the lion\u2019s share of its reasoning. However, I write separately to explain why an apparent inequity of our decision is actually a mirage. First, the apparent inequity: Our decision permits the Government to challenge the district court\u2019s initial value of funds determination on remand, though the Government did not previously make the challenge, but forbids Chilingirian from challenging the district court\u2019s restitution order on remand. The majority does not address exactly why this apparently inequitable result is, in fact, correct. I explain the justification here.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">We conclude that Chilingirian waived his challenge to the restitution order by not raising it in his initial appeal. This conclusion is correct. Our circuit\u2019s case law has identified \u201cthe general rule that when a party fails to seek review of a district court\u2019s final order, it is barred from reasserting that issue in any subsequent appeals occurring in that case.\u201d <em>United States v. McKinley, 227 </em>F.3d 716, 718 (6th Cir.2000). If this is correct, though, then why did the government not waive its challenge to the amount of funds involved?</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\"><em>United States v. Hebeka, </em>89 F.3d 279 (6th Cir.1996), provides the answer. Under <em>Hebeka, </em>the <em>McKinley </em>rule does not apply where a party asserts on appeal an argument that (1) the party had been unable to pursue during a previous appeal, but (2) later becomes logically relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 284-85. In this case, the district court applied the 1995 Guidelines during the original sentencing proceedings. These guidelines contain \u201cbreaks\u201d in the value of funds determination at $2 million and $3.5 million. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(G)-(H) (1995). Any figure between these two breaks results in the same enhancement. For this reason, the Government lacked a ground to argue on appeal that the $2.267 million figure was inaccurate; even if this Court agreed, the additional funds included in the finding would have made no difference under the 1995 Guidelines. Thus, it was irrelevant under the 1995 Guidelines whether the correct value of funds was $2.267 million or $2.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">On resentencing, however, the district court considered both the 1995 and 2001 Guidelines. The 2001 Guidelines contain a sentencing break at $2.5 million. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(J) (2002). The changes in the Guidelines made the difference between $2.267 million and $2.7 million relevant-the $2.267 million figure would result in a 16-level enhancement, whereas the $2.7 million figure would result in an 18-level enhancement. This new relevance, under <em>Hebeka, </em>prevents the <em>McKinley </em>waiver rule from applying in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">This result applies just the same if the tables were turned. Had the district court originally found the value of funds to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>$2.7 million, <em>Hebeka </em>would permit Chilingirian to advocate for a figure of $2,267 million on this appeal. Therefore, the previously described \u201capparent inequity\u201d is really no inequity at all, and need not cause any dyspepsia to readers or future defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
