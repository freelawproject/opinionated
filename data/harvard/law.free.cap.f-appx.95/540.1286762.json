Williams appeals from his judgment of conviction and sentence and final order of criminal forfeiture following his guilty plea to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i) and (h); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-20\">Williams argues that Pe\u00f1a violated his duty of loyalty to him by testifying against him before the grand jury and at his sentencing hearing; Williams also contends that the Government improperly exploited Pe\u00f1a\u2019s \u201cconflict\u201d by calling Pe\u00f1a as a witness. Williams has not demonstrated that his former counsel, Albert Pe\u00f1a, had an actual conflict of interest arising from Pe\u00f1a\u2019s representation of multiple clients with conflicting interests. <em>See Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 349-50, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). Further, because Pe\u00f1a\u2019s testimony did not involve communications protected by the attorney-client privilege, Williams\u2019s arguments lack merit. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>303 F.3d 606, 618 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cUnder the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege, the privilege can be over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>come where communication or work product is intended to further continuing or future criminal or fraudulent activity.\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted), <em>cert. </em>denied, 537 U.S. 1192, 123 S.Ct. 1272, 154 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Williams\u2019s written plea agreement, in which he agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>to the forfeiture of one million dollars, supports the district court\u2019s determination as to the amount of the monetary forfeiture. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 32.2(b)(1). To the extent that Williams suggests, in a one-sentence footnote in his original appellate brief, that the Government breached the plea agreement, thereby relieving him of his own obligations in the agreement, Williams has not adequately briefed the issue in his initial brief on appeal and it is abandoned. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247, 255-56 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc) (observing that this court is not required to search the record to find a legal and factual basis for an issue that is inadequately briefed).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Williams\u2019s \u201cUnopposed Motion to Supplement the Record with Government\u2019s Motion and District Court\u2019s Order Unsealing Sentencing Transcripts\u201d is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY because the Government\u2019s motion and district court\u2019s order are now part of the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
