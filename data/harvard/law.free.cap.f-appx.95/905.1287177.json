We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-22\">The IJ found Singh\u2019s story implausible and identified material inconsistencies between Singh\u2019s testimony and written documentation submitted in support of his asylum application. Because these inconsistencies concern Singh\u2019s arrest and harassment by the Punjab police, they \u201cgo to the heart\u201d of Singh\u2019s claim for asylum and constitute substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>supporting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 971 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We reject Singh\u2019s contention that the IJ did not adequately review his request for relief under the CAT. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Singh failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returns to India. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282-83 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004) petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was granted, or continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tune, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b938-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
