Patterson was convicted of both the Texas state charge of attempted capital murder and the federal charge of felon in possession of a firearm. Patterson argues that the district court erred in finding that the rule against piecemeal incarceration did not prevent his transfer from federal to state custody before he fully served his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">We review the district court\u2019s findings for clear error and its rulings of law <em>de novo. See Moody v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The district court correctly concluded that Patterson\u2019s transfer to state custody did not violate the rale against piecemeal incarceration because the transfer did not result in the lengthening of his sentence. <em>See Free v. Miles, </em>333 F.3d 550, 552 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Patterson failed to argue and has therefore abandoned an appeal of the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction over any \u00a7 2255 claims that he was attempting to assert. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Further, Patterson has filed four previous federal habeas petitions challenging his transfer from federal to state custody. He filed two previous \u00a7 2241, one previous \u00a7 2254, and one previous \u00a7 2255 petition. This is therefore Patterson\u2019s fifth attempt to challenge his transfer. Because this appeal is a \u201cduplicative action arising from the same series of events and alleging many of the same facts as an earlier suit\u201d the appeal is DISMISSED as FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Bailey v. Johnson, </em>846 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">Patterson is WARNED that any future filings to this court or any court subject to the jurisdiction of this court that challenge his transfer from federal to state custody will invite sanctions, which may include monetary fines and/or restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
