After a hearing, the district court found the government had met its burden of establishing by a preponderance of evidence that Epps suffers from a mental illness requiring treatment in a suitable facility, such as the Federal Medical Center (FMC) in Rochester, Minnesota. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245(d) (burden of proof). Contrary to Epps\u2019s argument on appeal, we conclude the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Eckerson, </em>299 F.3d 913, 914-15 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (standard of review). Specifically, the government offered testimony of FMC staff psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Shine, who saw Epps regularly over a considerable period of time. Dr. Shine\u2019s opinion concerning Epps\u2019s diagnosis and need for treatment, expressed at the hearing and in a written psychological evaluation, supported the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-18\">. The Honorable David S. Doty, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Susan Richard Nelson, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
