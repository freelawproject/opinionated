Onuohah argues that the district court misapplied the United States Sentencing Guidelines and erred in denying him a minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-23\">Section 3B1.2 provides for a two-point reduction in the offense level if the defendant was a minor participant. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A \u201cminor participant\u201d is defined as one who is substantially \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.5). As Onuohah was directly involved in finding suppliers for the fraudulent checks and directly involved in delivering the checks to the person who was to negotiate them, his role in the offense cannot be said to have been \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>932 F.2d 1085, 1092 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in refusing to adjust Onuohah\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Deavours, </em>219 F.3d 400, 404 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b114-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
