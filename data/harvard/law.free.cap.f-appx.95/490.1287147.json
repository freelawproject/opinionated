He was sentenced to thirty months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Chapman\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) raising two issues regarding Chapman\u2019s sentence: (1) whether the district court properly increased his offense level by four because of the number of firearms involved in Chapman\u2019s conduct; and (2) whether the district court erroneously enhanced Chapman\u2019s offense level by two for being a manager of criminal conduct. The Government has elected not to file a brief. Chapman was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief and has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We have independently reviewed the entire record in this case, including the issues raised by counsel, and, in accordance with <em>Anders, </em>have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Chapman\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
