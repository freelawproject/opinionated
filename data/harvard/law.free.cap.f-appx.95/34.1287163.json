O\u2019Loughlin appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his discrimination action and granting summary judgment to Social Security Administration Commissioner Jo Anne B. Barnhardt. O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s discrimination action was brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-34 (2000). This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-19\">O\u2019Loughlin asserts the district court erred in dismissing his action based on its conclusion he was untimely in initiating administrative review. This is meritless. O\u2019Loughlin fails to establish the Appellee waived this defense, and he fails to establish he timely pursued administrative review. <em>See generally </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(l)-(2); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.107(b); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.604(c); <em>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, </em>455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982); <em>Zografov v. Veteran\u2019s Admin. Med. Ctr., </em>779 F.2d 967, 968-70 (4th Cir.1985). He also asserts the Appellee\u2019s stated nondiscriminatory reason for his nonselection for promotion was pretextual. We disagree with O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s position that errors allegedly committed by the Appellee in the selection process evinced pretext. <em>See generally Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-21\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
