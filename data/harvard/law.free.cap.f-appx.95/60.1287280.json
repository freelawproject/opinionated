R.App. P. 24(a), and that Texas prisoner Robert G. Hart (#769108) should not be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal. Hart has filed a motion to proceed IFP on appeal, a pleading which this court construes as a motion challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">Hart avers that his case presents exceptional circumstances because he is indigent, has no legal training, and is hindered from investigating his case due to his incarceration in a maximum security prison. Hart has raised legal points that are arguable on their merits. Thus, Hart\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is GRANTED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-21\">However, the denial of Hart\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is AFFIRMED as he has not shown exceptional circumstances warranting the granting of such a motion. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-22\">IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b92-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
