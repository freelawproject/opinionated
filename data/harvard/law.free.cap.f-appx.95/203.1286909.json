There was no <em>Terry </em>stop when the investigating officer initially approached Sandoval-Gonzalez. Sandoval-Gonzalez\u2019s car was broken down in a public place, and the officer stopped to provide assistance. <em>See Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (noting that \u201ca seizure does not occur simply because a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few questions\u201d). By the time Sandoval-Gonzalez was detained and frisked, the officers had \u201ca particularized and objective basis for suspecting criminal activity.\u201d <em>See United States v. Colin, </em>314 F.3d 439, 442 (9th Cir.2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, Sandoval-Gonzalez could not produce any identification when asked to do so by the police; he identified himself to the police using different names; he informed the police that he was subject to probation or parole conditions; and he was discovered in a high crime area at three o\u2019clock in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">2. On appeal, Sandoval-Gonzalez asserts that the police officers exceeded the scope of the <em>Terry </em>stop when they forced him to remove his clothing so that they could examine his tattoos. Sandoval-Gonzalez waived this argument by failing to present it to the district court. <em>See United States v. Hawkins, </em>249 F.3d 867, 872 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">3. The district court did not err in denying Sandoval-Gonzalez\u2019s motion to suppress based on an impermissible frisk. The police officer frisked Sandoval-Gonzalez so as to take \u201csuch steps ... reasonably necessary to protect ... personal safety and to maintain the status quo during the course of the stop.\u201d <em>See United States v. $109,179 in United States Currency, </em>228 F.3d 1080, 1084 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">4. Sandoval-Gonzalez voluntarily requested that he be allowed to sit in the police car; he was not handcuffed; and he volunteered that he was an illegal alien. Under the totality of circumstances, Sandoval-Gonzalez was not in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. <em>See Alvarado v. Hickman, </em>316 F.3d 841, 846 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">5. The district court did not err in providing a derivative citizenship instruction after the jury retired. \u201c[A] defendant is not entitled to any particular form of an instruction, so long as the instructions given fairly and adequately cover his theories of defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>201 F.3d 1223, 1231 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sandoval-Gonzalez\u2019s request to reopen closing argument because Sandoval-Gonzalez\u2019s theory of defense was adequately covered in defense counsel\u2019s closing argument given before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the jury retired. <em>See United States v. Spillone, </em>879 F.2d 514, 518 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">6. Sandoval-Gonzalez\u2019s argument that the indictment was insufficient since it failed to allege a voluntary entry as an element of the \u201cfound in\u201d offense pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 is foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Pargar-Rosas, </em>238 F.3d 1209, 1213 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b236-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
