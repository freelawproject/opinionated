He argues that the district court clearly erred in overruling his objection to the presentence report\u2019s drug-quantity calculation and including the 10.72 grams of cocaine base recovered on August 8, 2002, as relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). Raymo also argues that the quantity of the cocaine base (10.72 grams) is insufficient as a matter of law to create an inference of intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Raymo has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred in including the 10.72 grams of cocaine base as relevant conduct. This offense was sufficiently similar and in close temporal proximity to the offense of conviction to reasonably suggest that it constituted the same course of conduct. <em>See United States v. Bethley, </em>973 F.2d 396, 401 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 589-90 (5th Cir. 2000). Further, Raymo has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred in finding that he possessed the 10.72 grams of cocaine base for distribution purposes rather than for personal consumption. <em>See United States v. Buck, </em>324 F.3d 786, 796 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Kates, </em>174 F.3d 580, 582-83 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
