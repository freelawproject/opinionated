Six years later, following the government\u2019s initiation of removal proceedings against him, Hu filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal, claiming that he was persecuted and feared future persecution under China\u2019s family planning policy. Following a February 25, 1999 asylum hearing, the IJ denied Hu\u2019s application for asylum and withholding, finding his claims incredible. On appeal, the BIA summarily affirmed and adopted the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">In his petition for review, Hu asserts that the IJ erred in denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly, <em>see Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir. 2003), and in so doing, defer to the IJ\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Because we afford \u201cparticular deference\u201d to the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations, <em>see Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997), the scope of our review is \u201cexceedingly narrow,\u201d <em>Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will not disturb the IJ\u2019s factual findings unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Applying this standard to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we find that the record amply supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Upon arriving in the United States, Hu averred in his airport interview<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that he sought asylum because of his father-in-law\u2019s political activities. When he filed his asylum application, six years later, he alleged that he sought asylum from China\u2019s family planning policy. Whereas Hu claimed in his asylum application that Chinese officials threatened him with cancellation of his business license after the birth of his first daughter, at his asylum hearing, he testified that he was denied a business license after the birth of his second daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In addition to these inconsistencies, Hu\u2019s asylum application contained a number of critical omissions. For example, although Hu testified on cross-examination that he was threatened with sterilization by Chinese family planning officials, he failed to assert this critical fact in his asylum application. He further testified that his wife had been forced to use an intrauterine device by the Chinese family planning officials, but again, no such allegation was made in his asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Viewing these inconsistencies, omissions, and lack of corroborating evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> together, the IJ reasonably found Hu an incredible applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-13\">. Lin was separately placed in exclusion proceedings and was ordered excluded after an IJ denied her asylum application. Represented by the same counsel as Hu, Lin filed a timely petition for review of the exclusion order, which is being heard in tandem with this case before this Court. <em>See Lin v. INS, </em>Dkt. No. 01-4151, 2004 WL 848259 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">. To the extent that Hu challenges the IJ\u2019s reliance on his airport statement in making its adverse credibility determination this claim was not exhausted below, and may not be raised here in the first instance. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\">. To the extent Hu argues that the IJ improperly required him to corroborate his claims, this assertion is unavailing. Although \"[t]he testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (1999 &amp; 2002), because Hu\u2019s testimony was incredible, the IJ properly faulted him for failing to corroborate his claim with witness testimony or additional documentary evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
