No. 105-339,112 Stat. 3182 (Oct. 31, 1998), for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Bonds v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>No. DC-3443-02-0315-1-1 (M.S.P.B. Apr.16, 2002). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-31\">We must affirm the final decision of the board unless we conclude that it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). Whether the board had jurisdiction to hear Bonds\u2019 appeal is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Butler v. SSA, </em>331 F.3d 1368, 1371-72 (Fed.Cir.2003). Under VEOA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the board has jurisdiction over an appeal alleging a violation of any right under a statute or regulation relating to veterans preference. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a (2000). In order to establish jurisdiction in such cases an appellant must show, among other things, that he is a preference eligible veteran. <em>Id. </em>Bonds contends \u201cVEOA extends to a larger population than \u2018Preference Eligibles\u2019 for which remedy is contained in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.25.\u201d The route of redress that Bonds has chosen to pursue \u2014filing his complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a(a)(l) \u2014 requires that a veteran be preference eligible, and section 1208.25 does not support his broad proposition. Bonds was not preference eligible under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108(4) because he retired at the rank of lieutenant colonel and was not disabled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
