See 174 Ill. App. 589. The evidence of the plaintiff tended to prove that immediately after the contract was signed, the plaintiff gave the defendant an order for a sample car for exhibition and demonstration purposes, paid a cash deposit of $50 at that time, and paid the remainder of the net purchase price, $1,000, in cash upon delivery of the same; that this car was not delivered until June 12, 1909, at a time when the season for the sale of 1909 cars was well advanced; that in the meantime, the plaintiff rented and opened a salesroom and signed a two years\u2019 lease for the same, at a rental of $1,000 for the first year, and $1,100 for the second; that he hired salesmen, signed a year\u2019s contract with a daily newspaper for advertising space, advertised therein and in other papers, and prepared and sent out circular letters to prospective customers, etc.; that on May 15, 1909, he ordered four more cars from the defendant and paid a deposit of $50 on each; that the first of these four cars was delivered about July 23rd the second about August 18th, the third sometime in September, and the last in the latter part of October; that at the time this order was given, the plaintiff had no order from any customer for any of the cars; that customers were found, however, by the plaintiff for all of them about as fast as the same were delivered; that during the summer of 1909, the president of the defendant company expressed dissatisfaction with some of the terms of the contract, especially the rate of discount allowed to the plaintiff, and requested the plaintiff to sign a new contract, such as defendant was \u201cmaking with other dealers,\u201d which plaintiff declined to do; that in August, defendant raised the list price of its cars $250; that soon after, Mr. Staver, the president of the defendant company, told the plaintiff it intended to \u201crevise their lines and bring out new models\u201d for the season of 1910, but when the plaintiff made inquiries about these changes, Mr. Staver declined to give him any information regarding the same unless he would sign a new contract; that finally, in November, 1909, the plaintiff made a specific request of the defendant for catalogues for the 1910 models, as he wanted to make plans for that year, but Mr. Staver replied: \u201cWhen you fix up a contract you will get all the information that is necessary. We will build four and six cylinder cars. That is all the information you will get until you sign a new contract. You cannot continue this contract. It is unsatisfactory, and you will either sign a new contract or you will not get these cars.\u201d The evidence further showed that the 1909 season for selling automobiles was then practically over; that defendant had only two cars left in its factory, and those were unfinished; that defendant had discontinued making cars like the sample car then in use by the plaintiff; that on December 31, 1909, the plaintiff and his salesman went to the office of defendant for the purpose of making a deposit on five more cars, as required by the contract; that Mr. Staver was in his office at the time, but refused to see them, and that thereupon, the plaintiff tendered the sum of $250 in currency to one of defendant\u2019s officers there present, as a deposit upon the purchase of five cars, and with \u2022the money tendered a written order for five cars, without giving any specifications, but stating that he was ready to do everything that was necessary to be done to comply with his contract; that this offer or tender was refused, the officer saying that he did not know anything about the plaintiff\u2019s contract; that a few days later, the defendant notified the plaintiff in writing that \u201con account of your (his) failure to comply with the contract,\u201d the defendant considered \u201cthe same hereby terminated.\u201d It was further shown that thereafter, and during the term specified in the contract, defendant sold twenty-six cars within the territory named in the plaintiff\u2019s contract, for $40,828.50.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-4\" pgmap=\"334\">Brothers &amp; Mills, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-5\" pgmap=\"334\">Bulkley, Gray &amp; More, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b335-13\" pgmap=\"335\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

Sales, \u00a7 62*\u2014when contract confers right to purchase. A contract conferring the exclusive right on the plaintiff to sell the defendant\u2019s automobiles in a city, held to entitle the plaintiff to purchase as many cars as he cared to buy, notwithstanding he did not have customers waiting for them.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b335-9\" pgmap=\"335\">5. Sales, \u00a7 160*\u2014when tender under contract of purchase must be kept good. A tender of money under a contract for the purchase of automobiles giving an exclusive right of resale in a city, held an offer to perform a condition of the contract, and that the tender need not be kept good by bringing the money into court.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b335-10\" pgmap=\"335\">6. Sales, \u00a7 65*\u2014when quantity sufficiently designated in order. An order for automobiles under a contract for their exclusive sale in a city, held to sufficiently designate the cars desired, where the defendant did not object to the order for that reason, and there was an uncertainty at the time the order was given as to the kind of automobiles the defendant intended putting on the market, and the purchaser offered to do whatever the defendant might require to comply with the contract.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b335-11\" pgmap=\"335\">7. Sales, \u00a7 143*\u2014when purchaser must be ready to perform on rescission by seller.

Sales, \u00a7 44*\u2014when stipulation against use of vendor's name in effecting resale of chattels broken. The fact that the plaintiff sent out circulars on the defendant\u2019s letter heads, held not to violate a condition of a contract for the exclusive sale of automobiles in a city, prohibiting the use of the defendant\u2019s name on printed matter, where it was done by direction of the defendant\u2019s superintendent, and was discontinued on objection being made by the defendant.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b336-4\" pgmap=\"336\">9.
