Hardy against A. J. Alexander to recover $70 claimed to have been loaned defendant. A jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and judgment for $70 and costs was entered against defendant, from which an appeal was taken.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-9\" pgmap=\"218\">No witnesses were examined on the part of defendant. The plaintiff testified that he was in the employ of defendant; that the plaintiff gave defendant a check for $70 to make up the amount the latter paid to one Carter on a horse deal; that the defendant took back a bill of sale on the horses. That subsequently there was a lawsuit between defendant and Carter, in which the latter claimed the right to redeem the horses, while defendant claimed there was an outright sale to him. In that case the court found that Carter had the right to redeem, and thereafter he paid appellant $45.55. Plaintiff testified that defendant said to him at the time he got the money: \u201cYou let me have this money and if I make any money, why, I will pay you well for the use of it, but if I don\u2019t make any you cannot lose any. I will stand between you and all danger.\u201d Plaintiff was a witness in the Carter case, and there made statements to some extent inconsistent with the claim that defendant owed him the $70. In the case at bar, plaintiff swore positively that defendant owed him this amount, and in that respect he was not contradicted.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b219-8\" pgmap=\"219\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AS4\" pgmap=\"219\">1.
