He subsequently made a motion to vacate the judgment on the ground of newly-discovered evidence, which was denied.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\" pgmap=\"367(141) 368(94)\">The defendant was represented in court by counsel. Before he waived a jury he was advised as to his right to a jury trial. The court heard the testimony of witnesses and arguments of counsel before conviction and judgment. The motion to vacate was supported by an affidavit of the prosecuting witness, stating that on account of misunderstanding or of ignorance on his part, he failed to state to the court certain circumstances which might have had a great weight before the court; that the facts are that he and the defendant were old friends; that defendant kept a grocery store, and the witness had been one of defendant\u2019s customers, but had ceased buying from him; that this created some bad feeling, which was so aggravated by the gossip of other persons that each came to believe the other was criticising him; that on June 28,1914, while the witness was passing in front of defendant\u2019s store, defendant called him and began to ask a question; that the witness was excited, and failed to answer, but placed his hand in his hip pocket to get his pipe and proceed on his way, when the defendant, acting under the impression that the witness was getting his pistol, struck the witness with a knife, causing a slight wound. There were also two affidavits of bystanders who briefly state that they witnessed this hip-pocket incident.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b368-8\" pgmap=\"368\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b368-9\" pgmap=\"368\">1.
