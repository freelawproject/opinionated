The evidence showed that the property described was subsequently removed by plaintiff from the location mentioned in the policy to a building in Block 43 of Granite City. The evidence whether such removal was consented'to by the defendant\u2019s local agent was conflicting. Plaintiff claimed that on or about the date of the removal of the property and prior to its destruction by fire, it notified defendant\u2019s agent who issued said policy that the property had been removed and was then located and situated on Block 43, and was advised by the agent that in consideration of the plaintiff foregoing its right to cancel the policy and to have the unearned portion of the premium returned, that the defendant would consent to the removal of the property to the new location, and that that policy would then cover the property the same as in the original location, and that defendant through its agent would indorse such consent, authority and agreement upon the policy; that the policy was in the possession of defendant\u2019s agent at Granite City, and was left with him for the purpose of making such indorsement, and that the plaintiff relied upon defendant\u2019s agent to make the indorsement thereon; that the policy was never returned to plaintiff; and that up to the time of the fire, so far as plaintiff was informed, the necessary indorsement had not been made as agreed upon, and that the policy continued in the possession of defendant.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-9\" pgmap=\"91\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-10\" pgmap=\"91\">1.

A copy of fire insurance was properly admitted in evidence in an action for a loss, under a declaration alleging that the policy was in the possession of the defendant, who failed to produce it on notice, where the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the original was left with the defendant\u2019s agent, and that it could not be found among the plaintiff\u2019s effects after diligent search.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-11\" pgmap=\"91\">2.

Insurance, \u00a7 653<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when salvage value of destroyed property does not affect amount of damage. In an action on a policy of fire insurance, the evidence held to show that destroyed goods had no salvage value which should have been taken in consideration in fixing damages.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b92-5\" pgmap=\"92\">5. Insurance, \u00a7 659a<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014sufficiency of evidence in action of fire insurance policy. A request, to peremptorily instruct the jury to find for the defendant held properly refused in an action on a policy of fire insurance, where the evidence tended to show that the insurer consented to the removal of insured chattels to the building in which they were destroyed.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b92-6\" pgmap=\"92\">6. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1411<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when judgment on conflicting evidence not disturbed. When the evidence is conflicting the Appellate Court will not disturb a judgment because against the weight of the evidence, where the jury gave credit to the testimony of one party\u2019s witnesses rather than to those of the other party, which the trial court affirmed by denying a motion for a new trial.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b92-7\" pgmap=\"92\">7. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1514<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014-when improper argument not reversible error. An improper argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the jury does not constitute reversible error, where it is evident that it did not influence the jury in awarding damages.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b92-8\" pgmap=\"92\">8. Instructions, \u00a7 151<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when refusal of requested instruction not error. The refusal of instructions requested by a party is not reversible error, where other instructions given at his request substantially cover the same ground, although not as favorable to him as those refused.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b92-9\" pgmap=\"92\">9. Insurance, \u00a7 702<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when interest recoverable on policy.
