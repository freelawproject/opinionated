M. deBeauviere against the \u25a0Chicago School of Physical Education and Expression for services claimed to have been rendered the defendant as a physical instructor. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $482.50, and the defendant sued out a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-3\" pgmap=\"319\">The evidence showed that the plaintiff was regularly employed at defendant\u2019s school in giving fencing lessons a few hours a week, at the rate of $2.50 an hour; that he claimed that in the spring of 1909, the head of the school employed him at the same rate to give instructions in what he called \u201csetting up exercises,\u201d consisting of \u201cexercises of the muscles of the body; bending and stretching the arms and legs; bending, twisting, etc.,\u201d with the understanding, that as the school was then in debt, his pay should \u201clie dormant\u201d until the end of the year 1910, by which time it was expected the defendant would be in a better financial condition as the result of the operation of a summer school at Saugatuck, Michigan.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\" pgmap=\"319\">The defendant did not deny that the plaintiff rendered services of the kind above stated, but claimed that when the plaintiff proposed to render such additional services, he was told that the school could not afford to pay for them, whereupon, being already an instructor in the school, he offered to teach the \u201csetting-up exercises\u201d without any additional compensation until the school was more firmly established, and that this offer was accepted. There was a sharp conflict in the evidence as to these respective claims. That in August, 1909, the plaintiff sent to the defendant a plan for giving such instructions in which he enumerated and enlarged upon the benefits that would follow its adoption, and the methods he would adopt if his suggestions were put in operation, that in the course of this letter, he said: \u201cThe first thing that will present itself to you, I know, is the question of remuneration. Well, don\u2019t worry about that. If your finances are flourishing, you can pay me, if you can\u2019t, I\u2019ll teach all the same. If you like you can pay me in postage stamps or in shares of your stock.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-5\" pgmap=\"319\">John W.

Where, in an action against a school for services as an instructor, a letter in evidence, written by the plaintiff to the defendant, stated that the latter need not worry about the former\u2019s pay for proposed services, and that \u201cif your finances are flourishing you can pay me, if you can\u2019t I\u2019ll teach all the same. If you like you can pay me in postage stamps or in shares of your stock,\u201d a remark of the trial judge in the presence of the jury, in reply to a request of the defendant to instruct as to the right to recover under such an offer, that there was \u201cno use giving instructions on that. You can\u2019t make a claim on one line in a letter. * * * I won\u2019t base an instruction\u201d thereon, held reversible error, since the letter tended to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s claim that there was a definite agreement as to compensation.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-4\" pgmap=\"320\">Lewis, Folsom &amp; Streeter and Robert P.
