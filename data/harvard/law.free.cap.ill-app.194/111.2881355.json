H. Mundy, the defendant, was the administrator; that his report as administrator falsely showed the payment by petitioner to the administrator of $985, and the payment by the administrator of a like sum to the petitioner; that the petitioner was not indebted to his father at the time of his death in any sum, and that he did not pay said sum or any other sum to said administrator ; that the administrator did not pay said sum to petitioner or any other sum as shown by said report; that the administrator falsely and wrongfully obtained said receipt from petitioner, which purports on its face to be for $985. Petitioner prayed for a citation against the administrator to strike such item from his report, and for the withdrawal of such receipt. A trial in the County Court resulted in a finding for petitioner, which was reversed on an appeal to the Circuit Court, from which an appeal was taken.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\" pgmap=\"133(55) 134(126)\">The facts were that James Sargent, a man about eighty-two years of age, a wife eighty-five years of age, a son, appellant, sixty-three years of age, and an adopted son, constituted the family and heirs at law of James Sargent, now deceased; that James Sargent was confined to his bed with sickness, an invalid, and very hard of hearing; that during that time he sold his home for $2,000 and from the proceeds paid $1,000 to his wife, and $985 to the appellant, Preston Sargent. The day before the transfer the petitioner went to the home of his father and solicited the payment to him from the husband and wife of a part of the funds which was paid for this property. James Sargent had but little property, and he and his wife were old, with but little understanding! of business methods. Preston Sargent was not an educated man, but knew that he got out of the sale nearly one-half the funds, but how he obtained it whether as a gift, a loan, or for what purpose, is not satisfactorily shown.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b134-9\" pgmap=\"134\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b134-10\" pgmap=\"134\">1.
