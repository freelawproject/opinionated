M. Triner testified on behalf of defendant that two or three days after the contract had been signed, the said de Montpellier called him on the telephone and stated that the paper that had been pasted on the back containing the special agreements between the parties had become lost, and that he had written on the face of the printed form of contract the substance of the special agreements entered into; that he was the editorial writer and would see that these extra conditions agreed upon were fulfilled, and requested that he make no mention thereof to his principal. Triner testified that he acquiesced in the suggestion made by the representative of the plaintiff; that the contract offered in evidence contained his signature; that it was the contract he signed, save the writing in the margin, and save that the paper containing the extra conditions was not pasted on the back. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony showed that the contract set forth in the statement of claim and offered in evidence was the contract it had received from its representative, de Montpelier, and which it had accepted on July 3, 1907, and under which the advertising had been printed in its publication.</p><headnotes data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-10\" pgmap=\"452\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-11\" pgmap=\"452(65) 453(48)\">1. Estoppel, \u00a7 65<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when contracting party estopped by silence to insist upon conditions. A person who enters into a contract for advertising is estopped to claim that the contract sued on is not the contract entered into where, shortly after the signing of such contract and upon hearing from the representative of the advertising concern that a supplement to the contract containing certain conditions insisted upon by the buyer had been lost, he simply relied upon a statement of such representative that the conditions had been written on the main contract, and that he would see that they would be fulfilled, and made no complaint to the seller, at such representative\u2019s request.</headnotes><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\" pgmap=\"452\">The following instruction for the plaintiff was refused :</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-6\" pgmap=\"452\">\u201cYou are instructed that if you find from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s manager, Mr. Triner, signed an order at the solicitation of the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, and that said solicitor had no authority from the plaintiff to make a contract but only to solicit orders, and that the order contained the clause\u2014\u2018It is clearly understood that the conditions above and herein set forth embody all agreements and understandings concerning the present contract made or had with the principal, its agents or employees acting on its behalf either written or verbal \u2019\u2014and that a copy of the contract containing such clause was thereafter delivered to defendant and received by it, then the defendant is es-topped from setting up as against the plaintiff, after said order has been accepted and filled (if you find it has been accepted and filled) any other agreements or representations not embodied in said written order, unless there was fraud on the part of the solicitor in securing the signing and execution of said order.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-7\" pgmap=\"452\">Cratty Bros. &amp; Flateau and Charles Hudson, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-8\" pgmap=\"452\">No appearance for defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b452-12\" pgmap=\"452\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

Evidence, \u00a7 352<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when parol evidence admissible to explain contract. A contract for advertising held ambiguous so as to authorize the admission of parol testimony to interpret its language.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b453-5\" pgmap=\"453\">3. Witnesses, \u00a7 327<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what proper as affecting credibility. Evidence that a witness for the defendant in an action on a written contract for advertising, the defense being that there were certain conditions which were pasted on the contract, and that they had not been fulfilled, testified at a former trial that the conditions were written on a card and pinned on the contract, is admissible as affecting the credibility of the witness.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b453-6\" pgmap=\"453\">4. Witnesses, \u00a7 325<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when prior statements admissible as affecting credibility. In an action upon a written contract for advertising, in which the defense is that there were certain conditions pasted on the contract, and that such conditions had not been fulfilled, such supplement having been lost, evidence that a witness for the defendant just before a prior trial of the case, in the presence of his counsel, stated to plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the added provisions were in fact written on a card attached to the contract, is admissible as affecting the credibility of the witness.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b453-7\" pgmap=\"453\">5. Witnesses, \u00a7 257<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what proper as affecting credibility. In an action by an advertising concern on an account for advertising, where a witness for defendant testified that plaintiff had agreed to furnish a Spanish editorial and to furnish stereotype plates for a period of one year and had failed- to do so, held that as affecting the credibility of such witness, evidence was admissible to show that the defendant had himself furnished material for copy for the advertisement for three months, and that thereafter no further material was furnished by defendant but plaintiff continued the insertion for the balance of the period as he claimed the right to do according to the contract.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b453-8\" pgmap=\"453\">6. Trial, \u00a7 128<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when refusal to permit counsel to comment on evidence erroneous. The refusal of a court to permit counsel for one party to comment in his argument on a letter which has been admitted in evidence by the adverse party, and which will support the first party\u2019s claim, is reversible error, although the court has allowed such first party to simply read the same to the jury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b453-9\" pgmap=\"453(21) 454(46)\">7. Principal and agent\u00a1 \u00a7 249<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction on effect of admission correct. An instruction that \u201cthe admissions of a solicitor or other agent of a principal are not binding on the principal unless the admissions are within the scope of the agent\u2019s authority and are made with reference to the subject-matter of his agency and at the time of the transactions between the parties,\u201d approved.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b454-5\" pgmap=\"454\">8. Estoppel, \u00a7 65<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction correct. An instruction in an action on an advertising contract, the defense being that certain conditions had been added to a supplement to the contract which had been lost, and that such conditions had not been fulfilled; that if the jury believed the plaintiff\u2019s agent had authority only to solicit orders and not to make a contract, and that a copy of the contract containing a clause that the contract contained all the terms thereof had been delivered to defendant, the latter was estopped, after the filing of the order by plaintiff, from setting up any other terms not embodied in the order, in the absence of fraud,, approved.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
