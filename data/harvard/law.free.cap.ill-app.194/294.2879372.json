Kuglin and Louis Bernstein, to recover the value of .coal sold to the defendants in 1911. Before the trial the Central Trust Company of Illinois, as receiver in bankruptcy for the Carterville company, was substituted as party plaintiff. Upon the trial a. verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff for $270, and from the judgment entered thereon, the defendant sued out a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-3\" pgmap=\"317\">. The defense was that the Carterville company did not deliver the kind of coal contracted for, but delivered an inferior grade of much less value. The' only question raised was that the verdict was a compromise. The evidence showed that there was a written contract by which the Carterville company agreed to sell and deliver to defendants their \u201crequirements, estimated at 1,000 tons\u201d of Berwind-Whites Pocahontas run of mine coal between July 18, 1912, and March 31, 1913, at $3.85 per ton, deliveries to be made in such quantities as might be ordered from time to time, the price being based on a freight rate of $2.05 per ton from mines to seller\u2019s yard to advance or decline as the rate might fluctuate; that up to September 1, 1912, the Carterville company delivered to the defandants coal of the kind and character prescribed by the contract, which was paid for at the contract rate. The dispute between the parties arose out of the delivery of ninety tons of coal during October and November, 1912. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove that in September, 1912, one of the defendants complained that the coal furnished prior to that time was not good coal; that he instructed the plaintiff to send \u201cBlue Valley\u201d or \u201cBluefields\u201d Pocahontas coal instead of BerwindWhites Pocahontas; that the ninety tons in question were furnished in pursuance of this order or direction; that such coal was of the grade ordered, and that its value was $4 a ton. The defendants and an engineer in their employ testified that the coal so delivered was not Pocahontas coal, but \u201clooked like Screenings,\u201d and was in fact, of the grade known as' \u201cNo. 5 washed nut,\u201d worth $1.75 to $2.per ton. The defendants admitted that they did not know where the ninety tons of coal in question came from, or the cost-of transporting such coal from the mines in West Virginia to Chicago.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-4\" pgmap=\"317\">Edward J.
