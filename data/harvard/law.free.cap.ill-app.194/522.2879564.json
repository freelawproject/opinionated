Vossler against George Earle and \"William Earle, copartners as George &amp; William Earle, to recover commissions on the sale of four tracts of land situated in Gary, Indiana, which sale was alleged to have been negotiated by Vossler. Plaintiff was a real estate broker doing business in Gary, and the evidence showed that he found a purchaser for the land, told him who the owners were and later took the purchaser to the office of the defendants in Chicago, where a contract in writing for the sale of the land for $120,000 was entered into. Later the contract was modified, and still later the land was conveyed to the purchaser. Plaintiff recovered a judgment for $6,000, and defendants appealed.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b545-7\" pgmap=\"545\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3r\" pgmap=\"545\">1. Brokers, \u00a7 7<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when contract to pay commissions implied. In an action by a broker for commissions for selling real estate, where the evidence showed that the principals by their conduct approved the agency of the broker, and that such broker was not a volunteer, a contract to pay commissions was implied if the sale was afterwards consummated through the broker\u2019s efforts.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3oP\" pgmap=\"545\">2. Brokers, \u00a7 5<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when license necessary. The fact that an agent negotiated a sale of land in another State at the home of the owner in Chicago did not make him a broker within the meaning of an ordinance requiring brokers to have licenses, there being no evidence that such agent was carrying on the business of broker in such city.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AfF\" pgmap=\"545\">3.
