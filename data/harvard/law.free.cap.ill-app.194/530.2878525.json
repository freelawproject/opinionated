The action was replevin, to recover possession of part of goods covered by a chattel mortgage given to plaintiff by one George Fabian, and acknowledged on the behalf of Fabian by one D. W. Fishell, as attorney in fact. The note secured by the mortgage was overdue, and unpaid in part. The defendant was a bona fide purchaser from the mortgagor, for value, of the goods in question, which were taken from her by the plaintiff, and was not a party to either note or mortgage.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b553-7\" pgmap=\"553\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b553-8\" pgmap=\"553\">1. Chattel mortgages, \u00a7 48<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when invalid against third persons. While a chattel mortgage not acknowledged as required by the statute may be good as between the parties, it is invalid as against a bona fide purchaser, for value, of the mortgaged property, who may set up its invalidity in defense.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b553-9\" pgmap=\"553\">2. Chattel mortgages, \u00a7 55<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014who must acknowledge. The Chattel Mortgage Act (Rev. St., ch. 95, sec. 3, J. &amp; A. (Hf 7576 et seq.), requiring a chattel mortgage to be acknowledged by the mortgagor, is not complied with where such mortgage is acknowledged by the attorney in fact of the mortgagor.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b553-10\" pgmap=\"553\">3. Chattel mortgages, \u00a7 85<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is effect of defective execution. A chattel mortgage, not executed as provided by the statute, confers no right on the mortgagee to take the mortgaged property from the possession of a bona fide purchaser for value, claiming under a transfer from the mortgagor.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b553-11\" pgmap=\"553\">4.

Chattel mortgages, \u00a7 195<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when inadmissible in evidence. In an action of replevin to recover part of the goods covered by a chattel mortgage from a bona fide purchaser from the mortgagor, for value, held error to admit the mortgage in evidence, where it appeared that the mortgage had been acknowledged by the attorney in fact of the mortgagor.</headnotes><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-3\" pgmap=\"553\">At the trial in the Municipal Court, the court admitted the mortgage in evidence against the objection of the defendant, and at the close of the evidence denied a motion by her to strike it from the record as not legally executed. On motion of the plaintiff, the court directed a verdict in its favor for one cent damages, and after overruling motions in arrest of judgment, and for a new trial, entered judgment on the verdict.
