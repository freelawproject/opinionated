Schmidt and'Camillo Marcuceilli to recover a mechanic\u2019s lien. Schmidt was a contractor for certain work in connection with a building being erected for Marcuceilli, and the plaintiff was a subcontractor who furnished Schmidt materials to be used in connection with the building. On a trial without a jury the issues were found for the plaintiff and its damages assessed in the sum of and judgment entered for $93.80 and costs, and a lien on the premises decreed, from which the defendant Gamillo Marcuceilli prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-8\" pgmap=\"469(120) 470(136)\">The single controverted question of fact was the time when the subcontractor\u2019s notice was served on the defendant Marcuceilli, the service being conceded but the date disputed. The last day on which the notice could have been served was January 2, 1914. Mr. Halleman, secretary and treasurer of the plaintiff company, testified that on that day about 6:45 p. m. he served the necessary notice on Marcuceilli at his home, that he made a memorandum of this fact upon the notice; that prior to that day he called Marcuceilli\u2019s attention to the amount due and stated that unless it was paid by January 2nd he would have to serve a lien notice. Marcuceilli, in addition to his own testimony, offered the evidence of two other witnesses who he claimed were present when the notice was served. Marcuccilli stated that the notice was served January 9th or 10th, and that after keeping the notice in his possession for two or three days, he handed it to his bookkeeper; that he fixed the date because it was four or five days after he had reopened his ice cream cone factory, about January 5th. Marcuccilli further stated that he told Halleman when he served the notice that the money had already been paid to Schmidt, and that he was not liable therefor. The two other witnesses for Marcuccilli testified that the notice was served about the 9th or 10th of January, and they fixed the date by reference to the opening of the ice cream cone factory.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b470-8\" pgmap=\"470\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJ9\" pgmap=\"470\">1. Evidence, \u00a7 475<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when province of court to determine where preponderance lies. It is the province of a court sitting without a jury to weigh and consider conflicting evidence and to determine where the preponderance lies; and in doing so to take into consideration the intelligence, fairness and means of information of the witnesses, their appearance and demeanor on the stand, and their interest in the suit and relationship to the parties, together with any and all circumstances attendant upon the giving of their testimony.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A7_\" pgmap=\"470\">2.

A decree granting a subcontractor a mechanic\u2019s lien will not be disturbed, where the question whether notice thereof was given in the proper time rested on conflicting testimony, and the court trying the case without a jury accepted that of the plaintiff instead of that of the defendant although the latter was sustained by the greater number of witnesses.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b470-5\" pgmap=\"470\">William A.
