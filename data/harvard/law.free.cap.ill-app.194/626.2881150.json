In an action to recover for the refusal to purchase and accept deliveries of beer under a written contract, evidence held insufficient to show that the beer was of unmerchantable quality, it appearing from the evidence that defendant\u2019s reason for refusing performance of the contract was that he had sold out his saloon, and it also appearing from defendant\u2019s testimony that he was satisfied with the beer both as to price and quality.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
