Byrnes, as administrator of the estate of Daniel Byrnes, deceased, against Solomon Zemoan for attorney\u2019s fees alleged to have been earned by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. The defendant filed an affidavit of merits, stating that the services had been paid for during the lifetime of the deceased, and also that the deceased was indebted to the defendant for money loaned. On May 5, 1914, the case was called for trial in the absence of the defendant and a judgment rendered against him for the amount claimed. The next day the defendant moved to vacate the judgment and, in support of his motion, filed several affidavits, showing that defendant had a meritorious defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim; and also stating, in substance, that before the opening of court on the day the judgment was rendered, the defendant and a man from the office of the defendant\u2019s attorney went to the court room and told the clerk of the court that defendant\u2019s attorney was actually engaged in the trial of a case in another court of record and would be so engaged all that day. The affidavits also showed that defendant\u2019s attorney was in fact so engaged all that day. The defendant asked the clerk whether it would be necessary for him to remain, to which the clerk replied in the negative, saying that the case would be passed if reached for trial on that day. The motion to vacate was denied and the defendant brings error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b364-8\" pgmap=\"364\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b364-9\" pgmap=\"364(36) 365(81)\">Judgment, \u00a7 2&amp;&amp;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014w7ien vacated because of absence of defendant and Ms counsel.
