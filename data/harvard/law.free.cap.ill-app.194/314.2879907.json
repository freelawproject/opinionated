Patents, \u00a7 34<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014who has burden of showing in action for royalties, impracticability or unprofitableness of manufacture. Whenever it becomes material to the defense of an action for an accounting for royalties to show that it was impracticable or unprofitable to manufacture under a license, the burden is on the licensee to establish such claim.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b337-6\" pgmap=\"337\">3. Patents, \u00a7 30<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when action to cancel license constitutes rescission. The filing of a bill by a licensor to cancel a license to manufacture a patented article, if acquiesced in by the licensee, constitutes an election to rescind.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b337-7\" pgmap=\"337\">4. Patents, \u00a7 30<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when licensee liable for royalties accruing after suit to cancel license. Where a licensee, on the filing of a bill by the licensor for the cancellation of a license to manufacture a patented article under a license, denies the licensor\u2019s right to rescind, and asserts that the license is in full force and effect, and continues to manufacture thereunder for a year and a half before expressly assenting to a cancellation, held that the licensee could not complain of a decree requiring him to account for royalties up to the time of assenting to the cancellation.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b337-8\" pgmap=\"337\">5. Patents, \u00a7 30<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verbal cancellation of license not shown.

Patents, \u00a7 34<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when action for cancellation of license will not defeat right to royalties subsequently accruing. The filing of a bill for the cancellation of a license to manufacture a patented article and to recover royalties does not deprive the licensor of the right to an accounting for royalties accruing until the actual cancellation of the license by decree or formal assent of the licensee.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b337-10\" pgmap=\"337\">7. Interest, \u00a7 23<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when interest recoverable for nonpayment of royalties under license.

Damages, \u00a7 67<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when royalties accruing after cancellation of license recoverable. Where on the filing of a bill for an accounting for royalties, and for the cancellation of a license to manufacture a patented article, the licensee asserts the continuance of the license until more than a year after the filing of the bill, when he formally assented to its rescission, held that the licensor could not recover royalties or an agreed compensation as superintendent for the licensee, which accrued subsequently to the latter\u2019s assent to the cancellation.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
