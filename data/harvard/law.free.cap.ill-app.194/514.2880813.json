Larceny, \u00a7 25<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when description of money insufficient. An information which charges defendant with the larceny of a pocketbook, and also with the larceny of money, without describing the money further than by stating its amount, and without alleging that the description is unknown, is defective in so far as it charges larceny of the money, and must be regarded as charging merely larceny of the pocketbook.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b537-8\" pgmap=\"537\">2.
