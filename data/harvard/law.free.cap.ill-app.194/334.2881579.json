S. Watson, the \u201csuperintendent of the western claim department\u201d of the defendant company. The plaintiff testified that on November 17,1913, as a result of such negotiations, Watson offered, on behalf of the indemnity company, to pay him $875 in settlement of his claim, and that he then and there accepted the offer. Watson testified that he never offered the plaintiff more than $750; that he intimated the company might pay $875, but that plaintiff demanded $1,000, and that no agreement was reached. No suit against Mollner was brought by the plaintiff, and a few days after the one-year-statute of limitations had run, Watson called the plaintiff by telephone and told him that as no suit had been brought within a year, the company withdrew its offer and declined to pay anything. Thereupon, this suit was brought to recover the amount which the plaintiff claimed the defendant agreed to pay.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-5\" pgmap=\"357\">Zimmerman, Myers and Garrett, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-7\" pgmap=\"358\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-8\" pgmap=\"358\">1.
