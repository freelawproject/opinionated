Judgment was rendered for the defendant, and the plaintiff brings error.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\" pgmap=\"365(129) 366(96)\">The evidence showed that while the property in question was listed with the plaintiff, he was not the exclusive agent, but that other brokers were also endeavoring to effect a sale; that in February, 1914, the property was sold by the defendant to Mr. and Mrs. John Polcyn jointly. The defendant testified that the sale was made \u201cfrom the outside,\u201d meaning through brokers other than the plaintiff; that in January, 1914, an employee of the plaintiff took Mrs. Polcyn to see defendant\u2019s property, but they did not at that time see the defendant; that the plaintiff then notified the defendant personally and by two letters, one in English and the other in Polish, that the property had been submitted to Mrs. Polcyn. One of the letters stated that the plaintiff showed Mrs. Polcyn only the \u201coutside\u201d of the property, and that she \u201crefused to step inside.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s employee testified that Mrs Polcyn told him she had seen the property before, and the defendant testified that Mrs. Polcyn had been introduced to her by another real estate man in December, 1913. There was no evidence tending to prove that the visit of Mrs. Polcyn to defendant\u2019s premises, in company with the plaintiff\u2019s employee, either brought about or had anything to do with bringing about the sale that was finally made.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-8\" pgmap=\"366\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A2B\" pgmap=\"366\">1.

Where real estate was listed with several brokers, one of them cannot recover compensation if it does not appear that he was the first to call the purchaser\u2019s attention to the property, or that his efforts contributed to the consummation of the sale.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AFIT\" pgmap=\"366\">2.

A broker cannot recover compensation for a sale of real estate by a client to Mr. and Mrs. John Polcyn jointly, upon an averment of a sale to John Polcyn, a purchaser procured by the plaintiff, where the evidence did not show that the latter ever introduced the purchaser to the defendant, or that Mrs. Polcyn, to whom the plaintiff showed the property, acted as her husband\u2019s agent.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AKn\" pgmap=\"366\">3.
