Hunter and John Doe, trading as O. L. Hunter &amp; Company, defendants, to recover on a contract for the sale of grain. The contract was for prompt shipment on shipping orders to be given by defendants. The contract contained an option, which was reserved to the plaintiff, that \u201cat the end of the contract time * * * the seller shall have the right * * * (3) to continue the contract, without notice, for thirty days with a carrying charge.\u201d A resale was made more than thirty days after a reasonable time had expired wherein defendants might have given shipping instructions, of which resale no notice was given to defendants. Plaintiff constantly pressed defendants by letters and telegrams, for shipping instructions, to which defendants paid no attention. The judgment was for the difference between the contract price and the amount realized on the resale, with carrying charges and commissions added. To reverse a judgment for plaintiff, defendants prosecute this writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-8\" pgmap=\"565\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-9\" pgmap=\"565\">1.
