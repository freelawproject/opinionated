Defendant Joyner filed a plea of the general issue and notice of the special defense that he was not the owner or in control of the premises mentioned in the declaration, or in possesion or control of the premises in which the defendants or either of them conducted a dramshop. The court entered an order finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration did not state a cause of action, and gave leave to file an amended one; and also ordered that the demurrers stand as demurrers to the amended declaration.
