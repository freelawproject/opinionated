Id. a prosecution wherein defendant was charged with permitting his property to be used as a house of ill-fame or assignation, in violation of an ordinance, where it appeared that the property in question was occupied by lessees of defendant, held reversible error to overrule defendant\u2019s objection to language of the prosecuting attorney in his closing argument to the jury, representing defendant as a rich man who received the profits of vice, while pretending to be respectable, and who in order to prevent conviction and to preserve his respectability made a defense which cast discredit on a preacher who was doing a great work, it appearing that the court did not rebuke counsel for his language.</headnotes><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\" pgmap=\"613\">In his closing argument the prosecuting attorney said:</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\" pgmap=\"613\">\u201cThe only purpose of the defense in this case has been to assassinate the character of a high minded preacher who is engaged in doing a great work, to make this earth the same kind of a place we want it to be in heaven; and they do that in order to save themselves the humility of being fined by this jury, so that it cannot be said that he is not a respectable man. He parades around in his riches as a great man, as a man of honor, a respectable citizen, and he makes his money how? * * * I will tell you how he gets a part of it, and whether he gets it directly or indirectly has absolutely nothing to do with this case. * * * We have not investigated yet; we have not got complaints from other parts of town. In other parts of town the preachers are not as aggressive unfortunately. If they were, we would find out some more about this man, and we would Imow where he gets some of his money. * * * He gets it out of those prostitutes up there in that hotel who are compelled to sell their souls and their bodies in order to put gold into his coffers. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\" pgmap=\"613\">These remarks were duly objected to, but the objection was overruled and the remarks and ruling were excepted to, whereupon the attorney made further remarks of the same nature.</p><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b613-7\" pgmap=\"613\">Childs &amp; Childs, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b613-8\" pgmap=\"613\">John W.
