From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-8\" pgmap=\"341(215) 342(255)\">The truck originally belonged to one Theodore W. Jones, and was sold by him to the plaintiff. Jones afterwards married the plaintiff, and they went to Kansas to live. Just prior to their leaving Illinois, in December, 1907, the truck was stored with the defendant, who issued its warehouse receipt for the same, in the name of M. M. Thomas, although the actual delivery of the truck to the defendant was made by Jones. Jones and his wife were divorced (or the marriage between them annulled) in 1908. Defendant sent monthly statements of the storage charges to M. M. Thomas at Topeka, Kansas, for about a year; and during that year, Jones wrote the defendant several letters, requesting and purporting to authorize the defendant to sell the truck. On December 16, 1908, the defendant wrote to Jones saying: \u201cWe have at last succeeded in closing deal for your automobile truck on the lines previously written you, viz., to net you $400,\u201d and requested him to \u201cplease send in the warehouse receipt which was outstanding in the name of M. M. Thomas\u201d and a bill of sale \u201cmade out to us or the International Automobile Co.\u201d; and in answer to this letter, Jones wrote from Denver, Colorado, that the warehouse receipt was at a certain street number in Topeka, Kansas (which was the plaintiff\u2019s address, as shown by defendant\u2019s bill to her for storage charges); that this house was closed because of his absence and because of the absence of M. M. Thomas, who was in Baltimore, Md., at\u2019 the bedside of a sick sister, and suggested that defendant go on and make the sale just as if the car was his own property, and promised that on his return to Topeka, the warehouse receipt would be mailed to him. On January 5, 1909, defendant wrote to Jones that it was \u201cholding check for $400,\u201d which it would forward upon receiving the warehouse receipt for cancellation, \u201cas we do not care to deliver said truck without cancellation of this receipt.\u201d The warehouse receipt was\" never delivered by Jones. During 1909, and part of 1910, defendant used the truck as its own property, and it was finally \u201cburned up\u201d in a fire in defendant\u2019s machine shop occurring some time in 1910. In November, 1911, defendant paid $400 to Jones for the truck and received from him a bill of sale, and an affidavit that he was the owner of the truck. Defendant knew the plaintiff, who had previously stored some of her furniture in its warehouse, and in 1912, she presented the warehouse receipt and made a demand upon the defendant for the truck, and when it was not forthcoming, brought this suit to recover its value.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-5\" pgmap=\"342\">The defendant took the position that if Jones was not the real owner of that truck, he was at least the agent of the plaintiff, who had actual possession of the truck and the \u201capparent power of disposition,\u201d and that in buying the truck from him, the defendant was in the position of an innocent party who was misled, through the fault of the plaintiff.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-6\" pgmap=\"342\">Robert W.

One who issues a warehouse receipt to a married woman with whom he is well acquainted and to whom he sends monthly bills for storage charges to another city, where she was then residing, for a period of one year is estopped from asserting that such person was not the owner, although the husband of such person who had been divorced or had had the marriage annulled had repeatedly written the owner of the warehouse that he had authority to sell and urged the sale of the property, but was unable to produce the warehouse receipt even after the lapse of three years, because of the alleged absence of his wife.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A_h\" pgmap=\"343\">2.
