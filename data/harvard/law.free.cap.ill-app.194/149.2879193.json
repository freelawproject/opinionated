Page, the owner of a livery stock including an automobile, a gasoline engine and lighting outfit, and some other articles, sold the same to C. E. Wilson for $2,000, he giving in part payment his note for $1,025 due April 1,1913, secured by a chattel mortgage on the livery outfit. On March 29, 1913, Wilson took up this note by executing a judgment note to Mrs. Page for $1,045.95 due ninety days after date, and also secured such note by chattel mortgage on the livery stock, which mortgage was duly acknowledged and recorded on April 5, 1913. On April 2, 1913, C. N. Cruse, a brother-in-law of Wilson, signed a note with him as his surety for $250, payable to the Ramsey Bank, and Wilson gave him a second mortgage on the livery stock for $600 to protect him. When the renewal mortgage matured, there being then due and unpaid upon it the sum of $1,060, Mrs. Page obtained a bill of sale from Wilson for the property named in the mortgage; and an arrangement was made that Wilson should hold the property for her use and keep account of the business done by him. It was also arranged that Wilson might sell the property if he could do so, and if anything was left after paying Page\u2019s indebtedness, he was to have it. Shortly afterwards, Wilson secured W. R. Wright to assist him in trying to dispose of the stock, and through this action Wright became acquainted with the manner in which Wilson was holding the stock; and on learning that the bill of sale was not recorded, informed Wilson that the lien was invalid, and offered to buy the property of him. Cruse, with Wilson\u2019s consent, turned over the $600 mortgage to Wright who then paid off Wilson\u2019s note to the bank for $250, upon which Cruse was surety, and certain other notes owed by Wilson, amounting in all to $855; and thereupon Wilson gave him possession of the mortgaged property. Afterwards Wright sold the automobile for $150, and the livfery stock proper to Lee and Gilbert for $1,000, leaving the gasoline engine, lighting plant and oil tank, valued at $300, on hand.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-10\" pgmap=\"172\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-11\" pgmap=\"172(78) 173(85)\">Fraudulent conveyances, \u00a7 308<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when ptirchaser in violation of Bulk Sales Law liable to personal judgment.
