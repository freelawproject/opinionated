H. Hostettler against Asa Mushrush and Henry Paddick, school directors of district number sixty-eight of the county of Lawrence and State of Illinois, for damages for a breach of contract of hiring. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-11\" pgmap=\"80(134) 81(186)\">This district had constructed a schoolhouse of two rooms and prior to the year 1913 had employed two teachers. Sometime during the month of June, 1913, plaintiff made application to the directors for position as teacher. After his application was received a meeting of the directors was held in the district, the time of which meeting is a matter of dispute. All the directors were present, and no other person except plaintiff and directors were present. Plaintiff contended that he was hired by the board as principal to teach only the advance grades. The two directors named as defendants contended he was hired to teach the entire school. The amount to be paid was $82.50 per month, and plaintiff was to do his own janitor work for a term of five or six months. The minutes of this meeting were not written until shortly thereafter, and no written contract at that time was made and signed. Plaintiff contended that the meeting was on the l\u00e1th day of June, 1913. Defendants claimed that the meeting was on the 17th day of June, 1913; that afterwards in July, 1913, the hoard met and approved the minutes; that plaintiff was not present at this meeting; that about September 2, 1913, the board and plaintiff again met, when the dispute was as to whether plaintiff was hired as principal and to teach the advance grades, or whether he was employed to teach the entire school. The defendants contended for the latter and the plaintiff and one director contended for the former, as the contract. This dispute continued from that time to September 22, 1913, without an agreement being reached. Another teacher was employed after plaintiff had refused to enter into the contract contended for by two of the directors, and defendants, refused to receive and accept the services of plaintiff as contended for by him.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\" pgmap=\"81(166) 82(30)\">The issues of fact were whether plaintiff was employed by defendants to teach as principal the higher grades, or was he employed to teach the entire school. Evidence was offered on this issue; plaintiff and Director Mills for the first proposition, and the defendants for the second proposition. The court refused to admit in evidence the letter of Miss Weaver, a witness for plaintiff and an applicant for teacher in the primary room., Miss Weaver had testified to a conversation at the home of Mrs. Diddle with Henry Paddick in which she said that Mrs. Diddle said that she heard that he had hired Mr. Hostettler for the advanced room, and he said, \u201cYes, I think we have done well,\u201d etc. Mr. Paddick denied that he told Mrs. Diddle they had hired a principal and, as tending to corroborate his statement, as to what occurred and to discredit the evidence of Miss Weaver, produced and offered in evidence a letter from Miss Weaver to him of date July 17,1913, and identified by witness Weaver, a letter written and received after this meeting at the Liddle home, which letter is, in substance, as follows :</p><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b82-16\" pgmap=\"82\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b82-17\" pgmap=\"82\">1.
