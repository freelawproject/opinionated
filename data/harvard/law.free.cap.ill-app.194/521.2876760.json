Fish against William H. Fish for a rule to show cause why defendant should not be attached for contempt because of his failure to comply with a divorce decree requiring him to pay $12 per month for the support and education of their child. A motion of defendant to dismiss the rule was denied and he then filed his answer. A hearing was had and a decree entered that $384 was due to complainant, that defendant was in contempt of court and that he be arrested and placed in the county jail until the sum was paid, or he was otherwise released by due process of law, but that his imprisonment should not exceed six months. Defendant appealed, but his appeal was not perfected and was afterwards dismissed with an order that procedendo issue. On filing a copy of the order, the sheriff attached the defendant and he sued out this writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-8\" pgmap=\"543\">W. H.
