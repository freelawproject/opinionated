J. Simer, administrator of the estate of Charles W. Simer, deceased, against Earl Hults. .From a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-12\" pgmap=\"262(64) 263(236)\">Defendant claimed to have purchased from Charles W. Simer, plaintiff\u2019s intestate, in his lifetime, the property in dispute, consisting of live stock, farming tools, hay and grain. Defendant was an unmarried man who lived with the deceased, his brother-in-law, both farming and working together. Defendant sought to establish his ownership of the property by showing that from time to time Simer borrowed different sums of money from him and gave notes therefor; that on July 16, 1910, the total amount of these notes was $1,850, and that one note was then given by Simer for the whole amount; that afterwards Simer borrowed an additional amount and gave defendant a note for $335; that in the fall of 1911, after the large note was due, deceased sold and transferred the property in question to defendant, and, in payment therefor, defendant delivered up to him the $1,850 note; that thereafter and until the death of Mr. Simer, defendant lived with him and held possession of the property on the premises. The property in dispute was not inventoried by the administrator, nor did it appear to have been claimed by him as part of the estate until about the time this suit was brought. Defendant attempted to prove the existence of the $1,850 note by the testimony of a brother and the latter\u2019s wife, to the effect that a note for that amount, signed by the deceased, payable to defendant, was left by defendant in their possession in 1911, and that afterwards, during the lifetime of Simer, defendant got the note; that the note was attached to a stub which was introduced in evidence, and that the stub bore a correct description of the note left in their possession and later taken away by defendant.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\" pgmap=\"263\">An instruction given for plaintiff told the jury: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence in this ease that Charles W. Simer, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, had in his lifetime purchased or raised or became the owner of the property in question, and if you further believe from the evidence that he had the property in question in his possession at the time of his death, then such possession is prima facie evidence of the title of the property in Charles W. Simer at the time of his death and in his administrator after his death.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-6\" pgmap=\"263\">Noleman &amp; Smith and Earl C.
