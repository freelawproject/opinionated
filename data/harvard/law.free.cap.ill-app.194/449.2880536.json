Tolman &amp; Company to recover $58.15, alleged to be due for the sale of fifty cases of Gold Medal corn flakes at $1.60 per case. The defendant in its affidavit of merits admitted that it purchased and received such merchandise, but denied that it was indebted to the plaintiff in any amount for the same, and alleged that there had been a complete accord and satisfaction of the claim of the plaintiff. The case was tried before the court without a jury and the plaintiff\u2019s damages were assessed and judgment entered thereon for $58.15, from which the defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-8\" pgmap=\"471(131) 472(115)\">The facts in the case were that prior to the transaction in question, the Cooked Boiled Oats Company, a corporation, had become indebted to the defendant in the sum of $13.15, and the George B. Walker Company, a partnership (George B. Walker being' one of the partners in the same), had also become indebted to the defendant in the sum of $50, \u201cfor the benefit of the said Cooked Boiled Oats Company.\u201d Early in February, 1912, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, the said George B. Walker, called on the defendant for the purpose of selling it a certain brand of corn flakes called \u201cGold Medal\u201d corn flakes, which had previously been manufactured by the Cooked Boiled Oats Company. The defendant refused to buy any of such com flakes from the plaintiff unless it assumed the amounts due to the defendant from the Cooked Boiled Oats Company and the George B. Walker Company. Thereafter, Walker called on the defendant and stated that he was authorized by the plaintiff to make arrangements with the defendant whereby the plaintiff would allow the defendant credit for the items of $13.15 and $50 on its purchases of Gold Medal com flakes if the defendant would buy its trade requirements of the flakes from the plaintiff. The defendant accepted this proposition and at once gave Walker an order for fifty cases of the flakes at $1.60 per case, and received the same in accordance with such agreement.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\" pgmap=\"472\">Walker testified that the contract he made with the defendant was in accordance with instructions that he received from the general manager of the plaintiff company. After the transaction in question, the defendant gave the plaintiff a second order for flakes, but this order was filled by Walker through another firm, as the plaintiff company had become bankrupt and had gone out of business. On February 22, 1912, the defendant sent to the plaintiff its check for $14.52, together with the following letter and statement:</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\" pgmap=\"472\">Chicago, Feb. 22,1912.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Akp\" pgmap=\"472\">\u201cThe Lockport Corn Flakes Co.,</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-7\" pgmap=\"472\">Chicago, Ill.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-8\" pgmap=\"472\">Dear Sir:</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-9\" pgmap=\"472\">We enclose herewith our check' for $14.52 in payment for the following invoices.

If this is not your understanding we would like a letter from you explaining just what you understand the agreement to be with Mr. Walker. We are anxious to get this matter straightened out.\u201d The defendant replied to the above letter on April 4,1912, stating in effect that its understanding of the arrangement was as indicated by the letter and statement of February 22, 1912, and that it had no other understanding with Mr. Walker in reference to the matter. The plaintiff retained the check of the defendant until after the receipt by it of the defendant\u2019s letter of April 4th, when it deposited the check in its bank and the same was paid. The plaintiff never answered defendant\u2019s letter of April 4th.</p><headnotes data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b473-7\" pgmap=\"473\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b473-8\" pgmap=\"473(38) 474(101)\">1.
