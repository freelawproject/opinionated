Hoover, a physician, against Mrs. Ida Buckman to recover a balance of $153, for services rendered in the treatment of the defendant\u2019s eight-year-old child. Upon trial before the court a finding was entered against the plaintiff as to the amount claimed by him, and against the defendant as to her claim of set-off, and a judgment was entered in favor of the defendant for costs. The plaintiff sued out a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\" pgmap=\"330(157) 331(113)\">It appeared, without contradiction, that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant to treat her child; that the child was suffering from tonsilitis; that after treating her for several days she was taken to a hospital, where an operation was performed on her tonsils; that the next day the defendant took the child home, and for three days thereafter she played around like other children; that during the night of the third day following the operation, the plaintiff was called to the defendant\u2019s house, and found the child suffering from a high fever, with symptoms of pneumonia; that a nurse was at once engaged, and the plaintiff called several times during the next day and the day following; that on the sixth day following the operation\u2014being the third day of the fever\u2014the plaintiff noticed symptoms of diphtheria; that he at once administered antitoxin, but the child did not improve; that the next day he gave more antitoxin, and then told the defendant the child was suffering from diphtheria; that defendant called in a specialist; that a tube was inserted in the child\u2019s larynx and the next day the operation of tracheotomy was performed with the assistance of another physician called by the plaintiff; that two days later the child died; that the plaintiff rendered an itemized bill to defendant for his services, amounting to $183,- and that defendant made no objection to the bill, but asked for time in which to pay it, and later paid on account of the same, in small amounts, the sum of $30, leaving a balance due the plaintiff of $153.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b331-8\" pgmap=\"331\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b331-9\" pgmap=\"331(22) 332(30)\">1.

Two other physicians testified that the plaintiff\u2019s treatment was the usual and customary treatment in such cases, was \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d and was \u201cthe skillful thing to do under the circumstances.\u201d The defendant and her daughter testified that the plaintiff did not tell them that the child was suffering from diphtheria, but insisted that she did not have that disease, until the next day after the antitoxin was administered, and that he refused to permit them to call another physician. Their testimony was flatly contradicted by the plaintiff.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-5\" pgmap=\"331\">Earl J.
