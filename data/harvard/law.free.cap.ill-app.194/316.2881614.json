If any adverse decision is handed down by any Circuit Court of Appeals, said licensees shall not be obliged to pay guaranty until such decision is reversed by higher court.\u201d It appeared from the evidence that a suit was brought against every person, firm or corporation that was infringing the patent except one concern that went into the hands of receivers; that by agreement between the parties to such suits, one of them was made a test case, and that the test case was pending when this suit was brought. There was evidence that the taking of testimony in the test suit had been delayed somewhat, but there is no evidence that such delay was the fault of the plaintiff.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-5\" pgmap=\"339\">J.
