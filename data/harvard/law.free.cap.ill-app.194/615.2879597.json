In an action to recover for personal injuries caused by being struck by a rapidly moving electric street car, a verdict finding plaintiff not guilty of contributory negligence held not justified by the evidence, where plaintiff\u2019s own testimony shows that at the time of the accident he was not in the exercise of due care for his own safety, as it appears that while on the west side of the street, and seeing such car rapidly approaching, he nevertheless started to cross to the east side of the street, and in so doing attempted to pass in front of such car, although he knew he would be struck by the car unless its speed was checked; and such conduct is not rendered less negligent by other testimony tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s companions, who were standing on the east side of the street near a \u201cstop-ball,\u201d had signaled said car to stop thereat, which said car was bound to do on such signal, in consequence of which plaintiff testified that he expected the speed of said car to \u201cslack up.\u201d</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b638-12\" pgmap=\"638\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
