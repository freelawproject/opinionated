Sheehan, defendant, in the Municipal Court of Chicago, to recover on contract. To reverse a judgment for plaintiff for $330, defendant prosecutes this writ of error. The original action was of the fourth class, in contract, against the defendant, together with one Walter E. Lund and the Merchants Pulverizing Company, a corporation. Defendant Lund was never served, and at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence the court ordered the action dismissed as to the corporation defendant, and that the trial proceed against defendant Sheehan.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-9\" pgmap=\"609(133) 610(21)\">It appeared from the evidence that April 3, 1911, plaintiff gave defendant a written option to purchase certain machinery for \u201cone-tenth interest in a new company.\u201d Plaintiff had previously given such an option to one Fiedler for $1,500. On June 14th, defendant and Lund, as first parties, made a written contract with Fiedler, as second party, wherein first parties agreed, inter alio,, to organize an Illinois corporation, to be known as the Merchants Pulverizing Company, to which second party was to transfer the machinery in consideration of receiving one-tenth of its stock, and this part of the agreement was duly carried out. The fourth clause of the agreement provided that the first parties \u201cwill pay all the money necessary for the purpose of completely setting up and installing the said machinery and pay for all the material necessary to be used in and about the installation of the same. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-5\" pgmap=\"610\">Plaintiff testified, substantially, that shortly after the written option of April 3,1911, was signed, defendant requested plaintiff to do the engineering work in installing the machinery, which he commenced on April 29th, and was engaged thereon for thirty-three days, during the period from April 29th to June 9th; that a fair and reasonable charge for such work was $10 per day; and that while at work installing the machinery defendant visited the premises several times and expressed satisfaction with the progress of the work. Plaintiff also testified that defendant said to plaintiff: \u201cGo ahead and put in the machinery and see that everything is set up. * * * I fix you up and pay you for whatever labor you do and time you lose there.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-6\" pgmap=\"610\">Defendant admitted saying to plaintiff that \u201cwe\u201d would pay expenses of hauling machinery and pay \u201cmillwrights to put up the machinery,\u201d but denied any promise to pay plaintiff for installing it.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\" pgmap=\"610\">The corporation was not fully organized until after plaintiff performed the labor sued for.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\" pgmap=\"610\">On September 18, 1911, under instructions from Sheehan and Lund, representing the corporation, an attorney at law secured a written release from plaintiff to the said corporation of \u201cwhatever right, title or interest, if any, I may have or might claim against or in * * * the goods, chattels and property, * * * now located at the plant of the Merchants Pulverizing Company * * * and delivered, obtained and installed under or pursuant to a certain option dated April 3,1911, and signed by me.\u201d Defendant testified that this release was obtained to \u201cfinish our records.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-10\" pgmap=\"610\">Thompson, Clark &amp; Stevenson, for plaintiff in error; Morton J.
