There was a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $5,000, from which the defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-12\" pgmap=\"222\">The facts are fully shown in the opinion filed on a former appeal. (173 Ill. App. 348.)</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-4\" pgmap=\"223\">Defendant was engaged in extracting syrup from corn, and in preparing the remaining grain for food purposes. A large building, called the mill house, containing a grinding machine or mill, was used, and one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet from the mill was a six story brick elevator. Adjoining the mill house was a fan or cake house containing a large fan, from the top of which an eighteen inch pipe extended to the sixth story of the elevator. When the ground grain had passed through the mill it was conveyed by means of fans through this pipe to the sixth story of the elevator and dropped into a hopper, from whence it was afterwards taken, sacked and prepared for market.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\" pgmap=\"223\">There was an explosion in the sixth story of the elevator which tore off that story of'the building and threw part of the wall upon Samuel Batson, the foreman of the elevator, and fatally injured him.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\" pgmap=\"223\">The evidence was substantially the same as that at the former trial, excepting that a witness for the plaintiff was permitted to give his opinion, as an expert, as to what caused the explosion. He testified that he had had experience in general repairing and building machines in different places; that he had worked for the defendant about three years; the first year as a machinist, afterwards as foreman, his duties being to look after repairing of machinery in the buildings. He was asked: \u201cFrom your experience and observations covering a period of fourteen years, and assuming the facts testified by the witnesses in reference to this explosion are.true, what in your judgment caused the explosion, and where did the fire originate that caused it?\u201d To which the witness answered: \u201cWell, I think it originated\u201d in the feed house. The witness did not himself know where the fire originated, but based his testimony upon facts testified to by witnesses, showing the conditions surrounding the explosion.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-7\" pgmap=\"224\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AAc\" pgmap=\"224\">1.

That an explosion in a grain elevator was caused by fire originating in an adjoining building and carried to it through a grain conveyer, cannot be shown in an action for the death of an employee, by opinion evidence based on testimony showing the surrounding conditions, since such evidence related to a matter of common knowledge.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ALj\" pgmap=\"224\">2.
