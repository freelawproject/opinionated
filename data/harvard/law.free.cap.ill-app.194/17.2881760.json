From a judgment for plaintiff for $1,115.64, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-9\" pgmap=\"39(194) 40(23)\">The declaration consisted of one count and alleged that appellant was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana and engaged in the business of life insurance as a fraternal benefit society in the State of Illinois; that on September 25,1911, it issued to Emma Mansfield, sister of appellee, its contract of insurance, and that in consideration of certain assessments and charges to be paid by the said Emma Mansfield that upon her death and proof thereof appellant should pay to appellee the amount of $1,000. The declaration further averred the death of Emma Mansfield in November, 1911; that appellee furnished proof of said death and demanded payment of the $1,000, which was refused. To this the defendant filed the general issue with notice that it would make certain defenses. On September 15,1911, Emma Mansfield made application to become a member of the order of appellant and on the same day was examined by Doctor Charles E. Greer of Charleston, Illinois, and recommended as a suitable and proper person to become a member of said order, and on September 25, 1911, a certificate of beneficial membership was issued to the said Emma Mansfield and made payable to the appellee upon the death of Emma Mansfield, conditioned upon the payment of regular assessments therein specified.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\" pgmap=\"40(305) 41(14)\">It further appeared from the evidence that Emma Mansfield paid Doctor Greer for the said examination and that the dues and assessments were thereafter paid by appellee until the death of Emma Mansfield, which occurred on November 28, 1911. Thereafter proofs of death were made and appellant refused to pay the certificate on account of false and fraudulent statements claimed to have been made by Emma Mansfield in her application to become a member of this order. It was contended by counsel for appellant that the application contained a clause warranting the statements of the applicant to be true and that the appellee was bound by those statements, whether they were made fraudulently or not, or whether material or not, and that, if untrue in any particular, she would be barred from a recovery. The application signed by Emma Mansfield contained the following clause: \u201cI do hereby agree and warrant as follows: 1. That the statements and answers contained in this application and medical examination to be full, complete and true and were read by me before attaching my signature thereto, and I hereby agree that these statements and warranties together with those hereinafter made to the examining physician in this application and the laws of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur, now in force and that may be hereafter adopted, shall form the basis of this contract for beneficial membership.\u201d Then further on and as a part of such application under paragraph 3 it is further provided: \u201cThat any untrue or fraudulent answers made by me in this application, or any neglect by me to pay any monthly payment, assessment or per capita tax which shall be made by the Supreme Tribe as provided by the laws of the Order, or by the by-laws of the Court to which I belong, shall vitiate my beneficial certificate and forfeit all payments made thereon.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b41-8\" pgmap=\"41\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b41-9\" pgmap=\"41\">1.
