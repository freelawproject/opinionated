He testified that he was a traveling man for the Can-field Manufacturing Company; that it was his duty to place goods on consignment and go around and collect afterwards; that in connection with such duties he carried with him watches, diamonds, etc., which were given away by him as premiums on the collections; that on October 18, 1912, while at Belding, Michigan, on business, he purchased a ticket of the Pere Marquette Railroad for Saranac, Michigan; that the Pere Marquette Railroad runs on to Ionia, where connection is made with the Grand Trunk for Saranac; that the ticket, however, was for a continuous passage; that on said ticket, he checked his suit case to Saranac, and paid the baggage man of the Pere Marquette Railroad ten cents to cover transfer at Ionia from the Pere Marquette to the Grand Trunk railway. Plaintiff testified that he saw his suit case at Ionia on one of the trucks of the Grand Trunk, at the time he changed cars there; that when he arrived at Saranac, he went up town to attend to his business, and on the same evening left Saranac, forgetting his suit case. He left Saranac that same evening for Lowell. The next day, while at Lowell, he said he wrote to the baggage master at Saranac with reference to his suit case. He further testified that the value of the suit case and contents was $107.25. Among the items making up the total, were eight watches valued at $4 each, one diamond ring valued at $4.50, and one diamond stud valued at $4.50, which plaintiff further testified were the property of the Can-field Manufacturing Company, and were carried by him for the purpose of distribution as premiums upon collections made by him.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b377-8\" pgmap=\"377\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b377-9\" pgmap=\"377(21) 378(69)\">1.
