The issues joined were referred to a referee for proofs and conclusion.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-9\" pgmap=\"125\">The plaintiff filed exceptions to the referee\u2019s report, which were sustained as to conclusions, and overruled as to evidence. No exceptions were taken to the court\u2019s findings; and judgment was entered in favor of defendant and against plaintiff for costs. No exception was taken to the judgment. The plaintiff appeals. A bill of exceptions was presented to the trial judge after the time limited for filing it had expired, and as the trial judge refused to sign it, no bill of exceptions was made a part of the record on appeal.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-10\" pgmap=\"125\">The plaintiff contended that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the judgment, and that a bill of exceptions was unnecessary. Also that because of section 68 of chapter 110 of the Practice Act (J. &amp; A. U 8605), when the court in its discretion refers a case to a referee, the action, so far as procedure is concerned, is transformed from a case at law to one on the chancery side.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-11\" pgmap=\"125\">W.
