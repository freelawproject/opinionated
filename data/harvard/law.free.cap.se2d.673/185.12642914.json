CARRICO.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Tried by a jury in the Circuit Court of Alleghany County on a charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), the defendant, Jerry Lynn Cooper, also known as Gerald Lynn Cooper, was convicted and his sentence was fixed at ten years in the penitentiary and a fine of $10,000.00. The circuit court upheld the conviction and imposed the ten-year penitentiary sentence but suspended the $10,000.00 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In an unpublished order, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. We granted Cooper an appeal to consider this single assignment of error: \"That the ruling by the Court of Appeals that [Cooper's] proposed jury instruction concerning alibi was not required is erroneous.\" Finding that the Court of Appeals' ruling was erroneous, we will reverse its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Commonwealth's evidence showed that in late 2004, Angela Tucker became a paid informant for the Alleghany Highlands Drug Task Force of the Virginia State Police. Tucker \"never had any charges or pending charges\" against her but was \"concerned about the drug problem in [her] area\" of the Commonwealth and thought she \"could help with that.\" She was paid $100.00 for each drug purchase she made for the police, and at the time she testified at Cooper's trial, she had made sixty such purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At 3:22 p.m. on April 5, 2006, Tucker told Special Agent Eddie Philpot of the Virginia State Police, who was attached to the Alleghany Highlands Drug Task Force, that she might \"be able to purchase some crack cocaine\" from Cooper, who happened to be her uncle. Special Agent Philpot, accompanied by Detective Winfred Smith of the Bath County Sheriff's Office, who was also a member of the Alleghany Highlands Drug Task Force, gave Tucker money for the purchase of drugs. After searching her, the officers installed \"body wire\" on her \"that broadcasts through a frequency through a listening post\" placed on the rear seat of the police vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Special Agent Philpot and Detective Smith then drove Tucker to a location in the City of Covington near Cooper's residence. Tucker\n   left the car, walked to the residence, and found Cooper at home. She asked him \"if he knew where to get any drugs from, well coke.\" He replied, \"yeah,\" but said he had to make a call to Boomie, a local \"coke dealer.\" He talked to Boomie, but Boomie \"never called back.\" At that point, Jap, a friend of Cooper's, \"come up\" and \"gave [Cooper] a ride.\" Before Cooper left, Tucker gave him a \"hundred dollar bill\" she had been given by Special Agent Philpot and Detective Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cooper could not get the drugs from Boomie but secured them from Van, who had \"a reputation for selling drugs ... in Covington.\" Cooper returned to Tucker in about ten minutes and \"gave [her] the drugs.\" It was then 4:26 p.m. Cooper departed and Tucker immediately turned the drugs over to Detective Smith, who was sitting with Special Agent Philpot in their police vehicle nearby and from which they had been observing Tucker's movements and listening to her conversations. Upon analysis, the drugs proved to be cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In defense, Cooper denied that he had sold drugs to Tucker and offered an alibi. He testified and presented testimony from other witnesses that between 3:22 p.m. and 4:26 p.m. on April 5, 2006, he was at work participating in the construction of a pool house at a site in Clifton Forge, a town located some distance from Covington. Cooper's employer and two of his co-workers stated that his work schedule was 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily and that he worked until 4:30 p.m. on April 5, 2006. A witness who shares her home with Cooper testified that he left for work at 8:00 a.m. on April 5, 2006, and that he was not there when she returned home from a meeting about 4:15 p.m., but arrived before she left for work at 9:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidence, Cooper proffered Instruction A, which was refused by the circuit court. Based upon 2 Virginia Model Jury Instructions-Criminal, No. 52.100, at 52-3 (repl. ed. 2008), the proffered instruction read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant relies upon the defense that he was not present at the time and place the alleged offense was committed. If, after consideration of all the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt that the defendant was present at the time and place the alleged offense was committed, you shall find him not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The circuit court refused the instruction on the ground it was not required because other instructions were granted on presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt, and the elements of the offense. The Court of Appeals held that because the circuit court had granted the other instructions, a \"separate instruction on alibi was neither necessary nor required, and the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to give [Cooper's] alibi jury instruction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As a general rule, the matter of granting and denying instructions does rest in the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See Daniels v.

The defendant complained of the instruction on appeal, \"arguing that it confused the jury as to the standard of proof required to establish an alibi.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n    at 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n    284 S.E.2d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagreed, stating that \"[a] jury objectively reading the instruction complained of could not be misled, because nowhere does it require proof of alibi beyond a reasonable doubt or even by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n    at 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n    284 S.E.2d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This brings us to the point of decision. In making our decision, we first question the efficacy of this Court's approval in\n   <em>\n    Draper\n   </em>\n   of the statement that \"[a]libi ... is not a defense in the accurate meaning of the term, but a mere fact shown in rebuttal of the State's evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000647\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/132/648/\">\n    132 Va. at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20S.E.%20471\">\n    111 S.E. at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We now hold to the contrary. Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004) 79 defines the word \"alibi\" as \"[a] defense based on the physical impossibility of a defendant's guilt by placing the defendant in a location other than the scene of the crime at the relevant time.\" And the same dictionary at page 451 defines the word \"defense\" as \"[a] defendant's stated reason why the plaintiff or prosecutor has no valid case; esp., a defendant's answer, denial, or plea &lt;her defense was that she was 25 miles from the building at the time of the robbery&gt;.\" Hence, we will hereafter treat alibi as a defense in the accurate meaning of the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We also question the efficacy of this Court's approval in\n   <em>\n    Draper\n   </em>\n   of the further statement that \"the evidence introduced to support [an alibi] should be left to the jury uninfluenced by any charge from the court tending to place it upon a different footing from other evidence in the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000647\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/132/648/\">\n    132 Va. at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20S.E.%20471\">\n    111 S.E. at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We now hold to the contrary. Rule 3A:11, which deals with discovery and inspection in criminal cases, provides in subparagraph (c)(2) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (c) Discovery by the Commonwealth.- If the court grants relief sought by the accused under clause (ii) of subparagraph (b)(1) or under subparagraph (b)(2) of this Rule, it shall, upon motion of the Commonwealth, condition its order by requiring that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) The accused disclose whether he intends to introduce evidence to establish an alibi and, if so, that the accused disclose the place at which he claims to have been at the time of the commission of the alleged offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Other than insanity or feeblemindedness, Rule 3A:11(c)(3), alibi is the only defense that must be disclosed pretrial by the accused in a criminal case. Thus, subparagraph (c)(2) has placed alibi on a different footing from other evidence in the case, and it should be left to the jury in an appropriate instruction on the subject, in addition to instructions on presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, in view of our changed consideration of the alibi concept, we question the wisdom of continuing our rule that the matter of granting or refusing alibi instructions rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   makes clear that an alibi instruction should be granted when there is \"evidence that the accused was elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the exact time or for the entire period during which it was or could have been committed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037510\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/210/16/\">\n    210 Va. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20S.E.2d%2097\">\n    168 S.E.2d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet, as a review of our decisions will reveal, alibi instructions have been granted in some cases and refused in others when no discernible difference is apparent. Eliminating judicial discretion will promote uniformity where uniformity is desirable, and it is desirable in this instance. Hereafter, the rule will be: grant an alibi instruction when the evidence described in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is present, refuse when the evidence is absent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Cooper's alibi evidence fully satisfied the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   test. We approved the wording of Instruction A in\n   <em>\n    Bassett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2083577\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/222/844/\">\n    222 Va. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   856-57 n. 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n    284 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   852 n. 2, and no reason has been advanced to require withdrawal of that approval. Accordingly, the instruction should have been granted. Because it was refused, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate Cooper's conviction, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals for further remand to the circuit court for a new trial with the jury instructed on alibi, provided the evidence remains substantially the same, the instruction is in proper form, and Cooper requests it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
