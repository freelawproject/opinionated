Gerardo Herrera alleged that his due process rights were violated when he was arrested and incarcerated for several days for a crime that he did not commit. After discovery, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The district court reasoned: (1) that Gerardo Herrera failed to show that he suffered a constitutional injury because his arrest was based on a valid indictment and arrest warrant and (2) that, at most, the summary judgment evidence showed negligence and that negligence does not give rise to a constitutional violation of due process. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-19\">The facts relevant to this appeal are stated \u201cin the most favorable way\u201d to Gerardo Herrera, <em>Lopez v. Houston Indep. School Dist., </em>817 F.2d 351, 352 (5th Cir.1987), and are as follows. A theft occurred at the Palacio Del Rio Hotel (\u201cthe hotel\u201d) in San Antonio, Texas on February 26, 1983. Dennis Carlson (\u201cCarlson\u201d), a San Antonio police officer, stated in his deposition that he investigated the theft and obtained from the hotel the name of Gerald Herrera as the perpetrator. Carlson also stated that the hotel gave him Gerald Herrera\u2019s address and date of birth. After dealing with a few other matters in the investigation, Carlson went on vacation, so he handed the ease over to his partner, Robert Lee West (\u201cWest\u201d). West testified in his deposition that the name of the suspected defendant on the charging disposition, which West turned over to the Bexar County District Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cthe district attorney\u2019s office\u201d), was Gerardo Herrera, not Gerald Herrera. West also stated that he did not know how the name Gerald Herrera became Gerardo Herrera and that he did not remember running a computer check on Gerald Herrera. The parties, however, stipulated in their agreed pretrial order that Gerardo Herrera\u2019s name, address, height, and weight were obtained from police department\u2019s computer records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-20\">After West gave the information<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regarding the theft to the district attorney\u2019s office, Charles Tennison (\u201cTennison\u201d), William Tassos (\u201cTassos\u201d), and Ernie Glenn (\u201cGlenn\u201d) were responsible for investigating the case prior to its submission to the Grand Jury. The case with Gerardo Herrera\u2019s name, instead of Gerald Herrera\u2019s name, was submitted to the Grand Jury, and the Grand Jury indicted Gerardo Herrera. Based on this indictment, an arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>warrant was issued, and upon being stopped for a traffic violation on or around July 16, 1984, Gerardo Herrera was arrested for the theft and was incarcerated from July 16,1984 to July 18,1984, when he was released on bond. After the realization of the mistake, the case against Gerardo Herrera was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\">On June 14, 1985, Gerardo Herrera filed suit against the Bexar County, Texas district attorney, sheriff, and jail administrator in addition to Bexar County, San Antonio, and San Antonio\u2019s police chief. By stipulation, the district court dismissed the sheriff, jail administrator, and police chief. Based on the same incident, Gerardo Herrera filed suit against Carlson, West, Tenni-son, Tassos, and Glenn<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on July 16, 1986. The district court consolidated the two cases on December 17, 1987, and the defendants moved for dismissal or summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 21, 1988, the district court informed Gerardo Herrera that it was treating the motion as a summary judgment motion and told Gerardo Herrera that any opposition to the summary judgment motion had to be submitted by February 5, 1988. Gerardo Herrera submitted no response, and on February 12, 1988, the district court granted the summary judgment motion and dismissed the case against all the defendants with prejudice. Gerardo Herrera filed timely notice of appeal, appealing only the summary judgment granted in favor of Carlson, West, Tennison, Tassos, and Glenn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">On appeal, we evaluate a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment by reviewing the record under the same standards used by the district court. <em>Brooks, Tarlton, Gilbert, Douglas &amp; Kressler v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>832 F.2d 1358, 1364 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir.1986). Therefore, we cannot affirm a summary judgment ruling unless \u201cwe are convinced, after an independent review of the record, that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u2019 and that the movant is \u2018entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks, </em>832 F.2d at 1364 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). Following this standard, we must consider fact questions with deference to the nonmovant. Consequently, when a fact question controls the disposition of a summary judgment motion, we must \u201creview the facts drawing all inferences most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Reid, </em>784 F.2d at 578. Further, we will decide questions of law just as we decide questions of law outside the summary judgment context \u2014 by <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Brooks, </em>832 F.2d at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">In <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-11\">[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can be \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact,\u201d since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmov-ing party\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is \u201centitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>spect to which she has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552. Thus, Gerardo Herrera must make a sufficient showing on the essential elements of his case, with respect to which he bears the burden of proof, to avoid summary judgment in the movants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">\u201cThe first inquiry in any \u00a7 1983 suit ... is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a right \u2018secured by the Constitution and laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 140, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2692, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). In <em>Baker, </em>the Court held that the arrest of a person pursuant to a facially valid warrant and his detention for three days over a New Year\u2019s weekend did not constitute a deprivation of the person\u2019s constitutional rights even though the person so arrested and detained was not the individual actually wanted for the narcotics charges. <em>Id. </em>Gerardo Herrera argues, however, that <em>Baker </em>is not dispositive of his case because <em>Baker </em>focused on the actions of the defendants <em>after </em>the arrest at issue in that case. In this case, Gerardo Herrera states, the cause of action is based on the actions of- the appellees <em>before </em>the arrest. However, this attempt at distinguishing <em>Baker </em>focuses us on the major problem in Gerardo Herrera\u2019s case \u2014 whether the appellees\u2019 actions constituted more than negligence. In <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), the Supreme Court addressed the issue which it had avoided in <em>Baker </em>and held that \u201cthe Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a <em>negligent </em>act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty or <em>property.\u201d Id. </em>at 328, 106 S.Ct. at 664 (emphasis in original); <em>accord Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 347-48, 106 S.Ct. 668, 670, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">In this case, the summary judgment evidence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at most, shows negligence. <em>See Simmons v. McElveen, </em>846 F.2d 337 (5th Cir.1988) (summary judgment on \u00a7 1983 claim granted in favor of defendants for plaintiff\u2019s failure to show more than negligence when plaintiff was incarcerated for eight months and defendants failed to turn over information to the district attorney\u2019s office that plaintiff's fingerprints did not match a cigarette package dropped by the assailant at the scene of the crime, failed to compare the true assailant\u2019s fingerprints with those on the cigarette package, and failed to conduct a physical line-up involving the true assailant). Therefore, we agree with the district court that since Gerardo Herrera has failed to come forward with any summary judgment evidence showing more than negligence \u2014 an element essential to his case and one on which he would carry the burden of proof at trial\u2014 summary judgment is appropriate for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">Gerardo Herrera, however, argues that summary judgment is inappropriate in a case which involves the subjective intent of the appellees. We reject such an argument. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 256-57, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Simmons, </em>846 F.2d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">Finally, we decline to address the issues of qualified and absolute immunity because we find other adequate grounds on which to affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court correctly decided that the motion for summary judgment should be granted. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">.
