Dupree, pro se, appeals from a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) affirming the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) decision denying Mr. Dupree service connection for his lung condition. Because Mr. Dupree raises only factual contentions, we <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-22\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b451-23\">Mr. Dupree served on active duty as a cook in the Army from July 1970 to January 1972. He complained of chest pain in October 1970, but an examination was negative. Mr. Dupree also sought treatment in 1970 for post-nasal drainage and a nonproductive cough. The chest x-ray resulting from this examination was negative. Mr. Dupree\u2019s January 1972 separation examination revealed a normal chest and lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-24\">In January 2001, Mr. Dupree was hospitalized with respiratory ailments. A radiology scan revealed a condition con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>sistent with pneumonia, and a computed tomography (\u201cCT\u201d) scan discovered bullous lungs. Mr. Dupree was diagnosed with pneumonia, empyema, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a history of heavy alcohol use. He was eventually discharged from the hospital in February 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">While Mr. Dupree had no significant medical history before this 2001 hospitalization, records indicate that he had a \u201c30 pack year history\u201d of tobacco use, a history of drinking three to four beers a day during the week, six to twelve beers per day on weekends, and a remote history of marijuana use in the 1960s. Mr. Dupree disputes this characterization of his marijuana use, asserting that he did not use the substance until he joined the Army in 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Later, in April 2001, a chest x-ray indicated that Mr. Dupree probably had fibrosis, as well as mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d). The following month, Mr. Dupree \u201cwas assessed with chronic COPD with obstructive airflow, shortness of breath, and fatigue.\u201d Citing a lung condition, Mr. Dupree filed a claim for service connection in October 2001. The Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) denied the claim in December of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In September 2002, a private radiologist concluded that Mr. Dupree had \u201c[interstitial fibrosis typical of previous occupational exposure to silica dust diagnostic of silicosis.\u201d Mr. Dupree then renewed his claim for service connection by submitting a statement in May 2003 asserting that he was exposed to silica dust while working as a cook in the Army. The VA denied this claim. Mr. Dupree appealed to the Board, which remanded the case upon the parties\u2019 joint request.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">In December 2008, Mr. Dupree was diagnosed with COPD/emphysema after undergoing a VA medical examination. The examiner determined that (i) Mr. Dupree\u2019s pulmonary condition was less likely than not related to his service as an Army cook; (ii) Mr. Dupree\u2019s 2001 pneumonia was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d caused by his bullous lungs; and (iii) those bullous lungs \u201cwere caused by alcohol use as well as ... chronic tobacco use.\u201d The examiner also concluded that Mr. Dupree showed no signs of having silicosis, asbestosis, or fibrosis. Finally, the examiner noted that \u201c[cjurrent medical literature does not list bullous lungs caused by exposure to asbestosis or silicosis. In addition it does mention that bullous lungs can cause ... pneumonia as well as copd/emphysema.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Relying on the results from this medical examination, the Board denied Mr. Dupree\u2019s request for a service connection. In particular, the Board found \u201cno competent medical evidence linking the Veteran\u2019s current lung disorder to his service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The Veterans Court affirmed, explaining the Board did not err in relying on the December 2008 VA medical opinion to find no service connection because that opinion \u201creflects that the examiner reviewed the appellant\u2019s claims file and medical records, which included, inter alia, his CT scans, x-ray reports, and Dr. Levine\u2019s medical opinion.\u201d The court also noted that the 2008 VA medical opinion shows that the examiner considered Mr. Dupree\u2019s medical history, including his diagnosis of pneumonia in 2001, and reviewed medical literature. Finally, the court explained that \u201cthe fact that the examiner did not expressly reference all of the records identified by [Mr. Dupree] ... did not render the examination inadequate, especially where, as here, the examination report reflects a thorough and detailed review of the medical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>Mr. Dupree appealed the Veterans Court\u2019s decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Our jurisdiction to review decisions by the Veterans Court is limited. We have exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof ... and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). Absent a constitutional issue, we lack jurisdiction to review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Mr. Dupree raises two primary arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the Veterans Court misapplied the relevant provisions of the VA Adjudications Procedure Manual M21-1 (\u201cM21-1\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The M21-1 provisions at issue in this case involve the latent periods for diseases caused by asbestos. According to Mr. Dupree, his respiratory condition, which he asserts was caused by asbestos, has a latent period ranging from ten to forty-five or more years (meaning ten to forty-five years, or more, can elapse between the date of exposure to asbestos and the date the disease fully develops). Mr. Dupree first complained of his respiratory condition in 1970 and full development allegedly occurred thirty-one years later in 2001. Therefore, Mr. Dupree asserts that his disease fell within the latent period prescribed by M21-1. Mr. Dupree also argues that the evidence in the record clearly supports a nexus between his exposure to asbestos while in the military and the condition that eventually developed in 2001 before the latent period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The Veterans Court addressed this argument, explaining that the Board correctly considered the latent period for asbestos-caused diseases set out in M21-1. The Board ultimately found, however, that the most probative evidence in the case (i.e., the 2008 medical report) suggested that Mr. Dupree did not have a disease caused by exposure to asbestos. This Board conclusion, which was affirmed by the Veterans Court, undermined Mr. Dupree\u2019s M211 latency argument because the guideline Mr. Dupree relies on applies primarily to diseases caused by asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">As evident above, adopting Mr. Dupree\u2019s argument that his condition falls within the latent period established in M21-1 would require making evidentiary conclusions regarding a nexus between asbestos and Mr. Dupree\u2019s condition that would conflict with the Board\u2019s determinations. We lack jurisdiction to make such conclusions. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2) (prohibiting this court from exercising jurisdiction over \u201cchallenges to factual determinations\u201d in veterans cases). Therefore, we cannot grant Mr. Dupree the relief he desires under M21-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">In his second argument on appeal, Mr. Dupree asserts that the Veterans Court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s reliance on the fact that marijuana contributed to his lung condition. In particular, Mr. Dupree argues that he did not use marijuana before he joined the Army and that this substance did not contribute to the onset of his condition. According to Mr. Dupree, the substance merely aggravated an already-existing condition. Once again, concluding as Mr. Dupree suggests would require us to upset factual determinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>made by the Board regarding the impact of his marijuana use on his lung condition, which were affirmed by the Veterans Court. We lack jurisdiction to review challenges to such factual determinations. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Mr. Dupree\u2019s appeal for a lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">DISMISSED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\">.
