Because Mr. Ugay does not raise any issues on appeal that fall within our jurisdiction, we <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Mr. Ugay applied for Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) burial benefits following the death of his father-in-law, Felimon A. Elacion. Mr. Elacion, the veteran, served in the Philippine Commonwealth Army from September 1941 to May 1942 and with the Recognized Guerrillas and Combination Service from February 1943 to April 1946. Mr. Elacion died in March 2005; he was eighty-nine years old. The death certificate listed the immediate cause of death as multi-organ failure, with old age contributing to death. At the time of his death, Mr. Elacion had established service connection for affective psychosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">Mr. Ugay sought burial benefits on the grounds that the actual cause of Mr. Elacion\u2019s death was affective psychosis, and that pulmonary tuberculosis (\u201cTB pneumonia\u201d) not multi-organ failure due to old age was the contributing factor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In support of his claim, Mr. Ugay offered affidavits from two physicians: the physician who signed Mr. Elacion\u2019s death certif\u00edcate and a physician who had treated Mr. Elaci\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\">In her affidavit, the physician who signed the death certificate affirmed that she had listed the immediate cause of death as \u201cImmediate eause-multiorgan failure\u201d and the contributing cause of death as \u201cold age.\u201d The physician further affirmed that Mr. Elacion\u2019s cause of death was actually affective psychosis with TB Pneumonia as a contributing factor. In a subsequent statement, the physician explained that her initial conclusion of multi-organ failure as a result of old age was due to the fact that she was not Mr. Elacion\u2019s attending physician and had no additional medical history before her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-18\">With the limited information about the deceased and not being able to attend the deceased, I therefore considered the old age of the deceased and his being bedridden already as a significant condition contributing to the death as well as the one that could lead to multiorgan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>failure common in the elderly, hence the cause of death in the death certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Mr. Ugay also submitted an affidavit by one of Mr. Elacion\u2019s attending physicians which provided that Mr. Elaci\u00f3n \u201cwas confined and treated by my father, the late Dr. Pio Castro from TB Pheumonia (sic) sometime in 1951 and I can vividly recall it for I am a living witness to it.\u201d The physician further attested that Mr. Elaci\u00f3n had suffered from TB pneumonia up until his death and that this illness significantly contributed to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The physician briefly addressed the issue of Mr. Elacion\u2019s affective psychosis, concluding that affective psychosis contributed to Mr. Elacion\u2019s TB pneumonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) requested a medical opinion from a VA physician concerning whether Mr. Elacion\u2019s service-connected affective psychosis materially caused or contributed to his death. The VA physician reviewed the private medical records, service medical records, and VA examination records and concluded that Mr. Elacion\u2019s death was not caused by or the result of affective psychosis and was not service connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Mr. Ugay appealed the RO\u2019s decision to the Board, contending that Mr. Elaci\u00f3n died as a result of service-connected affective psychosis and TB pneumonia. The Board concluded that \u201cthe death certificate and VA examiner\u2019s opinion are more probative [than the private medical statements]. The VA examiner reviewed all records in the claims file and opined that affective psychosis was not a primary or contributing cause of the veteran\u2019s death as the veteran\u2019s death was not premature.\u201d The Board further found that Mr. Elacion\u2019s TB pneumonia was not service connected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">No probative evidence was provided substantiating assertions that PT [sic] pneumonia was caused by or incurred in service or caused by a service connected disability. The service treatment records are void of any findings, symptoms, complaints, or diagnoses of pulmonary tuberculosis and/or pneumonia.... In the absence of credible medical evidence linking the veteran\u2019s pulmonary tuberculosis to a documented disease, event, or injury in service, service connection for TB Pneumonia as the cause of death must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">Accordingly, the Board held that the preponderance of the evidence was against Mr. Ugay\u2019s claim and, therefore, the cause of Mr. Elacion\u2019s death was not service connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">Mr. Ugay appealed the Board\u2019s determination to the Veterans Court, alleging that the Board had clearly erred in its determination that the preponderance of the evidence was against his claim; inadequately stated the reasons or bases for its decision; misapplied the law; failed to ensure that a medical examination was provided; and failed to adjudicate an unrelated claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">The Veterans Court concluded that the record did not support Mr. Ugay\u2019s arguments. The court noted that to establish clear error in the Board\u2019s weighing of the evidence, Mr. Ugay had to demonstrate that based on the record as a whole, the Board\u2019s assignment of weight was not plausible. The court observed that the Board relied on the certified cause of death as being organ failure and old age, as well as a VA medical opinion that Mr. Elacion\u2019s death was not premature and that his service-connected affective psycho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>sis was not a primary or contributing cause of his death. The Veterans Court found no error in the Board\u2019s application of the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Mr. Ugay now appeals the Veterans Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Our review of decisions by the Veterans Court is limited. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), we may only review \u201cthe validity of a decision of the [c]ourt on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on\u201d by the Veterans Court. We have jurisdiction to \u201cdecide all relevant questions of law, including interpreting constitutional and statutory provisions.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1). We cannot, absent a constitutional issue, \u201creview (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Mr. Ugay first contends that the Board relied on an invalid death certificate. According to Mr. Ugay, because the signing physician subsequently indicated that \u201cHater it was known that said Felimon A. Elacion\u2019s cause of death is affective psychosis with TB Pneumonia as a contributing factor,\u201d the death certificate relied on by the Board is invalid, because it states that the cause of death was multi-organ failure due to old age. The Board was not moved by the physician\u2019s later statement and concluded that there was \u201c[n]o rationale or evidence ... provided\u201d to support the assertion that the veteran in fact died of affective psychosis with TB-pneumonia as a contributing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Mr. Ugay also argues that the Board failed to properly evaluate the evidence of service connection for TB-pneumonia, but Mr. Ugay does not explain how the Board failed to do so. Rather, Mr. Ugay simply states that the Board should have given more weight than it did to the physician statement that Mr. Elaci\u00f3n had been treated for TB pneumonia since 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">In essence, Mr. Ugay argues that the Board and Veterans Court erred by giving the death certificate and the VA medical opinion more probative value than the private physicians\u2019 medical statements. Any disagreement with the Board\u2019s weighing of the evidence is merely a disagreement with the Board\u2019s fact-based determination, which we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>See Bastien v. Shinseki, </em>599 F.3d 1301, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2010) (\u201cThe evaluation and weighing of evidence and the drawing of appropriate inferences from it are factual determinations committed to the discretion of the fact-finder.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Because Mr. Ugay has not raised an issue within our jurisdiction, the appeal is <em>dismissed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">DISMISSED</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-13\">. In order for burial benefits to be awarded on this basis, Mr. Ugay also had to demonstrate that Mr. Elacion\u2019s TB pneumonia was service connected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">. Mr. Ugay also sought sanctions against the Board, which the Veterans Court denied. The sanctions request is repeated on appeal. Given the disposition of the current action, the request is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\">. The Veterans Court noted that Mr. Ugay\u2019s filing with the Veterans Court may constitute an informal claim for such benefits and that Mr. Ugay and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should pursue this potential claim. The disposition of the present appeal should not be read as limiting any such informal claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
