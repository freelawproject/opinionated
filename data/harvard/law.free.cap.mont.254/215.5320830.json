DeWart appeals from an Order of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, dismissing his complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 61-5-208(2), MCA (1989), requires a one year driver\u2019s license revocation when an individual is convicted of a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) violation within five years of a driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Appellant Jack DeWart (DeWart) was convicted of the offense of DUI pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, on August 13, 1986. He was convicted of a BAC violation under \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, on March 6, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Following its standard practice, the Motor Vehicle Division of the Montana Department of Justice (Department) would have revoked DeWart\u2019s driver\u2019s license for one year under \u00a7 61-5-208(2), MCA, upon receiving notice of the March 6, 1991, BAC conviction. Before the Department could act, DeWart initiated a declaratory judgment action seeking to have the Department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 61-5-208, MCA, declared erroneous as a matter of law and to permanently enjoin the Department from revoking his driver\u2019s license. He obtained a temporary restraining order preventing revocation by the Department. The Department agreed that the temporary restraining order would remain in effect until the court decided the issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The District Court dismissed appellant\u2019s declaratory action in an order dated October 29, 1991, and DeWart appealed. The parties agreed, and the District Court ordered, that the Department be restrained from revoking DeWart\u2019s driver\u2019s license pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Did the District Court err in concluding that \u00a7 61-5-208(2), MCA (1989), requires a one year driver\u2019s license revocation when an individual is convicted of a BAC violation within five years of a DUI conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The District Court relied on this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 61-5-208(2), MCA, in <em>Horton v. State </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 233, 717 P.2d 1108, in determining that a BAC violation within five years of a DUI violation mandates a one year driver\u2019s license revocation. It rejected appellant\u2019s argument, reasserted on appeal, that amendments to \u00a7 61-8-714, MCA, by the 1989 Montana legislature prohibit the use of DeWart\u2019s 1991 BAC conviction as a second conviction under \u00a7 61-5-208(2), MCA (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Section 61-5-208(2), MCA, a civil penalty statute, has long provided for a six month driver\u2019s license suspension upon either a DUI or a BAC conviction and a one year revocation upon a second conviction within five years. The appellant in <em>Horton </em>argued, as does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>appellant here, that a BAC conviction within five years of a DUI conviction does not equal a second offense resulting in a one year license revocation under \u00a7 61-5-208(2), MCA (1985). We rejected that argument, stating that the statute \u201cis plain, unambiguous and certain in providing that a BAC conviction following a DUI conviction... results in a license revocation for one <em>year.\u2019\u2019Horton, </em>221 Mont. at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">DeWart argues that Chapter 476, Laws 1989, introduced as House Bill 425, which made no change in the statutory language at issue, so altered related criminal penalty provisions as to necessitate an interpretation of \u00a7 61-5-208, MCA, different from that made by this Court in <em>Horton </em>in 1986. The 1989 amendments to \u00a7 61-8-714, MCA, the <em>criminal </em>penalty statute for DUI violations, added a new subsection (6) providing that \u201c[f]or the purpose of calculating subsequent convictions under this section, a conviction for a violation of 61-8-406 [BAC violation] also constitutes a conviction for a violation of 61-8-401 [DUI violation].\u201d DeWart asserts that this amendment, together with the absence of a corresponding amendment to the criminal penalty statute for BAC convictions and sketchy language from the legislative history, mandates a new interpretation of the civil penalty statute related to, but separate from, the criminal penalty statutes for DUI and BAC violations. DeWart\u2019s argument misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The plain and clear language of \u00a7 61-8-714(6), MCA (1989), limits its application to determining DUI penalties provided for in that section. The legislature had a clear opportunity to amend \u00a7 61-5-208, MCA, to comport with the interpretation urged by appellant and chose not to do so. Indeed, the legislature has amended \u00a7 61-5-208, MCA, on numerous occasions since our decision in <em>Horton </em>and has never amended the language at issue here. Our role is to ascertain and declare what is contained in a statute, \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We conclude that the amendments contained in Chapter 476, Laws 1989, do not change or impact the language we interpreted in <em>Horton </em>or <em>oux Horton </em>decision. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that \u00a7 61-5-208(2), MCA (1989), requires a one year license revocation when an individual in convicted of a BAC offense within five years of a DUI offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, McDONOUGH and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
