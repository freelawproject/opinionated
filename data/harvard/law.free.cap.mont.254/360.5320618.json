We reverse on all three counts, with directions that Count One be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The dispositive issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">1. Did the court err in refusing to dismiss Count One for lack of sufficient evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">2. Did the court err in permitting law officer opinion testimony regarding the credibility of the informant?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">To aid the court and counsel on remand, we also briefly address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">3. Was other crimes evidence admitted in violation of Just?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">4. Did the court err in refusing to give defendant\u2019s entrapment instruction concerning Count Three, the sale of four pills?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">Between September 1990 and May 1991, an undercover drug operation was conducted in Lincoln County, Montana, in which Hal Turner acted as an undercover agent for the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Department. During his employment, Turner became acquainted with defendant Lyons.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">On December 12, 1990, Turner went to Lyons\u2019s apartment to talk to a third person about arranging a drug deal. A fourth individual present at Lyons\u2019s apartment, Denyce Larson, provided some marijuana for everyone to smoke and said she knew where to buy more for $25 per quarter ounce. Lyons and Turner both told Larson that they wanted to buy some and each arranged to pay for a quarter ounce to be delivered to Lyons\u2019s apartment later that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">Turner later returned to Lyons\u2019s apartment to pick up his marijuana. The marijuana for both buyers had been delivered in one bag. After some joking around, Lyons\u2019s girlfriend divided the marijuana into two bags, which Lyons readjusted to his satisfaction. Then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Turner was allowed to choose which bag to take as his. This transaction is the basis of Count One charged against Lyons.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Counts Two and Three relate to sales of prescription sleeping pills by Lyons to Turner on December 18 and 19,1990. Count Two alleged that Lyons gave Turner one pill and Count Three alleged that he sold Turner four more pills. Turner testified that these transactions occurred at Lyons\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Lyons testified on his own behalf. He essentially admitted that the transaction charged as Count One occurred. However, he denied selling or giving Turner any prescription sleeping pills and maintained that Turner must have stolen the pills from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">At the close of the defense\u2019s case, the State asked to be allowed to offer character evidence in rebuttal to rehabilitate witness Turner because, it argued, Turner\u2019s credibility had been directly attacked by the defense. The court granted the motion. Officer Klint, a Lincoln County detective, testified about the importance of credibility in an undercover agent. He further testified that planting evidence is illegal, that he had checked into Turner\u2019s background before Turner began to work as an undercover agent, and that, in his opinion, Turner was \u201cvery truthful\u201d as far as undercover work.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Lyons was convicted of three counts of selling dangerous drugs under \u00a7 45-9-101, MCA. A fourth count charged against him was dismissed during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Did the court err in refusing to dismiss Count One for lack of sufficient evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Lyons was convicted under Count One of criminal sale of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-9-101 and 45-2-301, MCA. Section 45-9-101, MCA, defines the offense of sale of dangerous drugs as, <em>inter alia, </em>selling, bartering, exchanging, or giving away dangerous drugs as defined in \u00a7 50-32-101, MCA, or offering to do so. Section 45-2-301, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">Accountability for conduct of another. A person is responsible for conduct which is an element of an offense if the conduct is either that of the person himself or that of another and he is legally accountable for such conduct as provided in 45-2-302, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">The companion statute, \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\">When accountability exists. A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>(3) either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or facilitate such commission, he solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid such other person in the planning or commission of the offense ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Lyons argues that as a co-buyer he cannot be guilty of the crime of sale of dangerous drugs through the accountability statute. He quotes the general rule that a purchaser of illegal drugs is not an accomplice to the crime of selling drugs. <em>State v. Stokoe </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 461, 464, 730 P.2d 415, 417. He moved for dismissal of Count One after he and the State had presented their respective cases-in-chief, but the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Amotion to dismiss a criminal charge because of insufficient evidence should be granted only when there is no evidence upon which a trier of fact could render a verdict. <em>State v. Miller </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 497, 509, 757 P.2d 1275, 1282. This Court\u2019s standard of review of the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on such a motion is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Downing </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 215, 217, 783 P.2d 412, 414. The requisite elements for holding a person legally accountable for the conduct of another under Montana\u2019s accountability statutes are that 1) either before or during 2) the commission of an offense 3) with the purpose to promote or facilitate such commission 4) the person solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid such other person in the planning or commission of the offense. <em>Downing, </em>783 P.2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Turner testified as follows about ordering the marijuana:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">Q. Okay. And then what transpired next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">A. Denyce said that she, there was some available that was $25.00 a quarter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">A. Okay. And David said that he wanted one. And I said well, I wanted one, too, just kind of barged in, too. And nothing was, barged in, the pot was smoked, okay, then \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">A. Finally, David asked for something about the money part, okay. She needed the money. I said why sure, gets my money out and gave her $25.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">He testified as follows concerning the delivery of the marijuana:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">Q. Now, what were the arrangements for getting the pot? You gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the money to Denyce and then you left. You mean \u2014 what was supposed to be, mailed to you or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">A. Okay, there was a mix-up there, right. She said she had to go to work and she was telling Dave about how the deal was going. I didn\u2019t understand that totally how it was going to go down. So then when she left, I asked Jamie, I said, well, what is the deal? She said she got to go to work and, you know, I was worried about did I get ripped off for $25.00. And I am going to get something? And she said well later then around 6:00 or something. So anyway, I was supposed to be there later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">Q. So whatever that conversation was, you were to go back to the Lyons\u2019 residence and pick up the marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">Q. And did you go back to the Lyons\u2019 residence and pick up the marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">Q. And who was present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">A. David Lyons, Jamie Popp again, me and Angela Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">Q. Did Denyce or Mike show up at any time when you were there the second time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">Q. Okay. Was there any marijuana that you saw the second time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_1\">A. Oh, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-14\">Q. How did it come about that you saw marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-15\">A. Well, David told Jamie to get it out, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-16\">Q. Okay. And then what did Jamie do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-17\">A. Got it out of her purse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-18\">Q. Okay. And how was it packaged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-19\">A. Okay, it was rolled in one bag. David \u2014 well, I suppose I should back up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-20\">Q. Let\u2019s just go through it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-21\">A. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-22\">Q. You said all in one bag. Was it supposed to be in one bag?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-23\">A. Hmmm, well, I didn\u2019t think so. I thought that I was supposed to get a package, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-24\">Q. Who else was supposed to get a package?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-25\">A. David was supposed to get a package.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Q. And was anything said about why it was in one package?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">A. Yes. First told the story there is none for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">Q. Is that what somebody said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">A. David Lyons said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">Q. Okay. And how did you react to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">A. I started whining, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">Q. Define whining.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">A. Crying around, you know. He said there was only some for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azc\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">A. And I asked him, I said, can\u2019t I split it with you? And you know, I wanted to get something out of the deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">Q. Is that unusual to do that if you don\u2019t get your marijuana to whine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">A. No, sir, it is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-14\">Q. Okay. So you complained about it. Did he offer to give you your money back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-15\">A. No, sir, I don\u2019t believe that he did. It was all a joke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-16\">Q. It was a joke they wouldn\u2019t give you any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-18\">Q. How did you know that it was a joke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-19\">A. Well, he told me finally, the bag, we had to split it in half. Anyway, my part was already in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-20\">Q. All right. And so the bag comes out of the purse and then it is split?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-21\">A. No, sir, it is not split yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-22\">Q. Do you get your part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-23\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-24\">Q. How does that come about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-25\">A. Well, David told somebody to grab something to split it. I think Angela went to the kitchen to get something, a plate or piece of cardboard. And then Jamie split it, okay. And I said, I get to pick. Usually that is how it is. Whoever has the drug splits it and the other person gets to pick, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-26\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-27\">A. So I picked but Dave didn\u2019t like the way that I picked because I picked the big bag. So then he got in it and, you know, mixed it around more so it looks better. And then I got to pick my bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Q. What did you do with the marijuana after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">A. Wrapped it up and put it in my pocket.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In the other cases cited by the State in which defendants were convicted of sale of dangerous drugs under the accountability statutes, there was evidence that the defendants in some manner promoted or facilitated the drug sales. <em>State v. Gommenginger </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 265, 790 P.2d 455 (with respect to Count IV, defendant\u2019s wife told the buyer that she could deliver some cocaine to him only after she conferred with defendant; defendant drove his wife to deliver the cocaine to the buyer); <em>State v. Downing </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 215, 783 P.2d 412 (defendant admitted that he helped set up the deal; he arranged a meeting and was paid; he began the search for drugs for the buyer with the seller, but did not intend to limit his search to the seller).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In the present case, there was no evidence that Lyons had a purpose to promote or facilitate the sale of marijuana to Turner. This drug deal was not pre-arranged; it was not the reason Turner went to Lyons\u2019s apartment. Turner testified that he \u201cbarged in\u201d on the sale by Larson to Lyons to place his own order. The delivery of the marijuana to Lyons\u2019s apartment and Lyons\u2019s participation in dividing the marijuana into separate bags for himself and Turner show nothing more than that Lyons acted to obtain some marijuana for himself. Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the best that can be said is that Lyons and Turner were parallel buyers from Larson.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We conclude that, in this case, no rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of sale by accountability beyond a reasonable doubt and that this case falls \"under the general rule set forth in <em>Stokoe </em>that the purchaser of drugs is not an accomplice to the crime of selling drugs. We therefore hold that the District Court erred in denying the motion to dismiss Count One. Because of this holding, we will not address the issue Lyons raised concerning the surveillance tape introduced into evidence on Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Did the court err in permitting law officer opinion testimony regarding the credibility of the informant?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The State concedes this issue. In <em>State v. Webb </em>(Mont. 1992), 828 P.2d 1351, 1356, 49 St.Rep. 236, 239, this Court ruled that character evidence regarding a witness is not admissible into evidence solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>on the basis that the witness has testified concerning a material fact and the testimony conflicts with that of the defendant. In the present case, the District Court allowed rebuttal character testimony about Turner for precisely that reason \u2014 that Turner\u2019s testimony as to material facts concerning Counts Two and Three conflicted with Lyons\u2019s testimony as to the same facts. We therefore reverse Lyons\u2019s convictions on Counts Two and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Was other crimes evidence admitted in violation of <em>Just?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The evidence under this issue which relates to Counts Two and Three was testimony by Mike Brannon that he had obtained some pills from Lyons. No immediate objection was made to this testimony, but a brief was filed and an objection was made the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Because no objection was made at the time and because Brannon\u2019s testimony was unresponsive to the question he was asked, we hold that no violation of <em>Just </em>has been shown. If he testifies on retrial, Brannon should be advised not to mention obtaining pills from Lyons unless he is specifically asked about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Did the court err in refusing to give defendant\u2019s entrapment instruction concerning Count Three, the sale of four pills?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The District Court refused Lyons\u2019s offered entrapment instruction on the basis that an entrapment defense would be inconsistent with Lyons\u2019s defense that the sale of the four pills did not occur. The State did not brief this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Lyons cites <em>Mathews v. United States </em>(1988), 485 U.S. 58, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54, in which the United States Supreme Court held that, even if a criminal defendant denies one or more elements of the crime with which he is charged, he is entitled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find entrapment. While we do not wish to prejudge the evidence which may be presented on retrial of Counts Two and Three, we call the attention of the District Court to the <em>Mathews </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Reversed as to Counts One, Two, and Three. Remanded with instructions that Count One be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-13\">JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER, WEBER and McDonough concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
