We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">We frame the following issue for appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Whether the Public Service Commission\u2019s refusal to authorize recovery through prospective rate setting of past period \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, expenses did not justly compensate Mountain Water Company, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and of Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In 1987, the Montana Legislature passed, and the Governor signed into law, Senate Bill No. 28. The law became effective on October 1, 1987, and was codified under \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA. The bill mandated that the private water service provider be responsible for the cost of maintaining water service pipelines from the main to the owner\u2019s property line. Under the statute, the property owner is responsible for the cost of the pipe and other supplies used in the service line. Prior to 1987, the property owner bore the entire cost of the pipe and of maintaining the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">On October 1, 1987, the day the law went into effect, Mountain Water Company (MWC) filed a complaint against the Montana Public Service Commission (PSC) in United States District Court, seeking to have \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, declared unconstitutional. The United States District Court held that \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, was not unconstitutional. Specifically, it held \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, did not constitute a prohibited taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that the statute did not violate the Fifth Amendment and that any taking of MWC\u2019s private property by the statute is for a public use. Further, the court stated that MWC may seek just compensation for its property taken through rate setting before the PSC. <em>Mountain Water v. Montana Dept. of Public Serv. Reg. </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 919 F.2d 593, 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">On June 29, 1989, MWC filed an application with the PSC to increase its rates, in part to recover previous expenditures it had been compelled to provide for its customers under \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA. MWC proposed to capitalize \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, expenses incurred between January 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989. Recovery was sought through a two-year amortization. The PSC denied MWC recovery for the previous expenditures. However, with respect to ongoing \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, expenses, the PSC authorized recovery through rates of annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, expenses. MWC appealed the PSC\u2019s order. The District Court held that the PSC\u2019s refusal to allow recovery of back expenses incurred during 1988 and 1989 failed to justly compensate MWC for the taking. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">The issue before us is a question of law. In reviewing conclusions of law, our standard of review will be merely to determine if the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The Ninth Circuit held that \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, expenses were a taking for public use requiring just compensation, which could be sought through rate-making. We must determine whether PSC\u2019s denial of recovery for previous expenditures denied MWC just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The PSC is an administrative agency charged, through powers granted by the Montana Legislature, with regulating public utilities pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 69-3-101, MCA et seq. The rates set by the PSC through its rate-making policies must be at a level that allows a just compensation for any regulations imposed which impair the property interests of the utility company. <em>West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio </em>(1935), 294 U.S. 63, 55 S.Ct. 316, 79 L.Ed. 761. MWC argues that the PSC is bound by judicial estoppel. The PSC admitted during the course of the federal litigation that \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA, was a taking and that MWC would be compensated through rate-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">However, in making that admission the PSC did not waive application of the policies involved in rate-making. In Montana, public utility rates are set to match utility costs during the period that rates are in effect. The utility, the Montana Consumer Counsel, the PSC, or other persons with standing may seek a rate change when the financial information indicates a mismatch. See \u00a7 69-3-301, MCAet seq. MWC was aware that the Montana Legislature passed \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA. Prior to the law taking effect on October 1, 1987, MWC could have applied to the PSC to cover the utility costs for 1988 and 1989 under \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The PSC argues that its refusal to authorize recovery in rates of prior period expenses is in line with public utility law and utility regulation in Montana. Rate-making is a legislative activity and is therefore prospective only in its effect. <em>State ex rel. Billings v. Billings Gas Co. </em>(1918), 55 Mont. 102, 110, 173 P. 799, 801; <em>Billings Utility </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Co. v. Public Service Commission </em>(1921), 62 Mont. 21, 33, 203 P. 366, _. Historically, utility companies do not receive retroactive rate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">MWC cites <em>City of Helena v. Montana Dept. of PSR </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 173, 182-183, 634 P.2d 192, 198, as support for its position. We stated \u201cIt is clearly the law that utilities may not set their rates so as to amortize past deficits.\u201d <em>Galveston Elec. Co. v. Galveston </em>(1922), 258 U.S. 388, 395, 42 S.Ct. 351, 354, 66 L.Ed. 678, 683, was cited as the foundation for the rule. The city of Helena had sought to distinguish <em>Galveston </em>and its progeny because the cases involved private utilities, not municipal utilities. We held that the PSC was not required to treat the two differently in considering past losses suffered even though in dicta we said a municipality\u2019s improvements can be funded differently. This rule against retroactive rate-making clearly applies to MWC, a private company.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The District Court agreed that \u201cutilities may not set their rates so as to amortize past deficits\u201d but held that a prohibition against allowing recovery of unanticipated expenses was not absolute. <em>Montana Consumer Counsel v. PSC and MPC </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 180, 541 P.2d 770. In <em>Montana Consumer Counsel </em>we upheld the PSC\u2019s decision authorizing Montana Power Company to increase its charges for natural gas services due to an increase in the cost of natural gas. However, the rate order in question encompassed present and prospective rate changes. <em>Montana Consumer Counsel </em>at 188, 541 P.2d at 774. The rate charges were not retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the District Court erred in concluding MWC was not justly compensated by PSC\u2019s denial to retroactively allow recovery of \u00a7 69-4-511, MCA expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">We reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-10\">JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
