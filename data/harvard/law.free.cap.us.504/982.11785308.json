S. 981], awarded the Special Master interim compensation and reimbursement of expenses. The Court also allowed the parties and the proposed intervenors/ <em>amici </em>to comment further on the Special Master\u2019s suggestion of a one-time special assessment of costs to the intervenors/amici.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Although different arguments have been advanced as to the appropriate amounts to be assessed, no party or proposed interve-<em>nor/amicus </em>has objected to the propriety of including nonob-jecting <em>amici </em>in the assessment. We therefore do not reach the issue, deeming the parties to have agreed with the procedure. The Special Master found that the proceedings were expanded and made more costly by reason of <em>amici </em>participation, and the <em>amici </em>presumably acknowledge this to be the case. In light of these considerations, the interim award to the Special Master shall be paid as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-6\">(1) the State of Colorado, a party to this original action, is assessed the amount of $25,000, the amount recommended by the Special Master;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-7\">(2) the four proposed intervenors/amici, Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District, the National Audubon Society, and the Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust, are each assessed $5,000, an amount to which none have objected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-8\">(3) the remaining award is to be paid 40% by Nebraska, 40% by Wyoming, and 20% by the United States.</blockquote>\n<judges id=\"b924-9\">Justice White would adopt the recommendation of the Special Master respecting the allocation of his fees and expenses among the parties and the <em>amici.</em></judges>\n<p id=\"ADvC\">[For earlier order herein, see, <em>e.g., ante, </em>p. 905.]</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b924-10\">Justice Stevens,</author>\n<p id=\"A6Bj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Because I do not believe that the Court has authority to assess costs against nonparties, I respectfully dissent from the order to the extent it provides for an assessment against <em>amici curiae.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>I do not think that it is proper for the Court to justify its exercise of this authority on the basis of the <em>amici\u2019s </em>failure to object, especially when the assessment is for an interim payment to the Special Master in the course of an ongoing proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-12\"> Cf.
