The most significant issue concerns a long-delayed search of his cellphone. Fulton also makes arguments drawn from the Confrontation and Grand Jury clauses of the Constitution, and he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. We AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2014, a Galveston juvenile probation officer learned from the father of a juvenile she supervised that the girl was pictured in an online advertisement offering her services as an \"escort\" - in effect, a prostitute. The probation officer began to investigate and saw that the house where the girl had been arrested was a location where other young girls consistently were arrested. She began monitoring incoming police reports, spoke with some of the girls, compiled a list of names and ages, and gathered information from other probation officers. Her investigation revealed common links among the girls: Charles Fulton, Sr. and a residence on Avenue L. In February and early March 2015, the Galveston Police Department, in tandem with the FBI, began an investigation. Police discovered that Fulton acted as the girls' pimp, directing them to prostitution dates; providing them with food, condoms, housing, and drugs; and having sex with some of them as young as 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2016, Fulton was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on six counts of sex trafficking in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b) (2015), with a different minor victim identified in each count. Fulton was also charged with a seventh count for conspiracy to commit sex trafficking under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201594\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). He was found guilty after a jury trial on four of the substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. The district court sentenced him to prison for concurrent life terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We will analyze four issues. First, Fulton asserts the district court admitted evidence obtained from his cellphone in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Second, he argues the district court violated the Confrontation Clause by prohibiting him from questioning one of the minor victims about a purported aggravated assault charge. Third, he argues that special findings made by the jury in two of his counts of conviction were not supported by sufficient evidence. Finally, Fulton contends the district court violated the Grand Jury Clause by constructively amending the indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    I. Search of Fulton's phone\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In February 2015, Galveston police obtained a search warrant on the Avenue L\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   house where the prostitution was based. The warrant, though, was due to a separate investigation into Fulton's narcotics activities. Fulton's cellphone was seized. Nine days later, police obtained a second warrant to examine its contents but were unable to bypass the phone's security features. Around this same time, the FBI agent assisting with the Fulton sex-trafficking investigation learned that the Galveston police had the phone. The agent acquired it to determine if the FBI could access the phone's data. Three weeks later, that agent obtained a federal warrant to search the phone. Still, it took a year before the data on the phone was accessed. The FBI discovered evidence that helped piece together Fulton's involvement with the minor victims. Fulton moved to suppress the evidence, but the district court denied the motion. At trial, the Government introduced evidence of the phone's contents through the testimony of the FBI agent and of minor victims. The district court also admitted evidence such as text messages, a photograph, and the results of searches of the phone's files, linking Fulton to five minor victims and revealing behaviors consistent with sex trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, Fulton argues that the phone's seizure in the February 2015 raid violated the Fourth Amendment. He alternatively argues that even if the initial seizure had been lawful, the nine-day delay in obtaining a warrant to search it was unconstitutional. At oral argument, Fulton's counsel stated that those two arguments are the limit of the objections to the search and seizure. Thus, no issue is made about the FBI's obtaining the phone, procuring its own search warrant, and finally accessing the data on the phone a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review a ruling on a motion to suppress \"in the light most favorable to the verdict,\" accepting \"the district court's factual findings unless clearly erroneous or influenced by an incorrect view of the law\" and reviewing \"questions of law\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Whether the narcotics warrant authorized the phone's seizure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We start with whether the initial seizure of the phone was proper. Fulton contends \"the warrant did not particularly describe the phone as one of the items to be seized.\" The Constitution states that a warrant should not issue without \"particularly describing\" what is to be seized. U.S. CONST. amend. IV. A warrant's particularity is sufficient if \"a reasonable officer would know what items he is permitted to seize,\" which does not mean all items authorized to be taken must be specifically identified.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Aguirre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n    664 F.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614 (5th Cir. 2011). \"We have upheld searches as valid under the particularity requirement where a searched or seized item was not named in the warrant, either specifically or by type, but was the functional equivalent of other items that were adequately described.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This narcotics warrant did not mention cellphones. The alleged equivalent was a reference to \"ledgers,\" which is a \"book ... ordinarily employed for recording ... transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ledger\n   </em>\n   , OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1989). The government argues that is enough, because this court has held that a cellphone that is \"used as a mode of both spoken and written communication and containing text messages and\n   call logs, served as the equivalent of records and documentation of sales or other drug activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Aguirre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n    664 F.3d at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that precedent, a warrant permitted seizure of a cellphone when it referred to \"personal assets including computers, disks, printers and monitors utilized in the drug trafficking organization.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n    at 614-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is because what was seized were \"the functional equivalents of several items listed\" on the warrant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n    at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We also held that if meaningful particularity is not possible, \"generic language suffices if it particularizes the types of items to be seized.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p614\">\n    at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

There was nothing in the Galveston warrant suggesting that anything similar to computers or even electronics was to be seized. Moreover, the officer in this case was a veteran of the Galveston Police Department's narcotics unit, and he indicated at the suppression hearing that he knew cellphones are used in the drug trade. Though a ledger can serve one of the myriad purposes of a cellphone, we do not extend the concept of \"functional equivalency\" to items so different, particularly one as specific, distinguishable, and anticipatable as a cellphone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We now examine an exception to the exclusionary rule that nonetheless allows the introduction of the evidence from the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    B. Good faith\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   An exception for good faith may allow the introduction of evidence unlawfully obtained \"[w]hen police act under a warrant that is invalid for lack of probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Herring v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p142\">\n    555 U.S. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p142\">\n    129 S.Ct. 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p142\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Here, of course, we have held the initial seizure of the phone to be invalid because, regardless of probable cause, the phone was not covered by the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To constitute good faith, the \"executing officer's reliance on the [deficient] warrant [must be] objectively reasonable and made in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Massi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151528\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/512/#p525\">\n    761 F.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (5th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). The Government argues the FBI agent's reliance on the federal search warrant meets these requirements. Fulton argues we should the good faith exception should not apply \"to situations where law enforcement unreasonably delays in obtaining a search warrant.\" The district court refused to consider this exception because it held the phone and its contents to be admissible on other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Massi\n   </em>\n   , law enforcement officers prolonged a proper investigatory stop based on reasonable suspicion well beyond the time permitted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151528\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/512/#p525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151528\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/512/#p525\">\n    at 522-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The officers detained the suspects for several hours \"until evidence could be corroborated, an affidavit prepared, and the search warrant obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151528\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/512/#p525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151528\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/512/#p525\">\n    at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We applied the following test to determine whether the invalid seizure of the suspects while evidentiary justification for a warrant was developed would nonetheless allow the introduction of evidence that was later obtained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) the prior law enforcement conduct that uncovered evidence used in the affidavit for the warrant must be \"close enough to the line of validity\" that an objectively reasonable officer preparing the affidavit or executing the warrant would believe that the information supporting the warrant was not tainted by unconstitutional conduct, and (2) the resulting search warrant must have been sought and executed by a law enforcement officer in good faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151528\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/512/#p525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151528\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/512/#p525\">\n    at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This same approach can be applied when, as here, the initial seizure of an\n   object was without justification, but a later-obtained warrant led to the discovery of incriminating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We have already discussed the events that followed the seizure of the cellphone. We conclude that viewed objectively, an FBI agent who obtained a search warrant in these circumstances would not have had reason to believe the seizure and continued possession of the cellphone by the Galveston police were unlawful. We so conclude because the question of whether the warrant applied to the cellphone does not lead to an easy negative answer, though that is the one we have given. Consequently, the seizure of the cellphone was \"close enough to the line of validity\" to permit the officer to prepare the second warrant that led to the search of the cellphone. The federal search warrant was \"sought and executed by a law enforcement officer in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151528\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/512/#p525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The cellphone evidence obtained was properly admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    II. Confrontation Clause violation regarding a witness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Fulton argues he was improperly limited on the range of cross-examination of a witness. The Government called Minor Victim 3 to testify. She admitted that the FBI agent investigating the sex trafficking case sought her assistance and that she initially refused to help. She also admitted that she later contacted the FBI agent after she was jailed apparently on state charges. She changed her mind again later, resisted testifying, and appeared at trial only after being brought to court under a material-witness warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Fulton wanted to cross-examine her on what he understood to be an aggravated assault arrest in her \"juvenile history\" to probe her motives for contacting the FBI agent. Fulton sought to impeach her on the theory that she contacted the FBI agent thinking he could help her \"get off that aggravated assault charge.\" There is no indication that any assault charge was related to Fulton's offense. The district court refused to let Fulton pursue this line of questioning. Counsel was permitted to ask if \"any member of law enforcement offered [her] any kind of ... benefit in exchange for testifying.\" Fulton argues this restriction violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We review alleged Confrontation Clause violations\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We consider the fact that this witness's prosecutions were by two different sovereigns on two unrelated crimes to be critical.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   is based on the fact that state prosecutors had the ability and perhaps some reason to charge that witness with the same offense and perhaps also could have affected his state probation on two other burglary offenses; the witness had ample motivation for identifying a different culprit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174956\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/308/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174956\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/308/\">\n    at 317-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174956\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/308/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We see no reason to make such assumptions when the witness appeared in a federal court trial and the separate matter was in state court. \"[N]othing in the record or pleadings suggest[ed] that the federal prosecutor could have influenced any state juvenile-court proceedings and thereby provided an inducement for the victims to testify in the federal trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We also conclude that the effect of limiting cross-examination of this witness was minimal, as ample other evidence existed of Fulton's guilt of this offense. The district court did not err in not allowing Fulton to probe this witness about any state charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    III. Sufficiency of evidence on special findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The statute of Fulton's convictions on the substantive counts required that he either knew or recklessly disregarded (1) \"that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion ... or any combination of such means will be used to cause the [victim] to engage in a commercial sex act\" or (2) \"that the [victim] has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2015). Fulton was convicted on four of these substantive counts. For two of them, Counts 2 and 7, the district court instructed the jury to look only for the second of the two possible findings. Conviction on those counts is not contested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On Counts 4 and 6, the district court instructed the jury that it could make either finding. Accordingly, the jury entered special findings on Counts 4 and 6 that Fulton \"used force, threats of force, fraud or coercion\" and \"at the time of the offense, the victim had attained the age of 14 years but had not attained the age of 18 years.\" Fulton argues there was insufficient\n   evidence for the jury to find he \"used force, threats of force, fraud or coercion\" on these two counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Fulton moved in the district court for a judgment of acquittal after the Government's case-in-chief. He renewed the motion after his own case-in-chief. Consequently, we review his evidentiary sufficiency contentions\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   ; the analysis considers \"all evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\" and asks \"only whether the jury's decision was rational, not whether it was correct.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340400\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/837/#p841\">\n    774 F.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (5th Cir. 2014) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There is evidence Fulton used force and threats with the minor victims associated with Counts 4 and 6. There was testimony he threatened to \"beat ... up\" one victim. He also hit the other victim because she was leaving him, making \"a big handprint on [her] face.\" That victim further testified Fulton choked her for \"talking to other guys.\" There was also testimony that Fulton emotionally and financially manipulated the victims so as to support a finding of coercion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1591(e)(2), (e)(4) (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even if this evidence were not sufficient, Fulton's convictions would be unaffected. Either one of the special findings in Counts 4 and 6 supported a conviction under Section 1591(a). A finding of force, threats, fraud, or coercion carried a minimum sentence of 15 years; a finding that the victim \"had attained the age of 14 years but had not attained the age of 18 years\" carried a minimum sentence of 10 years. \u00a7 1591(b). Either finding carried a maximum sentence of life.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340400\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/837/#p841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even if we hold the findings of force, threats, fraud, or coercion were not supported by sufficient evidence, it remains true the jury found the victims to be younger than 18. That leaves Fulton guilty under Counts 4 and 6 with a maximum sentence of life, which he received for both. We leave his convictions on Counts 4 and 6 undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Grand Jury Clause violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The final issue concerns what is argued to be effectively an improper amendment of the indictment concerning Fulton's knowledge of the age of his victims. Section 1591(a) permits the Government to convict a defendant on alternative theories. For one of the theories, the Government is not required to prove that the defendant \"knew, or recklessly disregarded the fact, that the person had not attained the age of 18 years.\" \u00a7 1591(c). Instead, the evidence only has to prove that \"the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the\" victim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340400\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/837/#p841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fulton's indictment does not mention this \"reasonable opportunity to observe\" concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fulton argues on appeal that the district court imported this concept into the case by giving this jury instruction: \"If the Government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the [alleged victims] ... then the government does not have to prove that the defendant knew that the person had not attained the age of 18 years.\" Fulton argues this instruction allowed the jury to convict on a basis broader than that stated by the indictment. He did not make this argument in district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Our analysis starts with the special role of indictments under our Constitution: \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\" U.S. CONST. amend V. A district court errs by \"permit[ting] the defendant to be convicted upon a factual basis that effectively modifies an essential element of the offense charged or permits the government to convict [a] defendant on a materially different theory or set of facts\n   than that with which she was charged.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
