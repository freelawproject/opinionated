Judge Niemeyer wrote the opinion, in which Judge Quattlebaum and Senior Judge Shedd joined.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-11\">\n   NIEMEYER, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The District of Columbia and the State of Maryland commenced this action against Donald J. Trump in his official\n   capacity as President of the United States and in his individual capacity, alleging that he violated the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Foreign Emoluments Clause provides that no officer of the United States shall \"accept\" any \"present, Emolument, Office, or Title ... from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 8. And the Domestic Emoluments Clause provides that the President shall receive \"Compensation\" \"for his Services\" but not \"any other Emolument\" from the United States or any State. U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 7. The District and Maryland contend that the President's \"continued ownership interest in a global business empire\" provides him with \"millions of dollars in payments, benefits, and other valuable consideration from foreign governments and persons acting on their behalf, as well as federal agencies and state governments,\" and that the President is therefore receiving \"emoluments\" that are prohibited by the Clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their complaint, the District and Maryland allege that the President's ongoing constitutional violations harm their sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests, particularly (1) Maryland's interest as a separate sovereign State in securing adherence to the terms on which it agreed to enter the Union; (2) the District and Maryland's interests in not being pressured to grant, or being perceived as granting, \"special treatment to the [President] and his extensive affiliated enterprises\"; (3) the District and Maryland's interests in protecting the economic well-being of their residents, who, as competitors of the President, are injured by \"decreased business, wages, and tips resulting from economic and commercial activity diverted\" to the President's businesses; (4) Maryland's interest in avoiding a \"reduction in tax revenue that flows from [the alleged] violations\"; and (5) the District and Maryland's interests as proprietors of businesses that compete with the President's businesses. For relief, the District and Maryland seek a declaratory judgment that the President has violated the Emoluments Clauses and injunctive relief prohibiting future violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The President, in his official capacity, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), contending, among other things, that the District and Maryland lack standing to bring their action; that they do not have equitable causes of action to enforce the Emoluments Clauses; and that he has not received \"emoluments\" as prohibited by the Clauses. The President also filed a separate motion to dismiss in his individual capacity under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), contending additionally that he has absolute immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court treated the President's motions piecemeal. First, by an opinion and order dated March 28, 2018, the court denied the President's motion filed in his official capacity \"insofar as it dispute[d] Plaintiffs' standing to challenge the involvement of the President with respect to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. and its appurtenances and any and all operations of the Trump Organization with respect to the same\"; it granted the motion with respect to the \"operations of the Trump Organization and the President's involvement in the same outside the District of Columbia,\" concluding that the District and Maryland lacked standing to pursue any claims premised on such operations; and it deferred ruling on the other questions raised by the motion. The court also deferred ruling on the motion filed by the President in his individual capacity. Then, by an opinion and order dated July 25, 2018, the court concluded that the District and Maryland's complaint\n   stated valid claims under the Emoluments Clauses and accordingly denied the President's motion to dismiss filed in his official capacity insofar as the claims were made against him with respect to the Trump International Hotel and all its appurtenances in Washington, D.C. The court again deferred ruling on the President's motion to dismiss filed in his individual capacity, which included the President's assertion of absolute immunity. Also with the July 25 order, the court directed the parties to submit a joint recommendation with respect to the next steps to be taken in the litigation, including an outline of proposed discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The President, contending that the district court's rulings in both orders involved \"controlling question[s] of law as to which there [was] substantial ground for a difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order[s] [would] materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,\" filed a motion with the district court requesting that the court certify its orders for appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). By order dated November 2, 2018, the court denied the motion, concluding that \"the President has failed to identify a controlling question of law decided by this court as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion justifying appellate review that would materially advance the ultimate termination of the case or even the material narrowing of issues.\" This ruling left the action to proceed forward in the district court, including discovery against the President.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Seeking to avoid \"intrusive discovery into [his] personal financial affairs and the official actions of his Administration,\" the President in his official capacity then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this court seeking an order (1) directing the district court to certify its orders for appeal under \u00a7 1292(b), or (2) directing the court to dismiss the District and Maryland's complaint outright. He also filed a motion for a stay of the district court proceedings. While acknowledging that \"a district court normally has wide discretion to determine whether the criteria for certification under \u00a7 1292(b) are satisfied,\" the President contends that mandamus \"is a necessary safety valve in the extraordinary situation here, where a district court has insisted in retaining jurisdiction over what all reasonable jurists would recognize is a paradigmatic case for certification of [an] interlocutory appeal under \u00a7 1292(b).\" The President also filed an appeal with respect to the court's failure to address his assertion of absolute immunity on the claims made against him in his individual capacity, contending that by opening discovery against him, the court effectively denied him immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By order dated December 20, 2018, we granted the President's motion for a stay of the proceedings in the district court pending our rulings on his petition for a writ of mandamus and his appeal. We also determined to consider separately the mandamus petition and the appeal, ordering oral arguments on them seriatim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We now grant the President's petition for a writ of mandamus and, exercising jurisdiction through operation of \u00a7 1292(b), reverse the district court's orders, concluding that the District and Maryland lack standing under Article III. And in the separate appeal, No. 18-2488, that we also decide today, we likewise reverse due to the District and Maryland's lack of standing. Based on the decisions in this appeal and in appeal No. 18-2488, we remand with instructions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District and Maryland's complaint alleges that the President's continued interest\n   in the Trump Organization - specifically in hotels and related properties - results in him receiving \"emoluments\" from various government entities and officials, both foreign and domestic, and that such receipts violate the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With regard to the Foreign Emoluments Clause, the complaint alleges that the President is benefiting and will continue to benefit from the business conducted by the Trump Organization with foreign governments, instrumentalities, and officials. Focusing on the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., in which the President has a 76% interest, the complaint alleges that the Hotel markets itself to the diplomatic community and that, as a result, (1) the Embassy of Kuwait held its National Day celebration at the Hotel on February 22, 2017, spending an estimated $40,000 to $60,000; (2) the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \"spent thousands of dollars on rooms, catering, and parking\" at the Hotel in January and February 2017; and (3) Georgia's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations stayed at the Hotel at the Georgian government's expense. Beyond benefits received from the Hotel, the complaint also alleges that the President has violated the Foreign Emoluments Clause by receiving (1) income from various foreign states and foreign officials patronizing Trump Tower and Trump World Tower in New York City; (2) a favorable trademark decision from the Chinese government; (3) income from the international distribution of \"The Apprentice\" and its spinoffs; and (4) income from real estate projects in which the Trump Organization is engaged in the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With regard to the Domestic Emoluments Clause, the complaint, again focusing on the Trump International Hotel, alleges that the Hotel, which leases the Old Post Office Building from the General Services Administration (\"GSA\"), a federal agency, received a benefit from the GSA in March 2017, after the President was inaugurated. While the Hotel's lease agreement provided that \"no ... elected official of the Government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom,\" the GSA amended the lease agreement and issued a letter stating that the Hotel \"is in full compliance with [the Lease] and, accordingly, the Lease is valid and in full force and effect.\" The complaint claims that this \"forbearing from enforcing\" the terms of the original lease agreement amounted to an \"emolument\" in violation of the Domestic Emoluments Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The complaint also alleges that the President, \"through entities he owns,\" is seeking a $32 million historic-preservation tax credit for the Hotel and that, if the National Park Service approves the credit, it \"may constitute an emolument, in violation of the Domestic Emoluments Clause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, the complaint alleges that the State Department and U.S. Embassies have promoted the Mar-a-Lago Club - a business owned by the President in Palm Beach, Florida - and that \"federal, state, and local governments, or their instrumentalities have made and will continue to make payments for the use of the facilities owned or operated by [the President] for a variety of functions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To support their standing to sue the President, the District and Maryland allege that because of the President's constitutional violations, they suffer \"harm to their sovereign and/or quasi-sovereign interests,\" as well as \"proprietary and other financial harms.\" Regarding sovereign interests in particular, Maryland alleges that it has a \"sovereign interest in enforcing\n   the terms on which it agreed to enter the Union,\" and the District and Maryland allege that each has an interest in the enforcement of its laws relating to property that the President or his business organizations own or might seek to acquire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to the District and Maryland's quasi-sovereign interests, the complaint alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The [President's] acceptance or receipt of presents and emoluments in violation of the Constitution presents the District and Maryland with an intolerable dilemma: either (1) grant the [Trump] Organization's requests for concessions, exemptions, waivers, variances, and the like and suffer the consequences, potentially including lost revenue and compromised enforcement of environmental protection, zoning, and land use regulations, or (2) deny such requests and be placed at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis states and other government entities that have granted or will agree to such concessions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition, the complaint alleges that the District and Maryland have a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   interest in protecting their citizens from economic injury caused by the \"payment of presents and emoluments to the [President's businesses],\" asserting that such payments \"tilt[ ] the competitive playing field toward [his] businesses, causing competing companies and their employees to lose business, wages, and tips.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The complaint also alleges that the President's constitutional violations harm Maryland's tax revenue, stating in particular that the Trump International Hotel will have an adverse effect on tax revenue from the National Harbor development in Prince George's County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, with respect to their proprietary interests, the District alleges that it has a financial interest in the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, the D.C. Armory, and the Carnegie Library, and that its interests in those properties has been harmed by the President's receipt of emoluments through the Trump International Hotel, which gives the Hotel an unlawful competitive advantage. Maryland alleges similarly that it has a financial interest in the Montgomery County Conference Center in Bethesda and that the Center will suffer economic harm due to the competitive disadvantage resulting from the President's violations of the Emoluments Clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For relief, the District and Maryland seek a declaratory judgment that the President is violating the Emoluments Clauses and an injunction prohibiting future violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The President, in his official capacity, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), contending that the District and Maryland lack standing and that he has not violated the Emoluments Clauses. He also filed a separate motion to dismiss in his individual capacity, contending that he has absolute immunity. The district court treated the issues raised by the President's motions separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By an opinion and order dated March 28, 2018, the district court rejected the President's challenge to the District and Maryland's standing insofar as their claims were made in connection with the Trump International Hotel and its appurtenances in Washington, D.C. The court found that the District and Maryland had \"stated cognizable injuries to their quasi-sovereign, proprietary, and\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   interests\" and concluded that such injuries were directly traceable to the President's alleged violations of the Emoluments Clauses. But the court granted the President's motion to the extent that the District and Maryland's claims were based on the operations\n   of the Trump Organization\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Particularly as to the District and Maryland's alleged quasi-sovereign interests, the district court noted that Trump Organization hotels had obtained \"substantial tax concessions\" from the District and from the State of Mississippi; that the GSA had amended the Hotel's lease agreement; and that the Governor of Maine had stayed at the Hotel during an official visit to Washington in the spring of 2017, suggesting that the District and Maryland \"may very well feel themselves obliged,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , coerced, to patronize the Hotel in order to help them obtain federal favors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As for the District and Maryland's proprietary interests, the court concluded that Maryland had sufficiently alleged injury based on competitive harm to the Montgomery County Conference Center and that the District had sufficiently alleged injury based on competitive harm to the Washington Convention Center. The court stated that the District and Maryland had \"alleged sufficient facts to show that the President's ownership interest in the Hotel has had and almost certainly will continue to have an unlawful effect on competition, allowing an inference of impending (if not already occurring) injury\" to Maryland and the District's proprietary interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   And regarding the District and Maryland's\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   interests, the court concluded that both the District and Maryland \"have sufficiently stated a concrete injury-in-fact to their\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   interest in protecting the economic welfare of their residents.\" Citing the large size of the hospitality industry within and bordering Washington, D.C., the court reasoned that \"a large number of Maryland and District of Columbia residents are being affected and will continue to be affected when foreign and state governments choose to stay, host events, or dine at the Hotel rather than at comparable Maryland or District of Columbia establishments, in whole or in substantial part simply because of the President's association with it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In its March 28, 2018 opinion and order, the district court deferred ruling on the remaining issues raised by the President's motion filed in his official capacity. It also deferred ruling on the President's separate motion filed in his individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On July 25, 2018, the district court issued another opinion and order, holding that the term emolument means \"any profit, gain, or advantage\" and that the various benefits alleged in the complaint to have been received by the President therefore qualified as \"emoluments\" under the Emoluments Clauses. In this opinion, the district court again deferred ruling on the President's motion to dismiss the claims against him in his individual capacity, thus declining again to address the President's assertion of absolute immunity. Nonetheless, the court allowed the case to proceed with discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In short, the district court denied the President's motion to dismiss the claims against him in his official capacity insofar as they pertained to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. And it deferred ruling on the President's motion to dismiss the claims against him in his individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The President then filed a motion requesting that the district court certify its orders for appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). But the court denied the motion, concluding that its orders did not satisfy the statute's criteria that an order involve a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from such order would materially advance the ultimate termination of the\n   litigation. In so concluding, the court reiterated the reasoning of its earlier rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Following the district court's denial of his motion for \u00a7 1292(b) certification, the President, in his official capacity, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this court, seeking an order \"directing the district court to certify its orders denying dismissal of [the] plaintiffs' complaint for immediate appellate review\" or \"directing the district court to dismiss [the] plaintiffs' complaint outright.\" He also requested a stay of the district court proceedings pending resolution of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   By order dated December 20, 2018, we granted the President's request for a stay and scheduled the President's petition for oral argument, directing that the parties be prepared to argue \"not only the procedural issues regarding the mandamus petition but also the underlying issues of (1) whether the two Emoluments Clauses provide plaintiffs with a cause of action to seek injunctive relief and (2) whether the plaintiffs have alleged legally cognizable injuries sufficient to support standing to obtain relief against the President.\" We conducted oral argument on March 19, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With his petition for a writ of mandamus, the President requests that we direct the district court to certify for interlocutory appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) its orders of March 28 and July 25, 2018, which the court refused to do. That request is indeed an extraordinary one, as petitions for writs of mandamus are rarely given, and the district court's refusal to certify was an exercise of broad discretion. But, in the same vein, the District and Maryland's suit is also an extraordinary one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, the suit is brought directly under the Constitution without a statutory cause of action, seeking to enforce the Emoluments Clauses which, by their terms, give no rights and provide no remedies. Second, the suit seeks an injunction directly against a sitting President, the Nation's chief executive officer. Third, up until the series of suits recently brought against this President under the Emoluments Clauses, no court has ever entertained a claim to enforce them. Fourth, this and the similar suits now pending under the Emoluments Clauses raise novel and difficult constitutional questions, for which there is no precedent. Fifth, the District and Maryland have manifested substantial difficulty articulating how they are harmed by the President's alleged receipts of emoluments and the nature of the relief that could redress any harm so conceived. Sixth, to allow such a suit to go forward in the district court without a resolution of the controlling issues by a court of appeals could result in an unnecessary intrusion into the duties and affairs of a sitting President. Accordingly, not only is this suit extraordinary, it also has national significance and is of special consequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The criteria for granting petitions for writs of mandamus and \u00a7 1292(b) certifications are well established. A party seeking a writ of mandamus must demonstrate (1) that it has a \"clear and indisputable\" right; (2) that there are \"no other adequate means\" to vindicate that right; and (3) that the writ is \"appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527206\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/367/#p380\">\n    542 U.S. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380-81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527206\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/367/#p380\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527206\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/367/#p380\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Under these principles, it is understood that a writ of mandamus can properly issue to remedy a \"clear abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 390,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527206\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/367/#p380\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[U]nder principles of mandamus jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals may exercise its power to issue the writ only upon a finding of 'exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial\n   usurpation of power,' or a '\n   <em>\n    clear abuse of discretion\n   </em>\n   .' As this case implicates the separation of powers, the Court of Appeals must also ask, as part of this inquiry, whether the District Court's actions constituted an\n   <em>\n    unwarranted impairment\n   </em>\n   of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties\" (emphasis added) (citations omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To be sure, the discretion conferred on district courts by \u00a7 1292(b) is broad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swint v.

It is only natural that interest in his properties has generally increased since he became President. As such, despite any alleged violation on Defendant's part, the Hospitality Plaintiffs may face a tougher competitive market overall. Aside from Defendant's public profile, there are a number of reasons why patrons may choose to visit Defendant's hotels and restaurants including service, quality, location, price and other factors related to individual preference. Therefore, the connection between the Hospitality Plaintiffs' alleged injury and Defendant's actions is too tenuous to satisfy Article III's causation requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, the Hospitality Plaintiffs cannot establish that it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Plaintiffs seek an injunction preventing Defendant from violating the Emoluments Clauses. They argue that such injunction would \"stop the source of intensified competition and provide redress.\" Even if it were determined that the Defendant personally accepting any income from the Trump Organization's business with foreign and domestic governments was a violation of the Emoluments Clauses, it is entirely speculative what effect, if any, an injunction would have on the competition Plaintiffs claim they face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ... Were Defendant not to personally accept any income from government business, this Court would have no power to lessen the competition inherent in any patron's choice of hotel or restaurant. ... [T]he Emoluments Clauses prohibit Defendant from receiving gifts and emoluments. They do not prohibit Defendant's businesses from competing directly with the Hospitality Plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Furthermore, notwithstanding an injunction from this Court, Congress could still consent and allow Defendant to continue to accept payments from foreign governments in competition with Plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Thus, while a court order enjoining Defendant may stop his alleged constitutional violations, it would not ultimately redress the Hospitality Plaintiffs' alleged competitive injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418425\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418425\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/174/\">\n    at 185-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

Therefore, the Hospitality Plaintiffs' theory that the Clauses protect them from increased competition in the market for government business must be rejected, especially when (1) the Clauses offer no protection from increased competition in the market for non-government business and (2) with Congressional consent, the Constitution allows federal officials to accept foreign gifts and emoluments, regardless of its effect on competition.

This is so because \u00a7 1292(b), while mandating certification when the statutory criteria are met, nonetheless places broad discretion for finding that the criteria are satisfied in the district courts. The statute confers discretion on courts of appeals as a separate and distinct responsibility for its operation, providing that \"[t]he Court of Appeals ... may thereupon [after the district court's certification],\n   <em>\n    in its discretion\n   </em>\n   , permit an appeal to be taken from such order.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added).

As the Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   In limiting the judicial power to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies,\" Article III of the Constitution restricts it to the traditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to redress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to persons caused by private or official violation of law. Except when necessary in the execution of that function, courts have no charter to review and revise legislative and executive action. This limitation is founded in concern about the proper - and properly limited - role of the courts in a democratic society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The doctrine of standing is one of several doctrines that reflect this fundamental limitation. It requires federal courts to satisfy themselves that the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   invocation of federal-court jurisdiction. He bears the burden of showing that he has standing for each type of relief sought. To seek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must show that he is under threat of suffering \"injury in fact\" that is concrete and particularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the injury. This requirement assures that there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review in\n   order to protect the interests of the complaining party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Summers v.

The District and Maryland rely on these theories on appeal, and we address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The district court held that the District and Maryland have standing based on harm to the District's proprietary interest in the Washington Convention Center and Maryland's proprietary interest in the Montgomery County Conference Center, reasoning that the President's receipt of emoluments from the Trump International Hotel provides the Hotel with an illegal competitive advantage and thus diverts business away from these properties. In so holding, the court accepted the District and Maryland's invocation of the \"competitive standing doctrine,\" the \"nub\" of which is that \"when a challenged [government] action authorizes allegedly illegal transactions that will\n   <em>\n    almost surely\n   </em>\n   cause [the plaintiff] to lose business, there is no need to wait for injury from specific transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    DEK Energy Co. v.

Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   But even were the \"competitive standing doctrine\" to be accepted in this circuit, the doctrine is an\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   of Article III standing principles, not a relaxation of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DEK Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678028,11107631\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/1192/\">\n    248 F.3d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we must still determine whether the standard requirements for Article III standing are satisfied. And to do so, we assess whether the District and Maryland have demonstrated that President Trump's allegedly illegal conduct -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , his receipt of funds from foreign and state governments patronizing the Hotel - has\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   harm to their proprietary interests and that enjoining that conduct would\n   <em>\n    redress\n   </em>\n   such harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p492\">\n    555 U.S. at 492-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p492\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Upon conducting that assessment, we conclude that the District and Maryland's complaint fails to make a sufficient showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To begin, the District and Maryland's theory of proprietary harm hinges on the conclusion that government customers are patronizing the Hotel\n   <em>\n    because the Hotel distributes profits or dividends to the President\n   </em>\n   , rather than due to any of the Hotel's other characteristics.

And, even if government officials were patronizing the Hotel to curry the President's favor, there is no reason to conclude that they would cease doing so were the President enjoined from receiving income from the Hotel. After all, the Hotel would still be publicly associated with the President, would still bear his name, and would still financially benefit members of his family. In short, the link between government officials' patronage of the Hotel and the Hotel's payment of profits or dividends to the President himself is simply too attenuated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Moreover, the likelihood that an injunction barring the President from receiving money from the Hotel would not cause government officials to cease patronizing the Hotel demonstrates a lack of redressability, independently barring a finding of standing.

We have never accepted such a boundless theory of standing. The cases [the plaintiff] cites for this remarkable proposition stand for no such thing. In each of those cases, standing was based on an injury more particularized and more concrete than the mere assertion that something unlawful benefited the plaintiff's competitor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Already, LLC v.

The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Schlesinger\n   </em>\n   alleged that certain members of Congress were violating the Incompatibility Clause, which provides that \"no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office,\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2. To support Article III standing, the plaintiffs claimed that they \"suffered injury because Members of Congress holding a ... position in the Executive Branch were ... subject to the possibility of undue influence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172406\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172406\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/208/\">\n    at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172406\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/208/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, with reasoning that is readily applicable here, concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   It is nothing more than a matter of speculation whether the claimed nonobservance of that Clause deprives citizens of the faithful discharge of the legislative duties of reservist Members of Congress. And that claimed nonobservance, standing alone, would adversely affect only the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance, and that is an abstract injury. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   The District Court acknowledged that any injury resulting from the reservist status of Members of Congress was hypothetical, but stressed that the Incompatibility Clause was designed to prohibit such potential for injury. This rationale fails, however, to compensate for the respondents' failure to present a claim under that Clause which alleges concrete injury. The claims of respondents here ... would require courts to deal with a difficult and sensitive issue of constitutional adjudication on the\n   complaint of one who does not allege a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Furthermore, to have reached the conclusion that respondents' interests as citizens were meant to be protected by the Incompatibility Clause because the primary purpose of the Clause was to insure independence of each of the branches of the Federal Government, similarly involved an appraisal of the merits before the issue of standing was resolved. All citizens, of course, share equally an interest in the independence of each branch of Government. In some fashion, every provision of the Constitution was meant to serve the interests of all. Such a generalized interest, however, is too abstract to constitute a 'case or controversy' appropriate for judicial resolution. The proposition that all constitutional provisions are enforceable by any citizen simply because citizens are the ultimate beneficiaries of those provisions has no boundaries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Closely linked to the idea that generalized citizen interest is a sufficient basis for standing was the District Court's observation that it was not irrelevant that if respondents could not obtain judicial review of petitioners' action, 'then as a practical matter no one can.' Our system of government leaves many crucial decisions to the political processes. The assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172406\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172406\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/208/\">\n    at 217, 224, 226-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172406\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/208/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172278\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/166/#p179\">\n    418 U.S. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172278\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/166/#p179\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172278\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/166/#p179\">\n    41 L.Ed.2d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that plaintiff lacked standing to sue to enforce the Accounts Clause, U.S. Const. art.
