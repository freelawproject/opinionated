All told, the data breaches affected more than twenty-one million people. Unsurprisingly, given the scale of the attacks and the sensitive nature of the information stolen, news of the breaches generated not only widespread alarm, but also several lawsuits. These suits were ultimately consolidated into two complaints: one filed by the National Treasury Employees Union and three of its members, and another filed by the American Federation of Government Employees on behalf of several individual plaintiffs and a putative class of others similarly affected by the breaches. Both sets of plaintiffs alleged that OPM's cybersecurity practices were woefully inadequate, enabling the hackers to gain access to the agency's treasure trove of employee information, which in turn exposed plaintiffs to a heightened risk of identity theft and a host of other injuries. The district court dismissed both complaints for lack of Article III standing and failure to state a claim. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse in part and affirm in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As its name suggests, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management serves as the federal government's chief human resources agency. In that capacity, OPM maintains electronic personnel files that contain, among other information, copies of federal employees' birth certificates, military service records, and job applications identifying Social Security numbers and birth dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The agency also oversees more than two million background checks and security clearance investigations per year. To facilitate these investigations, OPM collects a tremendous amount of sensitive personal information from current and prospective federal workers, most of which it then stores electronically in a \"Central Verification System.\" Consolidated Amended Complaint,\n   <em>\n    In re United States Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Security Breach Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15-mc-01394, \u00b6 65 (D.D.C. March 14, 2016) (\"Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl.\"), J.A. 61. The investigation-related information stored by OPM includes birth dates, Social Security numbers, residency details, passport information, fingerprints, and other records pertaining to employees' criminal histories, psychological and emotional health, and finances. In recent years, OPM has relied on a private investigation and security firm, KeyPoint Government Solutions, Inc. (\"KeyPoint\"), to conduct the lion's share of the agency's background and security clearance investigation fieldwork. KeyPoint investigators have access to the information stored in OPM's Central Verification System and can transmit data to and from the agency's network through an electronic portal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It turns out that authorized KeyPoint investigators have not been the only third parties to access OPM's data systems. Cyberattackers hacked into the agency's network on several occasions between November 2013 and November 2014. Undetected for months, at least two of these breaches resulted in the theft of vast quantities of personal information. According to the complaint, after breaching OPM's network \"using stolen KeyPoint credentials\" around May 2014, Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6 127, J.A. 73, the cyberintruders extracted almost 21.5 million background investigation records from the agency's Central Verification System. They gained access to another OPM system near the end of 2014, stealing over four million federal employees' personnel files. Among the types of information compromised were current and prospective employees' Social Security numbers, birth dates, and residency details, along with approximately 5.6 million sets of fingerprints. The breaches also exposed the Social Security numbers and birth dates of the spouses and cohabitants of those who, in order to obtain a security clearance, completed a Standard Form 86. According to the complaints, since these 2014 breaches, individuals whose information was stolen have experienced incidents of financial fraud and identity theft; many others whose information has not been misused-at least, not yet-remain concerned about the ongoing risk that they, too, will become victims of financial fraud and identity theft in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After announcing the breaches in the summer of 2015, OPM initially offered individuals whose information had been compromised fraud monitoring and identity theft protection services and insurance at no cost for either eighteen months or three years, depending on whether their Social Security numbers had been exposed. But OPM's offer failed to address the concerns of all such parties, and the agency soon found itself named as a defendant in breach-related lawsuits across the country. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred these actions to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for coordinated pretrial proceedings. The suits were ultimately consolidated into two complaints: one brought by the American Federation of Government Employees on behalf of thirty-eight individuals affected by the breaches and a putative class of similarly situated breach victims (\"Arnold Plaintiffs\") and another for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by the National Treasury Employees Union (\"NTEU\") and three of its members\n   (\"NTEU Plaintiffs\"). Below we summarize the relevant allegations and claims contained in each complaint, accepting all factual allegations \"as true\" and drawing \"reasonable inferences * * * in the plaintiffs' favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Philipp v.

Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6 222, J.A. 98. Specifically, they assert that \"KeyPoint knew or should have known that its information security defenses did not reasonably or effectively protect Plaintiffs' and Class members' [personal information] and the credentials used to access it on KeyPoint's and OPM's systems.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517492,12517493\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As for OPM, Arnold Plaintiffs allege that the agency had long been on notice that its systems were prime targets for cyberattackers. OPM experienced data breaches related to cyberattacks in 2009 and 2012, and it is no secret that its network is regularly subject to a strikingly large number of hacking attempts. Despite this, say Arnold Plaintiffs, OPM repeatedly failed to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203541\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (repealed 2014), and its replacement, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (collectively, \"Information Security Act\"), which require agencies to \"develop, implement, and maintain a security program that assesses information security risks and provides adequate security for the operations and assets of programs and software systems under agency and contractor control.\" Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6 83, J.A. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As early as 2007, Information Security Act compliance audits conducted by OPM's Office of the Inspector General regularly identified major information security deficiencies that left the agency's network vulnerable to attack. Such problems included \"severely outdated\" security policies and procedures, understaffed and undertrained cybersecurity personnel, and a lack of a centralized information security management structure. Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-95, J.A. 67-68. As a result, in every year from 2007 through 2013, the Inspector General identified \"serious concerns that * * * pose an immediate risk to the security of assets or operations\"-termed \"material weaknesses\"-in the agency's information security governance program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 87-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , J.A. 66;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 90-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , J.A. 66-68 (listing those weaknesses).

Specifically, in 2014, the agency failed to complete an Information Security Act-required Security Assessment and Authorization for eleven of the twenty-one OPM systems due for reauthorization. Because the agency was unable to ensure the functionality of security controls for the systems that lacked a valid authorization-one of which was \"a general system that supported and provided the electronic platform for approximately two-thirds of all information systems operated by OPM\"-the Inspector General advised the agency to shut them down.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 102-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , J.A. 69-70. Despite the Inspector General's recommendation, OPM continued to operate the systems. The agency compounded existing security vulnerabilities by failing to encrypt sensitive data-including Social Security numbers-and\n   failing to enforce multifactor authentication requirements. To make matters worse, when the 2014 data breaches occurred, the agency lacked a centralized network security operations center from which it could continuously and comprehensively monitor all system security controls and threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The 2014 cyberattacks were \"sophisticated, malicious, and carried out to obtain sensitive information for improper use.\" Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 128, 132, J.A. 73-74. Arnold Plaintiffs assert that as a result of these attacks, they have suffered from a variety of harms, including the improper use of their Social Security numbers, unauthorized charges to existing credit card and bank accounts, fraudulent openings of new credit card and other financial accounts, and the filing of fraudulent tax returns in their names. At least three named Arnold Plaintiffs purchased credit monitoring services after falling victim to such fraud; others have spent time and money attempting to unwind fraudulent transactions made in their names. And some Arnold Plaintiffs who have yet to experience a fraud incident purchased credit monitoring services and spent extra time monitoring their accounts to mitigate the \"increased risk\" of identity theft caused by the breaches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203551\">\n    \u00b6 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , J.A. 81-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Arnold Plaintiffs assert several claims against OPM, but they press only one on appeal: that the agency \"willfully failed\" to establish appropriate safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of their private information, in violation of Section 552a(e)(10) of the Privacy Act of 1974. Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6 182, J.A. 89;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(10) (requiring the agency to \"establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained\").

Arnold Plaintiffs seek damages from OPM under the Privacy Act; from KeyPoint, they request money damages and an order requiring the company to extend free lifetime identity theft and fraud protection services to all putative class members, among other things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The other complaint, filed by the National Treasury Employees Union, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the Acting Director of OPM in her official capacity based on essentially the same set of facts.

According to the complaint, the agency's Inspector General warned at the end of 2015 that OPM was ill-equipped to protect itself from another attack, given \"the overall lack of compliance that seems to permeate the agency's IT security program.\" NTEU Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6 88, J.A. 182 (quoting United States Office of Pers.

NTEU Plaintiffs seek a declaration that OPM's failure to protect their information violated their putative constitutional right to informational privacy and an order requiring the agency to provide them with free lifetime credit monitoring and identity theft protection.

OPM moved to dismiss NTEU Plaintiffs' complaint for lack of standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted-that is, failure to allege a cognizable constitutional violation. The district court granted both motions to dismiss on the ground that neither Arnold Plaintiffs nor NTEU Plaintiffs pled sufficient facts to demonstrate Article III standing. Rejecting plaintiffs' argument that they faced a heightened risk of identity theft due to the breaches, the court held that the facts alleged failed to plausibly support the conclusion that this risk of future injury was either substantial or clearly impending. The district court ultimately concluded that only those plaintiffs who specifically identified out-of-pocket losses stemming from the actual misuse of their data had suffered an injury in fact sufficient for standing purposes. But even those plaintiffs lacked standing, the district court concluded, because they failed to allege facts demonstrating that the misuse of their information was traceable to the OPM breaches in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court went on to explain that it also lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Arnold Plaintiffs' claims for the additional reasons that (i) they failed to plead the actual damages necessary to bring them within the Privacy Act's waiver of sovereign immunity; and (ii) as a government contractor, KeyPoint enjoyed derivative sovereign immunity from suit. Finally, the court concluded that Arnold Plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege a Privacy Act claim and that NTEU Plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a constitutional claim. Both sets of plaintiffs have appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We reverse in part and affirm in part the district court's judgment. We hold that both sets of plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to satisfy Article III standing requirements. Arnold Plaintiffs have stated a claim for damages under the Privacy Act, and have unlocked OPM's waiver of sovereign immunity, by alleging OPM's knowing refusal to establish appropriate information security safeguards. KeyPoint is not entitled to derivative sovereign immunity because it has not shown that its alleged security faults were directed by the government, and it is alleged to have violated the Privacy Act standards incorporated into its contract with OPM. Finally,\n   we agree with the district court that, assuming a constitutional right to informational privacy, NTEU Plaintiffs have not alleged any violation of such a right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing consists of three elements.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

Accordingly, we explained, \"[n]o long sequence of uncertain contingencies involving multiple independent actors has to occur before the plaintiffs in this case will suffer any harm; a substantial risk of harm exists already, simply by virtue of the hack and the nature of the data that the plaintiffs allege was taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 629.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although the OPM cyberattacks differ in several respects from the breach at issue in\n   <em>\n    Attias\n   </em>\n   , there is no question that the OPM hackers, too, now have in their possession all the information needed to steal Arnold Plaintiffs' identities. Arnold Plaintiffs have alleged that the hackers stole Social Security numbers, birth dates, fingerprints, and addresses, among other sensitive personal information. It hardly takes a criminal mastermind to imagine how such information could be used to commit identity theft. Indeed, several Arnold Plaintiffs claim that they have already experienced various types of identity theft, including the unauthorized opening of new credit card and other financial accounts and the filing of fraudulent tax returns in their names. Moreover, unlike existing credit card numbers, which, if compromised, can be changed to prevent future fraud, Social Security numbers and addresses cannot so readily be swapped out for new ones. And, of course, our birth dates and fingerprints are with us forever. Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Arnold Plaintiffs, as we must, we conclude that not only do the incidents of identity theft that have already occurred illustrate the nefarious uses to which the stolen information may be put, but they also support the inference that Arnold Plaintiffs face a substantial-as opposed to a merely speculative or theoretical-risk of future identity theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is worth noting that several Arnold Plaintiffs also allege that unauthorized charges have appeared on their existing credit card and bank account statements since the breaches. According to OPM, because none of these Arnold Plaintiffs \"specifically alleged the OPM incidents affected their existing account information,\" the reported incidents of fraud on existing accounts (and, presumably, the risk of future fraud on those accounts) cannot plausibly be attributed to the OPM breaches. Gov't Br. 21. But we need not travel down that road because, regardless of whether the hackers obtained all the information necessary to make unauthorized charges to existing accounts, it is undisputed that the other forms of fraud alleged-the opening of new accounts and the filing of fraudulent tax returns-may be accomplished using the information stolen during the breaches at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   OPM argues that Arnold Plaintiffs' allegations of \"scattered instances of widely varying fraud\" are insufficient to support a plausible inference that Arnold Plaintiffs face an ongoing, substantial risk of identity theft. Gov't Br. 20. Specifically, OPM contends that despite the sensitive nature of the information stolen in the attacks, \"[i]t is impossible under these circumstances to 'easily construct any kind of colorable theory' that a desire to commit fraud motivated\" the OPM breaches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re OPM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263656\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1/#p35\">\n    266 F. Supp. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   38 ). This is especially the case, OPM argues, because \"this is not just a data breach,\" but rather\n   \"a data breach arising out of a particular sort of cyberattack\" against the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263656\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263656\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1/#p35\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re OPM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263656\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1/#p35\">\n    266 F.

According to OPM, it is illogical to assume that the same goals that typically motivate hackers of commercial databases animated the \"sophisticated\" actors who engineered these data breaches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263656\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263656\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1/#p35\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court agreed with OPM on this point. Although neither amended complaint contains any allegations regarding the cyberattackers' identity, the court noted that news articles and congressional reports had suggested that the suspected perpetrator was not a common criminal, but rather the Chinese government. Despite acknowledging that \"a finding concerning the source of the breach\" was \"beyond the scope of [the] proceeding at this juncture,\" the court appears to have relied at least partially on this external information in reaching the conclusion that it was implausible that the OPM hackers intended to steal Arnold Plaintiffs' identities.\n   <em>\n    In re OPM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263656\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1/#p35\">\n    266 F.

Beyond that, although a cyberattack on a government system might well be motivated by a purpose other than identity theft, given the type of information stolen in the OPM breaches and Arnold Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the subsequent misuse of that information, it is just as plausible to infer that identity theft is at least one of the hackers' goals, even if those hackers are indeed affiliated with a foreign government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Our dissenting colleague takes a different tack, suggesting that because this case involves\n   <em>\n    government\n   </em>\n   databases, \"espionage * * * is * * * an 'obvious alternative explanation' \" for the attacks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op. at 77 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Although the passage of two years in a run-of-the-mill data breach case might, absent allegations of subsequent data misuse, suggest that a claim of future injury is less than plausible, that is not the situation we face here. Conducted over several months by sophisticated and apparently quite patient cyberhackers, the attacks at issue in this case affected over twenty-one million people and involved information far more sensitive than credit card numbers.

The district court did not go on to consider whether Arnold Plaintiffs plausibly alleged that a risk of\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   identity theft was fairly traceable to OPM's and KeyPoint's cybersecurity failings, presumably because it had already rejected that risk as merely speculative. We can make relatively short work of such an inquiry here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Arnold Plaintiffs have alleged facts supporting a reasonable inference that their claimed data breach-related injuries are fairly traceable to OPM's failure to secure its information systems. Not only do Arnold Plaintiffs detail OPM's failure to heed repeated warnings by its own Inspector General regarding serious vulnerabilities in the agency's systems, but they also allege that as a result of that failure, hackers managed to breach key OPM systems on several different occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   With respect to KeyPoint, Arnold Plaintiffs further allege that the company's failure to properly secure its login credentials \"was a substantial factor in causing the Data Breaches.\" Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6 228, J.A. 99. KeyPoint contends that Arnold Plaintiffs' complaint fails to trace the breaches to any actual misconduct by KeyPoint, but that argument lacks merit. Arnold Plaintiffs' complaint alleges not only that the hackers accessed OPM's systems \"using stolen KeyPoint credentials,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127, J.A. 73, but also that the company was negligent in \"failing to protect and secure its * * * credentials,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 228, J.A. 99, by, among other things, \"failing to * * * comply with industry-standard data security practices,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 223(b), J.A. 98. It is reasonable to infer that \"data security practices\" would cover practices related to securing credentials. It is likewise reasonable to infer, based on the allegations contained in the complaint, that KeyPoint is at least partially to blame for the breaches due to its failure to comply with such practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As previously explained, even if the breaches in question did not expose all information necessary to make fraudulent charges on victims' existing financial accounts, the personal data the hackers did manage to obtain is enough, by itself, to enable several forms of identity theft. That fact, combined with the allegations that at least some of the stolen information was actually misused after the breaches, suffices to support a reasonable inference that Arnold Plaintiffs' risk of future identity theft is traceable to the OPM cyberattacks. Neither the likelihood that some Arnold Plaintiffs experienced other types of unrelated fraud nor the speculative possibility that they might also have been the victims of other data breaches renders causation implausible here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zappos.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516627,12516628\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1020/\">\n    888 F.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1029 (9th Cir. 2018) (\"That hackers might have stolen Plaintiffs' [personal identifying information] in unrelated breaches, and that Plaintiffs might suffer identity theft or fraud caused by the data stolen in those other breaches * * *, is less about standing and more about the merits of causation and damages.\"),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12618784,12618785,12618780,12618781,12618782,12618783\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1373/\">\n    139 S.

Couldn't the hackers have been interested in espionage\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   identity theft?\n   <em>\n    Maj. op.\n   </em>\n   57-58. Yes, that's\n   <em>\n    conceivable\n   </em>\n   . But does the conceivability actually render plaintiffs' theory plausible? I don't think so. The majority invokes a syllogism: Because \"espionage and identity theft are not mutually exclusive,\" it follows that ascribing an \"espionage-related motive\" doesn't \"render[ ] implausible\" an allegation of \"future risk\n   of identity theft and financial fraud\" caused by the data breach.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . But it does exactly that. To begin with, even if the alternative explanations in\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   happened to be mutually exclusive with plaintiffs' theories, the Court has never suggested that mutual exclusivity is a\n   <em>\n    prerequisite\n   </em>\n   to one plausible explanation's rendering some other explanation implausible. This case shows why such a prerequisite would be overkill. Just because two states of affairs\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   co-occur doesn't make their co-occurrence\n   <em>\n    plausible\n   </em>\n   -the legal standard plaintiffs must clear-nor does an otherwise implausible theory get bootstrapped into a plausible one merely because it's conceivable that it could co-occur with an obvious alternative explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   So while a foreign government might theoretically have enlisted \"sophisticated\" hackers to execute a \"massive\" cyberattack on the U.S. government over the course of \"several months\" to steal highly \"sensitive\" information,\n   <em>\n    Maj. op.\n   </em>\n   at 59, both to (i) compromise U.S. national security\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (ii) commit fraud by (for example) purchases through an unauthorized Best Buy account (Arnold Plaintiffs' Compl. \u00b6 39, J.A. 54), this dual-motive hypothesis seems fanciful for at least two reasons. First, the goal of identity theft is financial gain. The notion that a foreign state pursuing a complex, risky, and possibly expensive cyberespionage scheme would have as even one of its goals the extraction of small-potatoes sums from individuals by, e.g., filing fraudulent returns with the\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   IRS or creating a \"My Social Security\" account, see\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 14, J.A. 40-41, falls far short of plausibility. Second, and more important, a foreign power seeking leverage over the United States would be most unlikely to permit its agents to use or sell the data for identity theft purposes, as doing so would risk\n   <em>\n    sabotaging\n   </em>\n   the espionage goal. If data gleaned from the hack is slated for counterintelligence use, identity theft would undercut this aim by alerting victims and causing them to alter their data. Since the expected value of successful counterintelligence likely far exceeds that of identity theft, an espionage explanation affirmatively suggests that identity theft\n   <em>\n    will not\n   </em>\n   co-occur. And that is precisely what the record suggests. There is, as discussed below, a striking dearth of allegations as to any pattern of unusual or higher-than-ordinary identity theft or fraud among Arnold Plaintiffs. What readily comes to mind is an obvious alternative explanation-hacking focused entirely on pursuit of espionage and kindred threats to national security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Thus the Sixth Circuit's caution-that \"[f]erreting out the most likely reason for the defendants' actions is not appropriate at the pleadings stage,\"\n   <em>\n    Watson Carpet &amp; Floor Covering, Inc. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741443\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/452/#p458\">\n    648 F.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458 (6th Cir. 2011) -is inapt here.

(emphasis added). Sorting out which among them is \"most likely\" is, indeed, out of bounds at the pleadings stage. Yet the whole thrust of my argument is that we haven't got \"several plausible explanations.\" We have one alleged theory-identity theft-that, I argue, is not plausible in view of an obvious alternative explanation of far greater probability. Though it's unimpeachable logic to say that \"[t]he plausibility of [one particular] reason for the refusals to sell carpet does not render all other reasons implausible,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., the point-made in context of a discussion of \"several plausible explanations\"-is not at play here, and marshaling it only begs the question whether identity theft is, in fact, a plausible explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   More is needed to \"nudge[ ]\" Arnold Plaintiffs' identity theft claims \"across the line from conceivable to plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p682\">\n    556 U.S. at 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p682\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p567\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p567\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). That is especially true here given the passage of time. As the initial breach occurred nearly\n   <em>\n    two years\n   </em>\n   before Arnold Plaintiffs filed their operative complaint, one would expect to see-if plaintiffs were right about the hackers' motives-some allegation linking Arnold Plaintiffs as a whole to the breach-such as indications that persons in the OPM databases suffered a relatively high rate of identity thefts, or a pattern of\n   <em>\n    similar\n   </em>\n   thefts. But there are no such allegations. And \" 'as the breaches fade further into the past,' the Plaintiffs' threatened injuries become more and more speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277363\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/262/\">\n    848 F.3d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chambliss v.

Yet my colleagues think such an inference is not fair game here, where the breach occurred on \"a massive scale\" reflecting \"a relatively new phenomenon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Large-scale hacking is no doubt a recent phenomenon. But I can think of no attributes of such phenomena or their possible novelty that would invalidate a common sense expectation that future identity-theft-type injuries will become less plausible as time drags on without result. Whatever else may be true, if identity theft is an operative motive, time remains of the essence, given that much personal data-credit card numbers, bank account information, addresses-can go stale with time. If anything, the special features of this case make the passage of time exceptionally forceful in undermining plaintiffs' theory. The extraordinary volume of people affected and the exceptional sensitivity and range of the information captured should make it relatively easy to discern a \"pattern of identity theft or financial fraud\" among the pool of 21.5 million potential victims (and litigants)-if there is one.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And yet, as the majority agrees, we have no \"clearly identifiable pattern of identity theft or financial fraud\" in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   To be sure, \"certain Arnold Plaintiffs have already had fraudulent accounts opened and tax returns filed in their names.\"\n   <em>\n    Maj. op.\n   </em>\n   58. But that is hardly probative. \"In a society where around 3.3% of the population will experience some form of identity theft\" in a given year, it is \"not surprising\" that a few plaintiffs in a putative class of 21.5 million would \"have experienced some form of credit or bank-account fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    In re U.S. Office of Personnel Mgmt.

But that doesn't imply a \"substantial risk\" that\n   <em>\n    these hackers\n   </em>\n   have plans to break into the homes of garden-variety government employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In sum, Arnold Plaintiffs have alleged no facts-disproportionate incidence of identity theft, a distinctive pattern of fraud, or anything else of that sort among the putative class-that can credibly nudge their theory into the realm of plausibility in the face of an obvious alternative explanation. So they cannot \"all\" meet the threshold requirement for standing under the pleading standards of\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Maj. op.\n   </em>\n   55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   I grant, of course, that in the immediate aftermath of the cyber-intrusion, some putative\n   class members might reasonably have been unwilling to assume that the attack was motivated by a purpose other than identity theft.

Arnold Plaintiffs file a battery of state law claims against a contractor that OPM engaged to perform background checks of prospective federal employees. That contractor, KeyPoint Government Solutions, Inc., maintains that, as a government contractor, it is entitled to sovereign immunity. The court, however, disagrees, see\n   <em>\n    Maj. op.\n   </em>\n   Part IV-and I join that part of the opinion in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   I write separately to address an important distinction between contractor immunity, which KeyPoint asserts, and federal preemption, which KeyPoint fails to raise, and about which the court therefore expresses no views.

This case involves a fundamental federal issue-the hiring, vetting, and protecting of federal employees, and the balancing of the costs of keeping the relevant data secure against the costs of error or neglect in providing that security. And Congress, it seems, has already created a detailed statutory scheme in the form of the Privacy Act to address these (and other) issues. See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(10) (requiring \"appropriate ... technical ... safeguards\"). Under that scheme, the agency must, by contract, \"cause the requirements of [the Privacy Act] to be applied\" to the contractor's \"system of records,\" see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(m)(1) -and if the\n   <em>\n    agency\n   </em>\n   fails to do so, then it faces potential liability, see\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 552a(g)(1)(D) ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"372\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2024.102\">\n    48 C.F.R. \u00a7 24.102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (\"Agencies, which within the limits of their authorities, fail to require that systems of records on individuals operated on their behalf under contracts be operated in conformance with the Act may be civilly liable to individuals injured as a consequence of any subsequent failure to maintain records in conformance with the Act.\"). Allowing 50 states to pile on and impose liability on contractors, with the financial consequences falling back on federal agencies in contract negotiations as the\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   Court foresaw, might be found to upset the balance intended by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   KeyPoint, however, has not argued for preemption-only for sovereign immunity.
