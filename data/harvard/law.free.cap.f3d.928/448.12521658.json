Tzacir-Garcia was sentenced to forty-one months' imprisonment. He appealed, arguing that the district court committed plain error by concluding that he qualified for a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 1326(b)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   because of a previous conviction for an aggravated felony, as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43).

We summarily affirmed Tzacir-Garcia's sentence, concluding that his prior Texas robbery conviction was a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b).\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Burris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520743\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/920/942/#p945\">\n    920 F.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 945 (5th Cir. 2019). Accordingly, Tzacir-Garcia's conviction for Texas robbery is also a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a) and thus an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
