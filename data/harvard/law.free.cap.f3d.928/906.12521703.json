Pavatt was sentenced to death for the first degree murder conviction and ten years' imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction. After exhausting his state court remedies, Pavatt filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court denied Pavatt's petition, and also denied Pavatt a certificate of appealability (COA). Pavatt sought and was granted a COA by this court with respect to five issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The original hearing panel affirmed the district court's denial of relief with respect to Pavatt's convictions, but in a divided decision reversed the denial of relief with respect to Pavatt's death sentence and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. In doing so, the panel majority concluded that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) \"did not apply a constitutionally acceptable interpretation of Oklahoma's [especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC) ] aggravator in determining [on direct appeal] that the aggravator was supported by sufficient evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Pavatt v.

Having received those briefs and after additional oral arguments addressing those questions, we conclude that Pavatt's Eighth Amendment \"as-applied\" challenge to the HAC aggravator-the issue that the original panel majority relied on in granting him relief-is, for a number of reasons, procedurally barred. We also conclude that the other issues raised by Pavatt on appeal lack merit. Consequently, we vacate the prior panel opinion and affirm the district court's denial of federal habeas relief with respect to both Pavatt's convictions and death sentence. We also deny Pavatt's request for an additional COA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Factual background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The background facts of Pavatt's crimes were outlined by the OCCA in resolving Pavatt's direct appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Pavatt] and his co-defendant, Brenda Andrew, were each charged with conspiracy and first-degree capital murder following the shooting death of Brenda's husband, Robert (\"Rob\") Andrew, at the Andrews' Oklahoma City home on November 20, 2001. [Pavatt] met the Andrews while attending the same church, and [Pavatt] and Brenda taught a Sunday school class together. [Pavatt] socialized with the Andrews and their two young children in mid-2001, but eventually began having a sexual relationship with Brenda. Around the same time, [Pavatt], a life insurance agent, assisted Rob Andrew in setting up a life insurance\n   policy worth approximately $800,000. [Pavatt] divorced his wife in the summer of 2001. In late September, Rob Andrew moved out of the family home, and Brenda Andrew initiated divorce proceedings a short time later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Janna Larson, [Pavatt]'s adult daughter, testified that in late October 2001, [Pavatt] told her that Brenda had asked him to murder Rob Andrew. On the night of October 25-26, 2001, someone severed the brake lines on Rob Andrew's automobile. The next morning, [Pavatt] and Brenda Andrew concocted a false \"emergency,\" apparently in hopes that Rob would have a traffic accident in the process. [Pavatt] persuaded his daughter to call Rob Andrew from an untraceable phone and claim that Brenda was at a hospital in Norman, Oklahoma, and needed him immediately. An unknown male also called Rob that morning and made the same plea. Rob Andrew's cell phone records showed that one call came from a pay phone in Norman (near Larson's workplace), and the other from a pay phone in south Oklahoma City. The plan failed; Rob Andrew discovered the tampering to his car before placing himself in any danger. He then notified the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   One contentious issue in the Andrews' divorce was control over the insurance policy on Rob Andrew's life. After his brake lines were severed, Rob Andrew inquired about removing Brenda as beneficiary of his life insurance policy. However, [Pavatt], who had set up the policy, learned of Rob's intentions and told Rob (falsely) that he had no control over the policy because Brenda was the owner. Rob Andrew spoke with [Pavatt]'s supervisor, who assured him that he was still the record owner of the policy. Rob Andrew then related his suspicions about [Pavatt] and Brenda to the supervisor. When [Pavatt] learned of this, he became very angry and threatened to harm Rob for putting his job in jeopardy. At trial, the State presented evidence that in the months preceding the murder, [Pavatt] and Brenda actually attempted to transfer ownership of the insurance policy to Brenda without Rob Andrew's knowledge, by forging his signature to a change-of-ownership form and backdating it to March 2001.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On the evening of November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew drove to the family home to pick up his children for a scheduled visitation over the Thanksgiving holiday. He spoke with a friend on his cell phone as he waited in his car for Brenda to open the garage door. When she did, Rob ended the call and went inside to get his children. A short time later, neighbors heard gunshots. Brenda Andrew called 911 and reported that her husband had been shot. Emergency personnel arrived and found Rob Andrew's body on the floor of the garage; he had suffered extensive blood loss and they were unable to revive him. Brenda Andrew had also suffered a superficial gunshot wound to her arm. The Andrew children were not, in fact, packed and ready to leave when Rob Andrew arrived; they were found in a bedroom, watching television with the volume turned up very high, oblivious to what had happened in the garage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Brenda was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Her behavior was described by several witnesses, experienced in dealing with people in traumatic situations, as uncharacteristically calm for a woman whose husband had just been gunned down. One witness saw Brenda chatting giddily with [Pavatt] at the hospital later that night.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Rob Andrew was shot twice with a shotgun. A spent shotgun shell found in the garage fit a 16-gauge shotgun, which is a rather unusual gauge. Andrew\n   owned a 16-gauge shotgun, but had told several friends that Brenda refused to let him take it from the home when they separated. Rob Andrew's shotgun was missing from the home when police searched it. One witness testified to seeing Brenda Andrew engaging in target practice at her family's rural Garfield County home about a week before the murder. Several 16-gauge shotgun shells were found at the site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Brenda told police that her husband was attacked in the garage by two armed, masked men, dressed in black, but gave few other details. Brenda's superficial wound was caused by a .22-caliber bullet, apparently fired at close range, which was inconsistent with her claim that she was shot at some distance as she ran from the garage into the house. About a week before the murder, [Pavatt] purchased a .22-caliber handgun from a local gun shop. On the day of the murder, [Pavatt] borrowed his daughter's car and claimed he was going to have it serviced for her. When he returned it the morning after the murder, the car had not been serviced, but his daughter found a .22-caliber bullet on the floorboard. In a conversation later that day, [Pavatt] told Larson never to repeat that Brenda had asked him to kill Rob Andrew, and he threatened to kill Larson if she did. He also told her to throw away the bullet she had found in her car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Police also searched the home of Dean Gigstad, the Andrews' next-door neighbor. There they found evidence that someone had entered the Gigstads' attic through an opening in a bedroom closet. A spent 16-gauge shotgun shell was found on the bedroom floor, and several .22-caliber bullets were found in the attic itself. There were no signs of forced entry into the Gigstads' home. Gigstad and his wife were out of town when the murder took place, but Brenda Andrew had a key to their home. The .22-caliber bullet found in Janna Larson's car was of the same brand as the three .22-caliber bullets found in the Gigstads' attic; the .22-caliber bullet fired at Brenda and retrieved from the Andrews' garage appeared consistent with them in several respects. These bullets were capable of being fired from the firearm that [Pavatt] purchased a few weeks before the murder; further testing was not possible because that gun was never found. The shotgun shell found in the Gigstads' home was of the same brand and odd gauge as the 16-gauge shell found in the Andrews' garage. Ballistics comparison showed similar markings, indicating that they could have been fired from the same weapon. Whether these shells were fired from the 16-gauge shotgun Rob Andrew had left at the home was impossible to confirm because, as noted, that gun also turned up missing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In the days following the murder, [Pavatt] registered his daughter as a signatory on his checking account, and asked her to move his belongings out of his apartment. He obtained information over the Internet about Argentina, because he had heard that country had no extradition agreement with the United States. Larson also testified that after the murder, Brenda and [Pavatt] asked her to help them create a document, with the forged signature of Rob Andrew, granting permission for the Andrew children to travel with Brenda out of the country. Brenda also asked Larson to transfer funds from her bank account to Larson's own account, so that Larson could wire them money after they left town.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Brenda Andrew did not attend her husband's funeral. Instead, she and [Pavatt] drove to Mexico, and took the Andrew children with them. [Pavatt] called his daughter several times from Mexico and asked her to send them money. Larson cooperated with the FBI and local authorities in trying to track down [Pavatt] and Brenda. In late February 2002, having run out of money, [Pavatt] and Brenda Andrew re-entered the United States at the Mexican border. They were promptly placed under arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Pavatt v.

As we have noted,\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   requires a reviewing court to \"view[ ] the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    443 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When that standard is applied to the evidence presented in Pavatt's case, it simply does not support his description of what occurred. Although it is true that each of the shotgun blasts were independently lethal, Pavatt is incorrect in asserting that Rob Andrew \"could not have remained conscious for more than a few moments.\" Aplt. Br. at 21. Indeed, the medical examiner who testified on behalf of the prosecution conceded it was possible that Rob Andrew remained conscious for several minutes after sustaining the wounds. And that testimony, combined with Brenda Andrew's statements to the 911 operator regarding Rob Andrew's condition (which we will discuss in greater detail below), would have allowed the jury to reasonably find that he indeed remained conscious far longer than \"a few moments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pavatt also argues that the OCCA \"relied on irrelevant speculation about what Rob [Andrew] was feeling.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. In support, Pavatt examines and attempts to discredit each of the factors cited by the OCCA in support of its determination. To begin with, Pavatt asserts that \"[t]he 'numerous wounds ' referred to by the OCCA were caused by pellets from the same shotgun, shot at nearly the same time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Although Pavatt is correct on this point, that does not prove the OCCA's determination to be wrong. Indeed, the medical examiner testified at trial that the two shotgun blasts damaged Rob Andrew's right lung, aorta, and liver. In addition, the photographs of Rob Andrew's body quite clearly indicate that the shotgun pellets caused numerous, separate entry and exit wounds on his body. And, although Pavatt asserts that these wounds \"did not contribute to an inordinate amount of conscious pain prior to death,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30, the medical examiner testified to the contrary, noting the wounds would, indeed, have been painful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Pavatt in turn argues that, contrary to the OCCA's determination, \"the quick loss of blood from both wounds resulted in shock and loss of consciousness within one minute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But this argument ignores, and is ultimately contrary to, the testimony of the medical examiner. The medical examiner testified that, as a result of the blood loss associated with the wounds, Rob Andrew would have lost consciousness before he actually died. The medical examiner opined that Rob Andrew would have died \"[l]ess than ten\" minutes after\n   sustaining the gunshot wounds, but could have survived for five or six minutes. Tr., Vol. X at 2457-58. The medical examiner declined on direct examination to \"give ... an exact time\" frame that Rob Andrew would have maintained consciousness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2458. On cross-examination, the medical examiner agreed that it was possible that Rob Andrew died less than one minute after sustaining the wounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2466. On redirect, the medical examiner testified it was also possible that Rob Andrew remained conscious for more than one minute after sustaining the wounds. Ultimately, the medical examiner's testimony, construed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and considered together with other evidence presented by the prosecution, would have allowed the jury to find that Rob Andrew remained conscious for several minutes after sustaining the wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Pavatt argues that the fact that Rob Andrew was found \"clutching the plastic trash bag was meaningless in determining whether [he] consciously suffered and thus, it was unreasonable for the OCCA to speculate about why [he] may have been holding the bag.\" Aplt. Br. at 30. We disagree. At trial, the prosecution presented testimony from two witnesses on this very point. The first witness, Norman Nunley, was a longtime friend of the Andrews. Tr., Vol. V at 1363. Nunley testified that he first learned of Rob Andrew's death from Brenda Andrew, when she called him the morning after the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1381. According to Nunley, Brenda Andrew gave him a brief description of the shooting and, in particular, \"said [that] prior to the second shot [Rob Andrew] had grabbed a trash bag full of, like, pop cans or something and tried to hold it up between him and the gun.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1382. The second witness, Roger Frost, was an Oklahoma City police officer and one of the first people to respond to Brenda Andrew's 911 call. Frost testified that when he arrived at the Andrews' house, he discovered Brenda Andrew sitting in the doorway to the garage, approximately three feet from Rob Andrew's body.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Vol. IX at 2170. Frost further testified that he removed Brenda Andrew from the crime scene, walked her to an area outside of her house, and had her sit on the curb so that the paramedics could treat her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2174-75. Frost testified that he asked Brenda Andrew for information about what had happened and that she told him, in pertinent part, that Rob Andrew had grabbed the plastic bag full of cans as an apparent means of self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2176. Because the OCCA was obligated under\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it was entirely reasonable for it to accept this testimony of Nunley and Frost as true. And that determination was relevant to the OCCA's assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the HAC aggravator because it would have supported a finding that Rob Andrew remained not only conscious, but mobile and acting defensively, after the first shotgun blast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Somewhat relatedly, Pavatt complains that it was unreasonable for the OCCA \"to conclude that Rob [Andrew] consciously suffered based on Brenda[ Andrew]'s statements in her 911 calls, when everything she said in those calls was determined to be false.\" Aplt. Br. at 30. The fallacy of this argument, however, is the notion that all of Brenda Andrew's statements to the 911 operator (or, for that matter, her statements to other people, such as Mr. Nunley) were proven to be false. The fact of the matter is that at least some of Brenda Andrew's statements during the two 911 calls were obviously true. For example, it is undisputed that she was physically present with Rob Andrew after he suffered the two shotgun blasts and\n   during at least the second 911 call. Further, her statements to the 911 operator that she and Rob Andrew had been shot were indisputably true. Likewise, some of her statements describing what she was witnessing, such as the arrival of police officers to her house, were also quite clearly true (indeed, officers' voices can be heard in the background during the second 911 call at the precise time that Brenda Andrew tells the 911 operator that the police have arrived on the scene). Thus, the jury, having listened to recordings of both 911 calls, was left to decide whether her statements to the 911 operator regarding Rob Andrew's condition, including her statement that he was conscious and attempting to talk to her, and her repeated statements that he was breathing, were credible or not. Although the jury was not bound to give credence to those statements, it was certainly within the jury's province to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry v. New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    565 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (noting it is \"the jury's task [to] assess[ ] witness credibility and reliability\"). Consequently, we conclude it was in turn reasonable for the OCCA, applying the standard of review mandated by\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , to treat as credible Brenda's statements regarding Rob Andrew's condition in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to support the HAC aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, Pavatt argues that no \"deference [should be] afforded [the jury's verdict] under\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   \" because \"[t]here were no conflicting facts about how Rob [Andrew] died.\" Aplt. Br. at 22. We reject that argument.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   provides, in relevant part, that \"a federal habeas corpus court faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume-even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record-that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    443 U.S. at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is precisely the situation we have here. As we have already explained, the evidence presented at Pavatt's trial most certainly \"supports conflicting inferences\" regarding how long Rob Andrew remained conscious after sustaining the first and then the second shotgun blasts. We therefore must presume that the jury in Pavatt's trial, having found the existence of the HAC aggravator, resolved these conflicts in favor of the prosecution. And, in turn, we, like the OCCA, must defer to that resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In sum, we conclude that Pavatt has failed to establish that the OCCA's determination that the evidence was sufficient to support the HAC aggravator was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Thus, Pavatt is not entitled to federal habeas relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Pavatt's as-applied challenge to the HAC aggravator\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As part of Proposition One of his appellate brief, Pavatt also attempts to assert an as-applied challenge to the HAC aggravator. Specifically, Pavatt argues that the OCCA, in considering his\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   challenge to the HAC aggravator on direct appeal, \"unreasonably failed to follow its own precedent\" that had adopted a constitutionally narrow construction of the HAC aggravator, \"compounded its historically inconsistent approach to what Oklahoma requires to support the HAC aggravator,\" and, ultimately, applied an unconstitutionally overbroad definition of the HAC aggravator in affirming his death sentence.

And, accordingly, at no time did respondent expressly waive the exhaustion requirement with respect to an as-applied challenge to the HAC aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   To be sure, Pavatt argues in his supplemental response brief that respondent \"expressly waived\" the exhaustion requirement with respect to Pavatt's as-applied arguments. Aplt. Supp. Br. at 18. In support, Pavatt cites to page 128 of respondent's answer to Pavatt's habeas petition. A review of that cited page, however, reveals that respondent conceded exhaustion only as to Pavatt's\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   claim. ROA, Vol. 3 at 560 (Dist. Ct. Docket No. 69 at 128) (\"In Ground Ten, Petitioner alleges that insufficient evidence was presented at trial to support the jury's finding of the [HAC] aggravator.);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"This claim was raised on direct appeal and the OCCA rejected it on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Pavatt [I]\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303711\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/159/272/#p276\">\n    159 P.3d at 294-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is therefore exhausted for purposes of federal habeas review.\"). Thus, Pavatt's assertion that respondent expressly waived the exhaustion requirement with respect to Pavatt's as-applied arguments is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We likewise conclude that respondent did not expressly waive procedural bar as a defense. As we have discussed, it was far from clear that Pavatt intended to assert an as-applied challenge to the HAC aggravator in his federal habeas petition, and, in fact, both respondent and the district court reasonably interpreted Pavatt's habeas petition as asserting only a\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   challenge to the HAC aggravator. Consequently, we do not construe any of respondent's district court pleadings as expressly waiving procedural bar as a defense to the as-applied claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, our October 2, 2018 order directed the parties to address the questions of whether Pavatt's as-applied challenge was \"resolved by the district court,\" whether \"a COA [was] granted on th[is] claim[ ],\" and whether the claim was \"included in this court's case management order as [an] issue[ ] to be raised by Pavatt.\" Order at 2, Oct. 2, 2018. Because the district court reasonably did not perceive Pavatt's habeas petition as asserting an as-applied challenge to the HAC aggravator, it did not address, let alone resolve, that claim, and it did not grant a COA on the claim. Nor, in turn, did this court grant a COA on any as-applied challenge to the HAC aggravator. Consequently, the as-applied claim was not included in this court's case management order as an issue to be raised by Pavatt and briefed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For all of these reasons, we conclude that the as-applied challenge to the HAC aggravator that Pavatt asserts in his federal appellate brief is not properly before us and cannot serve as the basis for the grant of federal habeas relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Facial challenge to the HAC aggravator\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In both Ground Eleven and Ground Thirteen of his federal habeas petition, Pavatt referred to the HAC aggravator as being facially vague. ROA, Vol. 1 at 191, 202 (Dist. Ct. Docket No. 42 at 161, 172). Neither Ground Eleven nor Ground Thirteen, however, directly asserted a facial challenge to the HAC aggravator. Instead, Ground Eleven focused on the adequacy of the instructions given to the jury in Pavatt's case regarding the HAC aggravator, and Ground Thirteen asserted that Oklahoma's Uniform Jury Instruction defining the terms \"heinous,\" \"atrocious,\" and \"cruel\" failed to adhere to the constitutionally narrowing construction that had been adopted by the OCCA following this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cartwright\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Respondent did not interpret Pavatt's habeas petition as asserting a facial challenge to the HAC aggravator. But the district court, perhaps out of an abundance of caution, construed Ground Thirteen as challenging the HAC aggravator \"on the ground that it is unconstitutionally vague on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303711\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/159/272/#p276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303711\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/159/272/#p276\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Vol. 3 at 1138 (Dist.

The district court concluded, however, that this facial challenge was \"barred from federal review\" because it was \"not presented to the OCCA until [Pavatt's] second post-conviction application.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303711\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/159/272/#p276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court also noted, in any event, that the OCCA had, in response to this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cartwright\n   </em>\n   , adopted a constitutionally narrowing construction of the HAC aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The district court did not grant a COA as to Ground Thirteen. Likewise, we did not grant a COA as to Ground Thirteen (or to any facial challenge to the HAC aggravator) or include it in our case management order as an issue to be raised by Pavatt on appeal. And, in turn, Pavatt's opening appellate brief makes no mention of Ground Thirteen or any facial challenge to the HAC aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that there is no facial challenge to the HAC aggravator that is properly before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Adequacy of instruction on the HAC aggravator\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In Proposition Two of his appellate brief, Pavatt contends that the state trial court's instructions to the jury regarding the HAC aggravator failed to adequately\n   inform them that they must find \"conscious physical suffering\" before concluding that the murder was \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    a) Facts relevant to this claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Prior to trial, Pavatt filed an objection \"to the pattern verdict form, OUJI-CR 2d 4-84, on the grounds [that] the special findings,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the aggravating circumstances, [we]re ill-defined, vague and d[id] not check the unbridled discretion of the sentencer.\" State R., Vol. VII at 1286.

In Proposition Four of that application, Pavatt argued that the state trial court violated his constitutional rights by failing to provide an adequate instruction that informed the jury that it must find \"conscious physical suffering\" beyond a reasonable doubt before concluding that the murder was \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\" Second Appl. for Post-Conviction Relief, at 27-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    c) The OCCA's resolution of the claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In its opinion denying Pavatt's second application for post-conviction relief, the OCCA concluded that this claim was procedurally barred: \"Because this argument is based on the trial record, it could have been made in prior proceedings, and may not be considered now.\"\n   <em>\n    Pavatt III\n   </em>\n   , No. PCD-2009-777 at 5 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%201089\">\n    Okla.

Ct. Docket No. 91 at 104-05).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In this appeal, Pavatt argues that we should review his claims de novo for two reasons. First, he contends that \"[t]he OCCA did not clearly impose a procedural bar of these claims, but instead stated the 'current arguments merely modify or expand the claims made, and rejected, in prior proceedings.' \" Aplt. Br. at 50 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pavatt III\n   </em>\n   , No. PCD-2009-777 at 4). As discussed above, however, and as Pavatt ultimately concedes in a related footnote, the OCCA quite clearly concluded that these claims were procedurally barred under Oklahoma's Post-Conviction Procedure Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51 n.14. And, as we have previously discussed, this procedural bar ruling is considered both independent and adequate and thus serves to preclude federal habeas review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597315\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1802/#p1803\">\n    136 S.

In other words, Pavatt argues that the ineffectiveness of his post-conviction counsel establishes the \"cause\" for his failure to comply with Oklahoma's procedural requirements.

We are not persuaded that the same holds true with respect to Oklahoma's system and Pavatt does not argue otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Pavatt's argument is based exclusively on his own unique circumstances, i.e., the fact that he was represented at trial and on appeal by the same attorney. Thus, Pavatt has not established an exception to the procedural bar rule that would otherwise apply to his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Pavatt also, as previously noted, asserts in this appeal that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims on direct appeal. The OCCA rejected these ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims as procedurally barred under Oklahoma's Post-Conviction Procedure Act. Because the OCCA treated these claims as procedurally barred, and because\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trevino\n   </em>\n   do not apply to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims, we conclude that those claims are also barred from federal habeas review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    c) Trial counsel's failure to investigate and present a compelling mitigation case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Pavatt also complains that his trial counsel failed to investigate and present sufficient mitigating evidence during the second-stage proceedings. Pavatt argues that trial \"[c]ounsel's meager presentation of mitigation, based on a last-minute and superficial investigation, was an afterthought.\" Aplt. Br. at 65. According to\n   Pavatt, his trial counsel, \"believing [Pavatt] would be acquitted, put his time and resources into the guilt/innocence stage of trial\" and \"operated under the unreasonable belief that residual doubt of Pavatt's guilt would be enough to persuade jurors to spare his life.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697053\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/413/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pavatt argues that his \"[t]rial counsel had no reasonable strategy to shun the thorough investigation that would have uncovered Pavatt's significant psychological impairments and explained how those impairments, and his unique background, caused him to be easily influenced by Brenda Andrew.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Pavatt first raised this claim in his second application for state post-conviction relief.

Aplt. Br. at 99. This claim, like his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims, is procedurally barred due to Pavatt's failure to raise the claim in his original application for state post-conviction relief.

I now agree that the Oklahoma HAC aggravator, as presently construed by the OCCA, does not satisfy the Eighth Amendment requirement that the aggravator distinguish in a principled way those first-degree murderers who deserve the death penalty from the many who do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   At oral argument before the en banc court, counsel for the State acknowledged what is apparent from the OCCA opinion in this case: a defendant \"qualifies for the [HAC] aggravator if the victim was conscious for some period of time (a couple minutes) after receiving the fatal blow and experienced some pain during that time.\" Oral argument at 39:20-38. In other words, the very act of committing the murder makes one eligible for the death penalty unless the victim was rendered unconscious immediately upon receiving the fatal blow. In my view, no fairminded jurist could think that this requirement distinguishes in a\n   <em>\n    principled\n   </em>\n   manner those deserving the death penalty from the many first-degree murderers who do not. To the extent that it is not merely fortuitous that the victim remains conscious, this test provides what could be described as a \"sharpshooter bonus.\" If the perpetrator has the skill to render an immediately fatal blow, he or she escapes the death penalty under this aggravator. Such an arbitrary aggravator is not consistent with the Supreme Court's \"narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death.\"\n   <em>\n    Atkins v.

But the State brief's 10-page discussion of Ground Ten clearly indicates otherwise. It included substantial references to the Eighth Amendment constraints on aggravators. For example, one paragraph begins: \"To be constitutional, an aggravating circumstance may not apply to every defendant convicted of a murder; it must apply only to a subclass of defendants convicted of murder. It must not also be unconstitutionally vague.\" Resp. to Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus at 135. The paragraph ends: \"Nothing about the OCCA's discussion of the legal or factual basis for its conclusion here in any way suggests an overbroad or an erroneous interpretation, let alone application, of Oklahoma's [HAC] aggravator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 136. In discussing the Eighth Amendment, the State's brief included nary a hint that its acknowledgment of exhaustion of Mr. Pavatt's Ground Ten did not encompass this component of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Further, even after the panel dissent argued that Mr. Pavatt's Eighth Amendment claim had not been exhausted, the State was at best halfhearted in arguing in its original petition for rehearing that it had not waived exhaustion. It wrote: \"It is debatable whether Respondent waived an exhaustion defense by asserting in district court that Petitioner's sufficiency claim is exhausted.\" Pet. for Panel Reh'g or Reh'g En Banc at 5 n.1. This sentence is followed by a \"compare\" citation that notes one published opinion in which we held that exhaustion was not waived and one unpublished case in which we held that exhaustion was waived. There is no real argument on the issue. Moreover, the perfunctory statement is only in a footnote, which under this court's precedent is not adequate to preserve an issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hardman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453137\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/297/1116/#p1131\">\n    297 F.3d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1131 (10th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (\"Arguments raised in a perfunctory manner, such as in a footnote, are waived.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Perhaps the State thought that Mr. Pavatt had a good argument for exhaustion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   But the State may also have had strategic reasons for waiving exhaustion. The HAC aggravator is a commonplace in Oklahoma death-penalty cases. If new challenges to the aggravator are going to be made, it may be advantageous to deal with them sooner rather than later. A successful challenge years down the road could be extremely disruptive. If the State believes that the defendant is even more unsympathetic than usual and that the present composition of the courts is favorable, it may welcome an early challenge even if there is a respectable exhaustion argument. There is nothing wrong with that approach. It would be wrong, however, to waive exhaustion and then, after losing on the merits, argue that it is so plain that the prisoner failed to exhaust remedies that the State cannot possibly have meant what it said when it conceded exhaustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   I continue to believe that the State waived its exhaustion argument, and I think there is a reasonable argument that Mr. Pavatt exhausted his Eighth Amendment claim in state court and was procedurally barred on an inadequate state ground. I would therefore address the merits of the Eighth Amendment issue and hold that no reasonable jurist could say that the OCCA's interpretation of the HAC aggravator satisfies Eighth Amendment standards set by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    The original panel decision issued on June 9, 2017.\n    <em>\n     Pavatt v.

He wrote: \"[T]he first opportunity [the defendant] had to raise his due process challenge to the modification of his crime of conviction arose after the Court of Criminal Appeals issued its opinion. Because I believe it would have been inappropriate for [the defendant] to raise his due process claim under the limited rehearing procedures set out in Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals Rule 3.14, I believe [the defendant] can now present his due process claim by way of an application for postconviction relief in the Oklahoma courts.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11623430\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/782/#p783\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11623430\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/782/#p783\">\n     at 786\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The OCCA's procedural bar of the claim on the ground that it \"could have been raised in prior proceedings, but was not,\" Op. Den. Second Appl. at 6, appears to be unsupported by the relevant rule and statute as interpreted in state-court precedent. For a state procedural bar to bind a federal court, it must rest on \"independent and adequate\" state-law grounds.\n    <em>\n     Walker v.

One may therefore question the adequacy of the OCCA's procedural bar of Mr. Pavatt's Eighth Amendment issue in the second application. Unfortunately, this issue has not been developed in this court because exhaustion was raised at such a late stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
