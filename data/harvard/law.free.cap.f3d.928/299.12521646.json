Included in the suit were Sharkey's co-workers and supervisor at BCRC (collectively, the \"Defendants\"), who E.D. alleged were deliberately indifferent to the violation, as well as Berks County, which allegedly failed to implement policies to prevent the violating conduct. The Defendants and Berks County moved for summary judgment, arguing that the individual staff members were entitled to qualified immunity and that E.D. could not prove a municipal liability claim against the County. The District Court denied their motion, and they have filed this interlocutory appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In determining whether to affirm the denial of qualified immunity, we necessarily address whether immigration detainees are entitled to the same constitutional protections afforded by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as pre-trial detainees. We hold that immigration detainees are entitled to such protections and, for the reasons that follow, will dismiss the appeal pertaining to Berks County for lack of appellate jurisdiction and will affirm the denial of the Defendants' request for qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   E.D. entered the United States with her three-year-old son in or around May 2014, seeking refuge from domestic violence and sexual assault in Honduras. She and her son were transferred from an immigration facility in Texas to the BCRC, which detains approximately ninety women and children pursuant to a contract with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Approximately a month after E.D.'s arrival, BCRC employee Daniel Sharkey began giving food and treats to E.D. and her son. His overtures escalated to allowing E.D. to use his cell phone and promising to help with her immigration status. Within\n   weeks Sharkey began to touch and kiss E.D., who refused to reciprocate. He turned angry, insulted E.D., and told her she would be deported if she told anyone about his advances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July 2014, Sharkey began forcing E.D. to engage in sexual intercourse. On one occasion they had intercourse in a bathroom and a seven-year-old girl witnessed the encounter. In August 2014, E.D. and Sharkey were having intercourse in another resident's room when the resident returned. Within the month, Sharkey either left or was terminated from his employment at BCRC. He was later arrested and convicted of institutional sexual assault under Pennsylvania statute 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3124.2, which was enacted in February 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   E.D. alleges that, by August 2014, staff members at the BCRC were aware of Sharkey's conduct but failed to take steps to protect her. Eventually detainees complained and BCRC Director Diane Edwards was notified of the relationship. An investigation was launched. When questioned by staff members, E.D. denied Sharkey had sexually assaulted her because she feared deportation. E.D. eventually told her immigration attorney about Sharkey's conduct, and her attorney relayed the incidents to ICE officials. E.D. alleges that, after the relationship was reported, the defendant BCRC staff members retaliated by denying her and her son privileges and instituting a restrictive clothing policy that led to other detainees isolating her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to E.D., ICE policies and standards prohibit staff from sexually abusing immigration detainees and define any sexual contact, regardless of whether it is consensual, as sexual abuse. Moreover, ICE standards require that the Field Office Director be notified any time an employee, contractor, or volunteer is alleged to be a perpetrator of sexual abuse against a detainee. The ICE/DRO (Detention and Removal Operations) Residential Standards require residential facilities holding immigration detainees to affirmatively act to prevent sexual abuse and sexual assault of the residents, which includes providing staff training and prompt, effective intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2017, E.D. filed her third amended complaint in District Court against Daniel Sharkey, Berks County, the BCRC, the center's director Diane Edwards, and staff members John Behm, Janie Himmelberger, Brittany Rothermel, Erika Taylor, and Matthew Malinowski.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   E.D. claimed,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that her Fourteenth Amendment due process rights were violated by the employees and supervisor who were deliberately indifferent to Sharkey's conduct and by Berks County for failing to implement policies and procedures to prevent sexual abuse at the residential center. She further alleged that the Defendants retaliated against her after she reported the sexual abuse, thereby violating her due process and First Amendment rights. After the completion of discovery, all the defendants except for Daniel Sharkey moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The District Court granted the defendants' joint motion with regard to claims against the BCRC, ruling that it was not a proper defendant under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because it did not have an existence separate from Berks County. The Court also granted summary judgment in favor of BCRC employee John Behm and rejected E.D.'s claims for punitive damages against\n   Berks County, but otherwise denied the motion. The remaining defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the District Court's conclusion that E.D. pled the violation of a known constitutional right, that the BCRC employees and supervisor were not entitled to qualified immunity, and that a factfinder could reasonably find Berks County liable for Sharkey's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Generally, our appellate jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is limited to appeals of District Courts' final orders.

The District Court found that the Defendants' awareness of the alleged violation, and whether they acted reasonably in response, presents a genuine dispute of a material fact. Although the Court failed to make specific factual findings in its order, facts identified in is previous filings support its ruling that a factfinder could plausibly conclude the Defendants \"must have known\" of the risk to E.D.'s rights.\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11969487\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/742/#p748\">\n    117 F.3d at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In a memorandum opinion deciding a motion to dismiss, the District Court cited E.D.'s allegations that the BCRC is a small facility and the staff has \"frequent contact and interaction\" with the detainees, which permitted the Defendants to observe Sharkey with E.D. and become aware of their intimate relationship. Moreover, the Court cited E.D.'s claims that the relationship became \"obvious\" to the other detainees, motivating them to complain to the BCRC staff about Sharkey's conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding Supervisor Edwards, the Court found that E.D. raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the policies at the BCRC created an unreasonable risk of sexual assault, whether Edwards was aware of that risk, and whether E.D.'s injury was the result of the purported deficient policies. To support this finding, the Court cited E.D.'s response to the summary judgment motion, in which she alleged Edwards \"has oversight over everything in the program for the BCRC, including training,\" and that the training consisted of Sharkey \"going through documents and signing them.\" She further alleged that the sexual assault training, the curriculum of which Edwards approved, consisted of a printed-out slides that employees read independently before taking a quiz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on these adaptations by the District Court, we agree there is enough evidence to support an inference that the Defendants knew of the risk facing E.D., and that their failure to take additional steps to protect her - acting in their capacity as either a co-worker or supervisor - \"could be viewed by a factfinder as the sort of deliberate indifference\" to a detainee's safety that the Constitution forbids.\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11969487\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/742/#p748\">\n    117 F.3d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376173\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/257/#p261\">\n    316 F.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 (3d Cir. 2003). Here, the District Court addressed the summary judgment motion by issuing an order, unaccompanied by a supporting opinion. Instead, the order included a lengthy footnote setting forth the District Court's reasoning. This \"footnote order\" practice is frequently employed by our colleagues in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and it is not my desire to interfere with a longstanding custom and practice of that district. Indeed, in my view, there is nothing inherently problematic with so-called \"footnote opinions.\" In this case, however, the footnote neglects to identify a single undisputed fact, and provides only cursory discussion-without reference to the evidence of record-to support the conclusion that disputes of material fact exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because Appellants have raised on appeal relatively narrow legal claims that are capable of resolution without the need to closely examine the nuances of the District Court's fact-finding, I see no need to remand this matter for a more comprehensive opinion. Nonetheless, while the District Court provided just enough detail for us to render a decision in this case, it cannot be overlooked that perfunctory treatment of the factual record does not comport with the spirit of the supervisory rule that we announced in\n   <em>\n    Forbes v. Township of Lower Merion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313502\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/144/#p147\">\n    313 F.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2002). In\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   , we observed that providing only \"spare comments\" in a qualified immunity denial \"greatly hampered\" our ability to conduct meaningful appellate review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313502\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/144/#p147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313502\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/144/#p147\">\n    at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore\n   expressly set forth a rule applicable to all qualified immunity decisions: \"we ... require the District Courts to specify those material facts that are and are not subject to genuine dispute and explain their materiality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313502\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/144/#p147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313502\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/144/#p147\">\n    at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   has been the rule of our Court for well over a decade and a half, and remains so for good reason. A comprehensive and detailed summary judgment opinion, specifying those facts that are undisputed as well as those that are material and subject to genuine dispute, is vital-and often essential-to our meaningful review on appeal. I write to underscore the continued importance that our judges attach to compliance with the\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   rule, and to discourage cursory footnote treatment of the factual record in qualified immunity decisions.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
