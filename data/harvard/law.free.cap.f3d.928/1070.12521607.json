BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District funds both nursing-facility-based and community-based care for individuals with physical disabilities. In both settings, individuals are provided with assistance in eating, bathing, toileting and dressing, as well as with their mobility, medication management, meal preparation, money management and telephone use. The District does not operate nursing facilities itself; it funds care in nursing facilities certified for Medicaid reimbursement through its Medicaid State Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are nineteen Medicaid-certified nursing facilities in the District, which house a total of approximately 2,770 beds. Plaintiffs are physically disabled individuals in these facilities who have been receiving nursing-facility-based care for more than ninety days but wish to transition-and are capable of transitioning-to community-based care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This litigation began in late 2010, when four disabled individuals filed a class action against the District, alleging that the District's failure to transition them to community-based care violated Title II of the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The district court rejected the District's initial argument that it was entitled to summary judgment because it had in place an effective \"\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan\"-that is, a \"comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with [physical] disabilities in less restrictive settings,\" with \"a waiting list that move[s] at a reasonable pace not controlled by the [District's] endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated,\"\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    527 U.S. at 605-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Day v.

The district court identified certain deficiencies in the proposed class and denied the motion without prejudice. In March 2013, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that revised the proposed class definition and alleged multiple deficiencies in the services the District provides to transition disabled individuals from nursing homes to the community.

Plaintiffs have requested\n   four separate accommodations, reflected in the four provisions of the proposed injunction. Thus, the second, third, fourth and fifth common questions are: \"How costly would it be for the District to implement the [[first], [second], [third], or [fourth]] provision of the proposed injunction and would it be unreasonable to require the District to transfer its limited resources from other disabled individuals to pay that cost?\" If the answer to all four of these questions is \"yes, it would be so costly as to be unreasonable,\" the District is not liable. If the answer to at least one of the four questions is \"no, it would not be so costly as to be unreasonable,\" however, Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There is no commonality problem here because common\n   <em>\n    proof\n   </em>\n   will lead to common\n   <em>\n    answers\n   </em>\n   to each of the five\n   <em>\n    questions\n   </em>\n   on which\n   <em>\n    resolution of Plaintiffs' claims\n   </em>\n   turns. As to the first question, common proof will establish whether the District's plan is \"comprehensive\" and \"effectively working\" and whether its waiting list for transition to the community \"moves at a reasonable pace.\" As to the second, third, fourth and fifth questions, common proof will establish both how costly it would be for the District to implement each provision of Plaintiffs' requested injunction and whether it would be unreasonable to require the District to pay that cost, considering the District's limited resources and its obligations to other disabled individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Consider, for example, the first provision of the proposed injunction. This provision would require the District to provide all class members with information regarding community-based long-term care options, determine whether they prefer to transition to the community and, if they do, plan their transition and assist them in accessing available resources to help them transition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.

RESPONSE TO CONCURRENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Respectfully, we have some concerns about the concurring opinion. First, in our view, the concurring opinion miscomprehends the nature of an \"adequate '\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan' \" and, thus, our opinion. Second, in attempting to distinguish the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   , the concurring opinion relies on distinctions between this case and\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   that are inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It is important to emphasize that we view an \"adequate '\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan' \" differently from our colleague. An \"adequate '\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan' \" is a legal standard.\n   <em>\n    Any\n   </em>\n   plan that is \"comprehensive,\" \"effectively working,\" and contains a waiting list that moves at a \"reasonable\" pace is an \"adequate '\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , p. 14. And the district court has discretion in applying the \"comprehensive,\" \"effective\" and \"reasonable\" standards. Our opinion therefore affords both the District and the district court far more leeway than the concurrence apparently believes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We are especially troubled by the concurrence's suggestion that we propose \"to measure success of the ADA claims based primarily on the number of completed or pending placements of disabled individuals in outside housing.\" Concurring Op. 1092. This is not an accurate characterization of the majority opinion. For example, the district court could find, consistent with our opinion, that, in light of the lack of available public housing, the placement of only one individual in a given year\n   <em>\n    could be\n   </em>\n   a \"reasonable pace\" of movement from the District's waiting list. If the district court were to deem the District's plan \"comprehensive\" and \"effectively working,\" the District would then have an \"adequate '\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan' \" in place. The concurrence need not strain too hard to imagine a case \"where a plan producing relatively few successful annual placements ... can be called 'effectively working,' \"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1092-93, for this might be such a case. In short, the concurrence's central criticism-that we \"unduly cabin the discretion that the District should have in crafting services for individuals with disabilities,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1091, and that we make \"speed and success of placements\" the \"exclusive\" determinant of ADA liability,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1092 is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In our view, the approach suggested by the concurring opinion does not offer a viable framework for addressing the issues in this case. The concurrence first suggests that this case and\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   are \"apples and pears.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1088. Specifically, it claims that three distinctions between this case and\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   make the standard set forth in that case inapplicable here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1091-92. The concurring opinion says that, in light of \"three distinctions relevant to the ADA analysis,\" \"we must measure [the District's] services by using a different yardstick from what the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   plurality envisaged for Georgia\" in order \"[t]o determine whether the District is satisfying its ADA obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1091-92. The concurrence first points out that \"we are dealing with a class action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1091. True enough. But \"general rules of practice and procedure\" prescribed by the Supreme Court-such as Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure -\"shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\" Rules Enabling Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b). Thus, the fact that this is a class action is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"relevant to the ADA analysis.\" Concurring Op. 1091. Indeed, in discussing the Rules Enabling Act, the concurrence never once contends that Plaintiffs can be asked to meet a different substantive liability standard because they have chosen to proceed as a class.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072\">\n    at 1096-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And the concurrence nowhere disputes that group homes and private homes are both \"community settings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, and \"most importantly,\" the concurrence says, \"the District does not control the housing where the plaintiff class members hope to be placed, as Georgia did in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   .\" Concurring Op. 1091. Although we agree that this fact is relevant, the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   standard takes it into consideration. The lack of housing is relevant to whether the pace of movement from the waiting list is \"reasonable,\" which, in turn, is relevant to whether the District has an \"adequate '\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan' \" in place. We need not fashion a new legal standard to account for a fact that the existing standard already considers. In our view, this case and\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   are both apples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Having eschewed the applicable\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   standard, the concurrence endorses the standard articulated by the district court. In particular, the concurrence says that the District must prove by a preponderance of the evidence \"that there is no systemic deficiency related to the six characteristics\" the district court identified as dispositive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1096. However, the concurrence does not adequately explain its preference for the district court's six-factor approach. It concludes that the district court \"reasonably derived these six characteristics from at least five settlement agreements in analogous ADA failure-to-accommodate cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1094. But we cannot square the standard the district court derived from its settlement-agreement-survey with the standard enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   . Even assuming the six-factor approach is a useful starting point, the concurrence does not adequately explain why the District must establish that it lacks a \"concrete, systemic deficiency\" related to those six factors to avoid liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1096. Ultimately, the concurrence makes a valiant effort to make sense of the litigation history of this case, but its approach finds no support in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   . We therefore respectfully disagree with its suggested resolution of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   One final note. The concurrence's lengthy causation analysis does not represent the opinion of the court.

This case illustrates the wisdom of providing local governments greater flexibility at the fundamental alteration stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Compared to\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   , this class action presents materially different ADA issues. Our case involves more than 1,000 plaintiffs, or about two-thirds of all individuals currently in District-funded nursing facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Recording 0:57-1:17. The plaintiffs seek a comprehensive government plan with certain transition-related services: assistance with finding housing or performing activities of daily living needed for independent living outside a nursing facility. The plaintiffs wish to move into their own homes or the homes of friends or family members. The housing targeted by the plaintiffs is controlled by either the D.C. Housing Authority (DCHA) or private citizens, and neither are parties to this lawsuit or under the District's control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420041\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/51/#p61\">\n    322 F.R.D. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63, 72, 83 (D.D.C. 2017) (noting that class members have been placed into private housing or \"public/subsidized housing\" managed by the independently run DCHA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   These facts reveal three distinctions relevant to the ADA analysis. First, we are dealing with a class action. An appropriate remedy, on the one hand, could create enormous costs for the government but, on the other hand, could appropriately bring about broad policy changes benefiting an entire population, not merely one or two litigants. Second, the plaintiffs are at different stages of community transition and deinstitutionalization; the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs sought placements in group homes, but our class members hope to reside in their own private homes. We are thus dealing with a whole new level of transition - let's call it \"\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Phase II.\" Third, and most importantly, the District does not control the housing where the plaintiff class members hope to be placed, as Georgia did in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   These factual differences do not meaningfully change the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   analysis. The plaintiff class members here have all established that they are long-term residents of District-funded nursing facilities, that they desire to leave, and that the District has deemed it appropriate for them to enter outside care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420041\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/51/#p61\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420041\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/51/#p61\">\n    at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In this case, ... the class includes all physically disabled individuals who have resided in nursing facilities for over 90 days, are eligible for community-based care, prefer to receive long-term care in the community, and need the District's assistance to transition to the community.\"). As in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   , the isolation in nursing facilities seems facially unjustified, which is enough to establish a presumption that the government violated the ADA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    527 U.S. at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[U]njustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination ....\"). Thus, the plaintiffs have demonstrated an entitlement to facially reasonable accommodations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   But the factual distinctions matter significantly in the fundamental alteration analysis. At bottom, they reveal the unsuitability of executing an identical\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan requirement here. One monumental distinction in this\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Phase II litigation is the reasonableness of placing a burden on the government to create a \"waiting list that move[s] at a reasonable pace.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    at 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion). The record appears to indicate that the District cannot increase the number of housing units available to the plaintiff class members, and the plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. Certainly, the District exercises materially less control over the housing being targeted in this case than Georgia did over group-home placement in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, because we are dealing with a broad class of disabled individuals, not just two plaintiffs, the District Court reasonably may address more systemic changes than a one-off group-home placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   To determine whether the District is satisfying its ADA obligations, we must measure its services by using a different yardstick from what the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   plurality envisaged for Georgia. My colleagues disagree, setting the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan as the primary yardstick.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. 1083-84;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1081 (\"First, does the District have an adequate '\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan' in place? If it does, the District has met its responsibilities.\"). And using the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan yardstick, the majority seems to indicate that mere failure to move plaintiffs off a waitlist at a reasonable pace would be dispositive in showing the ineffectiveness of the District's current plan. Majority Op. 1081. But if the District has no control over the availability and suitability of the housing inventory that the plaintiffs seek, why should a reasonably paced waitlist be a suitable dispositive measurement here, as in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   My colleagues are leading the District Court astray. The majority opinion will inevitably cause the court to measure success of the ADA claims based primarily on the number of completed or pending placements of disabled individuals in outside housing. I don't disagree that speed and success of placements could be relevant factors to the analysis, but we should not establish - as I understand the majority opinion to be doing - a bright-line rule that makes them the exclusive, or even predominant, factors. The District Court essentially would repeat the legal error it made in the opinion below, but from another direction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420041\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/51/#p61\">\n    322 F.R.D. at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (entering judgment for the District simply because it could not envision a \"single injunction that would result in the class members being transitioned to community-based long-term care\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. 1083 (rejecting the District Court's\n   analysis because the remedy need only provide \"increased opportunit[ies]\" for outside treatment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   My colleagues contend that the District Court, in applying their\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan standard, need not fixate on speed and success.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. 1086.

I suspect that the District, owing to no fault of its own, will be unable to show a waitlist moving faster than a glacial pace. Instead of promoting a test that needlessly renders the government unable to defend itself, I would prefer applying the flexible standard that the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   plurality in fact created: whether \"inequit[ies]\" will result from immediate relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    527 U.S. at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   More generally, I worry that future courts will ascertain from the majority opinion a general requirement to consider the specific\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan analysis in all future failure-to-accommodate claims involving community-based care. But future plaintiffs may seek types of accommodations that do not fit neatly within the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   mold. For instance, one plaintiff class might seek modifications to a government-aid program so that its members would remain in the community care they already receive. The standard\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan analysis isn't a good fit because the pace of successful community placements in the past has little relevance to such a claim seeking to prevent future re-institutionalization. Yet the majority opinion appears to make the verbatim\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan the lodestar of all remedial analyses for failure-to-accommodate claims. In some cases, the substantial mismatch between the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan and the facts on the ground will ensure that the District Court's legal analysis will cause prejudice to the local government. In others, the mismatch will harm the vulnerable population of disabled individuals seeking nondiscriminatory care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The District Court should have a freer hand in determining what constitutes adequate transition services and crafting an injunction that fits within the District's current programming and resources.

My colleagues call it a \"fundamental error\" to seek such deficiencies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. 1078, but I cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   At the outset, I note that no party doubts the importance of finding concrete, systemic deficiencies in this litigation. Appellant Ivy Brown here argues only that the class plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged such deficiencies, not that the deficiencies lack a role in the ADA analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. 40-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Raising the issue\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , my colleagues point out that \"[n]owhere does\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   talk about 'concrete, systemic deficiencies.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. But the case does not purport to outline how every treatment-based failure-to-accommodate claim should proceed.\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   is but one gloss of the ADA's failure-to-accommodate claim. As I noted above,\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   is not a class action, but rather a simple case involving the claims of two individual plaintiffs. The District Court has focused on concrete, systemic deficiencies in an attempt to harmonize the substantive ADA standard and our class-action precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Recall that the plaintiffs proposed concrete deficiencies in their pleadings. Because \"reasonable\" accommodations can be an elusive term, the District Court asked the plaintiffs to be more specific as to what they wanted. In response, the plaintiffs identified eleven problems, which helped substantially to clarify matters. By saying the government programming had concrete\n   deficiencies and describing them, the plaintiffs necessarily implied that the fixes for those flaws are the accommodations they seek. Of course, these accommodations are not the same as those requested in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   : successful community placements. Thus, the District Court needed to ensure that they were reasonable and necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.130\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(i). The court properly did that here. The District Court found the deficiencies to relate to the six characteristics of an adequate government plan, which it determined by canvassing analogous settlement agreements. Although the characteristics do not guarantee actual\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Phase II placements, they still appear to provide disabled individuals with meaningful opportunities for future success. And if other local governments are consenting to providing such services, they likely are facially reasonable. Finally, because the plaintiffs established the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   elements of the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420041\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/51/#p61\">\n    322 F.R.D. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , they demonstrated an entitlement to accommodations fixing those specific deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   But it was not enough for the District Court to focus on the concrete deficiencies identified by the plaintiffs. To faithfully follow our Rule 23 precedents, the court needed to concentrate on\n   <em>\n    systemic\n   </em>\n   ones. The relevant cases are\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

A negative answer would show that all class members share at least some of the same legal injuries from the District's institutionalization, and that the injuries result from a concrete, systemic deficiency in the District's transition services. Such classwide injury, and the correspondingly broad remedy to redress it, would distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   . Whereas the lower court in Georgia could demand only the successful placements of the two individual plaintiffs, the District Court here could\n   require institutional changes to the government's transition programming.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

That cannot be squared with the elements of the ADA claim as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   . Because the District Court found the requested classwide accommodations to be facially reasonable in light of the settlement agreements, and because the class at trial established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   entitlement to such accommodations, the burden shifted to the government for proof of inequities. One way to show inequity is to demonstrate that the government's programming in fact already adequately provides the requested accommodations. If it does, then the plan warrants no systemic changes. Put another way, the District may rebut the need for classwide relief by demonstrating that it\n   <em>\n    lacks\n   </em>\n   the concrete, systemic deficiencies raised by the class pleadings and identified by the District Court. (I note that the parties in\n   <em>\n    In re District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279336,4275778\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/96/\">\n    792 F.3d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.

It should largely stick to its original plan and determine on remand whether the District has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is no systemic deficiency related to the six characteristics. That would lead to a proper resolution in this\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Phase II case. The majority opinion instead requires the District Court to engage in a new two-part test largely detached from the characteristics it already articulated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. 1083-84 (requiring the District Court to determine first whether the District has an\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Plan, and second whether the plaintiffs' requested injunctive relief is too \"costly\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   My colleagues say my approach would lead to a violation of the Rules Enabling Act (REA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. 1086-87.

My colleagues have identified no substantive right that is abridged, enlarged, or modified. The elements of the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   claim remain the same in an individual or class action. So too does the fundamental alteration standard: whether inequities arise from immediate relief. If the District Court looks for systemic deficiencies, it is doing so only because they help to reveal the specific accommodations requested by the plaintiffs here and the potential inequities associated with enjoining the District. The only difference between the class action here and\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   would be the scope of the remedy. But even then, the District's \"aggregate\" duty\n   to provide reasonable accommodations \"does not depend on whether the suit proceeds as a class action.\"\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v.

An injunction in the individual action would provide the accommodation only to the named litigants, while an injunction in the class action would provide the same accommodation to the population at large. The latter remedy would affect more people, result in more significant policy changes, and be considered institutional reform. And in the latter case, some absent class members surely would benefit from freeriding because they would not have sought the relief themselves.

For the plaintiffs, the court had a choice between two burdens of proving causation: (1) the traditional \"but for\" causation (a showing by the plaintiffs that their disability-based institutionalization \"would not have occurred\" had the District been providing their requested accommodations) or (2) the less onerous \"motivating factor\" causation (a showing by the plaintiffs that the District's failure to provide their accommodations was \"a 'motivating' or 'substantial' factor\" in their disability-based isolation).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Tex.

For the reasons set forth below, I conclude that the plaintiffs in an\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   claim may establish only \"motivating factor\" causation in their\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, and that the defendant may then prove the absence of \"but for\" causation to rebut liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In identifying the proper causation inquiry, we must pay close attention to the statutory text and context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Husted v.

The state of affordable housing in the District is bleak. More than 80% of individuals in nursing facilities who want to move to the community need some form of public assistance to secure housing. At present, and since April 2013, the D.C. Housing Authority (DCHA) waiting list for public and subsidized housing in the District is closed. Individuals seeking public assistance with housing cannot, at present, be added to the waiting list under any circumstances. The waiting list has over 40,000 names on it, and, for some categories, it will not need to be opened for over 20 years. ... For class members who did not add themselves to the DCHA waiting list before it closed in April 2013, the MFP voucher lottery [which will cease to be available in 2020] is essentially the only viable avenue for securing subsidized housing. With only 65 MFP set-aside vouchers, there is nowhere near enough capacity to provide housing to all class members.\" (record citations omitted)).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    If on remand the district court reaffirms these factual findings under the correct burden of proof, it appears the third provision of the proposed injunction,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , p. 1075, requiring the District to transfer a certain number of class members to the community each year, would likely be so costly as to be unreasonable.
