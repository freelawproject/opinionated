He is serving a 60-years-to-life sentence under California's Three Strikes Law for attempted burglary and receipt of stolen property.\n   <em>\n    People v. Claiborne,\n   </em>\n   No. B260391,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205146746\">\n    2015 WL 5146746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Cal. Ct. App. Sept. 2, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Claiborne is mobility impaired due to a right knee replacement in 2007 and ensuing chronic problems with that knee. Given his condition, Claiborne participates in the CDCR Disability Placement Program and receives certain accommodations in prison: he is allowed to use a cane; he is restricted to housing on the lower level, with no stairs; and, when escorting Claiborne within the institution, correctional staff must use \"waist chains\" and choose \"relatively level terrain and no obstructions in the path of travel.\" Waist chains are different from traditional handcuffs; whereas the latter are typically applied behind the back, the former allow a mobility impaired inmate to keep his hands at his sides during an escort, which lets him use any prescribed accommodation devices like a cane. CDCR documents and conveys information about Claiborne's accommodations to prison officials through physician orders known as medical accommodation \"chronos\" in his file. Claiborne also wears a green vest to alert officers that he is mobility impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The incident between Claiborne and Officers Blauser and Martin took place on May 3, 2010, while Claiborne was housed at California's High Desert State Prison, a Level Four security prison. As Claiborne was waiting for his medication in the morning \"pill line,\" Correctional Officer Daniel McBride, stationed in an observation tower, believed he saw Claiborne socializing with other inmates in the line. Officer McBride called Officer Blauser, who was working in Claiborne's housing unit along with her partner, Officer Martin, and asked Blauser to counsel Claiborne for unnecessarily lingering in the pill line. After waiting thirty minutes in the pill line, Claiborne received his medication and returned to his housing unit where he was admonished by Officer Blauser. She decided to \"put a cap\" on Claiborne's door, meaning he would spend the rest of the day locked up in his cell. Because Claiborne had intended to present at a Bible study group later that day, he asked to speak with the sergeant, Officer Blauser's supervisor, to contest the punishment and explain that he had been properly waiting in line and not socializing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The account of the facts diverge drastically from there. According to Claiborne, he was acting respectfully toward Officer Blauser when she told him to \"cuff up.\" He complied and, as Officers Blauser and Martin started to escort him, Claiborne informed them that it was difficult for him to walk and use his cane with his hands cuffed behind his back. He mentioned his chrono for waist chains but Officer Blauser told Officer Martin to take Claiborne's cane. Officer Martin said he would help hold Claiborne up as the three of them walked to the program office to speak with the sergeant. Claiborne, however, had difficulty walking with Officers Blauser and Martin. They escorted him straight across the yard, rather than along the sidewalk circling the yard, despite Claiborne's chrono\n   providing for level terrain. Because the yard was uneven, Claiborne hyperextended his right leg, causing his knee to give out partway across the yard. Claiborne lost balance and shifted rightward, causing Officer Blauser to order him to stop resisting. Claiborne tried to explain that he was not resisting and that his knee was bothering him because the officers were pulling him too quickly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the three were almost at the program office, Claiborne's right leg hyperextended again as he tried to pick the leg up three to five inches from the dirt yard onto the pavement. Because he had no cane to catch himself, Claiborne leaned to his right again, causing Officer Blauser to shout \"he's resisting\" and pull him down to the ground. She jumped on his right side, including his replaced knee, and pulled his hair and hit him in the face a few times. Other officers quickly rushed to the scene and Claiborne heard individuals ask, \"Where's his cane?\" and \"Why isn't he in waist chains?\" Claiborne was eventually taken into a holding cell and then interviewed by a sergeant, which was recorded by a video camera. Before turning on the camera to record the interview, the sergeant warned Claiborne that if he reported excessive force, he would be taken to the \"hole,\" in other words, administrative segregation, for an unknown amount of time. Worried about whether his medical needs would be met in the hole, Claiborne eventually stated on camera, after extended back-and-forth with the sergeant, that there was no excessive force used against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officers Blauser and Martin presented a different account. They were both aware of Claiborne's mobility impairment at the time of the incident. According to Officer Blauser, while she counseled Claiborne for lingering in the pill line, he became \"really aggravated\" and started raising his voice at her, causing her to feel uncomfortable. Claiborne then walked toward her while holding, not using, his cane. Because she did not feel safe, Officer Blauser told Claiborne to \"cuff up,\" and he immediately turned around and complied. She asked her partner, Officer Martin, to assist her with escorting Claiborne to the program office. Officer Martin took Claiborne's cane, and they each supported him by holding onto his bicep or arm on each side. Neither Officer Blauser nor Officer Martin recalled Claiborne saying anything about needing to use waist chains. Moreover, because it would have taken a few extra minutes to obtain waist chains, Officer Blauser decided to use handcuffs due to Claiborne's aggression and defiance of her order to return to his cell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to Officers Blauser and Martin, they escorted Claiborne straight across the yard because it was the quickest and most direct path to the program office and avoided walking amongst other inmates. They escorted him slowly and did not perceive any problems with his walking. Rather, they believed that Claiborne tried to break away from them twice, once halfway across the yard, and a second time close to the program office. At first, Officer Blauser ordered Claiborne not to pull his arm away but he continued to act aggressively, yelling and trying to pull away from her. When Claiborne pulled his arm away from her a second time, Officer Blauser decided to pull him down and called a \"code one\" over the radio. Officers Blauser and Martin used their weight to hold Claiborne down on the ground. They denied that Officer Blauser jumped on Claiborne, pulled his hair or punched him in the face. After other officers escorted Claiborne away, Sergeant Officer Kenneth Gullion followed protocol and conducted a video-recorded \"use-of-force\" interview, asking Claiborne about what took place. Sergeant Gullion did not remember what\n   happened prior to interviewing Claiborne on video. A separate officer wrote Claiborne up for a rule violation, resisting a peace officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after the incident, a nurse examined Claiborne and completed a medical report, noting that he had two abrasions, one each on his left knee and left cheek. Afterward, Claiborne experienced more problems with his right knee, and doctors determined that he had significant injuries, including bursitis. Following a series of evaluations, Claiborne was assessed to have \"[f]ailed right total knee arthroplasty.\" He underwent a revision procedure in 2012, but was told that his knee did not respond properly to the surgery and could not be fixed any more. Claiborne also had surgery on one of his shoulders in July 2015, when he was told that he waited too long to fix it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After exhausting the prison's administrative process, Claiborne filed suit in district court. Proceeding pro se, he sued Officers Blauser, Martin and other individual officers under Section 1983 for various claims, including the use of excessive force and deliberate indifference to his medical needs in violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. The other named defendant officers and other claims, including battery, negligent infliction of emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress, were eventually dismissed from the case. After the district court denied cross-motions for summary judgment, the case proceeded to trial on the two Eighth Amendment claims against Officers Blauser and Martin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial lasted three days, at the start of which the district court noted, outside of the jury's presence, that Claiborne was shackled. Claiborne testified on his own behalf, and two fellow inmates also testified on his behalf. The defense presented testimony from six officers including Officers Blauser and Martin, the tower guard officer (McBride), and Sergeant Gullion. The jury reached a verdict for both defendants on both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Claiborne filed a timely motion for new trial and relief from judgment, raising various arguments. Most relevant to our analysis, Claiborne argued that he was entitled to a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a) because he was visibly shackled while litigating his case in front of the jury. He also argued for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) because the district court barred his testimony about the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), prevented him from introducing or testifying about his medical records, and denied his request for a medical expert. The district court dismissed all the arguments and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When reviewing denial of a motion for new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a), our default is to review for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See Hung Lam v. City of San Jose,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266919\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1077/#p1084\">\n    869 F.3d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1084 (9th Cir. 2017). But here, Claiborne did not object to his shackling at trial so we must address the appropriate standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Errors not objected to at trial are generally subject to waiver or forfeiture. \"Forfeiture is the failure to make a timely assertion of a right, whereas waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In total, Officer Blauser referred to Claiborne as \"aggressive\" or a threat at least forty times during her testimony. In closing arguments, the defense repeated Blauser's testimony and emphasized that \"she perceived a threat\" and \"took the most reasonable action under the circumstances.\" In short, if the jury believed that Claiborne posed a threat to the officers, then defendants prevailed because their use of force was justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Not only did Claiborne's case hinge on his alleged dangerousness, the trial pitted his credibility against the defendant officers' credibility, and raised the issue of flight risk as defendants claimed that he was trying to escape from them during their escort in 2010.

There was no individualized determination of the security need for such restraints, yet this mobility impaired plaintiff was presented to the jury in shackles, corroborating the defense's position that Claiborne was an insubordinate, aggressive inmate and thereby undermining his case. On remand, the district court has discretion to impose\n   shackling during the new trial, but it may only do so after a full hearing at which officers show a compelling need for security and the court considers any less restrictive alternatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See Duckett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415399\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/734/#p747\">\n    67 F.3d at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Tyars,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341854\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/709/1274/#p1284\">\n    709 F.2d at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also Davidson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415813\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/44/1118/#p1122\">\n    44 F.3d at 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's denial of Claiborne's Rule 59(a) motion and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*.\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Honorable Gary Feinerman, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    We find no merit to defendants' alternative argument that Claiborne invited the error.
