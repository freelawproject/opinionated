Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with\n   <em>\n    Troester\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. The District Court's Order Granting Summary Judgment for Nike\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nike has 34 retail stores in California. At these stores, employees (other than those exempt from applicable wage and hour laws) are required to track their hours by \"punching\" in and out on a time\n   clock. Separately, these employees are required to submit to exit inspections each time they leave the store on a break or at the end of the day. These inspections can be longer or shorter depending, for example, on whether an employee needs to wait at the exit for someone to check them, whether the employee is carrying a box or bag that must be inspected, or the like. Regardless of how long the inspections take, however, they occur after the employee has punched out, such that exit inspections are \"off the clock\" and are thus uncompensated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Isaac Rodriguez worked at Nike's Gilroy, California retail store from November 2011 to January 2012. On February 25, 2014, Rodriguez filed a class-action complaint in Santa Clara County Superior Court, and on April 1, 2014, Nike removed the case to the District Court. On December 8, 2014, Rodriguez filed his First Amended Class Action Complaint, which brings claims under: (1) California Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 1194 and 1197 (failure to pay minimum wages); (2) California Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 510 and 1194 (failure to pay overtime wages); and (3) California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200 et seq. (unfair business practices). On August 19, 2016, the District Court certified a class of \"[a]ll current and former non-exempt retail store employees of [Nike] who worked in California during the period from February 25, 2010 to the present.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 31, 2017, Nike moved for summary judgment against the certified class. Nike argued that Rodriguez's claims were barred by the federal\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine, which precludes recovery for otherwise compensable amounts of time that are small, irregular, or administratively difficult to record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/#p692\">\n    328 U.S. 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/#p692\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/#p692\">\n    90 L.Ed. 1515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1946) ;\n   <em>\n    Lindow v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661654\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/1057/#p1062\">\n    738 F.2d 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1062-63 (9th Cir. 1984). In support of its motion, Nike put forth expert testimony from Robert Crandall, who, in response to this lawsuit, conducted a \"time and motion study\" to measure the length of exit inspections at Nike's California stores. Crandall randomly selected 15 of Nike's California retail locations and conducted video and in-person observations over a 30-day period. Based on his study, Crandall concluded that the average exit inspection took between 16.9 and 20.2 seconds, and that the median inspection took 4.7 seconds. Crandall also concluded that 21.5% of inspections took no measurable time, 92.2% took less than a minute, and 97.5% took less than two minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his opposition to Nike's motion, Rodriguez put forth testimony from his own expert, Brian Kriegler, who analyzed Crandall's study. Based on Kriegler's testimony, Rodriguez argued that Crandall's study was flawed in several respects, including that it: (1) covered too brief a sample to be extrapolated to the class period; (2) relied on \"judgment calls\" about what was happening in video observations; (3) artificially decreased inspection times by assuming that subjects who were interacting with others were not also waiting to be inspected; and (4) contained disparities between video and in-person observations. Rodriguez also put forth deposition testimony from Nike store managers who said that exit inspections regularly took several minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Furthermore, Rodriguez noted that the question of whether the federal\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine applied to California Labor Code claims was then pending before the California Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Troester v. Starbucks Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12395542\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/680/511/#p512\">\n    680 F. App'x 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (9th Cir. 2016) (certifying the question). Even if the doctrine applied, Rodriguez argued, Nike failed to carry its burden because it did not show that the amounts\n   of time at issue were small, irregular, or administratively difficult to record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 12, 2017, the District Court granted Nike's motion and dismissed the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Nike Retail Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-01508-BLF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204005591\">\n    2017 WL 4005591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 12, 2017). The court began by addressing whether the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine applied to Rodriguez's claims and by explaining that \"Nike's motion for summary judgment hinges on this question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Although the court acknowledged that the question was pending before the California Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Troester\n   </em>\n   , it stated that it \"must operate in the present legal landscape and apply the law as it currently exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Under current precedent, the court held, \"the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine is a valid defense to wage claims brought under the California Labor Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court then applied the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Lindow v. United States\n   </em>\n   , which courts in our circuit consider when evaluating whether amounts of time are\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   : \"(1) the practical administrative difficulty of recording the additional time; (2) the aggregate amount of compensable time; and (3) the regularity of the additional work.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661654\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/1057/#p1062\">\n    738 F.2d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before applying the\n   <em>\n    Lindow\n   </em>\n   factors, the District Court summarized the evidence before it. The court stated that it would not consider Kriegler's testimony insofar as it attacked the accuracy of Crandall's study because these attacks did \"not supply evidence addressing any of the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204005591\">\n    2017 WL 4005591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Although such attacks \"may be appropriate on a motion to strike expert testimony,\" the court reasoned, \"it is not evidence that creates a factual dispute for purposes of summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204005591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the court held, to the extent that Rodriguez intended for his motion to be construed as a motion to strike, the motion was denied, as Kriegler's testimony failed to show that Crandall's study was so unreliable as to be inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. The court did, however, consider the depositions of Nike store managers who testified that exit inspections regularly took several minutes. On this basis, the court concluded that, \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\" Rodriguez, \"it is undisputed that an exit inspection takes between zero seconds and several minutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Even assuming that exit inspections took several minutes, however, the court held that this time was\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   under\n   <em>\n    Lindow\n   </em>\n   . The court began by noting that \"[a]n important factor in determining whether a claim is\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   is the amount of daily time spent on the additional work,\" and that \"courts have regularly held that daily periods of up to 10 minutes are\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11 (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lindow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661654\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/1057/#p1062\">\n    738 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1062 ). The court then turned to the first\n   <em>\n    Lindow\n   </em>\n   factor-the administrative difficulty involved in recording exit-inspection time-and held that Rodriguez had failed to create a triable issue by arguing that Nike should install time clocks at store exits, rather than at the back of the store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13-14. Not only did Nike offer business reasons for having clocks at the back of the store, the court explained, but Rodriguez's proposal would also require some employees to spend more time clocking back in and out at store exits than they spent undergoing inspections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14. This conclusion was unaltered, the court held, by the fact that other major retailers placed time clocks at the front of their stores to compensate employees for security checks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13. The court also acknowledged, but did not address, Rodriguez's further proposals that Nike perform inspections at the back of the store before employees clock out, or that Nike add a fixed amount of time to each employee's\n   paycheck to account for inspection time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moving to the aggregate amount of compensable time, the court repeated the point that daily periods of 10 minutes or less are generally considered\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15. Even if each exit inspection took several minutes, the court reasoned, it would take multiple exits to meet the 10-minute threshold. Moreover, the court explained, \"the\n   <em>\n    Lindow\n   </em>\n   court made clear that even when an aggregate claim is substantial, a claim may still be considered\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   'because of the administrative difficulty of recording the time and the irregularity of the additional [ ] work.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *16 (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lindow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661654\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/1057/#p1062\">\n    738 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1064 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, with respect to regularity, the court held that Crandall's study \"demonstrates that compensable exit times lasting at least 60 seconds did not occur regularly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661654\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/1057/#p1062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The 60-second threshold was important, the court concluded, because Nike's systems measured time to the whole minute, and a 60-second inspection would thus have a measurable effect on wages. Although, as noted, Rodriguez had put forth testimony from Nike store managers that exit inspections could take several minutes, the court held that there was no evidence that such inspections occurred regularly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *17. Accordingly, the court concluded that each of the\n   <em>\n    Lindow\n   </em>\n   factors favored Nike and that no reasonable jury could find that exit inspections were compensable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B. The California Supreme Court's Decision in\n   <em>\n    Troester\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rodriguez filed his notice of appeal on September 14, 2017, and on April 20, 2018, we stayed appellate proceedings pending the California Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Troester\n   </em>\n   .

Moreover, while Crandall found that 69.0% of exit inspections took less than 15 seconds, and that 81.4% of inspections took less than 30 seconds, multiple Nike store managers testified, to the contrary, that longer inspections were common.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (\"90% of the time an employee was required to wait for some period of time for a manager to be available to perform the exit inspection,\" and \"60-65% of the time that period of waiting time was at least a minute.\" (quotations omitted));\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"40-50% of the time ..., the employee had to wait at least one full minute before the check was performed.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *12 (\"[A]bout 45 percent of the time an employee would be required to wait a minute or two for a manager to become available and perform a security check.\" (quotations omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Given this evidence, we cannot conclude that exit inspections qualify as \"split-second absurdities.\" Nor do they appear so \"irregular that it is unreasonable to expect the time to be recorded.\" Even according to Crandall's study, the vast majority of inspections took measurable amounts of time, and there is a genuine dispute between the parties as to whether these amounts were more than \"minute,\" \"brief,\" or \"trifling.\" As such, the record below does not support affirmance of the District Court's grant of summary judgment, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n   <em>\n    Troester\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    It is irrelevant, moreover, that Nike's timekeeping system records time in whole-minute increments. The record indicates that Nike's system truncates clock-in and clock-out times, such that an employee who clocks in/out at 10:00 AM and 55 seconds is credited as clocking in/out at 10:00 AM. Under this system (or a system that rounds rather than truncates), an employee does not need to undergo an exit inspection lasting longer than one minute to lose one minute of compensable time. Instead, an employee who clocks out at 10:00 AM and 55 seconds will lose one minute of compensable time if they undergo even a 5-second inspection after clocking out, because they would have been credited as clocking out at 10:01 AM, rather than at 10:00 AM, if they had been inspected before clocking out. Whether an employee loses one minute of compensable time is therefore only a matter of probability, with the probability approaching 1 as the inspection time approaches one minute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
