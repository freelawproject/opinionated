June 18, 2010). Beset by acrimony, TD Bank filed this copyright lawsuit against Hill, alleging that a portion of his 2012 book infringes a neglected manuscript that Hill co-authored while CEO of Commerce Bank. In enjoining Hill from publishing or marketing his book, the District Court concluded that TD Bank owned the copyright under a letter agreement and that Hill's book irreparably violated the Bank's \"right to not use the copyright.\" App. 9. In this denouement, we resolve certain open questions in our Circuit concerning employees' rights to their artistic creations and the proper exercise of equitable discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We conclude that, although the agreement between the parties did not vest initial ownership of the copyright in the Bank by purporting to designate the manuscript a work \"for hire,\" it did transfer any ownership interest Hill possessed to TD Bank. As a result, Hill's co-ownership defense, like his other defenses, fails. As for the imposition of injunctive relief, however, we cannot accept the District Court's sweeping conclusions, which would justify the issuance of an injunction in every copyright case. Instead of employing \"categorical rule[s]\" that would resolve the propriety of injunctive relief \"in a broad swath of cases,\" courts should issue injunctive relief only if the moving party makes a sufficient showing that such relief is warranted under the particular circumstances of that case.\n   <em>\n    eBay Inc. v.

Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court's permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Described by\n   <em>\n    American Banker\n   </em>\n   as \"the closest thing that the staid banking industry\n   has to a rock star,\" App. 1157, Vernon W. Hill, II headed Commerce Bank from its launch as a single \"store\" in 1973 until June 2007, a few months before TD Bank acquired it for approximately $8.5 billion. Hill built Commerce Bank in the highly saturated commercial banking industry by emphasizing customer loyalty through initiatives such as extended hours, quick account openings, and free perks at branches. His success also brought him personal acclaim, including articles in\n   <em>\n    The Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    American Banker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Guardian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    The Daily Telegraph\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As CEO of Commerce Bank, Hill reported to the Board of Directors and handled the day-to-day management of the Bank's affairs, including reviewing the Bank's finances, visiting its stores, and handling real estate and insurance matters. Under his employment agreement with Commerce Bank, Hill had \"primary responsibility for all operations of Commerce and its subsidiaries ..., provided that such duties are consistent with his present duties,\" and agreed to \"devote his full time and best efforts to the business and affairs of Commerce and its subsidiaries.\" App. 803. Notwithstanding this commitment, however, the Agreement allowed Hill to pursue \"outside activities,\" which the Agreement did not define. App. 803.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2006, Hill decided to write a book about his business philosophy and more than 30-year tenure at the Bank. Seeing this as a marketing opportunity, Commerce Bank supported the endeavor by hiring a business book author, Robert Andelman, to collaborate with Hill in drafting the manuscript. Hill exchanged some emails about the project during weekdays but primarily worked on the project during evenings and weekends. Other Commerce Bank employees sometimes assisted, for example, by answering Andelman's inquiries and providing feedback about the manuscript. The final manuscript, completed in 2007, recounts Commerce Bank's history and business model from Hill's perspective. Resembling both an autobiography and a marketing tool, the 2007 manuscript included both a personal dedication to Hill's wife and \"the entire Commerce team,\" App. 834, and a $20 gift certificate to open an account at Commerce Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Commerce Bank spearheaded the publication efforts by entering into an agreement with Portfolio, a division of Penguin Books. In this publishing agreement, Commerce Bank, which is defined as the \"Author,\" represented and warranted that it was the exclusive owner of all rights conveyed in the manuscript:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Author [i.e., Commerce Bank] hereby represents and warrants ... that Vernon Hill is the sole author of the Work; that the Work is or will be Vernon Hill's next book length work ...; that the Author is the sole and exclusive owner of all rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement and has not assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered the same; ... that the Author has full power to enter into this Agreement and to make the grants herein contained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   App. 1142. For his part, Vernon Hill signed a letter to Portfolio that referred to an attached copy of the publishing agreement and provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I hereby unconditionally guarantee, promise and agree with the Publisher, its successors and assigns that the Author [i.e., Commerce Bank] will, in all\n   respects, faithfully perform and fulfill all obligations of the Agreement on its part to be performed and fulfilled at the time and in the manner therein provided. I also unconditionally guarantee that the Work is a work made for hire within the meaning of the United States Copyright Law and that the Author is the owner of copyright in the Work and has full power and authority to enter into the Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   App. 1139. Both this letter agreement and the publishing agreement contain New York choice-of-law provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But the best laid schemes of mice and men often go awry: The relationship between Hill and Commerce Bank soured, culminating in Hill's termination and TD Bank's acquisition of Commerce Bank.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308677\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/586/874/\">\n    586 F. App'x at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the 2007 manuscript was never published, and by April 2008, Commerce Bank terminated the publishing agreement with Portfolio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As the years progressed, however, Hill sought to make use of certain portions of the manuscript. By July 2010, Hill had debuted his next commercial banking venture, Metro Bank UK. The bank's launch, the first in Great Britain for over a century, garnered significant press coverage on both sides of the Atlantic. Capitalizing on this comeback, Hill co-authored another book with Andelman-this one describing Hill's experiences founding Metro Bank UK, the British banking system, and Hill's pet insurance company, Petplan USA. The book, entitled\n   <em>\n    FANS! Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No-Growth World\n   </em>\n   , became available in November 2012 through online booksellers such as Amazon and barnesandnoble.com. Hill also publicized the book's launch through interviews, including with Jim Cramer, the host of\n   <em>\n    Mad Money\n   </em>\n   on CNBC, and with a columnist for the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plot thickened when this new endeavor came to the attention of TD Bank. Having shelved the 2007 manuscript for years, the Bank suddenly registered it with the Copyright Office and sent take-down demands to twenty retailers alleging that Hill's book infringed its copyright. Shortly thereafter, it filed suit in the District of New Jersey for copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the litigation progressed, discovery revealed that TD Bank had little actually at stake: TD Bank admitted that, at most, 16% of the book infringed the 2007 manuscript, and that it has never published the 2007 manuscript or any competing work and has no interest in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nonetheless, in its summary judgment opinion, the District Court concluded that, because the letter agreement \"deem[ed] the work to be a work made for hire,\" it was in fact a work for hire, vesting the copyright in the 2007 manuscript with Commerce Bank as Hill's employer. App. 35 n.10. Rejecting Hill's infringement defenses, the District Court determined that Hill had copied expressive content that was not unprotectable under the merger and\n   <em>\n    sc\u00e8ne-\u00e0-faire\n   </em>\n   doctrines. And Hill's copying, the District Court held, was not fair use because Hill did not repurpose the copied portion; the original manuscript was unpublished; and Hill's infringement would likely result in \"some impairment\" to the market for the 2007 manuscript \"should TD Bank ever choose to publish [it].\" App. 48 (emphasis omitted). But the District Court declined to issue an injunction, explaining that TD Bank had failed to show a likelihood of continued infringement and had not addressed at all the adequacy of legal remedies or the balance of hardships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hill faced his peripeteia in this litigation a year later. Confronted with evidence of Hill's continued promotion of the 2012 book and distribution of complimentary\n   copies at a local chamber of commerce event, the District Court enjoined Hill from \"publish[ing], market[ing], distribut[ing] or sell[ing]\" the 2012 book. App. 4. This conduct, the District Court found, irreparably harmed TD Bank by depriving it of the \"right to not use the copyright.\" App. 9. Hill timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There is no final judgment in this case because the District Court has stayed TD Bank's request for infringer's profits under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) pending the outcome of this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshak v.

Thus, we have jurisdiction only over the District Court's \"grant[ ]\" of a permanent injunction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136925\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/184/#p190\">\n    240 F.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before reaching the merits of Hill's appeal, we must first address TD Bank's contention that this appeal is moot and that we lack jurisdiction to consider the District Court's summary judgment ruling, even to the extent that it served as the necessary predicate for the permanent injunction. We reject both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   TD Bank first contends that this appeal is moot because Hill released a revised version of the book about a month after the District Court issued the injunction and, as TD Bank posits in a footnote to its appellate brief, \"the July 7, 2016 Kindle version [of Hill's book] ... does not infringe on the 2007 manuscript.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellee's Br. 3 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Compliance with an injunction can moot an appeal if there is no \"reasonable expectation\" that the injunction will govern the enjoined party's future conduct or otherwise injure him.\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

Yet TD Bank's footnote conceding that the July 7, 2016 Kindle version does not infringe the 2007 manuscript hardly constitutes the broad \"unconditional and irrevocable\" covenant not to sue that is needed to moot a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/#p93\">\n    568 U.S. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/#p93\">\n    133 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/#p93\">\n    184 L.Ed.2d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (applying the voluntary-cessation doctrine). Even if we accept the footnote as legally binding, it applies only to \"the July 7, 2016 Kindle version.\" Appellee's Br. 3 n.1. In fact, at oral argument, TD Bank's counsel refused to concede that any other version of the revised book complied with the injunction, demanding twice that Hill first \"certif[y]\" that he will not publish, distribute, or otherwise market the 2012 book (which sounds much like a consent decree). Third Cir. Arg. Recording at 57:48-58:06, 58:38-58:50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record also reflects that the Bank sent two letters asserting that the\n   rewritten book may still contain copyrighted content; the latter letter threatened to bring contempt sanctions against Hill. Hill, meanwhile, continues to profess his intention \"to share the earlier book.\" Appellant's Reply Br. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   TD Bank's other arguments on appeal are inconsistent with its assertion that this case is moot. For instance, the Bank urges us not to vacate the permanent injunction if we conclude that this appeal is moot,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930686\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/36/#p39\">\n    340 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930686\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/36/#p39\">\n    71 S.Ct. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%2036\">\n    95 L.Ed. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1950), because doing so would \"permit the infringing 2012 Book to become available.\" Appellee's Br. 3 n.3. That is to say, TD Bank does believe the injunction meaningfully constrains Hill's future conduct. And, in the same brief as its footnote concession, TD Bank accuses Hill of \"continu[ing] to infringe TD Bank's copyright in the 2007 Manuscript\" even \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the entry of the PI order.\" Appellee's Br. 24 n.12. TD Bank's motion to supplement the record reiterates these allegations, citing material that supposedly \"evidences the District Court's prescience in finding that Mr. Hill was likely to continue infringing TD Bank's copyright.\" Appellee's Mot. Suppl. R. at 8 (Apr. 25, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   TD Bank cannot have it both ways: Hill cannot be both a continuing infringer and fully compliant with the permanent injunction. As there is at least a reasonable likelihood that the injunction controls Hill's future conduct, this appeal is not moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n    441 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   543 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Scope of the Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   TD Bank next contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of the non-appealable summary judgment order-even to the extent that the permanent injunction order rests on its determination of ownership and liability-because Hill did not separately identify the summary judgment order in his notice of appeal. We are unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our interlocutory jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) encompasses matters \"inextricably linked\" with the issuance of a permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    Marshak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136925\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/184/#p190\">\n    240 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   190 ;\n   <em>\n    Kershner v.

Applying this standard, we have previously reviewed summary judgment orders that made the determination of liability necessary for the issuance of a permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doeblers' Pa.

Insofar as this was error, it is understandable because Hill cannot directly appeal the summary judgment order under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). At a minimum, the summary judgment order falls within those unspecified orders that we may consider on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550704\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/121/#p127\">\n    710 F.3d at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The summary judgment order established two fundamental prerequisites for issuing a copyright injunction-namely, TD Bank's ownership of the copyright and Hill's liability for infringement. The District Court also made repeated references in its permanent injunction opinion to its summary judgment decision, including incorporating\n   by reference that order's rendition of the undisputed facts.

Although Hill's commitment \"guarantee[ing], promis[ing] and agree[ing]\" that Commerce Bank would fulfill its obligations could by itself suggest a guarantee, Hill separately \"guarantee[d]\" that the manuscript \"is a work made for hire,\" that Commerce Bank \"is the owner of copyright,\" and that the Bank \"has full power to enter into\" the publishing agreement.

Nothing in these latter provisions resembles a true guarantee, as Hill assumed these obligations without reference to any other agreement or any other party's obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Instead, Hill's commitments together convey an unmistakable intent to effect a present transfer of any interest he possessed in the manuscript. Hill's assurance that the manuscript \"is a work made for hire,\" App. 1139, though insufficient to actually render it for hire, denotes an intent to relinquish his interest in the copyright.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1\n   <em>\n    Nimmer on Copyright\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.03[B][1][b][ii]. The use of the definite article \"the\" in \"[Commerce Bank] is\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   owner of copyright\" also implies that Commerce Bank is the sole owner of the copyright. App. 1139;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Edgenet, Inc. v.

And this implication gains force in the second half of that sentence, which provides that Commerce Bank has \"full power\" to execute the publishing agreement, because a co-owner lacks the authority to grant a truly exclusive license without the consent of all co-owners.\n   <em>\n    Brownstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071615\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/55/#p64\">\n    742 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   68 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Finally, any lingering doubt is dispelled by the letter's reference to the publishing agreement, which states that Commerce Bank \"is\n   <em>\n    the sole\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   owner of all rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. 1142 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We recognize that courts do not lightly infer that a party has assigned his interest in a copyright, particularly given the Copyright Act's writing requirement, and in doubtful cases, a document should not be construed to divest an author completely of his ownership interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baisden v.

In fact, TD Bank responded to similar admission requests by denying them, quoting or referencing, inter alia, the letter, and asserting that the document spoke for itself. It also could have answered in the alternative if it really believed that the letter could be considered an assignment. For instance, it could have stated that, while the document constitutes an acknowledgement of Commerce Bank's initial ownership, \"the Guaranty is an assignment\" to the extent Commerce Bank is not considered to be the initial owner. But it did not do so. Instead of leaving open the possibility that it became the copyright owner by means of a transfer or assignment from the original owner (or co-owner), TD Bank went so far as to emphasize the term \"initial\" in \"the\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   owner.\" Similarly, \"Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute In Support of Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\" stated: \"Undisputed that the Guaranty does not contain such an express provision [in which Mr. Hill assigned any right, title, or interest in the Unpublished Manuscript to Commerce].\" (JA1388). \"Disputed that the lack of such a provision provides Mr. Hill with any ownership interest in the copyright in the 2007 Manuscript.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing JA477, JA1139).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   TD Bank's pattern of failing to raise or contest the issue of assignment has continued on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In his opening appellate brief, Hill argues at some length that the District Court erred in relying on the letter. \"The only inquiry to which these contracts might be relevant is whether, after Mr. Hill's ownership vested, he executed an agreement transferring the copyright after creation, in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20204\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" (Appellant's Brief at 47-48 (citing\n   <em>\n    Brownstein v.

Citing to TD Bank's Responses to Defendant's First Set of Requests for Admissions, Hill asserts that \"TD Bank concedes that no such writing exists,\" which, in turn, purportedly entitles him to judgment as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48 (citing JA1307).) According to Hill, the District Court, among other things, failed to analyze the statutory writing requirement, acknowledge TD Bank's admission, properly apply New York's contract law in its consideration of the letter and the publishing agreement, or recognize that there is a presumption against transfers of copyright ownership unless they are clearly\n   stated. In the process, Hill (indirectly) cites TD Bank's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute In Support of Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071615\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/55/#p64\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"In fact, there is no evidence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   agreement over copyright ownership between Commerce and Mr. Hill, whose signatures never appear on the same contract.\" (citing JA1586)).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Faced with these assertions, one would expect TD Bank to respond (at least in the form of an alternative argument) that Hill did assign any interest he may have had in the manuscript pursuant to \u00a7 204 and New York law. At the very least, it would be expected that a litigant would deny an adversary's concession assertion if it truly believed that no such thing had occurred. Yet TD Bank does nothing of the sort. Instead, it simply characterizes Hill's contention \"[t]hat '[t]he Guaranty never says that Mr. Hill agrees to transfer exclusive ownership to Commerce' \" as \"a basic mistake regarding the Copyright Act's 'work made for hire' provision.\" (Appellee's Brief at 37 (quoting Appellant's Brief at 48).) \"Because the 2007 Manuscript was a 'work made for hire,' (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-47] ), TD Bank is the work's statutory 'author' and sole copyright owner on day one,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and no transfer to TD Bank is required.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to TD Bank, it is actually Hill's obligation to produce a written agreement transferring ownership to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   TD Bank did not argue that there was any assignment from Hill to Commerce Bank until oral argument, after this Court directed the parties to be prepared to discuss this issue of whether the letter constitutes a valid assignment under New York law and the Copyright Act. I do not believe it is appropriate for us to overlook what TD Bank (an obviously sophisticated litigant represented by able counsel) has done-and not done-regarding the issue of assignment throughout the course of this litigation. Recently, this Court considered a party's course of conduct to decide that it had waived its objection to a particular jury instruction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520668\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/920/182/#p187\">\n    920 F.3d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We hold that First State has waived this argument because of its continued acquiescence to Robinson's case theory, its encouragement of the adoption of the very jury instruction to which it now objects, and its failure to include this error in its post-trial briefing.\").

Certainly, the inclusion of this sort of language would have dispelled doubt and \"convey an unmistakable intent\" to effect a transfer (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ----). Although not strictly required as a matter of law (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572971\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/549/#p564\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 274-75 n.8), the existence of a document executed by the putative assignor and assignee would also have been stronger evidence of an assignment than what we have here, i.e., a publishing agreement executed by Commerce Bank and Portfolio, and a letter signed by Hill addressed to Portfolio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In turn, Hill's letter to Portfolio and the publishing agreement between Commerce Bank and Portfolio could be reasonably read as indicating that there was no copyright assignment. As the majority explains, the letter consists of two principal covenants: (1) \"Hill acknowledged the publishing agreement, a copy of which was attached to the letter, and 'guarantee[d], promise[d] and agree[d] with the Publisher\n   ... that the Author [i.e., Commerce Bank] will, in all respects, faithfully perform and fulfill all obligations of the Agreement' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 274 (quoting JA1139)); and (2) \"Hill 'unconditionally guarantee[d] that the Work is a work made for hire within the meaning of the United States Copyright Law and that the Author is the owner of copyright in the Work and has full power and authority to enter into the Agreement' \" (id. (quoting JA1139)). \"That publishing agreement provided that 'the Author [i.e., Commerce Bank] is the sole and exclusive owner of all rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement and has not assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered the same; ... that the Author has full power to enter into this Agreement and to make the grants herein contained.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting JA1142).) The documentation thereby indicates that the letter itself constitutes a guarantee as opposed to an assignment-and that Commerce Bank \"is the work's statutory 'author' and sole copyright owner on day one and no transfer to [Commerce Bank] is required\" (Appellee's Brief at 37 (citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   According to the majority, the latter provisions of the letter do not resemble a true guarantee. But it also acknowledges that Hill's commitment guaranteeing, promising, and agreeing that Commerce Bank would fulfill its obligations \"could by itself suggest a guarantee\" (Majority Opinion at 274-75). While not dispositive, the repeated use of this sort of \"guarantee\" language (at the very least) represents a highly unconventional expression of an intent to effect a transfer. Furthermore, the cited cases did not consider whether the \"guarantee\" at issue actually constituted an assignment under New York law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

Even if parts of the letter do not really look like a typical guarantee (i.e., an agreement to pay a principal obligor's debt upon the principal obligor's default), the same could be said with respect to the letter's resemblance to an assignment, especially given what the document did not say (and what it did). In fact, Hill stated in the letter that \"I have an interest in the Author [Commerce Bank] and in having the Work published by the Publisher,\" and thereby made these guarantees \"as an inducement to the Publisher to enter into the Agreement.\" (JA1139.) He clearly wanted the book to be published as opposed to expressing any sort of interest in effecting an assignment of his existing copyright interest to his employer. In fact, I question whether he was really concerned with the intricacies of copyright assignment and the work-for-hire doctrine in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Finally, the differences between assignment and the concept of a work for hire weigh against the majority's assignment determination. The agreement and the letter could be reasonably read as acknowledging that Commerce Bank was always the exclusive owner of the manuscript as a work for hire. After all, the letter basically said as much, unconditionally guaranteeing\n   that the manuscript \"is a work made for hire within the meaning of the United States Copyright Law and that the Author is the owner of copyright in the Work and has full power and authority to enter into the Agreement.\" (JA1139.) Commerce Bank warranted in the publishing agreement that it \"is the sole and exclusive owner of all rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement\" and \"has full power to enter into this Agreement and to make the grants herein contained.\" (JA1142.) The majority asserts that, although Hill's assurance that the manuscript is a work made for hire is insufficient to make it one, this assurance nevertheless \"denotes an intent to relinquish his interest in the copyright.\" (Majority Opinion at 275 (citing 1\n   <em>\n    Nimmer on Copyright\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.03[B][1][b][ii] )).) However, assignment and work for hire are two different concepts. As I have already explained in my waiver discussion, TD Bank characterizes Hill's assignment assertions as fundamentally mistaken. It is TD Bank who insists that, because the manuscript is a work for hire, \"TD Bank [as Commerce Bank's successor] is the work's statutory 'author' and sole copyright owner on day one and no transfer to TD Bank is required.\" (Appellee's Brief at 37 (citation omitted).) Where a work is made for hire, \"the employer ... is considered the author for purposes of this title, and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them, owns all the rights comprised in the copyright.\" \u00a7 201(b). In contrast, a transfer or assignment implicates \"the conveyance\" (as \u00a7 204(a) puts it) of the owner's interest to another. A \"work for hire\" characterization thereby indicates that the employer has been the exclusive copyright owner from the very beginning.\n   <em>\n    Nimmer\n   </em>\n   does state that an agreement whereby works prepared by the employee but not prepared within the scope of employment are deemed to be works made for hire \"may be regarded as the equivalent of a simple transfer of copyright from the employee to the employer.\" 1\n   <em>\n    Nimmer on Copyright\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.03[B][1][b][ii]. But the treatise does not provide any further explanation, and it immediately qualifies the statement itself by pointing to additional differences between a transfer and a work for hire,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20N.E.2d%201309\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"but will not trigger the various other legal consequences that flow from the status of a 'for hire' work\" (footnote omitted)). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Majority Opinion at 272-73 &amp; n.7 (pointing out that work's status determines duration of copyright, author retains certain non-waivable rights to cancel transfer after 35-40 years and perhaps waivable moral rights in proper attribution, and creator of work for hire lacks such rights).) In any event, the specific letter at issue here still fails to manifest \"an unmistakable intent to effect a present transfer\" of Hill's copyright interest (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 274).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I would vacate the District Court's summary judgment disposition on the question of copyright ownership and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
