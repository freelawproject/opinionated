He argues the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   erred in calculating his Guidelines range. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At sentencing, the district court calculated Smith's base offense level at 26 because he had at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\" or \"Guidelines\") \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(1). Smith had a criminal history of VI, and other adjustments led to a final offense level of 29, which resulted in a recommended range of 151 to 188 months of imprisonment. The statute, however, restricted Smith's actual Guidelines range to\n   a maximum of 120 months. The district court imposed the statutory maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Smith concedes he has a conviction for a controlled substance offense but argues for the first time on appeal that his prior conviction for Arkansas aggravated robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence.

It has found \"jerking the door from [a victim], cornering her in the back hallway and grabbing her dress\" constitutes sufficient force for robbery because that conduct overcame resistance.\n   <em>\n    Fairchild v.

In contrast, the Arkansas Supreme Court has stated \"the mere snatching of money or goods from the hand of another is not robbery, unless some injury is done to the person or there be some struggle for possession of the property prior to the actual taking or some force used in order to take it.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

Arkansas robbery, then, satisfies both the elements clause and generic robbery in the enumerated offenses clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a result, we conclude both Arkansas robbery and Arkansas aggravated robbery are crimes of violence. An offense is a crime of violence if its lesser included offense is a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It follows that because Arkansas robbery is a crime of violence, Arkansas aggravated robbery is also a crime of violence. Thus, we hold the district court properly categorized Smith's prior conviction for Arkansas aggravated robbery as a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The Honorable Brian S.
