The Forest Service identified large swaths of lands in California, including lands within the Tahoe National Forest, as insect-infested and diseased areas under the HFRA.

The Forest Service concluded that because the designation of landscape-scale areas does not directly or indirectly affect the environment, there are no effects that can be meaningfully evaluated, and a NEPA analysis is not required at the designation stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Designation of Landscape-Scale Areas and Development and Approval of the Sunny South Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2014, at the request of California's governor, the Chief of the Forest Service designated 1.5 million acres of land as a landscape-scale area under \u00a7 6591a(b)(1). And in 2015, the Chief designated an additional 5.3 million acres of lands in California, which encompassed the Tahoe National Forest, as a landscape-scale area under \u00a7 6591a(b)(2). The Chief designated these additional areas because they met one or more of the following criteria: they were\n   \"experiencing declining forest health,\" were \"at risk of substantially increased tree mortality,\" or were areas \"in which the risk of hazard trees poses an imminent risk to public infrastructure, health, or safety.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6591a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the fall of 2015, the Forest Service initiated planning for the Sunny South Project. The project authorizes tree thinning and prescribed burning across 2,700 acres of the Tahoe National Forest. The project addresses the \"perfect storm for an outbreak of bark beetles\" caused by \"four years of drought causing moisture stress in the trees and dense stands of almost pure ponderosa pine in sizes attractive to the bark beetle.\" Its stated objective is to \"give the remaining green trees access to more water and nutrients, leading to improved vigor to overcome the insect infestation.\" The project was designed to \"have positive ... effects on wildfire control operations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2016, biologists completed an evaluation to assess the Sunny South Project's \"potential effects and determine whether [it] would result in a trend toward listing or loss of viability for sensitive species.\" In preparing the evaluation, the biologists made \"a conscientious attempt ... to review and draw from the best available science regarding species, their associated habitat needs, and the potential for adverse project-related effects.\" As part of that evaluation, the biologists examined the project's potential effect on the California spotted owl, which the Forest Service designated as a sensitive species in the Tahoe National Forest. Ultimately, the biologists concluded that the Sunny South Project \"may affect individuals, but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability for the California spotted owl.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Forest Service approved the Sunny South Project in a decision memo dated August 3, 2016. In the memo, the Forest Service concluded that the project was categorically excluded from NEPA analysis under the HFRA, as there were no extraordinary circumstances preventing the application of the categorical exclusion from NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Plaintiffs cite a study that concluded \"that reducing canopy cover below 70% has been found to be a serious issue for owls ... because it can 'reduce reproductive potential, and reduce survival and territory occupancy as well.' \" These potential effects, according to Plaintiffs, are of great significance because the population at large is already declining, and the particular populations in impacted areas \"have recently shown the highest productivity possible with regard to owl reproduction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Forest Service identified the California spotted owl as a sensitive species within the project area and examined whether the project had any significant environmental effects on the species. Ultimately, it acknowledged that the project \"may affect individual owls, but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or a loss of viability\" for the species as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The record demonstrates that when developing the project, the Forest Service endeavored to ensure that the project did not affect the most important areas of the owls' habitat. The project avoided the Protected Activity Centers (\"PACs\")-the most valuable owl habitat, which contains the owls' nesting trees. And while areas surrounding PACs, known as Home Range Core Areas (\"HRCAs\"), would be treated, the project left about 79 percent of these HRCAs untouched. The Forest Service acknowledged that treatment would \"reduce habitat suitability by reducing canopy cover to a minimum of 50 percent, but [it] would retain other important components, notably the largest trees, snags, and logs, and untreated stream corridors.\" Ultimately, the Forest Service concluded that the spotted owl would in fact benefit in the long run because \"[b]y protecting active territories and treating the surrounding forest, the project is expected to limit adverse short-term effects while improving long-term habitat\" and \"reducing the risk of losing suitable habitat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In finding that individual owls may be negatively impacted in the short-term but\n   the species would benefit in the long-run, the Forest Service relied upon scientific studies and its own expert judgment, to which we must defer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council v.
