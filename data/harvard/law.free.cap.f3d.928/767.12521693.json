The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied Petroske's post-verdict motions for acquittal or a new trial, and sentenced him to concurrent 240-month sentences on each count. Petroske appeals, asserting that several district court rulings require reversal and a new trial. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October of 2015, the Hibbing, Minnesota, Police Department received a report that a man was peering into a residence. Police were dispatched to the location and found Petroske hiding in a shed in the backyard of a nearby residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Law enforcement officers sought and obtained a warrant authorizing a search of Petroske's residence. During the search, officers seized a laptop computer. A forensic examination of the laptop revealed a number of video files involving minors, some of whom lived in the Hibbing area. The examination also revealed a Word document in which Petroske summarized the steps he took to produce the videos and, in his words, obtain \"sexual gratification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The videos at issue involved surreptitious recordings of four minors in their own homes. The minors were in various states of undress, such as before or after exiting a shower. In several of the videos, Petroske can be heard making suggestive remarks. The videos were located in a computer folder focused on voyeuristic pornography. Petroske had a history of being involved in similar activity, having previously been convicted of felony stalking and a gross misdemeanor for interference with privacy near St. Cloud, Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petroske was charged with eight counts of production or attempted production of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. Six of the production and attempted production counts contained audio of Petroske's voice in addition to the video recording. Petroske moved\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude the audio portion of the recordings as being unfairly prejudicial. The district court denied the motion, concluding the audio was relevant to determine whether the images were intended to elicit a sexual response and to establish the necessary intent to prove attempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petroske also sought a pretrial ruling that, as a matter of law, none of the eight videos included a lascivious exhibition of the genitals of a minor. After reviewing the videos, the court determined that five of the videos supported at most attempted production of child pornography and the other three videos created a jury question on whether they established attempted production or production of child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petroske testified at trial, explaining on direct examination that he had a compulsion to engage in voyeurism. During his testimony, Petroske told the jury how and why he produced voyeuristic videos. During cross-examination, Petroske confirmed that his goal in filming was to capture depictions of the victims' genitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petroske objected to the following proposed jury instruction defining \"lascivious exhibition:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Visual depictions of children acting innocently can be considered lascivious if they are intended by the producer or editor to be sexual. The relevant inquiry is not whether the visual depictions appealed or were intended to appeal to the defendant's sexual interests, but whether, on their face, they appear to be of a sexual character.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court overruled Petroske's objection on the ground that the instruction accurately described the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before giving the jury the verdict form, the district court expressed concerns to counsel that some of Petroske's testimony on cross-examination ran the risk of inflaming the jurors' passions. After hearing from counsel, the court gave a curative instruction that reminded the jury that Petroske was not on trial \"for trespassing or stalking or [in]vading privacy or being a peeping tom\" and directed the jury to remain focused on the essential elements of the counts. The jury eventually found Petroske guilty of five counts of attempted production of child pornography, three counts of production or attempted production of child pornography, and one count of possession of child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petroske moved for a judgment of acquittal, renewing his claim that the content in the videos did not involve a lascivious exhibition of the genitals. Alternatively, Petroske moved for a new trial on the ground that the jury's passions were inflamed because of statements that were not relevant to the charges. The district court denied the motions, holding that a reasonable jury could have found Petroske guilty of each of the counts. In doing so, the court noted that it was unlikely the jury decided the case on an improper basis. The court expressed confidence that the jury would have convicted Petroske with or without the disputed testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, he argues that the instruction allowed the jury to find lascivious exhibition without requiring it to find that the videos depict the minors engaged in sexually explicit or suggestive conduct. But the \"fact that the young women in the videos were not acting in an obviously sexual manner, suggesting coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity, does not necessarily indicate that the videos themselves were not or were not intended to be lascivious.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Whether or not a video involves a \" 'lascivious exhibition' is not the work of the child, whose innocence is not in question, but of the producer or editor of the video.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904712\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/879/#p883\">\n    686 F.3d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883 (8th Cir. 2012) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The jury was thus properly instructed in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Petroske asserts the instruction is inconsistent in instructing the\n   jury to disregard whether the depictions appealed to Petroske's sexual interests but to focus on whether Petroske intended the depictions to be of a sexual character. In determining whether depictions are lascivious, \"the relevant factual inquiry ... is not whether the pictures in issue appealed, or were intended to appeal, to [a defendant's] sexual interests but whether, on their face, they appear to be of a sexual character.\"\n   <em>\n    Kemmerling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446244\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/644/#p645\">\n    285 F.3d at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We see no inconsistency between instructing the jury that it could not consider Petroske's own sexual interests, but could consider whether Petroske, as the producer or editor of the videos, intended for the depictions to be sexual because the two statements are not mutually exclusive. A producer or editor of a lascivious depiction of children may intend for the depiction to be sexual, regardless of his own personal sexual interests.

A reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Petroske intended to create child pornography and took a substantial step toward doing so by recording the videos. Petroske's own testimony at trial indicated that he intended to capture the children while they were nude and that, in particular, he wanted the videos to\n   capture depictions of their genitals.

Petroske's own statements on the videos indicate that the videos were intended to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. They also constitute audio \"captions\" to the videos that tend to portray the minors as sexual objects. The videos' focus and their nature, combined with Petroske's statements and testimony, constitute sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the videos were lascivious in nature. We affirm the district court's denial of Petroske's motion for acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   D.

A defendant waives \"his objection to the introduction of the evidence by presenting it himself during direct examination.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

After reviewing the trial transcript, it is evident that the character evidence at issue was volunteered by Petroske on direct examination. In doing so, Petroske waived any challenge to introduction of the evidence. Even if admitting the evidence had been in error, the remaining admissible evidence conclusively established Petroske's guilt such that a reasonable jury would have convicted him with or without it. The district court's limiting instructions to the jury were sufficient to ensure that no serious miscarriage of justice occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
