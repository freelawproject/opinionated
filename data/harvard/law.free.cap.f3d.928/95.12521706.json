The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) contends that, before this announcement was made, its members were entitled to a Privacy Impact Assessment by law. EPIC sued to enjoin the addition of the question on this basis, and now appeals the district court's denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction. Because EPIC lacks standing, we remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The E-Government Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2002, Congress passed the E-Government Act to modernize and regulate the government's use of information technology. Pub. L. No. 107-347,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%202899\">\n    116 Stat. 2899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203501\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   note) (hereinafter \"E-Government Act\"). The Act outlines eleven purposes. Nine involve improving government efficiency, organization, and decision-making. E-Government Act \u00a7 2(b). In addition to these predominantly agency-centric goals, however, the Act also aims to \"provide increased opportunities for citizen participation in Government,\" and \"[t]o make the Federal Government more transparent and accountable.\" \u00a7\u00a7 2(b)(2), (9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Section 208 of the Act contains privacy provisions. Its stated purpose is to \"ensure sufficient protections for the privacy of personal information as agencies implement citizen-centered electronic Government.\" E-Government Act \u00a7 208(a). To effectuate this purpose, \u00a7 208 requires federal agencies to conduct, review, and, \"if practicable,\" publish, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) before \"initiating a new collection of information\" that involves personally identifiable information that will be \"collected, maintained, or disseminated using information technology.\" \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A)-(B). A \"collection of information\" is defined as \"obtaining, causing to be obtained, soliciting, or requiring the disclosure ... of facts or opinions\" through \"identical questions posed to ... ten or more persons.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203502\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(A). The word \"initiating\" is not defined by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A PIA required by a new collection of information must address, at a minimum: what information will be collected, why it is being collected, how it will be used, how it will be secured, with whom it will be shared, whether a system of records is being created under the Privacy Act, and what \"notice or opportunities for consent\" will be provided to those impacted. E-Government Act \u00a7 208(b)(2)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Census\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To apportion representatives among the several States, the Census Clause of the United States Constitution requires an \"actual Enumeration\" of the United States population. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. The census occurs every ten years, \"in such Manner as [Congress] shall by Law direct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to this command, Congress passed a series of census laws directing the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a decennial census and establishing the Census Bureau as an agency within the Department of Commerce.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141(a). These laws give the Secretary broad authority to \"obtain such other census information as necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 141(a). The census has historically included a wide variety of demographic questions, often including questions about citizenship status. With few exceptions, a refusal to answer \"any of the questions\" on\n   the census is a violation of law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20221\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Census Bureau operates at least six information technology (IT) systems that process, store, and disseminate personally identifiable information from census responses. The primary system used for the census is called \"CEN08.\" This system shares information with five other systems: \"CEN21,\" \"CEN05,\" \"CEN11,\" \"CEN13,\" and \"CEN18.\" The Bureau maintains a PIA for each system on a publicly-available website. Because the use of the systems changes regularly, the Bureau reviews and updates each assessment at least once per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 26, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, announced that a citizenship question would be added to the 2020 Census. A variety of legal challenges to the merits of that decision followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This case presents a narrow question: when does the addition of the citizenship question need to be addressed in a PIA? The parties agree that the E-Government Act requires the government to complete a PIA before \"initiating a new collection of information.\" E-Government Act \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A)(ii). Their disagreement involves the meaning of the word \"initiating.\" The Census Bureau believes that it does not initiate a collection of information until it solicits information from the public. If this is correct, then the Bureau is not required to produce PIAs until questionnaires are mailed out in 2020. The Government has consistently provided assurances, both before the district court and here on appeal, that the assessments will be completed \"before it distributes any 2020 Decennial Census questionnaires.\"\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov. Br. at 30. Indeed, the PIA updates have been in progress as this litigation proceeded, and an updated PIA addressing the citizenship question was published for one of the six relevant IT systems (CEN08) a few days before this Court heard oral argument. Notwithstanding these assurances and evidence of progress, EPIC, a public interest research center focused on privacy and civil liberties, challenges the Government's interpretation. In EPIC's view, the decision to add the question\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the initiation of information collection. If this interpretation is correct, the completed PIAs were required before the decision to add the question was announced on March 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Eight months after Secretary Ross's announcement, EPIC filed a complaint in the district court. It alleged three counts against the Department of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census-two under the Administrative Procedure Act and one under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Count One alleges that the Secretary committed an unlawful act under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a) and (c) when he announced the decision to add the citizenship question before completing the PIAs. Similarly, Count Two alleges that the government unlawfully withheld agency action, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), by failing to timely complete and publish the PIAs. Count Three seeks a declaration of rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Among other requested relief, EPIC asks the court to: (1) set aside the decision to add the citizenship question; (2) order that the decision be revoked until the PIAs are completed and published; and (3) order the completion and publication of the PIAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 18, 2019, EPIC moved for a preliminary injunction. In the text of the proposed order submitted with its motion, EPIC asked that the Census Bureau be \"enjoined from\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     initiating\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   any collection of citizenship status information.\" Pl.'s Mot. Prelim. Inj. Attach. 2 at 1 (emphasis added). This is curious, since EPIC's entire\n   argument is that such collection has already been initiated. Nevertheless, the district court denied the motion because EPIC failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits or a likelihood of irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    EPIC v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529340\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/356/85/#p89\">\n    356 F. Supp. 3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89, 95-97 (D.D.C. 2019). The district court held that EPIC was not likely to succeed on the merits because \"\n   <em>\n    initiating\n   </em>\n   a new collection of information\" requires more than a decision to collect information at some point in the future.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529340\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/356/85/#p89\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529340\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/356/85/#p89\">\n    at 89-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Since the three counts in EPIC's complaint involve a repackaging of the same underlying grievance, we need not undertake a separate standing analysis as to each claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As an organization, EPIC can assert standing in one of two ways. It can assert standing on its own behalf, as an organization, or on behalf of its members, as associational standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Soc. for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v.

Organizational Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[A]n organization may establish Article III standing if it can show that the defendant's actions cause a concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization's activities that is more than simply a setback to the organization's abstract social\n   interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Feld Entm't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767851,3839788\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/13/\">\n    659 F.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).

In\n   <em>\n    PACEI\n   </em>\n   , EPIC challenged the authority of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to collect voter information from each state without first publishing a PIA as required by \u00a7 208.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264408\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/371/#p376\">\n    878 F.3d at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The requested relief included: (1) an order requiring the PACEI to \"promptly\" publish a PIA and (2) an order enjoining its collection of voter data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264408\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/371/#p376\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264408\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/371/#p376\">\n    at 377, 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We held that \u00a7 208 did not confer an informational interest on EPIC as an organization, and any resources spent obtaining information that would otherwise have been in a PIA was a \"self-inflicted budgetary choice that cannot qualify as an injury in fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The same reasoning applies to the present complaint. Thus, any assertion of organizational standing by EPIC under \u00a7 208 is foreclosed by our prior precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Associational Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   With organizational standing out of the question, we turn to EPIC's assertion of associational standing. An organization can assert associational standing on behalf of its members if: \"(1) at least one of their members has standing to sue in her or his own right, (2) the interests the association seeks to protect are germane to its purpose, and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of an individual member in the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We begin our analysis by observing that EPIC is a membership organization. Respondent contends that our precedent determines that EPIC is not, citing\n   <em>\n    PACEI\n   </em>\n   . It is true that when we issued our decision in\n   <em>\n    PACEI\n   </em>\n   , we noted that \"as far as the record shows, [EPIC] has no traditional membership[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264408\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/371/#p376\">\n    878 F.3d at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since that decision issued, however, the nature of the organization has changed. In January 2018, EPIC amended its bylaws. The new bylaws require the organization to designate \"members\" who must be \"distinguished experts in law, technology, and public policy.\" Members are eligible to sit on the Board of Directors. They also provide leadership to the organization and pay dues. We implicitly recognized that these changes were enough to turn EPIC into a membership organization when we conducted an associational standing analysis in\n   <em>\n    EPIC v. FAA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517193\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1249/#p1253\">\n    892 F.3d 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253-55 (D.C. Cir. 2018).

EPIC has not shown that the timing for publishing PIAs is plausibly connected to the government's collection of private information that it would not otherwise collect. Especially because, as previously noted (page 98-99,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ), the principal purpose of the impact assessment is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to deter collection in the first place, but instead to improve upon an agency's storage and sharing practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In short, EPIC has failed to show that its members have suffered, or imminently will suffer, a privacy injury as a result of a delayed PIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.
