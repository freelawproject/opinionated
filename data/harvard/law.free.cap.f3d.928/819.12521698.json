We are asked to decide in this case whether the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") preempts California's\n   <em>\n    McGill\n   </em>\n   rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs brought a putative class action alleging that defendants Rent-A-Center, Inc. and Rent-A-Center West, Inc. (collectively, \"Rent-A-Center\") charged excessive prices for its rent-to-own plans for household items. We affirm the district court's partial denial of Rent-A-Center's motion to compel arbitration. We also affirm the district court's denial of Rent-A-Center's motion for a mandatory stay of plaintiffs' non-arbitrable claims. Finally, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Rent-A-Center's appeal of the district court's denial of a discretionary stay and its decision to defer ruling on a motion to strike class action claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Factual and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rent-A-Center operates stores that rent household items to consumers for set installment payments. If all payments are made on time, the consumer takes ownership of the item. Rent-A-Center also sets a cash price at which the consumer can purchase the item before the rent-to-own period has ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Paula Blair entered into rent-to-own agreements with Rent-A-Center for an air conditioner in 2015 and for a used Xbox in 2016. Blair, together with two other named plaintiffs, filed a class action complaint on March 13, 2017, on behalf of all individuals who, on or after March 13, 2013, entered into rent-to-own transactions with Rent-A-Center in California. The complaint alleged that Rent-A-Center structured its rent-to-own pricing in violation of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1994, the California Legislature enacted the Karnette Rental-Purchase Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201812.620\">\n    Cal.

Plaintiffs seek a \"public injunction\" on behalf of the people of California to enjoin future violations of these laws, and to require that Rent-A-Center provide an accounting of monies obtained from California consumers and individualized notice to those consumers of their statutory rights. Plaintiffs also seek declaratory relief, compensatory damages and restitution, and attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Of the named plaintiffs, Rent-A-Center has a valid arbitration agreement only with Blair, and only with respect to her 2015 air conditioner agreement. Blair opted out of arbitration in her 2016 Xbox agreement, and Rent-A-Center has been unable to locate signed arbitration agreements for either of the other two named plaintiffs. In June 2017, Rent-A-Center filed a motion to compel arbitration of all claims arising out of Blair's 2015 agreement, which reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    (B) What Claims Are Covered:\n   </strong>\n   You and RAC [Rent-A-Center] agree that, in the event of any dispute or claim between us, either you or RAC may elect to have that dispute or claim resolved by binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted as broadly as the FAA allows. Claims subject to arbitration include ... claims that are based on any legal theory whatsoever, including ... any statute, regulation or ordinance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    (D) Requirement of Individual Arbitration\n   </strong>\n   : You and RAC agree that arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis, and that neither you nor RAC may seek, nor may the Arbitrator award, relief that would affect RAC account holders other than you. There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, mass, private attorney general, or representative action. ... If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court concluded that the agreement violates California's\n   <em>\n    McGill\n   </em>\n   rule because it constitutes a waiver of Blair's right to seek public injunctive relief in any forum. The court also held the\n   <em>\n    McGill\n   </em>\n   rule was not preempted by the FAA. Relying on the severance clause at the end of Paragraph (D), the court held that Blair's Karnette Act, UCL, and CLRA claims \"must be severed from the arbitration.\" The district court granted Rent-A-Center's motion to compel arbitration of Blair's usury claim because California's usury law \"is not amenable to public injunctive relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court denied Rent-A-Center's motion to stay proceedings on claims not sent to arbitration-including those of the other two named plaintiffs-pending the outcome of arbitration. It also delayed ruling on Rent-A-Center's motion to strike class action claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rent-A-Center appealed the district court's denial of its motion to compel arbitration of Blair's Karnette Act, UCL, and\n   CLRA claims. Rent-A-Center also appealed the court's denial of the motion to stay proceedings and its delay in ruling on the motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. The\n   <em>\n    McGill\n   </em>\n   Rule\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Several California consumer protection statutes make available the remedy of a public injunction, which is defined as \"injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public.\"\n   <em>\n    McGill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513458\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/216/627/\">\n    216 Cal.Rptr.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513458\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/216/627/\">\n    393 P.3d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A state-law rule that preserves the right to pursue a substantively complex claim in arbitration without mandating procedural complexity does not frustrate the FAA's objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   One theoretical distinction between arbitrating PAGA claims and arbitrating public injunctive claims is the potential for multiple injunctions against the same defendant imposing conflicting obligations, a scenario without an obvious analogue in the PAGA context. These concerns are conjectural and unpersuasive. We are unaware of a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   such conflict in the decades public injunctive relief has been available in California courts. Even assuming such conflicts are (for some unidentified reason) imminent in the arbitral forum, the defendant can always inform the arbitrator of its existing obligations. We see no reason to believe that an arbitrator would then impose an irreconcilable obligation on the defendant. Nor would complex procedures be needed to avoid such conflicts: the defendant need simply tell the arbitrator. If the initial proceedings were confidential, the defendant could, to the extent necessary, obtain permission from the earlier arbitrator to make such a limited disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ongoing injunctions sometimes need monitoring or modification. The need for monitoring and modification is inherent in all injunctive relief, public and private, and such monitoring and modification is not incompatible with informal arbitration. Arbitrators have long had the authority and ability to address requests for injunctive\n   relief within bilateral arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AAA Commercial Arbitration Rule 47(a) (\"The arbitrator may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties[.]\"). We are not concerned that arbitrating public injunctions would produce procedural complexities not already common to the arbitration of private injunctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Nor are public injunctions unique because of the need to weigh the public interest in deciding whether to grant an injunction. Judges and arbitrators routinely consider the public interest when issuing private injunctions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sw. Voter Reg. Educ. Project v.

Construction of the Arbitration Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Having concluded that the FAA does not preempt the\n   <em>\n    McGill\n   </em>\n   rule, we now turn to the 2015 air conditioner agreement itself to determine its scope and effect. Rent-A-Center contends that the agreement requires Blair to submit her Karnette Act, UCL, and CLRA claims to arbitration for determination of liability. According to Rent-A-Center, only after the arbitrator has determined liability can Blair go to court to seek the remedy of a public injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The severance clause in the 2015 agreement instructs us to sever Blair's Karnette Act, UCL, and CLRA claims from the scope of arbitration, and to permit such claims to be brought in court. The clause reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The severance clause is triggered by the\n   <em>\n    McGill\n   </em>\n   rule. Paragraph (D) of the agreement prohibits the arbitrator from awarding \"relief that would affect RAC account holders other than you,\" and eliminates any \"right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, mass, private attorney general, or representative action.\" Paragraph (D) thus precludes the arbitrator from awarding public injunctive relief. Paragraph (B) of the agreement permits Rent-A-Center to demand that all disputes be resolved in arbitration, which precludes Blair from seeking public injunctive relief in court. Read together, Paragraphs (B) and (D) waive Blair's right to seek a public injunction \"in any forum.\"\n   <em>\n    McGill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513458\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/216/627/\">\n    216 Cal.Rptr.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513458\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/216/627/\">\n    393 P.3d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rent-A-Center reads \"claim for relief\" in the severance clause to refer only to a particular remedy, not to the underlying claim. The district court found Rent-A-Center's reading \"unnatural and unpersuasive,\" and we agree. Parties are welcome to agree to split decisionmaking between a court and an arbitrator in this manner.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715436\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/928/#p934\">\n    733 F.3d at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
