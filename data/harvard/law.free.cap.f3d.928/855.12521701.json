BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Griffith and his then-wife lived on acreage near Cedaredge, Colorado, where they grew marijuana plants. Ms. Griffith testified that Mr. Griffith created the marijuana field with help from seven other individuals and that the plants were taken care of by Mr. Griffith, Ms. Griffith, and others. Mr. Griffith paid for some of the labor with marijuana. Ms. Griffith stated that both she and Mr. Griffith held prescriptions for medical marijuana, which allowed each of them to have 99 marijuana plants, although Ms. Griffith stated that Mr. Griffith used her 99 plants. She further stated that another person had a prescription for 48 plants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 27, 2016, and again on October 2, 2016, law-enforcement officials were called to Mr. Griffith's property about shots being fired. Both times officers observed Mr. Griffith carrying a weapon. Mr. Griffith told the responding officers that he was shooting in self-defense or for target practice. On October 4, 2016, authorities executed a search warrant on Mr. Griffith's property, where they found 478 marijuana plants and 92 kilograms of processed marijuana, as well as 28 firearms and ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A grand jury returned an indictment charging Mr. Griffith with (1) knowingly and intentionally conspiring to distribute, and possessing with the intent to distribute, 50 kilograms or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana and 50 or more marijuana plants, a schedule I controlled substance, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1)(C), and 846 ; (2) knowingly and intentionally possessing with the intent to distribute 50 kilograms or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana and 50 or more marijuana plants, a schedule I controlled substance, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1)(C) ; and (3) having been previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, knowingly possessing a firearm and ammunition in and affecting interstate commerce, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). On May 17, 2017, a jury convicted him on all counts, and on October 10, 2017, the district court sentenced him to 97 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Griffith challenges his convictions and sentence. He also challenges the use of federal funds to incarcerate him, but we do not address this claim because it does not relate to his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Griffith contends that the United States lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him. Much of his argument is unintelligible. From what we can discern, he contends (1) the federal Commerce Clause does not confer jurisdiction to prosecute criminal violations; (2) the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from enacting and enforcing criminal laws; (3) he is a \"living Flesh and Blood man,\" Def. Resp. to\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   Br. at 2 (Aug. 8, 2018); (4) the federal government does not have common-law jurisdiction to prosecute crimes; (5) Congress improperly gave power to a corporation known as the United States of America, whose \"special laws-US code etc., are private to the foreign corporation (USA), have no authority over the several Union States of the Republic and/or State Zoned Citizen(s),\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (6) \"to establish Article III original jurisdiction and standing, a contract must be introduced into the record when the complaint was filed on October 19, 2016,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We review a challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction de novo.\n   <em>\n    Niemi v.

Colo. Const. Art. XVIII, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 16.

The district court denied the motion because there was a question of fact whether Mr. Griffith was in compliance with Colorado law. Mr. Griffith relied\n   on his contention that he was in compliance to advance several challenges to the indictment and he continues to rely on it to challenge his convictions and sentence, as discussed herein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pretrial Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Griffith filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of selective prosecution and enforcement of marijuana laws. The district court denied the motion. We review de novo Mr. Griffith's challenge to this ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5705605\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/1079/#p1117\">\n    496 F.3d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117 (10th Cir. 2007) (reviewing timely pretrial motion to dismiss de novo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although Mr. Griffith's motion to dismiss purported to rely only on legal grounds, it in fact sought \"to vindicate an affirmative defense bearing directly on his guilt or innocence, [by] arguing that he [could not] be guilty of the charged offense\" under Colorado's marijuana laws.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704521\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1255/#p1261\">\n    613 F.3d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1261 (10th Cir. 2010). The motion did not attempt to demonstrate that Mr. Griffith was in compliance with Colorado law, and the government argued, among other things, that he was not. Thus, the motion required the district court to address issues of fact relative to the alleged offenses, which a court may not consider before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704521\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1255/#p1261\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating a district court may not consider before trial defendant's argument for dismissal based on \"the facts surrounding the commission of the alleged offense\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In addition, the motion to dismiss did \"not rest on a pure question of law, the facts charged in the indictment itself, or agreed extra-indictment facts,\" so a trial was required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704521\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1255/#p1261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the district court did not err in denying the pretrial motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Selective Enforcement and Prosecution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defense filed a motion to dismiss in the district court based on selective enforcement and prosecution. Defense counsel discussed selective prosecution in the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief. On appeal, Mr. Griffith maintains that the government selectively enforced the marijuana laws and selectively prosecuted him. For both claims, he asserts that the others involved in growing the marijuana on his property were not arrested or prosecuted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To proceed with a selective-prosecution claim, \"[t]he claimant must demonstrate that the federal prosecutorial policy had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

R. Vol. 3, at 454, 455. Defense counsel informed the district court that an attorney had advised Mr. Griffith \"that pursuant to the Cole Memo, as long as he maintained legality under Colorado state law ... he would be free from prosecution from the federal government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 453. But as the district court pointed out, the Cole Memo itself said it was \"[s]olely a guide to the exercise of investigative and prosecutorial discretion.

Therefore, the district court indicated that the proffered instruction would not be given.

The court then denied an instruction based on these circumstances because Mr. Griffith did not meet his burden to show (1) there was an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, (2) he did not recklessly or negligently place himself in a situation where it was probable that he would have been forced to use a firearm, (3) he had no reasonable legal alternative to using or possessing a firearm, (4) he possessed the firearm to avoid the harm, and (5) he abandoned the firearm at the earliest possible opportunity after the threat had passed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1.5-106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1.5-106\">\n    at 449-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONSPIRACY - SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Griffith contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana. The district court denied the defense motion for judgment of acquittal on this ground made at the close of evidence. We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, \"considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government to determine whether any rational jury could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The elements of a conspiracy are: \"(1) two or more persons agreed to violate the law, (2) [the defendant] knew the essential objectives of the conspiracy, (3) [the defendant] knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy, and (4) the alleged co-conspirators were interdependent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276115\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1240/#p1251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Griffith contends that the first element of a conspiracy was not proved because he relied on the advice of an attorney that if he complied with Colorado law, he would not be federally prosecuted. Thus, he argues, there was no agreement to violate the law. As discussed above, however, the evidence indicated that Mr. Griffith was not in compliance with Colorado law. And because he decided not to testify, this theory was not presented to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The evidence of a conspiracy was provided by Stacy Griffith, who was then Mr. Griffith's wife. She testified that Mr. Griffith created the marijuana field with help from seven other individuals, and that the plants were taken care of by herself, Mr. Griffith and four other named individuals. Mr. Griffith paid for some of the labor with marijuana, thus indicating that others had made an agreement to assist Mr. Griffith to produce marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ms. Griffith testified that Mr. Griffith's income was the sole income for the household and that he did not have work other than growing and processing marijuana and advising others how to grow marijuana. She further testified that Mr. Griffith kept information about his income from her-telling her the less she knew, the better off she was-thereby indicating that he knew his marijuana dealings were illegal. Ms. Griffith described the incident during the night of September 27, 2016, where Mr. Griffith and two of the others involved in the marijuana operation, believing someone was in the marijuana field, went outside together, guns blazing, permitting the inference that they all went to defend their marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Griffith argues that the only evidence of an agreement was circumstantial. But \"conspiracy convictions may be based on circumstantial evidence, and the jury may infer conspiracy from the defendant['s] conduct and other circumstantial evidence indicating coordination and concert of action.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Resp. to\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   Br. at 9 (Aug. 8, 2018). But Ms. Griffith testified, not that she feared federal indictment, but only that if she did not help with the marijuana operation, Mr. Griffith would \"get really mad,\" yell at her, \"threaten to leave,\" and \"yell at the kids.\" R. Vol. 3, at 359. The jury was free to consider this evidence in evaluating the conspiracy charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Mr. Griffith also contends that there was no evidence that anyone agreed to violate\n   the law because some of the marijuana on his property was owned by others and \"the only distribution of marijuana was that among the members of the cooperative collective.\" Def. Resp. to Gov't Br. at 4 (Jan. 16, 2019). He maintains that no illegal activity occurred because the members were lawfully entitled to cultivate and possess marijuana for medical and recreational purposes under Colorado law. Even if the record supported these claims, the jury was not required to adopt his characterization of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Griffith seizes on the district court's remark that \"the conspiracy count ... is troublesome [and] the evidence here is weak.\" R. Vol. 3, at 415. Even so, the court correctly \"construe[d] the evidence most favorably to the Government,\" and concluded that \"a rational juror could find that there was a conspiracy ... between Mr. Griffith and one or more [others].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727523\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/921/#p938\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court's observation that the evidence was weak does not equate to a finding that the evidence was insufficient, nor does it undermine the jury's verdict. Based on our de novo review, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude that a rational jury could have found Mr. Griffith guilty of conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. CONSPIRACY-TO-DISTRIBUTE CHARGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mr. Griffith contends that \"[t]here is no such Charge as Count I of the Indictment,\" which charged him with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 kilograms or more of marijuana and 50 or more marijuana plants. Def. Resp. to\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   Br. at 14 (Aug. 8, 2018).

He contends this error is plain error. Mr. Griffith was not charged with violating \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), however. Rather, he was charged under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C) and 846, R.

This increase was based on a video taken following the police response to a call of shots fired on Mr. Griffith's property on September 27, 2016. Mr. Griffith told a police officer that \"if [the intruders] come back, there's gonna be dead bodies on my property.\" R. Vol. 3, at 38 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The district court rejected Mr. Griffith's argument that the increase was not warranted because the threats were made in response to an attack on his home, not in conjunction with his drug-possession crime. The court found that he \"was protecting not only his family, but also his property, and his property included marijuana.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that this sentencing fact was established by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing this two-level increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Mr. Griffith did not raise his other objections to his sentence in the district court. Therefore, we liberally construe his pro se filings as requesting plain-error review on the remaining claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He asserts that this did not account for the marijuana plants drying out between harvest and weighing. Relatedly, he claims the total plant count did not consider that some of the plants were root balls, not plants. Mr. Griffith's failure to present these claims to the district court does not invoke even plain-error review. If Mr. Griffith had raised these arguments to the district court, the court \"could have heard evidence and made findings regarding the factual question[s] at issue. ... [P]lain error review is not appropriate when the alleged error involves the resolution of factual disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He also objects to a two-level increase for maintaining a premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance. These claims are based on his argument that his marijuana operation was legal under Colorado law, an argument we have rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Mr. Griffith challenges the two-level increase for possession of a dangerous weapon, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (\"If a dangerous weapon (including\n   a firearm) was possessed, increase by 2 levels.\"). He contends that on the day the search warrant was executed on his property, he did not possess a weapon. Rather, he maintains that the two times he did possess a weapon - September 27, 2016, and October 2, 2016 - his possession was not in furtherance of a drug crime, but instead, was in defense of his home and family. The enhancement is applicable \"unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n.11(A). We conclude that applying the two-level increase under these circumstances was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Next, Mr. Griffith challenges the base offense level of 20 for possessing a semiautomatic firearm. He contends the correct base offense level is 14, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) (setting the base offense level at 14 if \"the defendant ... was a prohibited person at the time [he] committed the instant offense\"), because he was a \"prohibited person\" as described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (\"an unlawful user of ... any controlled substance\"). But \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B) provides for a base offense level of 20 if the offense involved a semiautomatic firearm capable of accepting a large-capacity magazine and was committed by a prohibited person. Furthermore, \u00a7 2K2.1(a) directs application of the greatest of the potentially applicable base offense levels. We find no error in the district court's application of a base offense level of 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Mr. Griffith also objects to a four-level increase because he \"used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). He argues that the increase was improper because there was no witness to his use of a firearm during any drug trafficking offense, and there was trial testimony that he used guns for target practice. But this does not negate a finding that Mr. Griffith used or possessed a firearm in connection with drug trafficking. Thus, he has not demonstrated error in the district court's application of this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Griffith also objects to a six-level increase for possessing between 25 and 99 firearms. He argues that the jury did not convict him of this. \"[A]ny fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p490\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 490,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p490\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p490\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). But where a fact found by the sentencing judge merely increases the Guidelines range without increasing the defendant's sentence above the statutory maximum,\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   does not apply.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court's finding that Mr. Griffith possessed between 25 and 99 firearms did not increase his sentence above the statutory maximum. The statutory maximum was 10 years (120 months).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (\"Whoever knowingly violates [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ] shall be fined as provided in this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\"). Mr. Griffith was sentenced to 97 months, or 8 years and one month. We do not consider Mr. Griffith's related argument that most of his weapons were not able to shoot ammunition and/or were antiques, because he did not raise this claim to the district court for the court to make findings on this factual question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869461\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/1261/#p1271\">\n    531 F.3d at 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, Mr. Griffith claims he was entitled to a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, even though he pled not guilty to the charges and went to trial. He asserts he is entitled to the decrease because he did not deny growing\n   marijuana. Although \"conviction by trial ... does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for such a reduction,\" \"the adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
