He seeks release from military custody in a habeas corpus action brought under the pseudonym John Doe. Doe is a citizen not only of the United States but also of Saudi Arabia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Doe was initially captured in Syrian territory controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The Department of Defense determined that he is an enemy combatant for ISIL, and the Department has been detaining him at a military facility in Iraq. Doe's habeas petition contends that he must be released because, he claims, ISIL combatants do not come within any existing authorization for use of military force. He also contends that he is not in fact an ISIL combatant. At this stage of the proceedings, no court has addressed the merits of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This appeal instead concerns a separate claim by Doe: that the government, while his habeas petition remains pending, cannot forcibly-and irrevocably-transfer him to the custody of another country. Transfer of Doe to another country's custody would, naturally, obviate any occasion to seek release from physical custody at the hands of the United States. In connection with the possibility of Doe's forcible transfer to the custody of another country, the district court has entered two orders we now review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the first order, the court required the government to give 72 hours' notice before transferring Doe to the custody of any\n   other country. The notice period was meant to afford the court an opportunity to review the circumstances of a planned transfer before it takes place. The government seeks to set aside any obligation to give advance notice with regard to two specific countries. We will refer to those countries as Country A and Country B because of the government's desire to withhold public release of their identities due to apparent sensitivities associated with ongoing or future diplomatic discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court's second order came about after the government reached an agreement with Country B to transfer Doe to its custody. The government gave the district court the requisite notice of its intent to transfer Doe to that country. The court then enjoined the government from effecting the transfer. In the court's view, the government had failed to demonstrate the necessary legal authority (specifically, a statute or treaty) for the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We sustain both of the district court's orders. In claiming the authority to forcibly transfer an American citizen held abroad to the custody of another country, the government ultimately relies on two species of argument. Neither, in our view, gives the government the power to effect its desired handover of Doe to Country B, at least as things currently stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first rationale advanced by the government has no necessary grounding in Doe's designation as an enemy combatant or in the military's authority under the law of war. Rather, the government relies on Supreme Court decisions recognizing that, when a foreign country wants to prosecute an American citizen already present in its territory for a crime committed within its borders, the Executive can relinquish her to that country's custody for purposes of criminal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Munaf v. Geren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674149\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/674/\">\n    553 U.S. 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674149\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/674/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674149\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/674/\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) ;\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Those decisions, on the government's reading, extend past their facts in two ways: (i) they enable a forcible transfer of a U.S. citizen to a different foreign country than the one in which she is already present, and (ii) they enable a forcible transfer as long as the receiving country has some legitimate sovereign interest in her (whether or not related to criminal prosecution). No. 18-5032, Gov't Opening Br. 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We cannot accept the government's argument. We know of no instance-in the history of the United States-in which the government has taken an American citizen found in one foreign country and forcibly transferred her to the custody of another foreign country. Under the logic of the government's position, it could pick up an American traveling in Europe and involuntarily relinquish her to, say, the custody of Afghanistan, as long as Afghanistan is thought to have some cognizable sovereign interest in her. We cannot conclude that the government possesses that kind of authority over a U.S. citizen, at least without a statute or treaty specifically providing for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The government's second line of argument differs from its first in an important respect: the second argument turns on Doe's status as an alleged enemy combatant and on the military's attendant authority in a time of war. We agree with the government that, if Doe is an enemy combatant, the military can transfer him to the custody of Country B, a partner in the campaign against ISIL. But under the precedents of the Supreme Court and our court, two conditions must exist for an American citizen to be subject to military transfer or detention as an enemy combatant: (i) there must be legal authority for the Executive to wage war against the enemy, and (ii) there must be an opportunity\n   for the citizen to contest the factual determination that he is an enemy combatant fighting on behalf of that enemy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    542 U.S. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517, 533,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (plurality opinion);\n   <em>\n    Omar v.

Cir. 2011). Neither the legal inquiry nor the factual inquiry has taken place in this case. In the absence of those inquiries, we see no basis to set aside the district court's injunction barring the forcible transfer of Doe to Country B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   What about the district court's order requiring the government to give 72 hours' notice before transferring Doe to either Country A or Country B? Because the government gave notice of the proposed transfer to Country B, the government's appeal of the notice order as it applies to Country B is now moot. With regard to Country A, the government has yet to come forward with any information about the circumstances of a prospective transfer to that country, including the specific purpose or interest that will give rise to the transfer. The government instead seeks ex-ante, carte-blanche authorization to transfer Doe to Country A, regardless of the particular circumstances or reasons, and without any opportunity for judicial review. We conclude that the district court did not err in denying the government that sort of blanket preapproval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While we sustain the district court's orders, we do so respectful of-and with appreciation for-the considerable deference owed to the Executive's judgments in the prosecution of a war. That latitude of course extends to military decisions about what to do with enemy combatants captured overseas in a zone of active hostilities. Virtually all such decisions will be unaffected by our decision today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   But when an alleged enemy combatant-even one seized on a foreign battlefield-is an American citizen, things are different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    542 U.S. at 532-33, 535-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    at 558-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scalia, J., dissenting).

That precedent, in our view, governs the disposition of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In September 2017, Syrian Democratic Forces encountered Doe at a screening point on an active battlefield in Syrian territory controlled by ISIL. Doe surrendered, informed the Syrian Democratic Forces that he was an American citizen, and asked to speak to U.S. officials. The Syrian Democratic Forces transferred Doe to the custody of U.S. military forces in the region. The military reached a preliminary determination that Doe is an enemy combatant, and has detained him at a U.S. facility in Iraq for the past seven months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The military's preliminary determination that Doe is an enemy combatant is based on evidence that he is a member or substantial supporter of ISIL. The evidence against Doe includes the following: the circumstances of his surrender, his statements upon surrender and during detention, and records of his ISIL membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ISIL, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been designated as a terrorist group. It controls territory in Iraq and Syria, and has perpetrated and aided terrorism there and around the world, killing several thousand civilians,\n   including American aid workers and journalists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Dep't of State, Bureau of Counterterrorism,\n   <em>\n    Country\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reports on Terrorism 2016: Chapter 6, Terrorist Organizations\n   </em>\n   (July 2017). Since September 2014, the United States has pursued a counterterrorism strategy against ISIL, and is an active member of a 75-country coalition working to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In October 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, acting on Doe's behalf, petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition asserts that the military's existing authority to engage in armed conflict does not extend to ISIL, that the military thus lacks legal authority to detain an alleged member of ISIL, and that, as a result, the government must either prosecute Doe in an Article III court or release him. In addition to those legal arguments, Doe contends as a factual matter that he is not an ISIL combatant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court determined that the ACLU had standing to bring the action on Doe's behalf. The court ordered the government to give the ACLU access to Doe to ascertain whether he wanted to continue the action.\n   <em>\n    Am. Civil Liberties Union Found. v. Mattis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523034\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/53/#p60\">\n    286 F. Supp. 3d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60-61 (D.D.C.2017). On January 5, 2018, the ACLU informed the court that Doe wanted to continue pursuing the habeas petition with the ACLU representing him. The ACLU then asked for an order barring the government from transferring Doe to another country until the court decided the merits of his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 23, the district court granted Doe's request in part. The court entered a preliminary injunction requiring the government to provide 72 hours' notice before transferring Doe to any other country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court determined that Doe had proven a likelihood of success because the government had failed to demonstrate that it had the requisite legal authority to transfer him to another country. The court further concluded that Doe had shown irreparable injury, reasoning that transfer out of U.S. custody would render him \"unable to pursue his habeas petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Mattis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523176\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/288/195/#p200\">\n    288 F. Supp. 3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (D.D.C.2018). Finally, the court weighed the government's interest in maintaining productive diplomatic relations with potential transferee countries against a U.S. citizen's right to contest the lawfulness of his detention, concluding that both the balance of equities and the public interest favored Doe. Finding the requirements for a preliminary injunction to have been met, the court entered its order requiring 72 hours' notice so that Doe would have an opportunity to challenge a proposed transfer before it happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The government appealed. It initially asked this court to vacate the preliminary injunction so that it could transfer Doe to any country without providing advance notice. No. 18-5032, Gov't Opening Br. 27-28. In the alternative, the government asked for vacatur of the notice requirement as applied to one specified country \"or any other country that the Executive Branch determines has a legitimate interest in petitioner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. Later, in its reply brief, the government narrowed the scope of its appeal still further, such that it now seeks vacatur of the notice requirement only as applied to Countries A or B. No. 18-5032, Gov't Reply Br. 2 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 16, 2018, while the government's appeal of the notice injunction was pending, the government filed a notice in the district court in compliance with that injunction. The notice communicated the\n   government's intent to transfer Doe to the custody of Country B in 72 hours. Attached to the notice was a sworn declaration from a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, who averred that Country B had expressed a \"strong interest\" in taking custody of Doe and continuing to detain him in some form.\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Mattis\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-2069, Notice attach. 1 at 4-5 (D.D.C. Apr. 17, 2018), ECF No. 80. Doe moved for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order to block the proposed transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 19, 2018, the district court granted the preliminary injunction, barring the government \"from transferring [Doe] from U.S. custody.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Mattis\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-2069, Prelim. Inj. (D.D.C. Apr. 19, 2018), ECF No. 88. While the order could be read to bar transfer to any foreign country, we understand it to grant only the relief Doe requested (and thus only the relief the government had notice might be imposed)-that is, a bar on transfer to Country B specifically.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capital City Gas Co. v. Phillips Petrol. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2040912\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/373/128/#p131\">\n    373 F.2d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131 (2d Cir. 1967). In support of the order, the court again concluded that Doe had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits because the government had failed to identify the requisite legal authority for a forcible transfer of Doe to Country B. And for the same reasons it gave when it entered the notice injunction, the court concluded that Doe would be irreparably injured absent an injunction and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed in his favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The government appealed the second injunction to this court. It then moved for consolidation of the two appeals and expedited treatment, both of which we granted. This opinion thus resolves both of the government's appeals. In view of the presumption of public access to judicial proceedings, we have endeavored to fashion the opinion so as to manage redactions while still not revealing the identities of Countries A and B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The government appeals two orders granting injunctive relief to Doe: the order requiring the government to give 72 hours' notice before transferring Doe to Country A or B (the only countries as to which the government appeals the notice obligation); and the order prohibiting the government from transferring Doe to Country B. While both orders are denominated preliminary injunctions, the latter appears to function as a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A district court facing a request for a preliminary injunction must balance four factors: (i) whether the party seeking the injunction is likely to succeed on the merits of the action, (ii) whether the party is likely to suffer irreparable harm without an injunction, (iii) whether the balance of equities tips in the party's favor, and (iv) whether an injunction would serve the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

We hold that it would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The government makes two species of arguments as to why the Executive has the power to transfer Doe to Country B without his consent. The first rationale has no necessary connection to Doe's designation as an enemy combatant, or even to the wartime context of this case. It instead relies on a general understanding that, when a foreign country wants to prosecute an American citizen already in its territory for a crime committed within its borders, the Executive can relinquish him to that country's custody for criminal proceedings. The government's second rationale, unlike the first, hinges on Doe's status as an enemy combatant. That second strand of the argument relies on the military's asserted authority under the law of war to transfer an enemy combatant (including an American citizen) to an allied country in the conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Neither of the government's rationales, we conclude, supports the involuntary transfer of Doe to Country B, at least as things currently stand. In reaching that conclusion, we rely on the same undisputed facts as our dissenting colleague: that Doe is an American citizen, that he is in U.S. custody in Iraq, that the government believes he is an ISIL combatant, and that he objects to the government's forcible transfer of him to the custody of Country B.

That right is implicated when the government seeks to forcibly transfer an American citizen from the United States to a foreign country.

When a citizen sets foot outside the United States, the government says, the Executive can forcibly transfer him to the custody of any country having a \"legitimate sovereign interest\" in him. The transfer, the government emphasizes, would be \"total.\" No. 18-5110, Gov't Second Supp. Br. 8.

So some transfers of American citizens to foreign custody are governed by\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ; others are not. Into which of those camps does the proposed transfer of Doe to Country B fall?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In arguing that it can forcibly transfer Doe, the government reads\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   to yield the following set of rules. Under\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   , an American citizen in the United States cannot be forcibly transferred to a foreign country absent a statute or treaty (such as an extradition treaty) authorizing the transfer. But under\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , the government says, once a citizen voluntarily leaves the United States, the Executive can pick her up and deliver her to any foreign country that has a \"legitimate sovereign interest\" in her.

And a country's interest in a person qualifies as \"legitimate,\" the government submits, if, under international law, the country would have \"prescriptive jurisdiction\" over her-that is, the power to prescribe legal rules regulating her pertinent conduct. No. 18-5032, Gov't Opening Br. 23 (citing Restatement (Fourth) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 211 (Am. Law Inst.

Consider again the facts of\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   . There was no doubt of the legitimacy of France's interest in the U.S.-citizen petitioners in that case: they had allegedly committed crimes in France. The Executive nonetheless lacked unilateral authority to \"dispose of the[ir] liberty\" by extraditing them.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722963\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/5/#p9\">\n    299 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722963\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/5/#p9\">\n    57 S.Ct. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At that moment, the unilateral \"executive discretion\" found lacking in\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ostensibly would have sprung to life, such that the person-though an American citizen-could have been seized by the Executive and forcibly transferred to France.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And a country's prescriptive jurisdiction under customary international law, the government emphasizes, extends to any \"individual with a 'genuine connection' to the state,\n   <em>\n    even when the individual is located outside the state's territory\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674149\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/674/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Fourth) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 211 (Draft No. 2, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The government is surely correct that a sovereign's prescriptive jurisdiction-its power to regulate conduct-extends to persons located beyond its borders. The practice of extraditing individuals from abroad, and the existence of laws with extraterritorial reach, both illustrate the point. But the fact that a foreign country may have prescriptive jurisdiction over an American citizen who is outside its territory hardly means that, as long as the citizen is somewhere else abroad, the Executive has power to seize her and deliver her to that foreign country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Indeed, we know of no instance-in the history of the United States-in which the government has forcibly transferred an American citizen from one foreign country to another. (That includes the case of Amir Meshal, in which the government ardently denied a citizen's allegations that foreign officials, who had moved him from Kenya, to Somalia, to Ethiopia, were acting at the United States's behest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meshal v.

Indeed, we are unaware of any involuntary transfer of a U.S. citizen from one foreign country to another even pursuant to a treaty or statute. There is all the more reason, then, to proceed with considerable caution before recognizing such a power as a unilateral (although apparently never-before-exercised) prerogative of the Executive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The implications of the government's reading of\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   amplify the reasons to reject it. Consider, for example, a U.S. citizen who becomes a journalist, travels to Thailand for a multi-year assignment, and, on returning to the United States, writes articles critical of the Thai King that are alleged to play some role in sparking demonstrations in Thailand. Thailand might well argue that she falls within its prescriptive jurisdiction. And its arguments would have force if, for instance, she underpaid her Thai taxes while there, or her articles were deemed to have had a\n   \"substantial effect\" within Thailand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Fourth) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7\u00a7 211 &amp; cmt. f, 213 (Draft No. 2, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   If the government were right about\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , then the moment the journalist stepped outside the United States, the Executive would have unilateral power to apprehend her and forcibly transfer her to Thailand if she were accused of violating Thai law. (Incidentally, there is a good reason to think the U.S.-Thai extradition treaty would not apply in that instance, given that it covers only \"persons found in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties.\" Extradition Treaty, U.S.-Thai., art. 1, Dec. 14, 1983, S. Treaty Doc. No. 98-16.) By the government's logic, then, alleged breaches of the Thai tax code would authorize a forcible transfer. So too would alleged violations of Thailand's l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 statute-under which anyone who \"defames, insults, or threatens the [Thai] King ... shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years.\" Crim. Code B.E. 2499 \u00a7 112 (1956),\n   <em>\n    amended by\n   </em>\n   Crim.

Indeed, the implications of the government's argument are more far reaching still. Imagine that the journalist is a dual citizen of the United States and Thailand. If so, Thailand would have prescriptive jurisdiction over her regardless of any violation of Thai law, because, like all sovereigns, it has an \"interest in retaining control over its nationals and residents, wherever they may be.\" Restatement (Fourth) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 214 cmt. a (Draft No. 2, 2016).

But the question for us is an antecedent one: whether, in the first place, the Executive would have the unilateral power to forcibly transfer an American citizen to another country merely because she travels abroad. We think the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The government emphasizes that, on the facts of this case, Doe is not just any citizen who traveled someplace abroad and is suspected of conduct like tax evasion. Rather, he went to an active battlefield; and Country B, a \"coalition partner[ ] in an ongoing armed conflict\" against ISIL, has, the government says, \"an obvious and legitimate\n   interest in taking custody of\" him. No. 18-5032, Gov't Reply Br. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Those circumstances, however, do not give the Executive transfer power under\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   that it would otherwise lack.\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , as explained, do not rest on the military's authority under the law of war. And we have declined to read those decisions to manifest a principle of prescriptive jurisdiction under which the Executive can forcibly transfer a U.S. citizen who has traveled abroad to any other country with a legitimate sovereign interest in her. That a country may have an especially important interest in a citizen-including by reason of her allegedly hostile actions against the country's interests in a time of war-does not affect that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Does this mean that the military necessarily is without power in a time of war to transfer an enemy combatant who is a U.S. citizen to an allied country's custody? No, it does not. It means that the authority to effect such a transfer does not come from the general transfer power recognized in\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . The authority instead would come from the Executive's wartime powers under the law of war, a subject we turn to next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The government, as noted, has said in this case that its \"determination that [Doe] is an enemy combatant ... is not the basis for the U.S. military's authority to transfer\" him to Country B. No. 18-5032, Gov't Reply Br. 8. At the same time, though, the government has also said that \"battlefield detainees\" like Doe are \"lawfully transferrable under the laws of war.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (\"[P]etitioner's status as a U.S. citizen imposes no special constraints on the U.S. military's ability to transfer him consistent with the laws of war.\"); No. 18-5110, Gov't Second Supp. Br. 3 (arguing that transfer is permissible, in part because of \"the Department of Defense's good-faith determination ... that [Doe] is an enemy combatant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We now take up the latter facet of the government's claim of authority to transfer Doe: that it can do so pursuant to the Executive's wartime powers under the law of war. We conclude that the Executive does generally possess authority under the law of war to transfer an enemy combatant to the custody of an ally in the conflict. But that authority, we hold, could potentially support a transfer of Doe only if the government (i) demonstrates that it is legally authorized to use military force against ISIL, and (ii) affords Doe an adequate opportunity to challenge the Executive's factual determination that he is an ISIL combatant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   i.

Still,\n   <em>\n    Territo\n   </em>\n   offers modest support for the conclusion that the Executive's power to transfer under the law of war applies to both aliens and citizens.

Those conditions, again, are that the Executive have legal authority to use military force against the relevant enemy (here, ISIL), and that the citizen be afforded the process laid out in\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   for challenging the factual determination that he is an enemy combatant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In considering whether transfer should be subject to those conditions, an initial point bears noting: the transfer of a citizen to another country's custody, unlike continued detention of that citizen, is irrevocable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Once the Executive relinquishes custody of an American citizen to another country, our government, and our laws-including our law's habeas guarantee, which a detainee can use to seek relief from detention over time-would be unavailable to her, perhaps in perpetuity.

That, the government says, follows from our holding in\n   <em>\n    Kiyemba\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481276,7329791\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/509/\">\n    561 F.3d at 515-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, though, the central issue is not the prospect of continued detention in Country B, but rather the forcible transfer itself, which would involuntarily send an American citizen from U.S. custody to the custody of another country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In that regard,\n   <em>\n    Kiyemba\n   </em>\n   is starkly different; there, it was undisputed that the detainees had no cognizable interest against being moved from Guantanamo to a foreign country. (Indeed, because transfer was the only relief available to the petitioners-who, as aliens, had no right to be released into the United States-they affirmatively\n   <em>\n    sought\n   </em>\n   to be moved to a foreign country.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481276,7329791\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/509/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 519 n.5 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring)). Here, by contrast, the transfer centrally implicates Doe's interest in not being forcibly moved into Country B's custody. Indeed, involuntary transfer of a citizen to the custody of another sovereign-including via extradition-undoubtedly involves fundamental liberty interests that can be vindicated in habeas corpus.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722963\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/5/#p9\">\n    299 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722963\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/5/#p9\">\n    57 S.Ct. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"no executive prerogative to dispose of the liberty of the individual\" by way of extradition);\n   <em>\n    Landon v.

The 2012 NDAA is instructive in this regard. There, Congress set out four types of \"disposition[s] under the law of war\" that the Executive could choose for an enemy combatant, including \"[d]etention under the law of war without trial until the end of the hostilities,\" and \"[t]ransfer to the custody or control of the person's country of origin [or] any other foreign country.\" Pub. L. No. 112-81 \u00a7 1021(c)(1), (4). The statutory structure indicates that Congress saw transfer and detention as two options falling on largely the same plane-not as one option (transfer) broadly available in circumstances in which the other (detention) would not be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Significantly, our decisions draw an equivalence between transfer of citizens and detention of citizens.

With regard to legal authority, the military could irrevocably transfer a citizen thought to be an enemy combatant even if judicial review would have revealed that the Executive lacked lawful authority to use military force against the particular enemy. In that event, detainees in U.S. custody-and thus protected by U.S. law-would need to be released or criminally charged.

We find the same to be true of an irrevocable transfer to another country's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In that regard, it is instructive to consider the implications of the government's argument here for the facts of\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   itself. Upon holding that the government's continued detention of Hamdi was contingent on his having a meaningful opportunity to challenge the factual basis for his detention, the Court remanded the matter so that the government could conduct the factfinding process the Court had outlined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    542 U.S. at 538-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That process would result in a determination of whether Hamdi was a person against whom military force could be applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Under the government's argument here, though, the Executive, rather than grant Hamdi that process following remand, could have simply avoided it by choosing instead to forcibly and irrevocably transfer him to the custody of another country (pursuant to its authority under the 2001 AUMF). True, the government eventually did in fact transfer Hamdi to Saudi Arabia-but with his consent, not over his objection (and after he renounced his American citizenship). Jerry Markon,\n   <em>\n    Hamdi Returned to Saudi Arabia\n   </em>\n   , Washington Post (Oct. 12, 2004). There is, of course, a vast difference between a voluntary transfer and an involuntary one. As to the latter, we do not believe the\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   Court would have countenanced Hamdi's forcible transfer to another country unless he were first afforded the process the Court held he was constitutionally due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The government's final argument on this score is that transfer without process is permissible if effected in conjunction with \"initial capture[ ] on the battlefield.\" No. 18-5110, Gov't Supp. Br. 8-9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    542 U.S. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But while\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   allows for temporary detention without process attending \"initial capture,\" a citizen can be released if there ends up being an insufficient factual basis to continue detention. Transfer may be different because it, by nature, is not temporary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In addition, there would be no citizenship-based limit on transfer unless there were reason to know that a person is a citizen.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Asbury Aff. at 4,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Jan. 15, 2002) (\"[Harakat ul-Mujahideen] officials told [John Walker Lindh] not to admit to anyone that he was American but to say, if asked, that he was from Ireland.\") Here, at any rate, the Executive decided to transfer Doe-and reached an agreement to do so-several months after his capture.\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Jan. 22, 2018), ECF No. 55 (stating that no final decision had been made on whether to transfer Doe). This transfer decision, then, was not a battlefield judgment. For those reasons, the Executive cannot transfer Doe at this stage unless he receives the process required by\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In light of the above analysis, can the Executive involuntarily transfer Doe to Country B? We conclude it cannot, at least as things stand now. We take up the two strands of the government's argument in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   i. We first address whether the Executive can forcibly transfer Doe to Country B based on the general transfer authority recognized in\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . That authority, as we have explained, does not encompass the forcible transfer of a citizen from one foreign country to the custody of another foreign country. Insofar as the transfer of Doe to Country B would be an inter-country transfer, it falls outside of\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The government contends that the transfer nonetheless should be allowed because Doe is a dual citizen of the United States and Country B (Saudi Arabia). As a result, the government emphasizes, Country B has an especially strong interest in accepting custody over Doe: the interest in repatriating one of its own nationals in order to attempt to rehabilitate him consistent with its own laws and practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   To that end, the government notes that a country always has prescriptive jurisdiction over its own nationals, including when they are abroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 18-5032, Sealed Gov't Opening Br. 23 (citing Restatement (Fourth) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 214 &amp; cmt. a (Draft No. 2, 2016)); No. 18-5032, Sealed Gov't Reply Br. 15; No. 18-5110, Sealed Gov't Supp. Br. 4; No. 18-5110, Sealed Gov't Second Supp. Br. 4. And by carrying out the transfer, the government urges, the United States also would further its own interest in maintaining constructive relations with an ally in the military efforts against ISIL (which would, among other benefits, allow for productive discussions with Country B about the transfer of additional combatants in the future).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 18-5032, Gov't Opening Br. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   We do not doubt the weight of Country B's sovereign interests in (and prescriptive jurisdiction over) Doe based on all of those considerations, including, in particular, his Saudi citizenship. Nor do we question the Executive's assessment of Country B's interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiyemba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481276,7329791\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/509/\">\n    561 F.3d at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the strength of Country B's interests in Doe as a Saudi citizen does not diminish the force of Doe's rights as a U.S. citizen: here, the right to resist the Executive's forcible seizure and transfer of him to the custody of another country. After all, \"dual citizenship presupposes rights of citizenship in each country.\"\n   <em>\n    Kawakita v.

True, his French citizenship would have fortified France's sovereign interests in him (which were already substantial given his alleged commission of crimes in France). But his U.S. citizenship still would have meant that the Executive could not extradite him to France from the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722963\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/5/#p9\">\n    299 U.S. at 10-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722963\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/5/#p9\">\n    57 S.Ct. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it still would be anomalous to suppose that the Executive gained the ability to\n   transfer him merely because he set foot in Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Doe's dual citizenship, in short, does not affect our conclusion that the transfer authority recognized in\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   ii. We now turn to whether the forcible transfer of Doe to Country B can be supported by the Executive's wartime authority over enemy combatants under the law of war. That authority, as we have explained, encompasses transfers of enemy combatants to an allied country. But before the Executive could exercise that transfer power against Doe, the two\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   conditions would need to be met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The first condition is a determination that the Executive has legal authority to wage war against ISIL. \"For wartime military transfers,\" we have said, \"Article II and the relevant Authorization to Use Military Force generally give the Executive legal authority to transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    Omar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556800,3416635\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/13/\">\n    646 F.3d at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Doe would need to be afforded a meaningful chance to rebut the government's factual assertion that he is an ISIL combatant, per the requirements set out in\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Neither condition has been met at this point. Until those conditions are satisfied, the Executive lacks power under the law of war to transfer Doe to Country B on the basis of his status as an alleged ISIL combatant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Having addressed Doe's success on the merits of his claim that a forcible transfer to Country B would be unlawful, we now consider whether he has shown he would be irreparably injured absent the injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude he has made that showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   A forcible transfer of Doe to the custody of Country B, the government explains, would be \"bona fide and total,\" in that \"[o]nce transfer is effectuated,\" he \"would be entirely in [Country B's] custody,\" without any continuing oversight by-or recourse to-the United States. No. 18-5032, Gov't Reply Br. 15. Doe, wishing to avoid that irrevocable change in his station, objects to his proposed transfer to the custody of Country B. No more is required to demonstrate that he would face irreparable injury if he were involuntarily (and irreversibly) handed over to Country B in violation of his constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In contending that Doe fails to establish irreparable injury, the government observes that the point of a habeas petition is to obtain release from U.S. custody. And if the planned transfer of Doe to Country B goes forward, the government observes, he would no longer be in U.S. custody. So transfer, the government says, is thus tantamount to release, and there can be no \"irreparable harm from obtaining the very relief his habeas action seeks to obtain.\" No. 18-5110, Gov't Supp. Br. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The government's position cannot be correct. It would mean that any habeas petitioner objecting to a planned extradition of him would be unable to demonstrate irreparable injury if he were extradited. We know that is not the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belbacha v.

Of course, a transfer to a foreign country's custody necessarily ends U.S. custody; but\n   the transfer itself is a harm that cannot be remedied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The government similarly observes that, if Doe were released from his U.S. custody in Iraq, he would likely be detained by Iraq. Or, the government says, he might be seized in Iraq by another country. As a result, the government contends, there would be a limited practical difference between the release sought by Doe and a transfer to another country. No. 18-5110, Gov't Supp. Br. 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   That argument again proves too much. As to the first point, if detention in Iraq were equivalent to detention in another country for purposes of irreparable injury, then a citizen who could lawfully be transferred to one country could never secure an injunction prohibiting his ensuing transfer to any other country. By the government's logic, once the\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   Court blessed the petitioners' transfer to Iraq, they would have been categorically precluded from getting an injunction barring their transfer to Albania, Zambia, or any country in between. As to the second point, once a petitioner is released, he could conceivably be seized by any country. So if the mere possibility of apprehension by a country meant that a petitioner would not be harmed by transfer there, then courts could never enjoin a transfer to any country on the globe. That is not the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   When a private party seeks injunctive relief against the government, the final two injunction factors-the balance of equities and the public interest-generally call for weighing the benefits to the private party from obtaining an injunction against the harms to the government and the public from being enjoined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pursuing America's Greatness v.

We find the balance to tip in Doe's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The equities at stake on both sides are manifestly weighty ones. The government seeks to avoid undue interference with its military judgments in connection with ongoing hostilities and with its conduct of foreign relations with a coalition partner in that campaign. Doe, meanwhile, seeks to vindicate his rights as an American citizen to avoid a forcible and irrevocable transfer to (potentially indefinite) custody at the hands of a foreign sovereign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   As the Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   , a citizen's \"interest in being free from physical detention\" is the \"most elemental of liberty interests.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    542 U.S. at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore denied the Executive the ability to continue detaining an alleged enemy combatant in wartime unless it afforded him procedural protections the Court thought he was constitutionally owed. And the Court did so despite the government's belief that affording additional process would be unnecessary and unworkable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we conclude an injunction barring Doe's forcible transfer to Country B's custody is warranted for substantially similar reasons and in substantially similar circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The government also appeals the district court's order requiring it to give 72 hours' notice before transferring Doe to either Country A or Country B. With regard to Country B, the government gave the district court the requisite notice before attempting to effect an agreed-upon transfer. When a defendant complies with an injunction in that fashion, its appeal of the injunction becomes moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. v. Gittens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436802,9034998\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/416/\">\n    396 F.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421 (D.C. Cir. 2005). At any rate, now that we have sustained the injunction barring Doe's transfer to\n   Country B, any requirement to give advance notice of such a transfer is beside the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The notice requirement still presents an ongoing controversy with regard to Country A, however. An order requiring the government to give advance notice before transferring a detainee to another country cannot be sustained if there could be no grounds for enjoining the transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiyemba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481276,7329791\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/509/\">\n    561 F.3d at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government relies on that principle here, contending that any transfer of Doe to Country A invariably would be lawful. We are unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As an initial matter, we note that, because of the way this case developed, Doe did not have a meaningful opportunity to address a potential transfer to Country A. In the government's opening brief, it made three alternative requests for relief: (i) vacatur of the injunction in its entirety, (ii) vacatur of the injunction as applied to any \"country that the Executive Branch determines has a legitimate interest\" in Doe, or (iii) vacatur as applied only to one specified country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 18-5032, Gov't Opening Br. 38. Indeed, the government's opening brief noted the possibility of transferring Doe to Country A only in passing in a footnote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481276,7329791\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/509/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 31 n.5. Such a reference is ordinarily inadequate to preserve an argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CTS Corp. v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341845,4156006\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/52/\">\n    759 F.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64 (D.C. Cir. 2014). And while the government specifically included Country A as a possible transferee country in its reply brief, that was too late.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abdullah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920766,4280455\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/193/\">\n    753 F.3d at 199-200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The lateness of the government's suggestion that it might wish to transfer Doe to Country A is magnified, because, on the existing record, we know very little about what such a transfer would entail. Unlike with Country B, with whom the government has reached an agreement to transfer Doe, we are aware of no concrete plans in the works (or on the horizon) to transfer Doe to Country A. Indeed, the government has not submitted a single affidavit or declaration discussing a transfer of Doe to Country A, the reasons that might give rise to an agreement to transfer Doe there, the terms or expectations surrounding such a transfer, or the anticipated conditions of his custody after that transfer. The government has listed at a high level of generality some possible interests Country A could have in mind if it were to accept custody of Doe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 18-5032, Gov't Reply Br. 8-9. But even with regard to that array of potential interests, we do not know whether a transfer of Doe would occur only for those reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The government thus essentially seeks blanket preapproval to transfer Doe to Country A, regardless of the reasons or circumstances. We decline to recognize that sort of carte-blanche license in the present circumstances. In\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court upheld the transfer of the two habeas petitioners to Iraq's custody, but only after examining the reasons for the proposed transfers and the governing law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556800,3416635\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/13/\">\n    646 F.3d at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the government asks for an all-purpose preapproval without any opportunity to assess a particular transfer before it takes place. Particular transfers to Country A may or may not be unlawful depending on the circumstances. The notice requirement secures the ability to make that assessment at a suitable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In these circumstances, we cannot set aside the notice requirement as to Country A. In terms of likelihood of success on the merits, with notice of the possibility of a transfer to Country A and at least some factual information about what such a transfer might entail, Doe would have had an opportunity to show that a particular transfer to Country A would be unlawful. With regard to irreparable injury, a particular\n   transfer arrangement, depending on the circumstances, could irrevocably injure his interests, and Doe did not have an opportunity to address in his briefing the potential harm he would suffer if transferred to Country A. And the remaining injunction factors could favor Doe in the context of a concrete transfer proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   None of this is to say that, in the end, Doe necessarily will be able to show that any agreed-upon transfer to Country A (Iraq) is unlawful. He may or may not be able to do so, depending on considerations such as: (i) whether, given the way Doe came to be in Iraq, his presence there qualifies as \"voluntar[y],\"\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   , 553 U.S. at 704,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674149\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/674/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (ii) whether the reasons for an agreed-upon transfer should bring the case within\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   's rule allowing transfers of citizens already within a country's borders. At this point, without any information about an agreed-about transfer, we decline to set aside the notice requirement with regard to Country A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   We affirm the district court's injunction barring the government from transferring Doe to Country B, and we also affirm the district court's injunction requiring the government to give 72 hours' notice before transferring him to Country A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Our disposition will constrain the government's ability to transfer an American citizen believed to be an enemy combatant more than the government would like. That is an important consideration in this case in light of the deference owed to military judgments in wartime. But \"such cases,\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those in which \"a United States citizen [is] captured in a foreign combat zone\"-\"must surely be rare.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    542 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   571 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scalia, J., dissenting) (formatting altered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In those rare cases, the constraints on the Executive could, in theory, discourage the Executive from taking custody of a suspected enemy combatant known to be an American citizen. That was equally true, though, of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   , which established constraints on the Executive's treatment of U.S. citizens captured on a foreign battlefield. We adhere to that decision and apply it to military transfers, consistent with our precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556800,3416635\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/13/\">\n    646 F.3d at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   Court believed it \"unlikely\" that its decision would have a \"dire impact on the central functions of warmaking.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    542 U.S. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p517\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   does not empower a court to enjoin our military from\n   <em>\n    transferring\n   </em>\n   a battlefield captive not facing extended detention. Much less does it authorize injunctive relief where, as here, the receiving country has a facially strong interest in the captive and the Executive Branch has determined in good faith that he is an enemy combatant. Habeas is concerned with Executive Branch \"custody,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), not relinquishment of it. Doe erroneously blurs the distinction. He claims that the Executive cannot relinquish custody absent authority to maintain it or, alternatively, absent the \"positive legal authority\" of an extradition treaty. I discern no such requirement in\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   or any other precedent Doe cites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Further, I believe the Order is at odds with\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   . There, the Supreme Court vacated a preliminary injunction that blocked our military from transferring to Iraqi custody an American citizen determined by military officers-without\n   <em>\n    Hamdi\n   </em>\n   's judicial review-to be an enemy combatant. I see no reason for a different result here: the facts are closely analogous and the comity and separation of powers considerations that animated\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   apply with similar force. If that were not sufficient to align this case with\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   , our own decision in\n   <em>\n    Kiyemba v.

Doe told his captors he had been walking for two days. ISIS controlled all of the territory within a two-day walk. Doe's physical appearance was \"typical of an [ISIS] devotee.\" App. 245.

The petition, which remains pending in district court, claims that Doe's custody at the hands of the United States military is \"[u]nauthorized and [u]nlawful.\" App. 19. It asks the court to order the government to \"charge [Doe] with a federal criminal offense in an Article III court or release him.\" App. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   On December 23, 2017, the district court ordered the government to give the ACLUF \"immediate and unmonitored access\" to Doe.

In the same order, the court prohibited the government from transferring Doe until the ACLUF informed the court whether Doe wanted the ACLUF \"to continue this action on his behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The government complied with the order and the ACLUF spoke with Doe by videoconference. Doe confirmed that he wanted to pursue the habeas case with the ACLUF as his counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   On January 5, 2018, Doe sought \"interim relief\" prohibiting the government from\n   transferring him \"until the Court issues a final judgment on his habeas petition.\" Pet'r's Mot. for Continued Interim Relief, Dkt.

He argued that such relief was necessary \"to prevent the United States from pretermitting this habeas action while the Court considers the lawfulness of his detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3 n.4. He disclaimed then-and has not alleged since-that he will be mistreated if transferred. Less than two weeks later, the district court prohibited any transfer pending its ruling on Doe's motion for interim relief. Then, on January 23, the court ordered the government to provide the court and counsel 72 hours' notice before transferring Doe, \"at which time [he] may file an emergency motion contesting his transfer.\" App. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   On April 16, 2018-pending an expedited appeal of the notice requirement and after \"extensive diplomatic discussions\" with the receiving country-the government notified the district court and counsel of its intent to transfer Doe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Resp't's Notice, Dkt.

The Order prohibits the government \"from transferring [Doe] from U.S. custody\" absent \"further order\" of the district court. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. No. 88. Explaining its Order, the court recognized that Doe had to show \"[1] he is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [3] the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] an injunction is in the public interest.\" Mem.

Br. 6 (asserting \"government decide[d]\n   <em>\n    not to release\n   </em>\n   him ... six months ago\" when it moved to dismiss his habeas petition). I reject that characterization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Rewind to September 12, 2017, when our military took custody of Doe. In an active combat zone, it faced the real-time decision of what to do with a battlefield captive who admitted affiliation with ISIS. Should it detain him indefinitely as an enemy combatant? Transport him to the United States and charge him with a crime? Transfer him to a country with a sovereign interest in him? When the ACLUF filed the habeas petition on October 5, \"the Government was still engaged in this decisional process\" and had yet to choose a course of action. App. 161. No surprise there: the government had had a mere 23 days to investigate Doe. Since then, this litigation has left the government in a poor position to consider, negotiate and effectuate Doe's transfer. App. 153 (according to State Department, litigation contingencies have \"hinder[ed] the Department's ability to engage constructively with\" receiving country);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiyemba II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481276,7329791\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/509/\">\n    561 F.3d at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he requirement that the Government\n   provide pre-transfer notice interferes with the Executive's ability to conduct the sensitive diplomatic negotiations required to arrange safe transfers[.]\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The end result is the judicial equivalent of mission creep.

I have explained why, in my view, considerations of comity and separation of powers preclude the Order here. Especially important to me are Doe's voluntary travel abroad to a war zone during active hostilities; his capture on a foreign battlefield by foreign military forces; his admitted affiliation with a terrorist organization the United States is combatting militarily; the Executive Branch's resulting good-faith determination that Doe is an enemy combatant; Doe's continued presence in the same active theater of combat as his capture; and the receiving country's facially compelling interest in his transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   If these facts differed, the prudential considerations might differ and the district court might have equitable authority to block a transfer. For instance,\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   reserves the possibility of judicial intervention if the Executive Branch \"determine[s] that a detainee is likely to be tortured but decides to transfer him anyway.\" 553 U.S. at 702,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674149\" index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/674/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What if our military had known before taking custody of Doe that it would not be permitted to relinquish him to an ally with a facially strong interest in him unless it first litigated-in distant courts, for months, if not years, on end-the ability to do so? Would our commanders in the field have declined custody, leaving a citizen to the actions of other countries or, even worse, to the chaos of the battlefield? It seems to me that today's result gives the military an incentive to avoid custody when possible, especially if it is not immediately clear in the heat of combat that the captive is a U.S. citizen.
