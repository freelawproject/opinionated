The district court determined that at least three of Hoffmann's prior actions had been dismissed for failure to state a claim or because they were frivolous.

Pursuant to the PLRA, once a prisoner has had three actions dismissed as frivolous or malicious, or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, that prisoner is no longer permitted to file an action\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   unless the prisoner is in imminent danger of serious physical injury.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hoffmann is currently a state prisoner incarcerated in California, where he has filed a number of actions challenging aspects of his confinement. The complaint in this case brings \u00a7 1983 claims against two prison guards for allegedly retaliating against Hoffmann after he complained about the prison's kosher menu. There are, however, no allegations that Hoffmann faces an imminent threat of serious physical injury. Hoffmann filed this action using the pro se \"Civil Rights Complaint by a Prisoner\" form, which instructed him to identify prior actions he had filed. On the form, Hoffmann disclosed that he had filed thirteen prior actions-the actual number was closer to twenty-one-and he specifically identified three of them. The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge who identified a different set of three prior actions filed by Hoffmann that had been dismissed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) In\n   <em>\n    Hoffmann v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-CV-01735-MCE-KJN (\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ), Hoffmann alleged that his free speech rights had been infringed because he was having trouble receiving letters and pictures from his family.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   was dismissed as duplicative of another action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) In\n   <em>\n    Hoffmann v. California Correctional Health Care Services\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-CV-01691-MCE-AC (\n   <em>\n    CCHCS\n   </em>\n   ), Hoffmann raised privacy claims based on the potential exposure of his personal information. This action was dismissed on the basis of sovereign immunity, lack of standing, and the court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the related state-law claims Hoffmann included in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) In\n   <em>\n    Hoffmann v. Growden\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-CV-01431-EFB (\n   <em>\n    Growden\n   </em>\n   ), Hoffmann claimed that he was falsely imprisoned because he was not informed that he could post bail. After Hoffmann consented to proceed before a magistrate judge, but before the government had granted its consent,\n   <em>\n    Growden\n   </em>\n   was dismissed for failure to state a cognizable claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the basis of the three prior dismissals identified by the court, the magistrate judge issued an order asking Hoffmann to show cause why recommendation should not issue to the district court \"to deny Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   application and to dismiss this action without prejudice[.]\" Hoffmann failed to respond within the allotted twenty-one days, and the district court dismissed the case for failure to pay the required filing fee. The court explained that because\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    CCHCS\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Growden\n   </em>\n   qualified as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), Hoffmann was ineligible for\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status. The district court specifically ruled that the\n   <em>\n    Growden\n   </em>\n   dismissal qualified as a strike, even though that case had been dismissed by a magistrate judge who had not received both parties' consent to proceed and the district court's order followed our decision in\n   <em>\n    Williams v. King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264985\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/500/#p504\">\n    875 F.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 504-05 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding that magistrate judges require consent from all parties before they have authority to issue dispositive rulings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A few days after the dismissal of this case, the district court received Hoffmann's response to the show cause order. The response appeared to have been held up in the prison's mail system, but it was timely submitted so the district court considered it. Hoffmann contended that dismissals without prejudice should not count\n   as strikes under the PLRA; that the \"strike counter\" resets if a prisoner is released and then reincarcerated; and that the merit of some of his prior actions should outweigh his strikes. The district court rejected all of Hoffmann's arguments and declined to vacate its order dismissing Hoffmann's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hoffmann filed this timely appeal. We review de novo the district court's application and interpretation of the PLRA's three strikes requirement.\n   <em>\n    Andrews v. King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9032755\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/398/1113/#p1118\">\n    398 F.3d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1118 (9th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State contends that Hoffmann forfeited the arguments raised in this appeal because they were not raised in his pro se response to the district court order to show cause. Our review of new arguments is discretionary,\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Marsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11560381\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/194/1045/#p1052\">\n    194 F.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1052 (9th Cir. 1999) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Further, his new arguments raise only legal questions that do not involve or require any additional fact-finding.\n   <em>\n    Northrop Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179503\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/953/\">\n    59 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   957 n.2 (\"We can exercise that discretion to consider a purely legal question when the record relevant to the matter is fully developed.\"). We also note that the district court preemptively ruled on Hoffmann's argument that the magistrate judge lacked the authority to dismiss\n   <em>\n    Growden\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, by reaching that argument, we do not risk ruling on issues that the district court did not have a chance to address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lebron v. Nat'l R.R.

We disagree. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that Hoffmann cannot escape the consequences of the prior judgment in\n   <em>\n    Growden\n   </em>\n   through an untimely collateral attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , there is no dispute that a magistrate judge lacks the authority to dismiss a case unless all parties have consented to proceed before the magistrate judge.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264985\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/500/#p504\">\n    875 F.3d at 504-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is also undisputed that only Hoffmann had consented to proceed in\n   <em>\n    Growden\n   </em>\n   when the magistrate judge dismissed Hoffmann's complaint. Nevertheless, raising that challenge in this subsequent action amounts to a collateral attack on the\n   <em>\n    Growden\n   </em>\n   judgment, and the Supreme Court has long recognized that collateral attacks are disfavored.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chicot Cty.

In other words, even if certain claims in a prisoner's lawsuit are dismissed as frivolous or malicious, or for failing to state a claim, that dismissal will not qualify as a PLRA strike if there are other claims that are either not dismissed or are dismissed for different, non-enumerated reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    CCHCS\n   </em>\n   , Hoffmann alleged that his privacy rights were violated because an unencrypted, password-protected laptop was stolen and it may have contained sensitive information about certain inmates.\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

Because Hoffmann's claims in\n   <em>\n    CCHCS\n   </em>\n   were dismissed, at least in part, for lack of standing, and because a dismissal for lack of standing is a dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the case as a whole was not dismissed on the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 1915(g).
