After ruling that Furlow is an \"armed career criminal\" pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (the \"ACCA\") and a \"career offender\" under the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court sentenced him to 180 months in prison. On appeal, Furlow maintains that he does not have the requisite number of predicate convictions for those sentencing enhancements. More specifically, he contends that the court erred in ruling that his prior felony convictions for distribution of crack cocaine in South Carolina and first-degree arson in Georgia are proper predicates under the ACCA and the Guidelines career offender provision. As explained below, we reject those contentions and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Furlow's appeal concerns his designations as an \"armed career criminal\" under the ACCA (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ) and as a \"career offender\" pursuant to section 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines (the \"career offender provision\"). Both the ACCA and the career offender provision prescribe sentencing enhancements for certain federal offenses. They differ, however,\n   in that the ACCA is a Congressional enactment binding on the federal courts, while the career offender provision is an advisory guideline promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the ACCA, a defendant designated as an \"armed career criminal\" and convicted of the federal offense of possessing a firearm or ammunition as a convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), is subject to a minimum sentence of fifteen years and a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Absent an ACCA enhancement, however, the section 922(g)(1) offense has no mandatory minimum and is punishable by a maximum of ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(a)(2). A defendant is properly designated as an armed career criminal if he has three prior \"violent felony\" or \"serious drug offense\" convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In contrast to the ACCA's establishment of a fifteen-year mandatory minimum, the career offender provision creates no statutory penalty. A defendant who qualifies for an enhancement under that provision, however, may be subject to an increased Guidelines offense level and criminal history category, which would result in an increased advisory Guidelines range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(b). A defendant is appropriately designated as a career offender, under Guidelines section 4B1.1, if his \"instant [federal] offense of conviction\" is a \"crime of violence\" or a \"controlled substance offense,\" and if he has two prior convictions for such offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In assessing whether an offense constitutes a predicate for purposes of the ACCA or the career offender provision, a court looks to the various definitions of qualifying convictions contained in the ACCA and the Guidelines. As pertinent in this appeal, the ACCA \"violent felony\" definition and the Guidelines \"crime of violence\" definition are identical, in that they each enumerate \"arson\" as a qualifying predicate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii) ; USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). The ACCA definition of a predicate \"serious drug offense\" and the Guidelines definition of a predicate \"controlled substance offense\" are likewise similar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 The ACCA defines a \"serious drug offense\" as \"an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(A)(ii) ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 The Guidelines define a \"controlled substance offense\" as \"an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In these proceedings, a grand jury in the District of South Carolina returned an October 2017 indictment charging Furlow with six offenses, including possession with intent to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine,\n   in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and possession of a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Furlow thereafter moved the district court for a pretrial determination as to whether - if found guilty of certain charges in the indictment - he would be designated as an armed career criminal under the ACCA, a career offender under the Guidelines, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response to Furlow's pretrial request, the government filed an information alleging certain of his prior felony convictions. The information specified that Furlow had been convicted in Georgia for the felony offenses of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute marijuana in 2003, and two counts of first-degree arson in 2008. The information further alleged that Furlow had been convicted in South Carolina for felony distribution of crack cocaine in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In March 2018, the district court conducted a pretrial conference and informed Furlow that it had preliminarily determined that he was \"most likely\" an armed career criminal and a career offender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 101.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   About a month later, Furlow pleaded guilty to two offenses: possession with intent to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, and possession of a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon. Following Furlow's guilty pleas, the probation officer prepared a presentence report (the \"PSR\") recommending that the court designate Furlow as an armed career criminal. This recommendation was based on Furlow's two Georgia drug convictions (which the PSR counted as a single ACCA predicate), his two Georgia first-degree arson convictions (which the PSR also counted as a single predicate), and his South Carolina distribution of crack cocaine conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The PSR also suggested that the court apply the career offender provision because Furlow had pleaded guilty in these proceedings to a \"controlled substance offense\" (that is, possession with intent to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine) and had been previously convicted of arson and distribution of crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the July 2018 sentencing hearing in Columbia, Furlow objected to the PSR's armed career criminal and career offender classifications. Insofar as the PSR counted his Georgia arson convictions as a predicate for the ACCA and the career offender provision, Furlow asserted that the term \"arson\" - as used in the ACCA definition of \"violent felony\" and in the Guidelines definition of \"crime of violence\" - is unconstitutionally vague. For that reason (and that reason only), Furlow contended that his arson convictions should not be counted as a predicate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, Furlow maintained that - contrary to the PSR's suggestion - his\n   South Carolina conviction for distribution of crack cocaine was neither a \"serious drug offense\" under the ACCA nor a \"controlled substance offense\" under the Guidelines. According to Furlow, the South Carolina statute under which he was convicted,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2044-53-375\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 44-53-375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B), criminalizes a broader swath of conduct than that encompassed by the definitions of \"serious drug offense\" and \"controlled substance offense.\" Specifically, Furlow asserted that section 44-53-375(B) of the South Carolina Code proscribes the mere purchase of a controlled substance. For those reasons, Furlow argued that he did not have the requisite number of predicate convictions for the armed career criminal and career offender designations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court rejected Furlow's arguments and adopted the PSR's recommendation that he is both an armed career criminal and a career offender. In assessing Furlow's contentions, the court applied the so-called \"modified categorical approach\" to the state statutes proscribing the relevant Georgia arson offenses and the South Carolina distribution of crack cocaine offense. That approach is proper when: (1) a state criminal statute is \"divisible\" - or in other words, when the statute \"list[s] elements in the alternative ... thereby defin[ing] multiple crimes\" - and (2) at least one of those crimes has elements that match the elements of a predicate offense specified in the ACCA or the Guidelines, but another of those crimes does not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2249\">\n    136 S.

In applying the modified categorical approach, a federal court may look to certain state court documents to determine \"what crime, with what elements, [the] defendant was convicted of.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court must then compare the elements of the defendant's crime of conviction with the elements of the ACCA or Guidelines predicate offense, and - if the court determines that the elements match - the defendant's prior conviction supports the pertinent sentencing enhancement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to Furlow's arson convictions, the district court reviewed Georgia's first-degree arson statute, that is, section 16-7-60(a) of the Code of Georgia. The court accepted the government's assertion that section 16-7-60(a) is divisible as a result of its five subsections and that at least one of the crimes defined therein has the same elements as the \"generic\" offense of arson enumerated in the ACCA \"violent felony\" definition and the Guidelines \"crime of violence\" definition. Consequently, the court reviewed several state court documents related to Furlow's arson convictions and determined that he had been twice convicted under subsection (1) of section 16-7-60(a), for using fire to \"knowingly damag[e] the dwelling house of another individual.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 181. Because the court concluded that the elements of section 16-7-60(a)(1) matched the elements of generic arson, the court ruled that Furlow's Georgia offenses are an ACCA and a career offender predicate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to Furlow's South Carolina conviction for distribution of crack cocaine, the district court looked to section 44-53-375(B) of the South Carolina Code. The court explained that the modified categorical approach applies to section 44-53-375(B) because it creates several different crimes, with at least one of those crimes having elements that match those of an ACCA \"serious drug offense\" and a Guidelines\n   \"controlled substance offense.\" Utilizing that approach, the court reviewed certain state court documents related to Furlow's South Carolina conviction under section 44-53-375(B) and concluded that Furlow in fact pleaded guilty to distribution of crack cocaine in Lexington County, South Carolina. The court then compared the elements of Furlow's South Carolina offense with the federal definitions of \"serious drug offense\" and \"controlled substance offense\" and found a match. It was thus satisfied that Furlow's South Carolina conviction is a proper predicate for the armed career criminal and career offender designations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In sum, the district court premised its ACCA ruling on Furlow's two Georgia drug convictions, which the court identified as a single predicate; his two Georgia arson convictions, which the court also counted as a single predicate; and his South Carolina distribution of crack cocaine conviction. As for the career offender designation, the court relied on Furlow's arson and distribution of crack cocaine convictions. Based on that designation, the court calculated a total offense level of 31 and placed Furlow in a criminal history category of VI, resulting in an advisory Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court varied downward from the advisory range and sentenced Furlow to concurrent terms of 180 months in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furlow has appealed the criminal judgment, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, Furlow contests the district court's reliance on his South Carolina distribution of crack cocaine conviction and his Georgia first-degree arson convictions to support the armed career criminal and career offender designations. We review de novo a legal question of whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate for the ACCA or career offender provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

When a defendant has not properly preserved an issue by presenting it to the district court, however, we review his appellate contention for plain error only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

According to Furlow, we are obliged to apply the \"categorical approach\" - as opposed to the modified categorical approach utilized by the district court - to the South Carolina statute under which he was convicted, that is, section 44-53-375(B) of the South Carolina Code. Furlow argues that section 44-53-375(B) creates a single drug offense and\n   specifies different means of committing that offense. Because one of those means is the mere \"purchase\" of a controlled substance, Furlow maintains that his conviction under section 44-53-375(B) does not categorically qualify as an ACCA \"serious drug offense\" nor a Guidelines \"controlled substance offense.\" On the other side, the government asserts that the court correctly applied the modified categorical approach and properly ruled that Furlow's conviction pursuant to section 44-53-375(B) constitutes a predicate for each designation. Because Furlow properly preserved this issue in the district court, we review it de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
