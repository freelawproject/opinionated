Myers's application for a whistleblower award. Myers sought relief from the Tax Court, which found his claim was untimely and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. We hold first that this court has jurisdiction over Myers's appeal. We then reverse the Tax Court's dismissal and remand this case for further proceedings because, although Myers's petition was untimely, the filing period is not jurisdictional and is subject to equitable tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009 Myers filed an Application for Award of Original Information (Form 211) with the Whistleblower Office of the IRS. He alleged his former employer had intentionally misclassified him and other employees as independent contractors in order \"to avoid paying workmen compensation, health insurance, vacation time etc.,\" and sought a monetary award under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207623\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) of the Internal Revenue Code for bringing to the Secretary's attention \"persons guilty of violating the internal revenue laws,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207623\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7623(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a letter dated March 13, 2013, the Whistleblower Office denied Myers's claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We have considered your application for an award dated 08/17/2009.

Therefore, you are not eligible for an award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the information you submitted did not qualify for an award, thank you for your interest in the administration of the internal revenue laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 27, 2013 Myers sent a fax to the Whistleblower Office stating, among other things, \"I inexplicably received a letter denying my claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Myers continued to send correspondence regarding his claim to the Whistleblower Office, which responded in four more letters dated November 20, 2013; January 8, 2014; February 24, 2014; and March 6, 2014. Other than the one dated February 24, 2014, those letters were identical, stating, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   We considered the additional information you provided and determined your claim still does not meet our criteria for an award.

Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20T.C.%20438\">\n    148 T.C. 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 20, 2015 Myers mailed his pro se petition to the Tax Court, asking it \"to revisit the denial of [his] IRS Whistleblower (W/B) claim ... that was inexcusably denied by the IRS on 3/13/2013.\" The IRS moved to dismiss Myers's petition for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that it was not timely filed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207623\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). That provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Any determination regarding an award under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) may, within 30 days of such determination, be appealed to the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In October 2015, the Tax Court held an evidentiary hearing on the IRS's motion because the parties disputed whether the IRS had sufficient evidence of having properly mailed the determination letters to Myers. The Tax Court ultimately concluded this issue was immaterial because actual notice of the IRS's adverse determination suffices to begin the filing period.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20T.C.%20438\">\n    148 T.C. at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tax Court then found Myers had actual notice \"no later than April 11, 2014\" - the date of his first email to Wilkins - and on June 7, 2017 entered an order dismissing Myers's claim for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20T.C.%20438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20T.C.%20438\">\n    at 441, 448-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 25, 2017, Myers filed a \"Motion for Reconsideration\" in which he \"ask[ed] the court to respectfully reconsider their decision to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.\" The Tax Court denied the motion on July 13, 2017. Myers thereafter appealed to the Tenth Circuit and mailed the notice of appeal to the Tax Court on September 21, 2017 - 106 days after that court had entered its order dismissing his case and 70 days after it had denied his motion for reconsideration. Myers's appeal was subsequently transferred from the Tenth Circuit to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties' briefs did not raise any question concerning our jurisdiction. Nonetheless, prior to oral argument we directed the parties to file \"supplemental briefs addressing whether appellant's notice of appeal was timely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 13.\"\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

The timeliness of Myers's notice of appeal depends upon the effect of his motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 13(a)(1)(A) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207483\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   each provides that an appeal from the Tax Court to the court of appeals must be filed with the Tax Court within 90 days after the entry of the Tax Court's decision. Because Myers mailed his notice of appeal 106 days after the Tax Court's dismissal order, it would not be timely under those provisions. That mailing, however, occurred only 70 days after the Tax Court had\n   denied his motion for reconsideration. Rule 13(a)(1)(B) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   If, under Tax Court rules, a party makes a timely\n   <em>\n    motion to vacate or revise\n   </em>\n   the Tax Court's decision, the time to file a notice of appeal runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion or from the entry of a new decision, whichever is later. (Emphasis added)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Myers apparently did not make a \"motion to vacate or revise\" the Tax Court's decision, which would be brought under Tax Court Rule 162. Instead, because Myers styled his filing as a \"motion for reconsideration,\" the Tax Court treated it as a \"motion for reconsideration of findings or opinion\" under Tax Court Rule 161 ; that type of motion is not mentioned in Rule 13. It follows that Myers's notice of appeal is timely if the 90-day period to appeal did not begin until the Tax Court denied his motion for reconsideration. The question before us, then, is whether a motion for reconsideration restarts the clock, as described in Rule 13(a)(1)(B), even though the Rule does not explicitly so state. The IRS and Myers agree that it does, relying principally upon the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Nordvik v. Commissioner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416665\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/1489/#p1493\">\n    67 F.3d 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1493-94 (1995) (reversing\n   <em>\n    Trohimovich v.

We do not read the reference in Rule 13(a)(1)(B) to a \"motion to vacate or revise\" to refer solely to motions brought under Tax Court Rule 162. Any post-decisional motion that \"places the correctness of the judgment in question\" is the \"functional equivalent\" of a motion to vacate or revise and should be treated as such for the purpose of determining timeliness.\n   <em>\n    Rados v.

That the great majority of individual taxpayers proceed pro se before the Tax Court exacerbates the potential for unfairness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   James S.

Myers's notice of appeal was therefore timely under Rule 13(a)(1)(B) and raises no doubt about our jurisdiction. Consequently, we do not reach the issue whether the 90-day appeal period is jurisdictional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Jurisdiction of the Tax Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Having assured ourselves of our jurisdiction, we turn to that of the Tax Court, which determined that Myers's claim was untimely under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207623\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, Myers contends that the Tax Court erred in finding that his claim was untimely; in the alternative, he argues that the filing period is not jurisdictional and seeks equitable tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This court \"review[s] the decisions of the Tax Court ... in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207482\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Accordingly, we consider jurisdictional issues de novo, including whether a filing was timely.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mobley v.

Whether Myers's Petition was Untimely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is undisputed that the 30-day period in \u00a7 7623(b)(4) begins only once there has been a \"determination\" by the Whistleblower Office. Myers therefore challenges the Tax Court's finding that his petition was not timely on two accounts: First, the letters sent by the Whistleblower Office \"were so bereft of information as to not qualify as a 'determination' under Section 7623(b)(4)\"; and second, he lacked effective notice of the determination because the IRS failed to show that it mailed the letters. We reject both arguments and agree with the Tax Court that Myers's petition was not timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Whether Myers received an appealable \"determination\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Tax Court concluded that \"each of the five letters to petitioner from the Whistleblower Office reflects an appealable determination under section 7623(b)(4).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20T.C.%20438\">\n    148 T.C. at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Myers objects that the letters do not (1) \"contain any information regarding the value of [his] claim,\" (2) explain why he is not entitled to an award, or (3) tell him how and when to petition the Tax Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we note that we address Myers's claim on its merits, despite the IRS's contention that Myers forfeited these three objections by failing to raise them before the Tax Court. Myers raised his lack of information about his right to appeal at least twice in his briefs before the Tax Court, stating, \"the only problem is that not a single one of these letters ... inform the Petitioner where he could appeal the respondents [sic] determination,\" and \"the respondent's denial letter determinations must also advise the W/B of their right to seek judicial review ... and the respondent failed to comply with this policy guideline on all five denial letters sent to the Petitioner!\" Because Myers was pro se, we believe this sufficed to preserve the issue. Although Myers did not preserve his other two objections, we exercise our discretion to resolve this \"straightforward legal question\" that \"both parties have fully addressed ... on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Prime Time Int'l Co. v.

In order to assure that a claim is ripe for review by the Tax Court, the determination need state only the Whistleblower Office's final decision. Here, the letters told Myers \"the information [he] submitted did not qualify for an award\"; that sufficed to give him his \"ticket[ ] to the tax court,\"\n   <em>\n    Laing v.

Nevertheless, we decline Myers's invitation to craft requirements out of whole cloth. In this case, it was enough that the letters notified Myers of the Whistleblower Office's final decision on his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether actual notice triggers the beginning of the filing period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Myers next argues the IRS failed to \"prove by direct evidence the date and fact of mailing or personal delivery\" of its determination, as required by the Tax Court's case law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20T.C.%20438\">\n    148 T.C. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   446 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kasper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338902\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/137/37/#p41\">\n    137 T.C. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   45 ). The Government does not dispute that there is insufficient direct evidence of mailing in this case. Instead, it contends, as the Tax Court held, that notice to a claimant is effective, and thus the 30-day period commences, when the claimant receives actual notice \"without prejudicial delay and with sufficient time to file a petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 446-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In Myers's view, \"[i]t is not the receipt of the determination which creates the jurisdiction of the Tax Court, but the Commissioner's mailing of notice.\" Putting aside Myers's incorrect assumption that \u00a7 7623(b)(4) is jurisdictional - which we address below - we note that neither the statute nor the applicable Treasury regulations expressly requires mailing. Instead, the Tax Court's rule in\n   <em>\n    Kasper\n   </em>\n   responds to an evidentiary concern: because \"the Government is generally entitled to a rebuttable presumption of delivery upon presentation of evidence of proper mailing,\" the Tax Court considered it inappropriate to rely upon \"evidence of standard practice\" to establish proper mailing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338902\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/137/37/#p41\">\n    137 T.C. at 44-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I therefore respectfully dissent from my colleagues' conclusion on this issue but join them in the remainder of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In August 2009, Myers applied to the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Whistleblower Office for a monetary award for information he provided-his belief that his employer misclassified him and his co-workers as independent contractors to avoid statutory obligations owed to employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 7623(b)(1) (authorizing Treasury Secretary to award whistleblower from 15 to 30 per cent of unpaid tax collected based on information whistleblower provides). The Whistleblower Office sent Myers five letters denying his application. Myers received the last of the letters no later than April 11, 2014 and had 30 days within which to appeal the Whistleblower Office's determinations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 7623(b)(4). Instead, from April 2014 to February 2015, Myers sent a total of twenty-four emails to various government officials, including the IRS chief counsel. The officials never responded. Myers eventually filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   appeal with the Tax Court but not until January 26, 2015-more than eight months after the filing period had passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Tax Court dismissed Myers's appeal as untimely.\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

Whereas \u00a7 7623(b)(4) 's jurisdictional grant and filing period are part of a 36-word sentence and share the same statutory paragraph, the \"sentence\" at issue in\n    <em>\n     Auburn\n    </em>\n    is 344 words long and is divided into separate statutory paragraphs, sub-paragraphs and sub-sub-paragraphs,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(a). The two sentences are thus chalk and cheese.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The majority's holding is also at odds with several decisions from other circuits. The Ninth Circuit has concluded that the nearly identical language in I.R.C. \u00a7 6630(d)(1) is \"unambiguous\" that the filing period is jurisdictional.\n    <em>\n     Duggan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266492\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1029/#p1034\">\n     879 F.3d at 1034-35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In addition, the Second, Third and Fourth Circuits have also found I.R.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) 's similarly worded filing period to be jurisdictional.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Matuszak v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275837\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/192/#p197\">\n     862 F.3d 192\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 196 (2d Cir. 2017) ;\n    <em>\n     Rubel v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276735\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/301/#p306\">\n     856 F.3d 301\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 305 (3d Cir. 2017) ;\n    <em>\n     Nauflett v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517256\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/649/#p652\">\n     892 F.3d 649\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 652-53 (4th Cir. 2018). The majority does not meaningfully address the Ninth Circuit's decision and attempts to distinguish the others on the ground that \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) uses the subordinating conjunction \"if\" before the filing period and \u00a7 7623(b)(4) does not.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Majority Op. 1035-36 &amp; n.\u2021. The phrase \"such matter\" in \u00a7 7623(b)(4), however, serves the same function as \"if\" in \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) : it expressly links the provision's jurisdictional grant to its filing period. Section 6015(e)(1)(A) 's jurisdictional clause is similarly \"separated from the rest of the provision by being put in parentheses and introduced by the word 'and' \"-two of the reasons the majority uses to conclude that \u00a7 7623(b)(4) 's jurisdictional grant operates independently of the remainder of the provision.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1034-35. Sections 6015(e)(1)(A) and 7623(b)(4) are equivalent in all material aspects.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
