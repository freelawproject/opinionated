He informed the court that he \"has never done a clemency proceeding and needs the expertise of an agency accustomed to such a process.\" He identified FPD-AZ as such an agency and noted that FPD-AZ had already appeared as clemency counsel in ten cases, including three outside of Arizona and two as \"co-counsel with [court-appointed] counsel.\" Niemy also wrote that neither he nor FPD-AZ was seeking separate federal funding as part of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court denied Samayoa's motion, concluding that because California provides for state-appointed clemency counsel, \"Petitioner does not appear to qualify for the appointment of federal counsel under \u00a7 3599(a)(2).\" The court reasoned that \"it seems appropriate to direct [the] application [for additional counsel] to the court that previously appointed counsel for [clemency] proceedings, in this case the California Supreme Court.\" Samayoa filed\n   a motion for reconsideration, which the district court also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Samayoa timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.

But that fact was provided as part of the\n   Court's opening narrative to explain how the case arose.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nowhere in the Court's statement of the question on certiorari or in its discussion of the case did it condition the scope of \u00a7 3599(e) on the state's failure to provide clemency counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   's discussion of why Congress intended \u00a7 3599(e) to include state clemency proceedings supports the plain reading of the text. One of\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   's primary rationales was that habeas counsel is uniquely positioned to advocate for clients in subsequent proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   emphasized \"continuity of counsel,\" noting that \"the work of competent counsel during habeas corpus representation may provide the basis for a persuasive clemency application.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   was thus concerned with not only whether a petitioner was represented in clemency proceedings, but also by whom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Indeed, this case mirrors\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   in illustrating the benefit of continuity of counsel. In\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   , the Court noted that federal habeas counsel had uncovered a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation that, though defaulted and not a ground for habeas relief, \"could be marshaled\" in a state clemency application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, here, Judge Reinhardt's dissent in Samayoa's earlier appeal discusses new mitigation evidence uncovered by habeas counsel about Samayoa's \"unimaginably horrific\" upbringing.\n   <em>\n    Samayoa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5714496\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/919/\">\n    649 F.3d at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though the evidence did not lead to habeas relief, it is precisely the type of evidence that \"could be marshaled\" in a state clemency application.\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    556 U.S. at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   's emphasis on the importance of continuity of counsel is particularly salient here, confirming that continuing representation by habeas counsel under \u00a7 3599(e) should not depend on whether a State simultaneously provides for the appointment of clemency counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As applied to Niemy,\n   <em>\n    Harbison\n   </em>\n   is clear-Niemy is authorized under \u00a7 3599(e) to continue to represent Samayoa in his California clemency petition, regardless of any provisions under California law regarding state appointment of clemency counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. Appointment of Additional Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We now turn to the operative question in this case: does the availability of state-appointed clemency counsel prevent the district court from appointing additional clemency counsel under \u00a7 3599 during post-habeas proceedings?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Section 3599(f) permits federally appointed counsel to seek \"investigative, expert, or other services ... reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant\" in all relevant stages of proceedings. Niemy has informed the court that, due to his lack of experience with clemency petitions, the appointment of FPD-AZ as additional counsel is necessary for the adequate representation of his client. The statute already contemplates that multiple attorneys may be necessary for the representation of a death-row inmate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3599(a)(2) (\"[A]ny defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation ... shall be entitled to the appointment of one\n   <em>\n    or more\n   </em>\n   attorneys\") (emphasis added). We conclude that \u00a7 3599(f) authorizes a court to consider, upon the request of an attorney appointed under \u00a7 3599(a)(2), whether additional counsel is a \"reasonably necessary\" service for the representation of a death-row inmate at any stage of proceeding where the appointed attorney is authorized to represent the client pursuant to \u00a7 3599(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 3599(e) also contemplates that federal counsel may be replaced in subsequent stages by \"similarly qualified counsel\" upon a motion from the attorney or\n   defendant. Niemy was originally appointed, along with another attorney, in 2001. That second attorney has left the practice of law and no longer represents Samayoa. The Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Battaglia v. Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322149\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/470/\">\n    824 F.3d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2016), is instructive. In that case, the Fifth Circuit granted an inmate's motion under \u00a7 3599 to substitute federal counsel for purposes of state competency proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322149\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322149\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/470/\">\n    at 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The inmate's federal habeas counsel had not officially withdrawn his representation, but the court determined that he had effectively abandoned his representation of Battaglia.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322149\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Battaglia\n   </em>\n   , the second attorney here has not officially withdrawn, but has effectively abandoned representation of Samayoa. It would therefore be appropriate for the district court to replace her with FPD-AZ under \u00a7 3599(e), provided FPD-AZ is \"similarly qualified.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, even assuming as the dissent does that Samayoa's request for additional counsel triggers a new inquiry under \u00a7 3599(a)(2), that subsection does not reference state-appointed counsel. Section 3599(a)(2) instructs that \"any defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation ... shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys.\" The only inquiry that the statute requires is whether a petitioner is \"financially unable\" to obtain adequate representation. The statute does not bar the district court from appointing additional counsel simply because a defendant can obtain representation through other sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We hold that state provisions for clemency counsel do not bar the appointment of additional counsel under \u00a7 3599 for purposes of state clemency proceedings. We remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-42\">\n   WATFORD, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I agree with my colleagues that the scope of Glen Niemy's federal appointment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203599\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   extends to state clemency proceedings, and that the scope of his representation is unaffected by California's provision of counsel for clemency purposes. Niemy's request for appointment of co-counsel, however, triggers a new inquiry under \u00a7 3599(a)(2). That provision authorizes a federal court to appoint \"one or more attorneys\" to represent a death-row inmate in state clemency proceedings, but only if the inmate can show that he is \"financially unable to obtain adequate representation\" on his own. An inmate cannot make that showing if the State itself, free of charge, has appointed counsel capable of providing adequate representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   If the California Supreme Court were to appoint the Arizona Federal Public Defender's Office to represent Richard Samayoa in state clemency proceedings free of charge, he would not be able to show that he is financially unable to obtain adequate representation on his own. That is why the district court sensibly concluded that Niemy must make his request for the appointment of co-counsel to the California Supreme Court in the first instance. If that court for whatever reason declines Niemy's request, the district court should then appoint co-counsel under \u00a7 3599(a)(2), as Niemy has persuasively shown why Samayoa needs the assistance of co-counsel to receive adequate representation in his state clemency proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   My colleagues appear to read subsection (a)(2) as requiring Samayoa to show only that he is indigent in order to be entitled to the appointment of co-counsel. That reading does make some sense in light of the statute's reference to the inmate's being \"financially\" unable to obtain adequate representation. But in my view the majority's\n   reading cannot be squared with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Harbison v. Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    556 U.S. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), where the Court declared that an inmate's state-furnished representation may indeed render him ineligible for appointment of counsel under \u00a7 3599, notwithstanding his indigency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653689\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/180/#p186\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
