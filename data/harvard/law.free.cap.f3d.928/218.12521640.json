On appeal, Attending argues that the district court erred in determining that (1) the arbitration clause in the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") permitted, rather than mandated, arbitration; and (2) the arbitration clause denied due process to Attending's employees. We conclude that the arbitration clause (1) mandated arbitration of the claims at issue here; and (2) did not deny due process to Attending's employees. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Attending is a home health care provider operating in the greater New York City area. Attending's large professional staff of health and personal care workers provides home assistance to otherwise-independent elderly New Yorkers. Plaintiff-Appellee Tatyana Abdullayeva (\"Abdullayeva\") is one of those workers and has been since October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a condition of her employment, Abdullayeva-like all of Attending's home care workers-was required to join the Home Healthcare Workers of America. She became a member of the Local 1660 chapter (\"the Union\") on April 13, 2016. At around the same time, the Union and Attending reached agreement on the CBA. The CBA was the result of an extended negotiation process and set out detailed terms governing the relationship between and among Attending, its workers, and the Union. The CBA became binding on Attending's workers on its effective date, May 1, 2016, and remained so until April 30, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 27, 2017, a year after the initial agreement, the Union and Attending negotiated an amendment to Article 8 of the CBA, which is entitled \"Adjustment of Disputes.\" As amended, Article 8(B) reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   B. The parties [the Union and Attending] further agree a goal of this Agreement is to ensure compliance with all federal, state, and local wage hour law and wage parity statutes. Accordingly, to ensure the uniform administration and interpretation of this Agreement in connection with federal, state, and local wage-hour and wage parity statutes,\n   <em>\n    all claims brought by either the Union or Employees\n   </em>\n   , asserting violations of or arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act ..., New York Home Care Worker Wage Parity Law, or New York Labor\n   Law (collectively, the \"Covered Statutes\"), in any manner,\n   <em>\n    shall be subject exclusively, to the grievance and arbitration procedures described below\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1) The statute of limitations to file a grievance concerning the Covered Statutes shall be consistent with the applicable statutory statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    All such claims if not resolved in the grievance procedure, including class grievances filed by the Union, or mediation as described below shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration\n   </em>\n   before Elliott Shriftman. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4) In the event an Employee has requested, in writing, that the Union process a grievance alleging a violation of the Covered Statutes and the Union declines to process a grievance regarding alleged violations of the Covered Statutes, through the grievance/mediation process or to arbitration following the conclusion of mediation, an Employee solely on behalf of himself/herself,\n   <em>\n    may submit\n   </em>\n   their individual claim to mediation, or following the conclusion of mediation, to arbitration. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A-52-53 (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In October 2017, on behalf of herself and all similarly situated employees, Abdullayeva filed suit against Attending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. She alleged that Attending had,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , willfully failed to pay its workers overtime and spread-of-hours pay in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and New York Labor Law (\"NYLL\"). In the alternative, Abdullayeva alleged unjust enrichment. Attending responded by moving to compel arbitration, arguing that Article 8(B) mandated arbitration of claims like Abdullayeva's and thus barred her from seeking relief in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 5, 2018, the district court (Weinstein,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   .) denied Attending's motion and held that the CBA did not bar Abdullayeva from bringing her FLSA and NYLL claims in federal court. The district court first concluded that the CBA violated Abdullayeva's due process rights because the arbitrator had been preselected by the Union and Attending without any input from Abdullayeva. The court then interpreted Article 8(B) to render arbitration of Abdullayeva's claims permissive rather than mandatory. More specifically, the court determined that Article 8(B)(4), in particular, is \"at best ambiguous,\" and does not satisfy the \"clear and unmistakable\" test applicable to the assessment of purported waivers of union members' right to bring statutory claims in court when such waivers are part of a collective bargaining agreement's arbitration provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Attending timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a determination whether parties have contractually bound themselves to arbitrate a dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Local 348-S v.

However, an exception to the scope presumption applies in the context of a union's waiver of its members' right to bring statutory claims in court.

The district court framed the sole relevant inquiry as whether \"[a] clause purporting to require arbitration of a [FLSA] claim that is contained in a collective bargaining agreement\" clearly and unmistakably requires arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Abdullayeva v. Attending Homecare Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201181644\">\n    2018 WL 1181644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2018). The district court therefore applied the \"clear and unmistakable\" standard when analyzing whether the Union\n   <em>\n    agreed\n   </em>\n   to arbitrate on behalf of its members. This was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under relevant Supreme Court and Second Circuit caselaw, the \"clear and unmistakable\" standard is applicable only to the question whether a union has waived its members' right to bring statutory\n   claims in court, not to the initial question whether an arbitration agreement exists at all. After all, the clear and unmistakable standard does not reflect\n   <em>\n    disfavor\n   </em>\n   of union-negotiated arbitration agreements.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    14 Penn Plaza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653276\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/247/#p274\">\n    556 U.S. at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653276\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/247/#p274\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Nothing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements signed by an individual employee and those agreed to by a union representative.\").

Article 8(B)(1) then states that \"all [claims under the Covered Statutes,] if not resolved in the grievance procedure, ... shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.\" A-52.

To read Article 8(B)(4)'s use of the word \"may\" otherwise, as the district court did, is to bring subsection (4) into conflict with the rest of Article 8(B), which as explained above manifestly reflects an intent to require arbitration. Indeed, the district court's reading makes little sense in light of Article 8(B)(1)'s requirement that \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   [claims under the Covered Statutes,] if not resolved in the grievance procedure ... shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration\" (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galli v.

Accordingly, we conclude, contrary to the district court, that the CBA unambiguously reflects the Union's agreement, on behalf of its members, to binding arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to the scope of that agreement, Article 8(B) clearly and unmistakably incorporates Abdullayeva's statutory claims. This Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   noted that both this Circuit and our sister circuits have \"interpreted the 'clear and unmistakable' standard to require specific references in the [collective bargaining agreement] either to the statutes in question or to statutory causes of action generally.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173670\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/81/#p82\">\n    841 F.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   we held that where the collective bargaining agreement in question merely contained the vague directive that \"any disputes ... shall be subject\" to a grievance and arbitration procedure, the agreement did not clearly and unmistakably mandate arbitration of the plaintiff's statutory claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173670\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/81/#p82\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173670\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/81/#p82\">\n    at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
