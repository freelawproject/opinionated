While that definition may seem straightforward to the uninitiated, it has spawned almost as many questions as there are federal or state crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Supreme Court has addressed this matter several times, in an effort to clarify just how much violence is required for a crime to be qualifying, and how courts are to go about assessing that issue. It most recently spoke to these issues in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    139 S. Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    202 L.Ed.2d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019). In each of the six cases now before us, we concluded that the ACCA enhancement applied; the petitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the Court; the Court held that petition for the decision in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   ; and it now has remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   . Because each of these cases raises the same question-whether the Illinois statutes prohibiting robbery and armed robbery, 720 ILCS 5/18-1(a), 5/18-2, qualify as crimes of violence for ACCA purposes-we have consolidated them for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin by reviewing some basic principles. First, we are addressing only the \"elements\" approach to proving a crime of violence. The statute also enumerates certain crimes, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii), but robbery is not on that list. (At one time there was also a so-called residual clause, but it was invalidated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Samuel Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S. Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), and is not relevant to any of these appeals.) Second, in deciding whether a statute \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" we must use a categorical approach, under which we \"compare the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant's conviction with the elements of the 'generic' crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Descamps v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p257\">\n    570 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p257\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p257\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). If the statute in question is \"divisible,\" meaning that it offers alternative elements rather than merely alternative ways of proving a single element, see\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/\">\n    136 S.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/1/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), the Supreme Court took a close look at the level of force that is needed in order to trigger the ACCA sentencing enhancement. Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm after a felony conviction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), and the government argued that he was subject to the ACCA penalty scheme. One of his prior felonies was for the Florida offense of battery by \"[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing] another person,\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20784.03\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a), (2) (2003).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question was whether the degree of force required by the Florida law met the\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   definition in ACCA. Under the common law, the Supreme Court observed, the \"element of 'force' [was] satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, bearing in mind the need to take context into account, the Court held that ACCA did not adopt the common-law approach. Instead, it said, \"in the context of a statutory definition of '\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   felony,' the phrase 'physical force' means\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   force-that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   addressed the next logical question in this sequence: how much physical pain or injury is necessary? Is a scratch or a pinch enough? If not, then how much more does the statute demand? Like\n   <em>\n    Curtis Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   arose in Florida. After Stokeling pleaded guilty to a violation of section 922(g), the government sought an enhanced sentence under ACCA; it relied in part on his 1997 Florida conviction for robbery. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.13\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). That statute defines robbery as \"the taking of money or other property ... from the person or custody of another, ... when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Critically, the Florida Supreme Court had held in an earlier case \"that the 'use of force' necessary to commit robbery requires 'resistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical force of the offender.'\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Ct. at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Supreme Court held that this was enough to satisfy ACCA. It relied substantially on the common-law definition of the crime of robbery, which requires force or violence, and which understands \"violence\" to mean the use of sufficient force \"to overcome the resistance encountered.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The history of ACCA and the widely accepted definition of robbery in the states reinforced the Court's conclusion. It was enough, the Court said, if a statute requires \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After we received the Supreme Court's mandate, we invited the parties to submit statements pursuant to Circuit Rule 54 on the proper next steps. We have received those statements, and so the cases are ready for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Two Illinois statutes figure in all six cases: the law prohibiting robbery, and the law prohibiting armed robbery. The ordinary robbery statute reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A person commits robbery when he or she knowingly takes property, except a motor vehicle covered by Section 18-3 or 18-4, from the person or presence of another by the use of force or by threatening the imminent use of force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   720 ILCS 5/18-1(a). Armed robbery incorporates that language and adds additional criteria:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A person commits armed robbery\n   <em>\n    when he or she violates Section 18-1\n   </em>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) he or she carries on or about his or her person or is otherwise armed with a dangerous weapon other than a firearm; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (2) he or she carries on or about his or her person or is otherwise armed with a firearm; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (3) he or she, during the commission of the offense, personally discharges a firearm; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (4) he or she, during the commission of the offense, personally discharges a firearm that proximately causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, permanent disfigurement, or death to another person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   720 ILCS 5/18-2(a) (emphasis added). Because no one can violate the armed robbery statute without meeting the criteria of section 18-1, it is enough for our purposes to examine whether Illinois's ordinary robbery statute satisfies the test set out in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendants argue that the Supreme Court already has signaled that our earlier decisions (each of which upheld reliance on the Illinois statute for ACCA) were wrong. They read\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Chater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323202\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/163/\">\n    516 U.S. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323202\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/163/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323202\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/163/\">\n    133 L.Ed.2d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), to say that the GVR (\"grant, vacate, and remand\") practice means that the Court believes that the lower court failed adequately to consider a point, or that there is a \"reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of the litigation ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323202\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/163/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323202\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/163/\">\n    at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323202\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/163/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But it is one thing to say that a point requires further thought, with the benefit of the pertinent Supreme Court opinion, and another to say that there is some kind of presumption that the result should change. The GVR order, as the Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   , is an efficient way for the Supreme Court to obtain the views of the lower courts on the effect of a new decision, whatever those views might be. We thus reject any suggestion that the only task left for us is to reverse and find that the Illinois statute fails to satisfy ACCA's requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The parties dispute whether, as a categorical matter, the degree of force required by the Illinois robbery statute is compatible with the definition of force in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   . The government argues that the Florida robbery statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   is, for these purposes, indistinguishable from the Illinois robbery statute. The defendants contend to the contrary that the two statutes are not the same, because Illinois cases permit a robbery conviction for conduct that falls outside the scope of the common-law offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We focus on the language of the Illinois statute providing that a person commits robbery when he or she takes property \"from the person or presence of another by the use of force or by threatening the imminent use of force.\" 720 ILCS 5/18-1(a). The Illinois Supreme Court has defined the degree of force necessary to constitute robbery as \"such [force] that the power of the owner to retain his property is overcome, either by actual violence physically applied, or by putting him in such fear as to overpower his will.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

It cites\n   <em>\n    People v. Patton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2983813\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/76/45/\">\n    76 Ill.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Ill.%20Dec.%20766\">\n    27 Ill.Dec. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.E.2d%201174\">\n    389 N.E.2d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175 (1979), which overturned a robbery conviction where the defendant grabbed the victim's purse from her hand, \"throwing her arm back 'a little bit.' \" In\n   <em>\n    Patton\n   </em>\n   , the state supreme court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   a simple snatching or sudden taking of property from the person of another does not of itself involve sufficient force to constitute robbery, though the act may be robbery where a struggle ensues, the victim is injured in the taking, or the property is so attached to the victim's person or clothing as to create resistance to the taking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.E.2d%201174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no meaningful difference between that statement and the test laid out in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   . Given that fact, the government argues that this court correctly held\n   that Illinois robbery convictions qualify as violent felonies under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendants acknowledge that for robbery convictions to qualify under ACCA after\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   , even slight force is \"violent force\" so long as it is employed to overcome the victim's resistance. They say, however, that we must examine both the amount of force and the temporal connection between the force and the theft component of robbery. Because they understand Illinois cases to permit a robbery conviction where the perpetrator does not overcome resistance by the victim or where the robber uses force after he has stolen the property, defendants reason that Illinois robbery is not categorically a violent felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants assert that Illinois deems it robbery when the wrongdoer takes something that is attached to the victim's clothing, thus overcoming resistance only from the clothing without also encountering any struggle or resistance from the victim. They point to two cases illustrating that a robbery conviction does not require force that overcomes resistance directly from the victim. In\n   <em>\n    People v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5640714\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill/234/391/\">\n    234 Ill. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20N.E.%201035\">\n    84 N.E. 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1036 (1908), the Illinois Supreme Court held that the act of ripping off a diamond stud attached to a shirt, followed by a brief scuffle, was robbery. It said, \"In the absence of active opposition, if the article was so attached to the person or the clothes to create resistance, however slight, or if there be a struggle to keep it, the taking is robbery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20N.E.%201035\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The petitioners argue that if there is an \"absence of active opposition\" and the only force used is to separate an item from clothing, there is no resistance by the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Illinois Supreme Court expanded on the\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   analysis in\n   <em>\n    People v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5567161\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/129/80/\">\n    129 Ill.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20Ill.%20Dec.%20466\">\n    133 Ill.Dec. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20N.E.2d%20677\">\n    541 N.E.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679 (1989). There it distinguished the physical effort of transferring something from its owner to another, such as taking a wallet from a person, from \"[t]he force required to overcome the physical resistance created by the attachment of an item to the person or clothing of the owner.\" In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , because the victim's \"necklace was attached to her person in such a way that it offered resistance to anyone who would take it without permission,\" the court found that the defendant was guilty of robbery, not theft. We acknowledge that these are fine distinctions, but they are in line with the common-law examples cited by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   to illustrate what constitutes force that overcomes a victim's resistance. \"Under the common law it was robbery 'to seize another's watch or purse and use sufficient force to break a chain or guard by which it is attached to his person' ... or pull a diamond pin out of a woman's hair when doing so tore away hair attached to the pin.\"\n   <em>\n    Stokeling,\n   </em>\n   139 S. Ct. at 550. The Court did not distinguish between overcoming active resistance by the victim and overcoming resistance necessary to remove an item that is attached to the clothing or person of the victim. Similarly, in both\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   the state supreme court held that the act was robbery because the defendant used force to overcome the victim's resistance. The latter two cases do not, in our view, describe any behavior outside the scope of\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Next the defendants assert that, consistent with common law, force used during\n   robbery to overcome a victim's resistance must occur before or contemporaneously with the acquisition of control over the property. Because Illinois has allowed robbery convictions where the wrongdoer uses force only after the theft, they argue, Illinois robbery covers more territory than generic robbery. They point to\n   <em>\n    People v.

The court relied on earlier decisions sustaining convictions for robbery \"where a struggle ensued following the taking, or the perpetrator used force when escaping the scene.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=836%20N.E.2d%20820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20Ill.%20Dec.%2089\">\n    297 Ill.Dec. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=836%20N.E.2d%20820\">\n    836 N.E.2d at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See Model Penal Code \u00a7 222.1(1). But the Illinois cases distinguish between, on the one hand, the use of force after and separate from the taking, and, on the other hand, the use of force immediately following the taking that accomplishes the taking or the defendant's departure.

In other words, Illinois cases require that force be used as part of the action of taking or immediately leaving the scene. This can reasonably be characterized as force necessary to overcome the victim's resistance, and thus it is compatible with\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   's definition of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Given\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   's emphasis on state practice, it is also worth noting that the features of Illinois law highlighted by the defendants are not idiosyncratic to Illinois. As the dissenting justices in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   pointed out, the Florida robbery statute also sweeps broadly. Although they would have said that the Florida law flunked the\n   <em>\n    Curtis Johnson\n   </em>\n   test for physical force, the majority saw things otherwise. The dissenters also worried that any degree of force could convert larceny into robbery, and so (for example) the force element as the majority viewed it could be satisfied by a pickpocket who attempts to pull free after the victim catches his arm, or a thief who grabs a bag from a victim's shoulder (so long as the victim holds the strap for a moment), or a person who causes a bill to rip while pulling cash from the victim's hand.\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   , 139 S. Ct. at 558 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). But the majority would have found adequate resistance in all of\n   those situations, and it is their opinion we must follow. The Tenth Circuit understands\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   the same way. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520272\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1238/#p1245\">\n    917 F.3d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1245 (10th Cir. 2019), it examined\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   and held that a Missouri conviction for second-degree robbery is categorically a crime of violence under the career-offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), which is closely related to ACCA. It concluded that although Missouri courts have upheld robbery convictions where an item was \"so attached to the person or clothes of the owner as to afford resistance\" and where a defendant struggled with store employees while trying to escape, this degree of force was consistent with\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520272\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1238/#p1245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520272\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1238/#p1245\">\n    at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We can summarize\n   <em>\n    Curtis Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   as follows: they require more than the simple offensive touching that the common law would have called for, but the requirement to show \"force sufficient to overcome a victim's resistance,\" 139 S. Ct. at 548, is not a demanding one. All that remains is to apply this understanding to the six cases before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A. Klikno\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In 2007, Steven Klikno pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

Before his federal conviction, Klikno had amassed four convictions in Illinois: (1) residential burglary; (2) unlawful restraint; (3) aggravated battery; and (4) a 1995 conviction for armed robbery. In his motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for post-conviction relief, Klikno argued that his Illinois unlawful restraint and armed robbery convictions did not qualify as predicate felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act after\n   <em>\n    Samuel Johnson\n   </em>\n   . The government conceded that Illinois unlawful restraint was no longer a qualifying conviction after\n   <em>\n    Samuel Johnson\n   </em>\n   wiped out ACCA's residual clause, but it argued that Illinois armed robbery was a qualifying crime because it had as an element the requisite amount of force.
