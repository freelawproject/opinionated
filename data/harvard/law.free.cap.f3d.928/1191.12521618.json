The warrant was issued by a judge in the New Mexico Children's Court (Children's Court) based on an affidavit in which an APD detective alleged A.N. had committed a delinquent act, that is, an act\n   \"that would be designated as a crime under the law if committed by an adult,\" N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 32A-2-3(A). Because A.N. was less than eighteen years old, she was considered a juvenile and was detained at a juvenile detention facility after her arrest. On the same day A.N. was arrested, two adults were arrested and charged with the same crime referenced in A.N.'s arrest warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Four days after A.N.'s arrest, Defendant Kunihiro prepared a news release (\"News Release\") regarding the arrest of the two adults and A.N. which included the charges brought and the crime allegedly committed. The News Release identified A.N. by name, reported the crime she had been charged with, and stated that she was sixteen and being held at a juvenile detention facility. At Defendant Smith's suggestion, the News Release included A.N.'s booking photo. Defendants Syling and Schoolcraft, APD's Chief and Deputy Chief, respectively, reportedly approved the News Release before it was released to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The APD, acting through Defendant Smith or another as-of-yet unidentified APD employee, provided the News Release to media and news organizations and posted it on APD's public Facebook page. By the next day, the News Release, including the information related to A.N. and her arrest, had been picked up and published by various media organizations, including TV stations in Albuquerque and El Paso. The APD's Facebook post of the News Release had also been viewed and shared hundreds of times and generated more than 100 comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege, and Defendants have not disputed, that New Mexico's Children's Code and other state rules and regulations provide that arrest and delinquency records relating to a child are confidential and that information from these records may not be disclosed directly or indirectly to the public.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 32A-2-32(A), (C) (providing as part of New Mexico's Delinquency Act that all records pertaining to a child in the possession of the state department responsible for delinquency proceedings \"are confidential and shall not be disclosed directly or indirectly to the public\" by state officials or others, including law enforcement officials);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32A-2-32.1 (prohibiting state agencies, municipalities and others from \"disclos[ing] on a public access web site maintained by it any information concerning ... an arrest or detention of a child [or] delinquency proceedings for a child\"). Because a child is defined for these purposes as a person who is less than eighteen years old,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 32A-1-4(A), it is further undisputed that A.N., as a sixteen-year-old, was entitled to the benefit of these state law protections and that Defendants violated one or more of these state statutes and rules in publicly disclosing her confidential information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.N.'s mother learned of the News Release shortly after APD posted it on Facebook. She called to complain about the release of information about A.N. and was told by Defendant Smith that APD was allowed to release this information because A.N. at sixteen was \"the age of consent,\" and because she had been physically arrested. Aplt. App. Vol. I at 57. But APD removed all references to A.N. from the Facebook post on the following day, after receiving correspondence from an attorney representing A.N. and her mother requesting the immediate removal of this information. Nonetheless, information regarding A.N. and her arrest remains publicly available today on internet sites maintained by media and other organizations that received the News Release from APD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this action against APD, the Defendants in their individual and official capacities, and others, alleging that the disclosure of A.N.'s name and the information concerning her arrest violated the Children's Code and other New Mexico rules and regulations, violated their right to procedural and substantive due process and to equal protection under the United States and New Mexico Constitutions, and constituted various torts under New Mexico law. In support of their federal equal protection claim, Plaintiffs alleged Defendants violated Plaintiffs' right to equal protection under the law because they and the APD, by official policy or actions, treated A.N. and other juvenile arrestees sixteen or over differently from juvenile arrestees under sixteen with respect to publicly disclosing information about their arrest and delinquency, notwithstanding New Mexico's laws prohibiting the disclosure of this information for all children under the age of eighteen. Plaintiffs sought damages and injunctive relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   APD, Defendants, and the other defendants moved to dismiss a number of Plaintiffs' claims on different grounds. As relevant to this appeal, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 equal protection claim against them in their individual capacities under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) based on qualified immunity. Although the district court granted Defendants' motion in most respects, it denied the motion as to Plaintiffs' federal equal protection claim, concluding Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on it. Defendants timely appealed the district court's denial of their motion to dismiss this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In response to our order directing the parties to address the jurisdictional issue, Defendants asserted their appeal turns on an issue of law because the facts alleged by Plaintiffs are taken as true for purposes of their Rule 12(b)(6) motion and the issue on appeal-whether the district court erred in finding the law clearly established that their alleged actions violated Plaintiffs' equal protection rights-is a pure question of law.

This rule is not too general to define clearly established law because \"the unlawfulness\" of Defendants' conduct \"follow[s] immediately from the conclusion\" that this general rule exists and is clearly established.\n   <em>\n    Dist. of Columbia v.

As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Pauly\n   </em>\n   , the requirement that clearly established law be \"particularized to the facts of the case\" is intended to prevent plaintiffs from \"convert[ing] the rule of qualified immunity into a rule of\n   virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Pauly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12608520\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/548/#p551\">\n    137 S.

This concern is particularly acute in Fourth Amendment cases, such as\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pauly\n   </em>\n   , because of the \"imprecise nature\" of the relevant legal standards and the fact-intensive assessment required to determine whether a violation occurred.\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.

Stated differently, this general rule is sufficiently specific to have put Defendants on notice in this case that they would violate A.N.'s right to equal protection under the law if they intentionally and without a rational basis differentiated between her and similarly situated juvenile arrestees in applying New Mexico's laws against the disclosure of juvenile arrest and delinquency records.

Ct. R. 10-166 (regarding public inspection and sealing of Children's Court records), might not apply. It is not clear to us how or if this argument, even if it has merit, would negate Defendants' as-yet undisputed violation of the other New Mexico statutes and rules cited by Plaintiffs.

In\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    , we held an Oklahoma statute that defined \"juveniles\" for purposes of criminal proceedings as males under sixteen years of age and females under eighteen years of age violated the equal protection rights of males over sixteen because there was no logical constitutional justification for this disparate treatment of males and females of the same age.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"737998\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/456/18/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"737998\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/456/18/\">\n     at 19-20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This decision supports our conclusion that A.N.'s right to equal protection was clearly established, because it provides notice of something that should go without saying, which is that equal protection principles apply to the treatment of juveniles in criminal proceedings, just as they do to individuals in other settings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
