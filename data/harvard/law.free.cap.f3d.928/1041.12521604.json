Subtitle C of RCRA required the Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations governing the storage, treatment, and disposal of \"solid waste,\" which was defined as \"discarded\" material,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206903\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (27). Among RCRA's stated\n   objectives was \"minimizing the generation of hazardous waste ... by encouraging process substitution, materials recovery,\n   <em>\n    properly conducted recycling\n   </em>\n   and reuse, and treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206903\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6902(a)(6) (emphasis added). In 2008, EPA promulgated a final rule that treated material transferred from a waste generator to a third-party reclaimer as legitimately recycled, rather than \"discarded\" and subject to Subtitle C regulation, if several conditions were met. This Transfer-Based Exclusion was replaced by another exclusion in 2015, reinstated by the court in 2017, and reissued by EPA as modified in 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Environmental petitioners consider the Transfer-Based Exclusion to be insufficiently protective of human health and the environment and bring two challenges: First, they contend the Transfer-Based Exclusion exceeds EPA's statutory authority under RCRA. In their view, a generator \"discards\" hazardous material whenever it pays a reclaimer to accept the material. Second, they contend the Transfer-Based Exclusion fails arbitrary and capricious review because EPA has not provided a reasoned explanation for treating hazardous material differently based on whether it is sent to a reclaimer instead of a storage, treatment, or disposal facility, and because EPA has already identified deficiencies in the Transfer-Based Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   EPA initially raises a host of threshold objections to petitioners' contentions, some of which industry intervenors join. Upon examination, we conclude none is persuasive. On the merits, EPA responds that neither the statutory text, case law, nor empirical data supports petitioners' contentions. We conclude, in view of this court's precedent, that EPA did not act contrary to RCRA in adopting the Transfer-Based Exclusion because hazardous secondary materials are not necessarily \"discarded\" each time they are transferred from a generator to a reclaimer along with payment. Further we conclude that EPA has provided a reasoned explanation for applying different standards to materials that are not yet part of the waste disposal problem RCRA addresses where they meet conditions EPA concluded were adequate for safe transfer and legitimate recycling. The Transfer-Based Exclusion therefore survives arbitrary and capricious review. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Some background is necessary before addressing the threshold objections to petitioners' challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2008, EPA promulgated a final rule intended to \"encourage and expand the safe, beneficial recycling of additional hazardous secondary materials,\" adopting the Generator-Controlled Exclusion and the Transfer-Based Exclusion. The Exclusions deal with \"reclamation,\" a type of recycling that occurs when secondary material is processed to recover a usable product or is regenerated.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.1\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4), (7).

The final rule allowed generators of hazardous secondary materials to avoid Subtitle C regulation of those materials where the generator controls the recycling or where the generator transfers the materials to an off-site reclaimer.\n   <em>\n    Revisions to the Definition of Solid Waste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2064%2C668\">\n    73 Fed.

EPA eventually replaced the Transfer-Based Exclusion in 2015 with a similar but more restrictive Verified Recycler Exclusion, allowing generators to avoid Subtitle C requirements only when they transfer materials to verified recyclers that had obtained either permits or variances.\n   <em>\n    Definition of Solid Waste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%201694\">\n    80 Fed.

Environmental and industry groups challenged this Exclusion, and in\n   <em>\n    API III\n   </em>\n   , the court vacated the permit and variance provisions, reinstated the 2008 Transfer-Based Exclusion, and upheld other requirements regarding emergency preparedness and containment added in 2015.

By parity of reasoning, just as the court has recognized industry groups' standing based on injury caused by elimination of parts of the Exclusion,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    API III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275795\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/50/\">\n    862 F.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Transfer-Based Exclusion deprives petitioners' members of Subtitle C protections that Congress deemed necessary to address health or environmental risks. Congress acknowledged the potential threat to human health and the environment associated with hazardous wastes\n   when it required EPA to promulgate regulations governing their storage, treatment, and disposal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206903\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(B).

In their declarations, petitioners' members describe how their reasonable fear of those same health or environmental risks impairs their ability to feel safe and to enjoy the outdoors. Several declarants state that they spend less time outdoors exercising, gardening, walking their dogs, or fishing, or do not enjoy these outdoor activities as much, due to their worries about health and environmental harms.

Although EPA attempts to recast petitioners' current contentions as new, Sierra Club raised the same concerns in 2007 as petitioners here about the relevance of generators' payment to recyclers and the insufficiency of the Transfer Conditions. EPA's Response to Comments shows it was aware of these objections to the proposed rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NRDC\n   </em>\n   , 755 F.3d at 1022-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Regarding the payment issue, EPA quoted Sierra Club's concerns,\n   <em>\n    see Revisions to the Definition of Solid Waste\n   </em>\n   , Response to Comments Document, 88 (Oct. 1, 2008), and explained that although it would not \"mak[e] its finding on discard solely based on the 'value' of the recycled material[,] '[v]alue' is one aspect of the Agency's findings and[ ] contributes to the ultimate determination that materials complying with the conditions and restrictions of this regulation are not discarded,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Regarding the sufficiency of the Transfer Conditions, EPA noted commenters' views that \"before EPA can lawfully claim that excluded materials are not discarded, the Agency would need to strengthen the conditions to protect human health and the environment\" and that \"the minimal conditions in the proposal are not sufficient to protect against discard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86.

The court granted the joint motion of Sierra Club and EPA to hold the petition in abeyance.

EPA's study of successful recycling had shown that \"generators who could otherwise bear a large liability from poorly-managed recycling at other companies have addressed [these] issue[s] by carefully examining the recyclers to which they send their hazardous secondary materials, such as through audits to ensure that they are technically and financially capable of performing the recycling.\" 2015 Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%201694\">\n    80 Fed.

Under this court's precedent EPA did not exceed its authority under RCRA in adopting the Transfer-Based Exclusion because hazardous secondary materials are not necessarily \"discarded\" each time they are transferred from a generator to a reclaimer along with payment. EPA has also adequately explained why such materials may be subject to the Transfer Conditions rather than full Subtitle C requirements.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
