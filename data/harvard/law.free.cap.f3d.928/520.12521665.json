There, he experienced a parade of horribles. The question is whether those responsible violated Berkshire's clearly established constitutional rights. Different facts and different law apply to each Defendant in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Berkshire had mental-health issues, but he began to improve while he was in the Residential Treatment Program (\"RTP\") at the Macomb Facility. In RTP, Berkshire worked as a Housing Unit Representative on a \"Warden's Forum,\" in which he brought inmate complaints to the attention of prison staff. After Berkshire brought one set of complaints, Dr. Debra Dahl unilaterally raised Berkshire's Global Assessment Functioning (\"GAF\") score, which mental-health professionals use to measure a patient's level of functioning, to a score that made Berkshire ineligible to stay in RTP. Berkshire claims Dr. Dahl removed him from RTP to retaliate against Berkshire for his Warden's Forum complaints, thereby violating his First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Once discharged from RTP, Berkshire's health and mental state quickly deteriorated. Three individuals oversaw Berkshire's care: Donna Beauvais, the unit chief of the outpatient mental-health program; Christopher Sermo, a psychologist with the outpatient program; and Dr. Vasilis Pozios, a private doctor working for the government. Berkshire had homicidal thoughts and engaged in self-injurious activity, including depriving himself of food and water. Eventually, Berkshire attempted to commit suicide. Only then did Beauvais and Sermo transfer Berkshire to a Crisis Stabilization Program, because, according to an email, they \"could not transfer [Berkshire] to Mars ....\" Berkshire claims that Beauvais, Sermo, and Dr. Pozios exhibited deliberate indifference to Berkshire's serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Finally, after Berkshire attempted suicide, he was restrained. Around midnight, Sergeant Michael Nelson entered Berkshire's cell, and Berkshire requested a bathroom break. Sergeant Nelson (now a lieutenant) told Berkshire to \"hold it\" and that he was going to \"stay just like that until [his] mental illness goes away,\" and then left. Sergeant Nelson never returned, leaving Berkshire to lie in his own urine and feces for about six to seven hours. Berkshire's claim against Sergeant Nelson turns on the Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court denied qualified immunity to all the Defendants. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Berkshire has a history of mental-health issues going back to early childhood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 183-4 (Clark Rep. at 2-3) (Page ID #2430-31). Berkshire's problems with the law started when he was just nine years old.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Page ID #2431). Eventually, Berkshire was incarcerated for thirteen years (2001 to 2014) for second-degree home invasion,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (Page ID #2430), and from 2011 to 2012, he was housed at the Macomb Correctional Facility in Michigan. The instant case involves five Defendants and their encounters with Berkshire at the Macomb Facility. The facts as to each will be addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dr. Dahl: Berkshire's Time in RTP and His Discharge from RTP\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July 2011, Berkshire entered RTP. RTP is an inpatient mental-health wing at the prison that offers programs in art and music therapy, weight lifting, and psychotherapy for inmates with needs like Berkshire. At the time, Berkshire was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early March 2012, RTP residents elected Berkshire as their Housing Unit Representative. R. 183-2 (Berkshire Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26) (Page ID #2407). These representatives work on behalf of RTP residents, solicit residents' complaints and concerns, and share those complaints and concerns with the Resident Unit Manager.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 184-5 (Policy Directive) (Page ID #2616). A representative like Berkshire carries out their role by compiling resident input into an \"Agenda\" that is submitted to the unit manager prior to meetings between the representative and the unit manager and other staff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Relatedly, representatives participate in the \"Warden's Forum,\" which \"assist[s] the Warden in identifying and resolving problems which exist in the general population of the institution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a representative, Berkshire made \"rounds\" with residents to discuss their concerns, which he would then compile into an Agenda. R. 183-2 (Berkshire Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28) (Page ID #2407). Moreover, in his role as representative, Berkshire assisted other inmates, \"many of whom could not read or write, with drafting grievances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. On March 19, 2012, Berkshire submitted an Agenda to Dr. Dahl, the RTP unit chief, and the Resident Unit Manager, Geraldine Wilson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35 (Page ID #2409); R. 183-10 (Agenda) (Page ID #2491). The Agenda contained six issues and requests and included citations to prison policies. R. 183-10 (Agenda) (Page ID #2491-93). Berkshire addressed the Agenda to Dr. Dahl, and he asserts that he delivered it to her personally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; R. 183-2 (Berkshire Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37) (Page ID #2409). Over the course of the next two days, RTP staff refused to let Berkshire make his rounds, even though other representatives were able to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 183-2 (Berkshire Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 38-40) (Page ID #2409-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Then on March 21, 2012-two days after Berkshire submitted his Agenda-Dr. Dahl increased Berkshire's GAF score from 48 to 53.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 183-13 (Page ID #2500-02). (As mentioned above, the GAF is a measure used by mental-health professionals to indicate the level of functioning of a patient.) A GAF score of 51 makes an inmate ineligible for RTP. Consequently, Berkshire was transferred from RTP back into the general population on about March 23, 2012. Berkshire states that he \"had not discussed [his] mental health situation with any of [his] treating doctors in\n   months nor did [he] feel that [he] was ready to be placed in the general population of a prison.\" R. 183-2 (Berkshire Aff. at \u00b6 41) (Page ID #2410);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 183-4 (Clark Rep. at 7) (Page ID #2435) (noting a \"three month lapse in documentation\" between December 20, 2011, when Berkshire's GAF was 48, and March 21, 2012, when Dr. Dahl raised Berkshire's GAF to 53). For her part, Dr. Dahl could not recall meeting with Berkshire, creating the record, or the review of Berkshire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 183-7 (Dahl Dep. at 65-66) (Page ID #2472-73). The record itself states that, \"[s]ince being in the RTP, Mr. Berkshire has made good progress,\" and goes on to recount some of Berkshire's experiences in RTP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 183-13 (Page ID #2501).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ultimately, Berkshire was discharged from RTP. Any \"good progress\" that Berkshire had made during his time there declined quickly once he entered the general population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Beauvais, Sermo, and Dr. Pozios: Berkshire's Decline After His Discharge From RTP, His Treatment, and Suicide Attempt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Donna Beauvais, Christopher Sermo, and Dr. Pozios each had a hand in Berkshire's treatment after Berkshire's discharge from RTP. (Because Dr. Pozios forfeited his qualified-immunity defense below and because his appeal is squarely decided by binding Sixth Circuit precedent, we address the facts related to him only to the extent that those facts interrelate with those relevant to Beauvais's and Sermo's appeals.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Discharge from RTP was traumatic for Mr. Berkshire.\" R. 183-4 (Clark Rep. at 4) (Page ID #2432). Indeed, an April 1, 2012 medical record reveals that Berkshire was hospitalized due to an \"abrup[t] stop[p]age of his medication, and he hadn't ... eaten any food, drunk any water in 3 days .... When asked how he is doing, prisoner Berkshire stated 'doesn't matter'.\" R. 183-16 (Page ID #2522). The record also states that treatment was necessary to \"reduce risk of [Berkshire] needing a more intensive level of care, reduce risk of harm to self or others, maintain or improve current level of functioning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Berkshire was asked whether he had attempted suicide in the past, he responded \"many times.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 26, 2012, three days after Berkshire was discharged from RTP, Beauvais met with Berkshire for about ten to fifteen minutes. Beauvais knew then that Berkshire was expressing homicidal thoughts. R. 212-2 (Beauvais Dep. at 61) (Page ID #4436). After this meeting, Beauvais testified that she \"did not provide any treatment,\" but she assigned Berkshire \"to a case manager and a psychiatrist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67 (Page ID #4439). It is possible that Beauvais was referring to Sermo, who is a\n   <em>\n    psychologist\n   </em>\n   . Sermo indicated that Beauvais \"was happy that she gave [Berkshire] to [him] ... because [Berkshire] was presented to [him] as being problematic.\" R. 212-3 (Sermo Dep. at 65) (Page ID #4447). Within days after Berkshire's meeting with Beauvais, he stopped eating and drinking and abruptly stopped his medications, which triggered his hospitalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 3, 2012, Sermo visited Berkshire in his cell to evaluate him, allegedly for less than five minutes. Berkshire stated that Sermo asked him \"what [Berkshire] felt was best for [himself].\" R. 93 (Berkshire Aff. at \u00b6 35) (Page ID #996). Berkshire asked to be placed back into RTP, but Sermo responded that neither Berkshire's \"diagnosis [n]or behaviors met the criteria\" for RTP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Berkshire then requested to be placed in a Crisis Stabilization Program, in which Berkshire could have received a psychiatric evaluation to\n   determine appropriate treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Berkshire asserts that Sermo stated \"that he did not feel like doing all of that paperwork and ended the interview.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   212-3 (Sermo Dep. at 66) (Page ID #4448) (Sermo admitting that Berkshire was a patient that caused him to do extra work).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shortly after this meeting, Berkshire attended a hearing about a threatening behavior ticket he received (purportedly written by Beauvais), and Berkshire was placed in segregation. R. 93 (Berkshire Aff. at \u00b6 37) (Page ID #996); R. 183-17 (Page ID #2525). Berkshire then went on another hunger strike and engaged in other self-injurious behavior. This culminated in an April 9, 2012 attempt to hang himself with a noose in his cell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 93 (Berkshire Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 38-47) (Page ID #996-97); R. 183-17 (Page ID #2525). After that, Berkshire's GAF was promptly reduced to 19. R. 183-17 (Page ID #2526). The medical record corroborates the fact that Berkshire was refusing care at this time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 183-4 (Clark Rep. at 8-9) (Page ID #2436-37) (\"Given the severity of [Berkshire's] conditions paired with uncontrolled behavior a secondary method to administer medications should have been sought .... [Berkshire's] diagnosis of dissociative depression is marked by deferred ability to establish trust easily ... or to self soothe with isolation practices.\"). Berkshire's suicide attempt was unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Other evidence also suggests that Beauvais and Sermo knew of the severity of Berkshire's condition but deliberately declined to take action. Another inmate, Brent Lang, met with Dr. Pozios in late-May or early-June 2012. Lang's declaration states that Dr. Pozios \"admitted that he, Donna Beauvais and Christopher Sermo knew that Randy Berkshire was suffering from a[n] MMD (Major Mental Disorder) and that he had engaged in suicidal behaviors over the course of two weeks.\" R. 115 (Lang Decl. at \u00b6 8) (Page ID #1478). The declaration continues: \"Dr. Pozios stated that they waited weeks before they referred him to a Crisis Stabilization Program because they hoped that Randy Berkshire would have died.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. But after the attempted hanging, Beauvais and Sermo did transfer Berkshire to a Crisis Stabilization Program. On April 11, 2012, Beauvais emailed Dr. Pozios: \"Unfortunately, we could not transfer [Berkshire] to Mars so we had to send him to CSP.\" R. 213-5 (Page ID #4562). Dr. Pozios responded, \"Great. Why didn't you try the moon? It's closer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sergeant Nelson: The Night of Berkshire's Attempted Suicide\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sergeant Nelson's appeal involves a shorter set of facts. After Berkshire attempted to hang himself, prison staff first placed him in a four-point top-of-bed restraint. In this position, Berkshire stated that he was \"screaming and complaining that [he] was in severe physical pain.\" R. 115-1 (Berkshire Suppl. Aff. at \u00b6 22) (Page ID #1615). Prison staff then placed Berkshire in a five-point top-of-bed restraint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Sergeant Nelson was on duty from 9:00 P.M. on April 9, 2012 to about 5:00 A.M. on April 10, 2012. R. 212-6 (Nelson Dep. at 56) (Page ID #4466). Sergeant Nelson entered Berkshire's cell around midnight to check on the restraints. R. 115-1 (Berkshire Suppl. Aff. at \u00b6 22) (Page ID #1615). When Berkshire asked to use the restroom, Sergeant Nelson told him to \"hold it\" and that Berkshire was going to \"stay just like that until [his] mental illness goes away.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sergeant Nelson did not return and left Berkshire laying in his own urine and feces for upwards of six to seven hours. Additionally, Berkshire asserts that he was \"noncombative,\" \"not threatening,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   and \"posed no danger to [him]self or others\" at the time Sergeant Nelson entered his cell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Berkshire asserts that around 1:30 or 2:00 A.M., he was screaming loudly and trying to get off the bed to use the restroom, but he was ignored. He then \"urinated and defecated on [him]self.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25 (Page ID #1615-16). At 7:00 A.M., another official finally entered his room, and Berkshire was cleaned around 9:00 A.M.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-29 (Page ID #1616).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Berkshire brought a suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging violations of his First and Eighth Amendment rights. The district court denied qualified immunity to Dr. Dahl, Beauvais, Sermo, and Sergeant Nelson (collectively, \"State Defendants\").\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkshire v. Dahl\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-12038,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203276466\">\n    2017 WL 3276466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. Aug. 2, 2017). In addition, Berkshire filed for summary judgment against Dr. Dahl. The district court granted Berkshire's motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-8, but the district court issued no final judgment or Rule 54(b) certification as to Dr. Dahl,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 54(b). The district court did not address Dr. Pozios's argument for qualified immunity because Dr. Pozios did not raise the issue in his objections to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkshire v. Dahl\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-12038,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%209471684\">\n    2017 WL 9471684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 3, 2017) (denying Dr. Pozios qualified immunity). Prior to these rulings, the district court also struck late-added affidavits proffered by Dr. Dahl.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R. 235 (Dist. Ct. Aff. Order) (striking one affidavit and two paragraphs from another).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. State Defendants' Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Before turning to the merits of this qualified-immunity appeal, we must first address our jurisdiction. Berkshire previously filed a motion to dismiss the State Defendants' appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The motion was held in abeyance for our consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For this court to have jurisdiction over an appeal based on the denial of qualified immunity, a defendant must concede the facts in the light most favorable to Berkshire. This concession is necessary because \"it is well-established that an order denying qualified immunity to a public official is immediately appealable pursuant to the collateral order doctrine to the extent that a summary judgment order denies qualified immunity based on a pure issue of law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

First, even if the district court erred in granting summary judgment against Dr. Dahl, that issue is irrelevant to Dr. Dahl's motion for summary judgment against Berkshire. Importantly,\n   <em>\n    Berkshire\n   </em>\n   was the non-moving party for Dr. Dahl's motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. For Dr. Dahl's qualified immunity, we must view all facts and related inferences in the light most favorable to Berkshire. If, on the other hand, we held that Dr. Dahl should have received qualified immunity, then we could reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment for Berkshire (and the affidavit issue would become moot). That is not the scenario we are in. Second, the State Defendants acknowledge that there are no cases in which \"a court of appeals has jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of a district court's order striking an affidavit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Appellants' Reply Br. at 4.

This complaint, though \"individualized\" in a\n   <em>\n    very\n   </em>\n   technical sense, relates directly to Berkshire's role as a representative and his ability to serve as a resource\n   <em>\n    for other inmates\n   </em>\n   to voice\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   complaints and concerns-which Berkshire was appointed to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Fed.%20Appx.%20485\">\n    150 Fed.Appx. at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, Dr. Dahl slices the record too thin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moving to the second and third elements of Berkshire's retaliation claim, he also has enough evidence to overcome a qualified-immunity defense.

In sum, given the temporal proximity between Berkshire's submitting the Agenda and Dr. Dahl's unilateral changing of the GAF score, alongside Dr. Dahl's inability to recall why the score was changed and the general absence of other documentation, Berkshire rounds out his retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muhammad v.

The plaintiff there was confined in a holding cell in a county jail for twenty hours and he did, in fact, use the bathroom upon release.\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20WL%2036997\">\n    1987 WL 36997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Moreover, the court stated that \"in light of plaintiff's recent assault on the deputy sheriff, the defendants were vested with very broad discretion in adopting policies and procedures which were needed to preserve internal order and security.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20WL%2036997\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Hartsfield\n   </em>\n   is also distinguishable because, as the court noted, \"the record provides [unrefuted] sworn testimony and documentation ... that adequate toilet breaks and opportunities to drink were provided to plaintiff while he was in restraints and that he took advantage of them at least once ....\"\n   <em>\n    Hartsfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753134\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/305/#p310\">\n    199 F.3d at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not the case here. Third and relatedly, as the district court reasoned, the court should not fault Berkshire for requesting to use the restroom only once when he had only one opportunity to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkshire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203276466\">\n    2017 WL 3276466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14. Sergeant Nelson entered Berkshire's cell around midnight, denied Berkshire a toilet break, and then this denial effectively continued for approximately six to seven hours because Sergeant Nelson never returned. In fact, no one returned until approximately 7:00 A.M.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203276466\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, Berkshire has produced sufficient evidence to show a violation of a clearly established constitutional right, and he can survive Sergeant Nelson's assertion of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For these reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court, and we\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   the remainder of Dr. Dahl's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    There has been some debate about whether this is a speech case or a petition case. We note that the operative complaint states: \"Defendant Dahl's actions violated Plaintiff's rights for the retaliation of protected speech grounded in the First Amendment.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 101 (Am.
