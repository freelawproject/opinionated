Plaintiffs sued Christensen and the county under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims, in addition to a state law negligence claim against the county. After trial, the jury found Christensen and the county liable for J.K.J. and M.J.J.'s injuries and awarded each $ 2 million in compensatory damages. The jury also levied punitive damages against Christensen, awarding $ 3,750,000 to each plaintiff. Both defendants moved for new trials, and the county also moved for judgment as a matter of law. The district court denied those requests and defendants now appeal the judgments entered against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We see no reason to disturb the jury's verdict against Christensen and so affirm the denial of his request for a new trial. His assaults were predatory and knowingly criminal. But to impose liability against the county for Christensen's crimes, there must be evidence of an offending county policy, culpability, and causation. These are demanding standards. Christensen's acts were reprehensible, but the evidence shows no connection between the assaults and any county policy. We therefore reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Christensen's Sexual Assaults\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   M.J.J. and J.K.J. were inmates at Polk County Jail at various times between 2011 and 2014. Christensen admits he engaged in sexual acts with the women individually. To hide his offenses, Christensen planned his encounters to occur when no one was present and in locations where he controlled access. He also urged plaintiffs not to discuss or report his sexual advances because he would lose his job and family if caught. Plaintiffs complied with Christensen's secrecy directive and his assaults were kept hidden from jail officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Polk County authorities discovered Christensen's assaults against M.J.J. and J.K.J. after a former inmate reported her own sexual encounters with Christensen to an investigator in a neighboring county. When notified of the former inmate's allegations, county authorities initiated an internal investigation and confronted Christensen, who immediately resigned. The investigation continued, which led to the discovery of Christensen's abuse of plaintiffs, and ultimately to his prosecution. He eventually pleaded guilty to several counts of sexual assault and is serving a 30-year prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Trial Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs sued the county and Christensen in separate actions and the cases were consolidated for jury trial. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants were deliberately indifferent to a serious risk of sexual assault in violation of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and that the county violated state law by negligently supervising Christensen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, Christensen admitted his offenses but challenged the harms plaintiffs suffered. He argued plaintiffs consented to his overtures and that their encounters were the product of \"voluntary attraction.\" Although not stated directly, his position implied that any award of damages should correspond to plaintiffs' level of consent. Plaintiffs denied consenting to Christensen's advances and offered expert testimony showing their mental trauma from his assaults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Against the county, plaintiffs made four principal allegations: (1) the jail's sexual assault policies and training were inadequate; (2) the jail customarily tolerated sexually offensive comments by guards; (3) the investigation of a former guard revealed the jail's sexual assault policy was inadequate and that the jail minimized sexual abuse; and (4) the jail failed to widely implement recommendations under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030301\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -09. The sum of these allegations, plaintiffs argued, prove the county was deliberately indifferent to a known risk of sexual assault by jail staff. The county disagreed, arguing that the trial evidence did not support the jury's liability finding and damages awards. These claims were heavily contested, and we recount the evidence noting those facts the county disputed. Although we summarize the trial evidence, on appeal we view the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lindsey v. Macias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519043\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/517/\">\n    907 F.3d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518 n.1 (7th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Policies and training\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged the jail had no policy either to prevent or detect sexual assaults, and that its policies on sexual misconduct were \"practically nonexistent.\" At trial, the county produced several policies prohibiting sexual contact between guards and inmates, and two stand out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Policy I-100 forbids any mistreatment or harassment of inmates, explaining inmates' rights and informing them that it is never acceptable for \"any inmate [to] be the object of verbal, physical, emotional, psychological, or sexual harassment by facility staff.\" The policy continues, \"[a]ny officer engaged in such actions is subject to disciplinary charges and/or termination.\" Inmates are also provided a handbook when booked into the jail that says:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Every inmate has the right to be safe from sexual abuse and harassment. No one has the right to pressure you to engage in sexual acts. If you are being pressured threatened, or extorted for sex, you should report this to staff immediately.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Likewise, Policy C-202 prohibits any \"intimate social or physical relationship with\n   a prisoner.\" It also informs jail staff that sexual contact with any inmate is a criminal offense under Wisconsin law, and any officer that suspects such conduct has a duty to report it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20940.225\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 940.225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(h) (categorizing sexual contact and sexual intercourse by a correctional staff member with an inmate as a Class C felony).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs also claimed the county never trained officers to avoid sexual assaults. But the jail's onboarding and continuing education programs instruct employees that sexual contact with prisoners is a crime and never permitted. The Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) approved these programs annually, requiring: (1) eight to ten weeks of \"field training,\" during which a new corrections officer shadows an experienced officer to learn jail policies and procedures; (2) completion of a 160-hour jail training program to become a certified corrections officer; (3) 24 hours of continuing education each year to be recertified; and (4) daily training, which includes specific training on the jail's prohibition against fraternizing with inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At trial, Christensen acknowledged the jail trained him that sexual contact with inmates is a felony and against jail policies. Specifically, Christensen testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 He knew his conduct violated jail policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 He was trained his conduct was a crime;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 He knew he was putting plaintiffs at risk;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 He never forgot that sex with inmates was a crime; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 He agreed he did not require more training to know his conduct was a crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs' expert witness on prison training standards, Jeffrey Eiser, testified that the jail's policies prohibited sexual contact between inmates and guards. Eiser also corroborated that the county trained Christensen that sexual contact with inmates was a felony and against jail policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To support their contention that the jail never trained its staff, plaintiffs relied on two witnesses. The first, Lynelle Manning, was a jailer with the county for about 20 months. Manning testified that although she was never officially certified as a correctional officer, she received \"formal training\" by the jail and shadowed a senior officer for weeks. She also received and read the jail's policy and inmate booking manuals, which contain the jail's prohibition of sexual contact between guards and inmates. Manning also testified that during her employment she never heard sexually charged conversations between jail staff and inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs' second witness, Sergeant Steven Schaefer of the county's sheriff's department, worked at the jail from 2002 until 2015. Schaefer testified \"we were all required to attend\" countywide training on sexual harassment. He provided the training to new employees from time to time. According to Schaefer, that training instructed on the jail's numerous prohibitions between staff and inmates, including improper comments, becoming too close or too familiar, sharing personal information, and sexual relationships. He also agreed that improper relationships between inmates and guards were \"something that the jail as a whole took very seriously.\" Notwithstanding Schaefer's testimony, plaintiffs' counsel told the jury during closing argument: \"You heard Sergeant Schaefer say, 'We never trained on it. We never trained on it. We never trained on it.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Inappropriate speech\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, plaintiffs alleged that jail staff routinely made sexually inappropriate\n   comments about female inmates without repercussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   According to plaintiffs, Captain Scott Nargis, who oversaw daily operations of the jail, was the reason that sexually offensive speech was accepted at the jail. During adverse examination, plaintiffs' counsel asked Nargis if he ever \"engaged in tier talk which is not necessarily flattering talk amongst co-workers\"; Nargis answered \"yes.\" Nargis also agreed that he participated in tier talk \"on occasion\" to establish trust among subordinate officers. Plaintiffs never asked Nargis on the witness stand if he himself made sexual comments. Nor did plaintiffs present evidence that tier talk connoted \"sexual talk,\" that Nargis's \"tier talk\" was sexually explicit, or that Nargis made comments sexual in nature with, about, or around inmates or guards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Evidence to suggest Nargis knew about offensive comments by jail staff was scarce and unclear as to timing. Nargis testified that during Christensen's twelve-year employment, he once heard Christensen comment on a female's \"rear end.\" He did not recall whether that comment was made about an inmate. Nargis also recalled being told that Christensen once remarked about an inmate's breasts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Evidence of inappropriate sexual comments by other jail staff was also sparse and unspecific. J.K.J. testified she believed two other corrections officers once overheard Christensen making flirtatious comments to inmates. Christensen also testified to overhearing a jail guard, Allen Jorgenson, and two other guards make suggestive comments to inmates. But J.K.J. and Christensen offered no specifics on the alleged comments, and there was no evidence these incidents were reported to the county or any jail supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Investigation of former guard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At trial, plaintiffs introduced one other allegation of sexual contact between a jail guard, Jorgenson, and an inmate, N.S.: another inmate saw Jorgenson put his arm around N.S.'s waist and \"pat her on the butt.\" This occurred in 2012, two years before the discovery of Christensen's violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sergeant Steven Schaefer reported these allegations to Nargis, who in turn questioned Jorgenson and N.S. individually. Each denied any improper relationship or contact. Despite these denials, Nargis requested the assistance of chief deputy sheriff Steven Moe to further investigate Jorgenson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To plaintiffs, the Jorgenson investigation proves the county \"minimized\" and ignored allegations of a guard assaulting an inmate. At trial, the jury considered the findings of the Jorgenson investigation, including Jorgenson's interactions with N.S. Another inmate believed Jorgenson and N.S. had an \"inappropriate relationship\" but \"no physical relationship.\" It was also reported that Jorgenson misused a jail camera to focus on inmates longer than necessary. In addition to an internal investigation, Nargis and Moe reached out to former inmates as part of their review. Because of inconsistent witness accounts, Nargis and Moe could not confirm that Jorgenson engaged in any sexual contact with N.S. Still, Nargis and Moe concluded that Jorgenson's affiliation with N.S. violated jail policy. As a result, Jorgenson was issued a written reprimand for \"foster[ing] a friendship relationship\" by giving \"undue, unfair, or simply too much attention\" to N.S., who continued to deny any improper actions or relationship up to the point of Jorgenson's reprimand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After Jorgenson was written up, N.S. recanted her denials in a letter to Nargis. In response, Nargis and Moe reopened the investigation \"to take a whole fresh look at the situation.\" N.S.'s letter detailed that Jorgenson made sexually harassing gestures and crude and indecent remarks, and asserted allegations of Jorgenson putting his arm around N.S.'s waist and touching her \"back and butt.\" After this second review, Nargis and Moe could not confirm these allegations and decided the reprimand remained the appropriate level of discipline. At trial, no evidence was submitted that Nargis or Moe erred in the Jorgenson investigation or performed their inquiries in bad faith. In closing, plaintiffs' counsel argued to the jury that the \"jail knew that one of their trusted friends was committing sexual assault against at least one inmate, N.S.\" but considered it \"no big deal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Jorgenson also made inappropriate remarks, of which inmates and staff were aware. But there was no evidence Jorgenson's improper comments were reported to Nargis, Moe, or any county policymaker before the N.S. investigations. On that point, the county argued the N.S. allegations prompted complaints by various female coworkers, who claimed Jorgenson made inappropriate comments to them as well. Those coworker complaints led to a human resources investigation that resulted in Jorgenson resigning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The county's sexual assault policies were inadequate to prevent and detect assaults, and the county deliberately avoided opportunities to reduce sexual assault risks, according to plaintiffs. Both arguments were based on the county's purported underutilization of policy recommendations from PREA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Again, plaintiffs zeroed in on Nargis. They claimed the jail intentionally shunned PREA because Nargis openly \"denigrated ... PREA standards,\" citing a 2014 email from Nargis to jail staff about PREA training:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Seems to be that everyone is in a tizzy to train their staff on PREA. There is no requirement for use [sic] to be compliant with everything that the law calls for, but nevertheless it is federal law. So we'll hit the basics of PREA training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At trial, plaintiffs termed this \"the tizzy email.\" To plaintiffs, Nargis's choice of the word \"tizzy\" was \"mocking\" PREA and \"indicat[ed] that he disliked PREA.\" They also claimed the email never discussed any specific PREA measures. Rather, it merely restated the jail's current anti-sexual assault policies. Plaintiffs argued \"the tizzy email\" proves that Nargis and the jail \"consciously disregarded\" PREA standards, and by extension, disregarded the risk of sexual assaults at the jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs' expert Eiser opined that the jail's sexual assault policies and training were inadequate because they did not fully adopt certain components of PREA. Eiser conceded compliance with PREA is not mandatory for county jails in Wisconsin, and that PREA standards are better viewed as optional \"best practices.\" Eiser also testified there is no empirical data that compliance with the proposed best practices would yield a better result. Plaintiffs agree that state law, not PREA, governs county jails in Wisconsin, but did not offer evidence that the jail's sexual assault policies or training fell below state legal or administrative standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As for compliance with state law, the county argued the DOC annually reviews the jail's policies, including its policy prohibiting fraternization with inmates. In each year of plaintiffs' incarcerations, the DOC found the jail to be in full compliance\n   with all applicable Wisconsin statutes and regulations. Language addressing PREA was added to the jail's anti-fraternization policy in 2012, with an accompanying PREA training in 2014. The county also noted that in the past nine years, during which the jail housed 14,100 inmates, Jorgenson's circumstance was the only known improper relationship between a guard and an inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Verdict and Post-Verdict Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The district court bifurcated the trial into liability and damages phases. At the close of the liability phase, during the jury instruction conference, the court found the evidence failed to show a pattern of constitutional violations known to county policymakers. As a result, the court excluded this basis of liability from the jury instructions, leaving plaintiffs to argue that the \"risk of the inadequacy of the training, supervision, and/or adoption of policies [was] plainly obvious.\" The court also rejected a jury instruction as to whether plaintiffs consented to Christensen's sexual contact and thus reduced plaintiffs' harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After a five-day trial, the jury found for plaintiffs on all claims and awarded each plaintiff $ 2 million in compensatory damages against the county and Christensen. The jury also awarded $ 3,750,000 to each plaintiff in punitive damages against Christensen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After the verdict, Christensen moved for a new trial under FED. R. CIV. P. 59. Christensen argued there was insufficient proof that he harmed plaintiffs or was aware of the substantial risk of harm his actions imposed. The district court rejected these arguments, relying on plaintiffs' testimony that they never consented to Christensen's advances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The county also moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and for a new trial under Rule 59. This resulted in partial yet hollow success for the county-the district court granted judgment to the county on plaintiffs' state law negligence claims, but denied the county judgment on plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims, as well as a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The district court rejected the county's contention that plaintiffs failed to prove it was culpable for and the cause of Christensen's violations, as required for liability under\n   <em>\n    Monell v. New York City Dep't of Soc. Servs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). Although the court noted the evidence against the county was \"not overwhelming,\" it concluded three subjects supported the verdict: (1) jail supervisor Nargis \"generally acknowledged his awareness of tier talk\" at the jail; (2) Nargis was aware of sexual comments by correctional officers to inmates and female employees through the Jorgenson investigation, in addition to two comments made by Christensen; and (3) the county held only one PREA training session. For the district court, this was sufficient evidence for the jury to find \"that Nargis and others within the [county] ... acted with deliberate indifference to the need for better training, supervision and policies.\" So the verdict against the county remained intact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The county and Christensen both argue the district court improperly denied them\n   judgment as a matter of law or a new trial under Rules 50 and 59. At the outset, we note Christensen never filed a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50. Without such a motion, he forfeited his request for judgment under that rule, and our review is limited to his request for a new trial under Rule 59.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Unitherm Food Sys., Inc. v.

We start with plaintiffs' claim that the county was deliberately indifferent to a known and obvious risk that its express policies would lead to, and in fact caused, Christensen's assaults. Then, we consider whether plaintiffs' general allegations against the county amount to an implicit policy, i.e., a widespread practice or custom, that permits sexual misconduct by jail staff; and if so, whether the county's deliberate indifference to that policy caused Christensen's assaults. Next, we examine plaintiffs' contention that the county was deliberately indifferent to the need for more training and supervision, causing plaintiffs' injuries. After that, we address whether Christensen's constitutional violations were a highly predictable consequence of the jail's failure to train its staff allowing for single-incident liability. Last, we consider the sufficiency of the evidence in light of the county's motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the district court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.

Instead, they challenge alleged gaps or omissions in those policies. Plaintiffs contend the policies do not provide adequate measures to prevent and detect sexual assault-namely, measures suggested by PREA. \"[T]he absence of a policy might reflect a decision to act unconstitutionally, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly told us to be cautious about drawing that inference.\"\n   <em>\n    Calhoun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955211\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/375/#p380\">\n    408 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   380 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bryan Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p407\">\n    520 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p407\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Canton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p385\">\n    489 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p385\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On this theory, the county's culpability hinges on whether it was deliberately indifferent to an obvious need to update or enhance its sexual assault policies. Liability could be established by showing the county adhered to a policy that it knew, or should have known, failed to prevent assaults by jail staff. But plaintiffs supplied no evidence of policy violations putting the county on notice of a sexual assault problem to resolve or act upon.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodward v.

When Christensen assaulted plaintiffs, the jail had no history of sexual assaults and operated under zero-tolerance sexual assault policies.

Plaintiffs contend the sum of these improprieties resulted in a widespread practice of allowing and encouraging sexual misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Nargis was a focal point of plaintiffs' implicit policy claim, beginning with the allegation that he promoted a \"toxic culture\" by participating in tier talk and acceding to offensive remarks by jail staff. In our de novo review of the record, however, this allegation lacks support. The only reference at trial to \"tier talk\" occurred during plaintiffs' examination of Nargis. And when Nargis admitted to \"tier talk,\" he did so only within plaintiffs' limited definition (\"not necessarily flattering talk\"). Plaintiffs failed to include that their definition encompassed a sexual subtext. Rather, plaintiffs grafted a sexual connotation onto the term after trial in response to the county's appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record also contains no evidence that Nargis's tier talk was sexually explicit, profane, or insensitive.

At trial, in questioning other witnesses about indecent remarks, plaintiffs routinely and frequently used concrete and specific terms such as \"sexual comments,\" \"inappropriate comments,\" and \"sexual harassment.\" None of these defined terms were used when plaintiffs questioned Nargis about tier talk. We therefore cannot assume that Nargis's admission of \"not necessarily flattering talk\" means \"sexual talk.\" Instead, we take plaintiffs at their word that \"tier talk\" means what they told Nargis it means.

The county does not dispute Jorgenson's comments to female coworkers were inappropriate. And plaintiffs do not dispute those comments went unreported until the N.S. investigation. Even if the county was somehow responsible for Jorgenson's boorishness, it was not deliberately indifferent to whether the problem continued.

There is no hazy border of the forbidden here: state law and jail policy unequivocally prohibit any sexual contact with inmates and afford no discretion on the matter.

When the court questioned how a reasonable jury could conclude Christensen's conduct was not harmful, Christensen's counsel replied that a harm instruction \"goes to consent and whether this was something that ultimately caused the harm being alleged.\" Christensen's counsel also argued the question of harm \"is a close call\" and \"one for the jury.\" The court was not persuaded and shifted the harm element from the liability phase to the damages phase; reasoning this was \"a compromise\" between its skepticism and Christensen's request. Then, after the jury found Christensen liable to plaintiffs, the court asked whether Christensen planned to argue that his conduct was not harmful during the damages phase. Christensen's counsel replied: \"No, Your Honor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In denying Christensen's motion for a new trial, the district court concluded that he had not preserved his objections to the removal of a harm instruction in either trial phase.

The instructions listed the essential elements of deliberate indifference, instructed the jury on plaintiffs' burden to prove these elements, and provided guidance on the meaning of a key term within these elements. Above all, the phrasing of the instructions was uncomplicated and substantively accurate. So Christensen has failed to show abuse of discretion on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Christensen next contends the instructions were \"seriously prejudicial\" because they \"resulted in a finding of liability without any consideration\" of whether he caused plaintiffs any harm. But this inaccurately conflates causation and consent. Like any prison guard, Christensen was prohibited from having sex with inmates; plaintiffs' constitutional claims are based on this prohibition. Christensen admits to committing these offenses. Plaintiffs' alleged consent does not make Christensen any less of a cause. To claim otherwise assumes consent voids causation, which it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   For their part, plaintiffs testified they did not consent to Christensen's advances. Plaintiffs' expert testified as to the serious mental health trauma plaintiffs suffered, and opined on the amount of damages from their injuries. Christensen offered no rebuttal.

Christensen argues the district court should have granted a new trial because the jury awarded identical compensatory damages to each plaintiff, so the verdicts \"lack a rational relationship with the evidence contained in the record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \"We review challenges to the propriety of a compensatory damages award\n   for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Kapelanski v.

In that case, a jury awarded $ 55,000 to each plaintiff among thirteen plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 833. Christensen asserts we affirmed the grant of a new trial in\n   <em>\n    Cygnar\n   </em>\n   solely because the jury gave identical awards to each plaintiff. Not so: we affirmed a new trial in\n   <em>\n    Cygnar\n   </em>\n   because the jury gave the same award per plaintiff despite the plaintiffs' \"sharp variances\" in the amount of economic harm suffered among them.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 848. In other words, because the awards in\n   <em>\n    Cygnar\n   </em>\n   did not account for obvious differences in harm between plaintiffs individually, we ruled that they did not bear a reasonable relation to the actual injuries sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In contrast, plaintiffs here relied on expert testimony to assert identical economic harms (psychological treatment costs) for the similar noneconomic harms suffered of repeated sexual assaults by Christensen. Christensen counters plaintiffs suffered different pre- and post-assault mental health concerns, and he engaged in sexual contact with each plaintiff with varying degrees of regularity. These \"inconsistencies,\" Christensen argues, precluded the jury from awarding an identical sum to J.K.J and M.J.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Christensen fails to explain how plaintiffs' mental health issues and the frequency of his assaults, which plaintiffs endured over years, necessarily translates into different damages awards. He also fails to show the jury's awards were not \"in line with other awards in similar cases,\" in support of his position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cygnar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531752\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/827/\">\n    865 F.2d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Each point warrants careful consideration, with the controlling question being whether\n   <em>\n    any rational jury\n   </em>\n   could have concluded that the combined evidence supports a finding of liability against the county. Setting aside a jury verdict on the basis of insufficient evidence is serious business. See\n   <em>\n    Woodward v. Corr. Med. Servs. of Illinois, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246932\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/917/#p930\">\n    368 F.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926 (7th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Polk County's Policies and Sexual Assault Training\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : All agree that Polk County's written policies categorically prohibit sexual contact with inmates. But so too should everyone agree that policies cannot exist on paper alone. It is not enough in this context to print the policy in a handbook, distribute it to all jail guards, and tell them to follow it. Training is critical precisely because it reinforces that strict adherence to the policy is required and indeed what most matters. And this is especially so in the context of a county employing male guards to supervise female inmates-a circumstance that is perhaps more the norm than the exception around the country, but which inheres with meaningful risk. It takes little foresight to envision an instance where a guard grows too comfortable, loses his better angels, and steps over the clear line marked in Polk County's written policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The trial evidence showed that Polk County's training on preventing the sexual harassment and abuse of inmates was sparing at best. The training consisted almost exclusively of informing guards of the easy and obvious-that the jail's policies prohibited sexual contact with inmates. What was missing stands out. The jury heard no evidence of guards being informed of the inherent vulnerability the confinement setting presents to female inmates. Nor was there evidence of the county either explaining the serious harm that can befall an inmate sexually abused by a guard or taking steps to train guards to hold each other accountable to the county's bright-line prohibition on any intimate\n   contact with inmates. The record shows that the only training dedicated to preventing the sexual assault of inmates by guards came in a single session on the Prison Rape Elimination Act in 2014-well after much of Darryl Christensen's abuse of J.K.J. and M.J.J. had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   At an even broader level there was no evidence that the county included the female inmates themselves in its efforts to prevent sexual abuse. The jury, for example, heard no account of the county ensuring or reinforcing that inmates had access to a safe and confidential channel through which to report inappropriate sexual conduct by jail guards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Do not overread these observations as somehow prescribing what the county had to do to avoid liability. The observations serve only to show that the county's training was so thin that its inadequacy could have informed the jury's ultimate finding of deliberate indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Culture of the Polk County Jail\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : At trial the jury learned that Captain Scott Nargis was aware of sexual comments made by male guards about and towards female inmates. Nargis testified that he heard Christensen comment on a female's \"rear end,\" while also learning from others that Christensen had made inappropriate comments about an inmate's breasts. Captain Nargis further testified that he himself occasionally participated in so-called \"tier talk\"-consisting of \"not necessarily flattering talk amongst co-workers.\" While the majority concludes that the tier talk of which Nargis was aware was not sexual in nature, there is no way to view the testimony about tier talk as compelling the jury to reach that conclusion. Rather, the record shows that Nargis recalled instances in which the banter among the guards included sexual comments about females within the facility, including at least one female inmate. At the very least, a reasonable jury could have found that the jail's administrators did little to reinforce the dignity and respect owed female (and indeed all) inmates and instead seemed to enable a culture that condoned the sexual objectification of female inmates by male guards. Judge Conley saw the evidence much the same way in denying the county's post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Unfortunately, there is more. The record shows that the jail's culture extended beyond tier talk, as evidenced by the allegations and resulting investigation of another guard, Allen Jorgenson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Polk County's (Non) Response to the Jorgenson Incident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : In early 2012 jail administrators received a complaint that Jorgenson had engaged in sexual contact-\"inappropriate touching\" to be exact-with a female inmate. The allegations also included concerns that Jorgenson used security cameras to fixate on female inmates and told inmates to expose themselves to him. Captain Nargis also learned that jail staff, as part of screening outgoing inmate mail, had reported seeing multiple references to Jorgenson's inappropriate behavior toward female inmates and staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Captain Nargis and Chief Deputy Steven Moe responded by conducting an investigation and concluding that Jorgenson had violated the jail's policies and deserved a written reprimand. The investigation confirmed that Jorgenson used security cameras on multiple occasions to focus on female inmates longer than necessary and flirted with female inmates generally. Though unable at first to substantiate that Jorgenson engaged in sexual contact with the inmate in question (in no small part due to the inmate's denial that any sexual contact had occurred), Nargis and Moe nonetheless found that Jorgenson pursued an improper personal relationship with the inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   More then came to light when the inmate submitted a letter recanting her prior denial of sexual contact with Jorgenson. The incidents described in the letter were detailed and specific, to say nothing of disturbing, and served to put Nargis and Moe on notice of allegations of repeated predatory behavior by Jorgenson. The inmate recounted much more than petty flirtation, reporting that \"[t]here are many things he [Jorgenson] has said and done that have been inappropriate in a sexual manner towards me,\" including, for example, telling me \"he has wanted me to lift my shirt,\" \"seeing us in the shower\" and calling it a \"nice show,\" touching my \"back and butt,\" \"lean[ing] over the [work] cart to look down my shirt,\" saying \"he wants me to ride topless in his boat,\" and instructing me to \"keep quiet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The letter prompted Nargis and Moe to take a fresh look at the matter. Sergeant Steven Schaefer spoke with the inmate to verify her report and concluded that she may have been telling the truth at that point. At trial Moe acknowledged that, after the jail received the letter, he found it \"more likely\" that Jorgenson had engaged in inappropriate or even illegal touching of the inmate. In the end, however, the county left in place its original reprimand of Jorgenson, only then to see him resign a short time later when female coworkers complained that he had made inappropriate comments towards them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The majority opinion risks the misimpression that Jorgenson's conduct was isolated to putting his arm around an inmate and patting her backside. The inmate's letter put the county on notice of much more, or at least a reasonable jury could have so concluded. By its terms, the letter conveyed detailed allegations of repeated sexual misconduct, including physical touching, by Jorgenson. While the majority might be right to observe that the jury heard no direct evidence demonstrating that Captain Nargis or Chief Deputy Moe undertook their investigation in bad faith, that observation answers the wrong question. The jury was entitled to conclude that, separate and apart from whatever discipline was owed Jorgenson, the county had a plain example of predatory sexual behavior staring it in the face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   A broader takeaway was available to the jury on this evidence: apart from reprimanding Jorgenson, the county took no action to reinforce its sexual assault policies with all other male guards. The county did not, for example, seek to learn why its policies aimed at protecting inmates from sexual assault and harassment were going unheeded or whether its culture-including the sexual commentary about and towards female inmates-contributed to Jorgenson's actions. Nor did the county hold a formal training session, or even a short informal meeting, to remind guards of the clear and absolute prohibition on any and all sexual contact with inmates. Indeed, Sergeant Schaefer testified that, after the Jorgenson incident, the guards received no training regarding inappropriate sexual conduct towards inmates. The jury likewise heard no evidence of the county taking any steps to monitor its male guards' compliance with its policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   To be sure, Polk County was not required to take any one of these particular measures. See\n   <em>\n    Glisson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277402\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/372/#p379\">\n    849 F.3d at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it emphatically is not our place to instruct a municipality on how to implement its sexual assault policies. The essential observation-the conclusion available to the jury-is much more limited: the Jorgenson incident informed the county that a guard had engaged in prohibited sexual conduct towards female inmates. With that information in hand, the one option unavailable to Polk County was the one it chose-doing nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The majority relies extensively on our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Vigo County, Indiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518729\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/1038/#p1045\">\n    905 F.3d 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2018) to make the point that notice of a handful of prior incidents of misconduct by employees does not support a finding of a municipality's deliberate indifference to coerced sexual activity. I see the cases as light years apart.

In light of this duty, and with knowledge that its policies aimed at preventing the sexual harassment and abuse of female inmates by guards were being disregarded, Polk County could not stand still.

A rational jury could have found that the county fell short of doing so. Even more specifically, the jury could have concluded that Polk County was aware that its mere proscriptions on sexual contact between guards and inmates had proved insufficient at preventing the sexual exploitation of at least one female inmate by a male guard. Deciding to do nothing once it had that information, a rational jury could have found, reflected deliberate indifference on the county's part.

And, as the majority is right to emphasize, Christensen also went to lengths to conceal his conduct. These facts make it tempting to view the plaintiffs' injuries as the result\n   of a lone bad actor's knowing decision to disregard the law and the county's policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The evidence permits another view, though. Christensen's actions cannot be separated from the broader context in which they occurred: J.K.J. and M.J.J.-female inmates in Polk County's custody-faced a very real risk of sexual assault by guards. Wisconsin law recognizes that risk by making it a crime for a guard to engage in any sexual contact with an inmate in any circumstance. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20940.225\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 940.225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(h). For their part, Polk County jail administrators likewise recognized the clear risk of inmates being sexually assaulted. More to the point, following the Jorgenson investigation, Polk County knew the risk was far from hypothetical. To the contrary, the Jorgenson incident showed the county that the existence of a written policy prohibiting sexual contact between guards and inmates was insufficient to prevent the sexual harassment and abuse of inmates by guards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   And this is precisely where the jury could have determined the county fell short. It neither conducted meaningful training aimed at preventing and detecting sexual assault nor monitored its employees' compliance with its policies. On this evidence, a rational jury could have found that the plaintiffs' injuries were the \"highly predictable consequence\" of the deliberate path of inaction that the county pursued by not providing more training or monitoring to prevent the sexual assault of female inmates.\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    563 U.S. at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p407\">\n    520 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p407\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   What worries me about today's decision is that, as a very practical matter, municipalities may conclude that there is not much to be done to stop a rogue guard from engaging in secretive and heinous conduct in violation of a bright-line policy prohibiting sexual contact with inmates. That view would be as mistaken as it is dangerous, for cities and counties have a meaningful responsibility and role to play in preventing the sexual abuse of inmates in their custody by the guards they employ. That promise comes from the Eighth Amendment. While not every incident of abuse will be preventable, a jail's decisionmakers are not free to choose-through their deliberate decisions on enforcement and training related to the jail's policies-to leave unaddressed a known and material risk of sexual assault to inmates under the jail's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Each of these observations follows from the evidence before the jury and, in this way, can be seen as embodied in the jury's verdict against Polk County.
