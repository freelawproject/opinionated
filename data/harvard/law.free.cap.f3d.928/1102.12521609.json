Congress permits courts to issue such injunctions in rare circumstances. Because this is one of them, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Atlas Air, Inc. and Polar Air Cargo Worldwide, Inc. (collectively, \"Atlas\") are global commercial air carriers that operate domestic and intercontinental flights for the U.S. military, DHL, and Amazon, among others. Atlas's pilots are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Airline Division; and the Airline Professionals Association of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local Union No. 1224. We refer to them collectively as the \"Union.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011, after a protracted negotiation process, the Union and Atlas entered into\n   a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The CBA prohibits the Union from engaging in a work stoppage or slowdown and permits Atlas to seek an injunction if the Union does so. The CBA also creates a process to resolve any \"grievance[s]\" that Atlas has over the \"interpretation or application\" of its provisions. Defs.' Ex. 1 at 126-27, No. 17-cv-1953 (D.D.C. Nov. 30, 2017), Dkt. No. 31-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since entering the CBA, Atlas's business model and staffing demands have changed significantly because of the rapid expansion of e-commerce. In the past, most of Atlas's business was international. Of late, the company's focus has shifted to a growing domestic market. The Union tried to work \"collaboratively with Atlas\" to alleviate the growing pains caused by this change rather than holding the company \"accountable\" to the precise terms of the CBA. J.A. 172-73. But as domestic operations expanded, pilots' frustrations increased. In 2014, the pilots elected a new Chairman of the Atlas Pilots' Executive Committee, the body through which the Union manages day-to-day representation of the pilots. Captain Robert Kirchner ran on a platform calling for \"strict contract compliance.\" J.A. 173. As he explained, if Atlas is \"allowed to bend and violate the terms of the [CBA] when it suits them, [the company] will have no reason to negotiate changes to the [CBA]\" when it becomes amendable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When he assumed the role of Chairman in January 2015, Captain Kirchner launched several communication tools to help educate pilots about their rights and responsibilities under the CBA: \"Atlas Teamsters Action Message\" podcasts (ATAM), \"Atlas Pilots Crew Call\" question and answer sessions, \"Chairman's Update\" emails, and \"CBA Chat\" videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 16, 2016, about one year after Captain Kirchner took office, the Union notified Atlas that it would seek to amend the existing CBA. Around that same time, the Executive Committee's communications efforts picked up steam. The day before the Union issued that notice, the Communications Chairman, Captain Michael Griffith, asked rhetorically on an ATAM, \"Are you going to continue[ ] to sell your talents for a quick buck, or are you going to stop doing the Company favors and follow the CBA to the letter and give your [Executive Committee] and Negotiation Committee the leverage and power they need today?\" J.A. 638. Over the coming months, the Union repeatedly called on pilots to be \"all in,\" \"fly the CBA,\" and \"fly the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 631, 650; Pls.' Ex. 51 at 3, No. 17-cv-1953 (D.D.C. Nov. 30, 2017), Dkt. No. 5-54; Pls.' Ex. 100 at 54, No. 17-cv-1953 (D.D.C. Nov. 30, 2017), Dkt. No. 27-4. It encouraged pilots to \"SHOP,\" or \"stop helping out Purchase,\" named for the location of Atlas's headquarters in Purchase, New York.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 640. According to Captain Kirchner, \"SHOP\" or \"shopping\" refers to the idea that pilots should not \"help out\" Atlas \"by permitting [it] to get away with contract violations,\" but should instead insist on \"strict contract compliance.\" J.A. 178. The Union asked pilots to \"BOOT,\" which stands for \"block out on time.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 652. By contrast, Atlas encourages pilots to \"block out\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , push back from the gate-up to fifteen minutes early as a matter of course, or even earlier with Atlas's approval. The Executive Committee also encouraged pilots to think more carefully about when to call in sick or accept overtime work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Atlas was unhappy with these efforts and the changes it began to see in pilots' behavior. Atlas viewed SHOP and BOOT as part of a Union attempt to orchestrate a work slowdown in an attempt to ratchet up pressure on Atlas during their negotiations over an amended CBA. When Atlas could not convince the Union to stop this behavior,\n   the company asked the district court for an injunction. The Union disputed Atlas's allegations and moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the district court determined that it had jurisdiction and entered a preliminary injunction to prevent the Union from encouraging pilots to \"block out on time,\" call in sick on short notice, and refuse to volunteer for overtime shifts.\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air, Inc. v.

It was in that context that he started calling for strict CBA compliance. In Atlas's view, the relevant date is February 2016, when the Union notified Atlas of its intent to negotiate an amended CBA, intensified its messaging campaign, and announced SHOP and BOOT. It is clear from the district court's analysis that the court agreed with Atlas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    280 F.

That dispute began in February 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Of course, a union is allowed to educate its members about their contractual rights and safety obligations, and in that context, it may not be a problem to call for strict compliance with the contract. A union may not, however, encourage strict compliance with the terms of an existing agreement in an effort to gain leverage in negotiations for a new or amended contract. When a union changes the status quo in aid of such an effort, the district court may enjoin the union's conduct. That is just what happened here with respect to blocking out, short-notice sick calls, and overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1. Blocking Out On Time\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Atlas asserts that pilots were substantially more likely to block out (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , push back from the gate) precisely on time after the Union notified Atlas of its intent to negotiate an amended CBA. Departing exactly on time, as opposed to when the aircraft is \"loaded and ready,\" removes any potential \"buffer,\" meaning the flight is more likely to arrive late if it encounters other issues, like headwinds or congestion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    at 100-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This threatens to cause cascading delays across flights by forcing Atlas to shuffle runways, schedules, and gates, particularly at Atlas's biggest hubs where flights depart every two-to-three minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Atlas's expert, Dr. Lee, presented statistically significant evidence showing that from January 1, 2012 to February 15, 2016, nearly 80% of flights blocked out early and 13% blocked out precisely on time. J.A. 464-67 (Lee Decl.). This consistently low percentage of precisely on-time departures reasonably suggests that pilots were not waiting to depart until scheduled. But from February 16, 2016 to August 2017, about 34% of flights blocked out early and 53% blocked out precisely on time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, since February 2016, \"the percentage of flights blocking out twenty-five or more minutes before the [estimated departure time] dropped from 12.1% to 3.3%,\" and \"flights unaffected by other delays have blocked out an average of six minutes less early.\"\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    280 F. Supp. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   100 (citing Dr. Lee's analysis). Notably, these statistics exclude flights delayed for reasons outside Atlas's control, like weather or customer requests, and flights experiencing cascading delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Union's responses to this compelling evidence lack merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the\n   Union disputes the reliability of Dr. Lee's analytical models. He used departure delays, but in the Union's view, arrival delays are a better metric because that is what customers care about. The Union's expert, Daniel Akins, found that Atlas's \"poor on-time [arrival] performance predates\" the Union's February 16, 2016 notice, pursuant to section 6 of the RLA, that it wished to negotiate an amended CBA (\"section 6 notice\"). Union Br. 12 (citing Mr. Akins's analysis);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20156\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Union therefore reasons that Atlas cannot blame the Union for these changes. The Union also claims that Dr. Lee made up the \"loaded and ready\" concept; that is not something airlines or pilots track, and Atlas does not have a rule requiring or allowing pilots to depart when the aircraft is \"loaded and ready.\" Union Br. 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As the district court found, there were good reasons for Dr. Lee to use departure time. Customers may be primarily concerned with arrival times, but the BOOT campaign encouraged pilots to\n   <em>\n    depart\n   </em>\n   on time, and departure delays contribute to arrival delays. That is why blocking out as soon as the aircraft is able to depart (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"loaded and ready\") is beneficial-it decreases the risk that an aircraft experiencing other delays will arrive late. A pilot who is ready and able to depart early, but instead sits at the gate until the scheduled departure time (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , waits to block out on time) cuts down the buffer. Because we agree that departure time is an appropriate metric, whether Atlas's flights arrived chronically late before the section 6 notice is immaterial to whether the BOOT campaign had a statistically significant effect on departure times. As for the Union's objections to the \"loaded and ready\" metric, it matters not that Atlas's expert coined this term to explain his analysis to the district court, and that Atlas did not have a formal policy requiring pilots to depart once the plane was \"loaded and ready.\" Since voluntary conduct can be part of the \"status quo,\" the pertinent question in this case is what the pilots normally did before the Union informed Atlas of its intent to negotiate an amended CBA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Delta Air Lines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11148499\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1300/#p1307\">\n    238 F.3d at 1309-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (encouraging pilots to decline optional overtime assignments violated the status quo). In other words, the question is what pilots normally did before the Union assertedly began trying to change the status quo. Atlas's statistical evidence shows that, prior to February 2016, pilots frequently departed before the scheduled time and only rarely departed precisely on time, and after February 2016, the inverse was true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the Union argues that blocking out on time is not illegal, but instead ensures that pilots are \"in compliance with [Federal Aviation Administration] rest, flight and duty time regulation[s].\" Union Br. 51. That may be so, but the issue is not whether pilots\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   block out on time; it is whether pilots altered their prior practice of blocking out before the scheduled time, when possible. And the answer to that question, the district court fairly concluded, was yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, the Union offers various alternative explanations for these changes, including \"the increasing complexity and size of [Atlas's] operations,\" the shift towards employing more junior-level pilots, an \"improved emphasis on fatigue training and awareness, and the increasing age of the Atlas fleet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. But these ideas would at best shed light on why fewer\n   flights blocked out\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the estimated departure time. The Union's theories do not explain the significant increase in flights blocking out\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   on time-from 13% to 53%. On the present record, the most plausible explanation for this conduct is the one Atlas offered: even if they were ready earlier, pilots waited to depart until the scheduled time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Atlas provided clear proof that the Union encouraged pilots to act in this manner. The record is replete with communications from the Union exhorting pilots to stop departing early. For example, on a June 2016 ATAM, Captain Griffith reminded listeners that \"the amendable date of our current [CBA]\" is approaching, and commended pilots on their efforts to \"show[ ] our particular giant how we can [SHOP] and [BOOT] and even buckle down and say, first you pay me.\" J.A. 653. In his June 2017 Chairman's Update email, Captain Kirchner told pilots that Atlas believes if it \"delay[s] a new CBA long enough, you will ... abandon our quest for an industry-leading CBA. This cannot be allowed to be the case! YOU must SHOP, BOOT and push back on their tactics harder than ever as we are starting to get the movement we desire.\" J.A. 728. Another Executive Committee member made the point even more explicit in an August 2017 Crew Call: \"Blocking out on time is ... advantageous to us by giving leverage to our Negotiating Committee and our [Executive Committee] and our stewards.\" J.A. 769. Given this evidence, the district court did not improperly conclude that Atlas is likely to succeed in demonstrating that by encouraging pilots to \"block out on time,\" the Union altered the status quo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   2. Short-Notice Sick Calls\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A \"short notice\" sick call refers to a pilot's decision not to fly, typically due to illness, made on the same day as the pilot's next scheduled flight. Atlas argues that pilots began calling in sick on short notice at a higher rate after the Union served its section 6 notice. This made it more difficult to find substitute crew members, increasing the risk that flights would be cancelled or delayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In support, Atlas provided statistical evidence that, from January 2013 to February 2016, only 14.4% of sick calls were made the same day the pilot was scheduled to fly. J.A. 451 (Lee Decl.). This suggests that pilots were not typically waiting until the day of the scheduled flight to notify Atlas of their unavailability. But from February 2016 to September 2017, that number was 20.4%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the reason for this percentage change was a spike in short-notice sick calls beginning in October 2016, Atlas's expert also compared statistics from October 1, 2015 to September 20, 2016, and from October 1, 2016 to September 20, 2017. Using those dates, short-notice sick calls increased from 13.8% to 23.8%, while sick calls made at least two days in advance decreased from 44.5% to 31.6%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, during the October 2015 to September 2016 period, the highest percentage of short-notice sick calls in a given month was 18%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But from October 2016 to September 2017, the monthly percentage never dropped below 18%, and it exceeded 20% in every month but one.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Union does not challenge the assertion that short-notice sick calls increased in frequency. Instead, the Union argues that \"\n   <em>\n    overall\n   </em>\n   sick leave usage at Atlas did not increase.\" Union Br. 54 (emphasis added). But that misses the point. The increased percentage of sick calls made at the last minute supports Atlas's theory that pilots were waiting to call in sick in order to disrupt scheduled flights. The Union also questions the timing of these changes. Of course, a change in behavior in October 2016 does not provide perfect support for Atlas's theory that pilots began\n   acting in this manner in February 2016 in response to this major dispute. But it is unrealistic to expect massive changes in behavior to occur right away, or all at once.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Air Lines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n Int'l\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    ALPA\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236040\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/257/#p260\">\n    563 F.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260, 264 (7th Cir. 2009) (affirming injunction for a \"job action that began in 2006 [and] escalated in 2008\"). The question, then, is whether Atlas has offered sufficient evidence connecting this statistically significant change to the Union's conduct, or whether the record suggests this occurred for another reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   That brings us to whether the Union participated in or called for this change in behavior. Of course, there is nothing inherently suspect about a union encouraging its members not to work sick. What\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   suspect is a union reminding its members not to work sick while acknowledging the legal consequences of calling for a sick out and continually emphasizing that strict contract compliance will provide negotiation leverage. Combined, this kind of evidence can fairly be interpreted as encouraging slowdown activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236040\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/257/#p260\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236040\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/257/#p260\">\n    at 272-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming district court's conclusion that statistical evidence, combined with coded directives \"to engage in job actions,\" like \"fly the contract,\" warranted a status quo injunction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Atlas offered several examples to support its claim that the Union's conduct went beyond merely reminding pilots not to work sick. The day the Union provided its section 6 notice, the host of a CBA Chat told viewers he had called in sick because of a high fever, then pulled a hot water bottle from under his shirt. The Chat closed with this reminder: \"It's your CBA. They signed it. You use it.\" J.A. 637. The Union was aware that expressly calling for a \"sick out\" would be \"unethical\" and might expose the Union to a large fine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 636 (describing $40 million fine levied against another airline union for encouraging a sick out). But it did encourage pilots to be \"all in,\" to SHOP, and to \"fly the CBA.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 631, 650; Pls.' Ex. 51 at 3, No. 17-cv-1953 (D.D.C. Nov. 30, 2017), Dkt. No. 5-54. The Union directly connected the CBA, these coded terms, and the sick calls when it \"commend[ed]\" pilots for their \"vigilance in holding up the provisions of our CBA\" and reminded them that, \"in the midst of [this] period of increased friction and hostility, ... make absolutely certain that you are fit for duty each and every time you report to work. Please, do not fly sick or fatigued. All In, Every Day.\" J.A. 774.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To be sure, Atlas's argument is not ironclad. It could not identify any specific example of an individual pilot who had abused the sick leave policy.\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    280 F. Supp. 3d at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fit between the Union's language and the pilots' conduct is not exact, as these communications relate to calling in sick, not calling in sick at the last minute. And, as the district court acknowledged, \"[s]tanding alone,\" the claim that the Union encouraged pilots not to fly sick \"might not carry the day.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the district court found that specific examples and \"more explicit language\" were not necessary because, when viewed in context, \"it is evident that at least some of the Union's exhortations were tied to the ongoing labor dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    at 90-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That was not reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   3. Open Time\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, we turn to overtime, known in this industry as \"open time.\" Airlines use open time when both the primary and reserve crew are unable to fly as scheduled. Filling an open time slot involves calling individual pilots in order of seniority until Atlas finds someone willing to work that flight. Unfilled open time creates cascading delays because the airline must move pilots from other flights to cover these shifts. At its worst, it may take\n   days to get back to the normal schedule. As such, although each pilot may choose whether to accept an available open time shift, Atlas relies on the assumption that most open time positions will be filled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The district court found that Atlas presented sufficient statistical evidence to support its claim that, since the Union served the section 6 notice, it has become more difficult to fill open time. In 2015, Atlas made an average of one-and-a-half calls to fill each open time assignment. J.A. 456 (Lee Decl.). In 2016, that number increased to over two calls per assignment, and in 2017, to over three.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 457. Still, more assignments remained unfilled. From January 2015 to February 2016, about 2.5% of all open time assignments were not filled, and unfilled assignments never exceeded 5% in a given month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 459. Between March 2016 and August 2017, around 10% of total assignments were unfilled.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In eleven of those eighteen months, the unfilled rate exceeded 5%; in three months, it exceeded 20%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As with sick leave, however, a statistically significant shift in open time did not occur immediately after the Union provided its section 6 notice in February 2016.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, although the overall trend demonstrates an increase in unfilled open time, the statistics are not consistent from one month to the next. Between November 2016 and March 2017, for instance, the percentage of unfilled open time fluctuated from 11% to 42%, 5%, 0%, and 23%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Union suggests that these changes resulted from a decrease in total open time and a decline in the desirability of those assignments. In support, the Union points to a purported 2015 policy change that required more pilots to \"deadhead\" on company aircraft to get to the location of their next assignment. Deadhead flights tend to be less direct, less comfortable, and less reliable than commercial flights. The Union also suggests that this change might have occurred because individual pilots chose to decline open time for personal reasons, such as a desire to spend more time with their families, or because they did not need the extra money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The district court rejected these alternative explanations as \"more supposition than evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    280 F. Supp. 3d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That was not clearly erroneous. The Union's expert, Mr. Akins, was unusually equivocal about these ideas, emphasizing that they were \"possible\" or \"may\" explain these changes in behavior. J.A. 252-53 (Akins Decl.). He acknowledged that it is \"counterintuitive\" to expect that \"the share of open trips uncovered would increase as open trips decreased.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 253. We agree. We would naturally expect that, if there are fewer opportunities to earn extra income, more pilots would be interested in them. Furthermore, the Union did not offer any evidence to support its claim that Atlas's deadheading policy had changed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 252 (Akins Decl. stating he was \"informed\" of the deadheading policy shift but not providing supporting evidence or affidavits). Given the questionable logic of the desirability theory and the dearth of evidence supporting the deadheading theory, the district court did not err in accepting Dr. Lee's reasoned analysis over Mr. Akins's unsupported speculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the district court did not reject\n   each theory of why an individual pilot might decline open time, the court adequately made clear that it credited Dr. Lee's conclusion that this change did not merely stem from a series of individual decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, the Union points to the temporal disconnect between the section 6 notice and the alleged change in behavior. As we said in our discussion of sick calls, large-scale behavioral changes do not always happen overnight.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   , Part III.A.2. That is especially true when it means forgoing an extra benefit, like overtime pay, so it was not erroneous for the district court to conclude that the \"precise temporal correspondence that the Union demands is neither required nor what one would reasonably expect to occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    280 F. Supp. 3d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, although the amount of unfilled open time was not consistent from month-to-month, statisticians typically compare figures year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. And the fact remains that, from 2015 to 2017, it took more phone calls to fill each open time slot, and more open time slots still went unfilled. Based on this, the district court did not improperly conclude that Atlas had carried its burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Atlas presented sufficient evidence demonstrating that the Union encouraged pilots to act in this manner. Although some of these communications concerned the practice of accepting open time out of seniority order in violation of the existing CBA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Union Br. 18-19, the vast majority did not. For example, when a pilot asked during a Crew Call whether \"picking up open time flying harm[s] ... [the Union's] ability to negotiate,\" Captain Kirchner explained that \"[e]verything you do when you cut a corner on the CBA, when you go the extra mile for [Atlas], that just solidifies and helps them in what they are trying to do to us ... and it prolongs the negotiation process.\" J.A. 721-22. He reminded pilots, \"You are all watching a huge amount of open time. ... [U]nfortunately some of our pilots are falling over backwards to help [Atlas] out of a jam .... Think what you do before you do it because you might be prolonging the agony\" of \"service failures, scheduling failures, etc.\" J.A. 735. The Executive Committee did explain that whether to fly open time is \"a personal decision,\" J.A. 736-38, and clarified that the Union could not \"reprimand\" pilots who accepted open time flights,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 713, or \"openly advocate [for] not picking up open time flying,\" Pls.' Ex. 113 at 10, No. 17-cv-1953 (D.D.C. Nov. 30, 2017), Dkt. No. 28-15. But the Union's preferences were clear: \"[I]f you don't fly open time, and that's a personal decision because you want to be with your family, and you don't want to help [Atlas] out, that's a great personal decision. ... [I]t's just time for people to do what's right for the group, but do it on a personal basis.\" J.A. 737. In light of this anecdotal and statistical evidence, the district court did not err in enjoining the Union from encouraging pilots to decline open time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Two final points warrant discussion. First, Atlas's September 2017 lawsuit was timely. RLA claims are subject to a six-month statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11152208,3676602\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/218/\">\n    232 F.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226 (D.C. Cir. 2000). If events in the six months leading up to the lawsuit are part of an ongoing slowdown campaign or would themselves constitute violations of the RLA's status quo requirement, however, the action is not time-barred.\n   <em>\n    ALPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236040\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/257/#p260\">\n    563 F.3d at 269-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ongoing slowdown);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Local Lodge No. 1424 v.

The statistical and anecdotal evidence that we have described sufficiently demonstrates that the Union was continuously violating the RLA in the six months before Atlas filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, the Union claims that the injunction is overbroad in violation of the First Amendment and NLGA section 109. The district court enjoined the Union, its \"officers, agents, employees, members employed by [Atlas], and all persons acting in concert with any of them ... from authorizing, encouraging, permitting, calling [for], engaging in, or continuing any strike, work stoppage, sick-out, concerted refusal to volunteer for or to accept work assignments (including, without limitation, open time flights), slowdown (including, without limitation, the existing SHOP and BOOT campaigns), or other self-help against [Atlas] relating to the dispute or disputes arising from the Section 6 notice.\" J.A. 156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Such language is common in these types of injunctions, and presents no problem here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ALPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236040\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/257/#p260\">\n    563 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   259-60 ;\n   <em>\n    Alton &amp; S.

Cir. 1995) (per curiam) (unpublished table decision). The Union protests that the district court erroneously enjoined lawful, protected individual and group activity. But the district court was only permitted to enjoin those \"specific act[s] ... expressly complained of in the [complaint]\" and about which it made explicit factual findings.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the complaint, language of the injunction, and the court's underlying findings reflect, this case is about whether the\n   <em>\n    Union\n   </em>\n   violated the RLA by encouraging pilots to jointly engage in actions designed to obtain leverage in the negotiations for an amended CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n    280 F. Supp. 3d at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The injunction does not restrict the rights of\n   <em>\n    individual pilots\n   </em>\n   whose actions are independent of the Union, nor does it impermissibly prohibit lawful self-help activities that would not run afoul of the RLA. For example, it does not prohibit a pilot's personal decision to refuse an open time assignment. Rather, the injunction applies only to \"persons acting in concert with\" the Union and its officers in their efforts to obtain leverage in negotiations for an amended CBA. J.A. 156;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (enjoining only the \"concerted refusal to volunteer for or accept work assignments\");\n   <em>\n    see Concerted\n   </em>\n   , NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY 352 (2d ed. 2002) (\"jointly arranged, planned, or carried out; coordinated\");\n   <em>\n    see also Concerted Action\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019) (\"An action that has been planned, arranged, and agreed on by parties acting together to further some scheme or cause, so that all involved are liable for the actions of one another.\").

While true, we detect no error. Courts resolving these type of cases do not typically make such express findings; instead, they compare statistics about challenged behaviors from before and after the relevant dividing time.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11123374\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/243/349/\">\n     243 F.3d at 354-55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 363 ;\n    <em>\n     Delta\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11148499\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1300/#p1307\">\n     238 F.3d at 1310-11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This approach makes perfect sense to us. As the Union conceded at argument, the status quo includes practices that have developed over time, as reflected by the manner in which the employer or employee actually acts. So if the district court finds-as it did here-that statistical evidence demonstrates that the employer or employee consistently acted in one manner for a given period of time, that can establish a pre-dispute \"status quo.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    On appeal, the Union gestures at two other arguments, both of which it forfeited. The idea that it is counterintuitive for pilots to decline premium pay to gain bargaining leverage was not adequately raised before the district court.\n    <em>\n     Haselwander v.
