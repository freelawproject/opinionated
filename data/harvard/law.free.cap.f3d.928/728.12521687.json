In August 2003, after Mendez-Gomez was convicted of making a false claim of United States citizenship in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20911\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an IJ issued a final order of removal. Mendez-Gomez was removed from the United States. He reentered the United States in late 2003, using a fraudulent lawful permanent resident card, or \"green card,\" to obtain entry through a checkpoint just inside the United States-Mexico border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2017, an Otter Tail County, Minnesota police deputy stopped Mendez-Gomez's vehicle for an equipment violation. When Mendez-Gomez produced only a Guatemalan passport as identification, the deputy requested immigration assistance. A Border Patrol agent telephoned the deputy and spoke to Mendez-Gomez, who admitted that he had entered the United States roughly 16 years prior and had no documents allowing him to legally remain in the country. Mendez-Gomez claimed he had never been arrested by immigration officials before, but he presented no documentation allowing him to enter or remain in the United States and was taken into immigration custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon entering Mendez-Gomez into the immigration database, Border Patrol agents discovered his prior order of removal. Mendez-Gomez then made a conclusory statement about legally entering the United States, refused to answer any more questions or sign any immigration documents, and requested to speak with his attorney. Subsequently, DHS filed a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate regarding Mendez-Gomez's prior removal order. Mendez-Gomez checked a box on that form indicating he wished to make a statement contesting the reinstatement, but there is nothing in the administrative record showing that he did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Mendez-Gomez indicated that he feared return to Guatemala, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services conducted a reasonable fear hearing. At this hearing, Mendez-Gomez testified that, in 2001, he borrowed money from a loan shark named Don Lucho to pay for his mother's lung surgery. Mendez-Gomez has not repaid the loan. Although he has never been attacked because of the unpaid debt, he testified that two armed men appeared at a soccer game in the summer of 2001 and asked whether members of his family were in attendance and that the men were looking for him because he had not repaid the loan. Mendez-Gomez believes that the men would have tortured or killed him for failing to pay the money back. He further believes that three of his cousins were murdered for being with him at the soccer field that day. Mendez-Gomez's father and other family members in Guatemala received telephone calls as late as 2016 threatening Mendez-Gomez's life due to the unpaid loan. Mendez-Gomez has never reported any of these incidents to the police because he is afraid they may be corrupt or subject to bribes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The asylum officer denied Mendez-Gomez's reasonable fear application. An IJ then vacated the asylum officer's determination and placed Mendez-Gomez into withholding-only proceedings for review of his applications for withholding of removal and CAT review. The IJ ultimately denied Mendez-Gomez's applications. The BIA upheld the IJ's decision, finding that Mendez-Gomez failed to present any argument that he had been improperly placed in reinstatement proceedings, failed to present\n   meaningful argument on his CAT claim, and failed to show the Guatemalan government was unable or unwilling to protect him. Mendez-Gomez now petitions this Court for review of the BIA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We first address Mendez-Gomez's claim that DHS violated his due process rights by improperly reinstating his prior removal order. \"For some time, the law has provided that an order for removing an alien present unlawfully may be reinstated if he leaves and unlawfully enters again.\"\n   <em>\n    Fernandez-Vargas v.

Thus, failure to raise an issue before the administrative agency precludes a petitioner from raising it on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escoto-Castillo v.

He contends that his reentry was lawful because a border agent at a second checkpoint 20 to 60 miles within the United States waved him through. However, Mendez-Gomez told immigration officials over the telephone at his initial detention that he was unlawfully present in the United States, admitted that he reentered the United States within four months of being deported, and never effectively contested the unlawful nature of his reentry during the reinstatement process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Furthermore, all the evidence Mendez-Gomez now relies on was not submitted until he entered withholding-only proceedings before the IJ. Withholding-only proceedings solely review an alien's applications for protection; they do not address whether DHS properly reinstated a prior removal order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(i). The decision to reinstate a prior removal order lies with DHS, and Mendez-Gomez failed to raise this issue to DHS before the agency reinstated his prior removal order. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the reinstatement of the prior removal order, as the issue was not exhausted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escoto-Castillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837596\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/864/#p866\">\n    658 F.3d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mendez-Gomez also contends that DHS violated his due process rights by continuing to interrogate him without his attorney present after he requested an attorney. \"[T]o succeed on a due process claim, an alien must prove that he was actually prejudiced by the lack of process afforded to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Briones-Sanchez v.

Because Mendez-Gomez concedes his identity and the existence of the prior removal order, he must show he lawfully reentered the United States to show prejudice. However, Mendez-Gomez cannot do so as a matter of law because he did not have the Attorney General's consent to reenter the United States within ten years of his removal, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9)(A)(ii)-(iii).
