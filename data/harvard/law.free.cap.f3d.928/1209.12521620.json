We exercise jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and affirm, albeit for reasons other than those stated by the district court, and remand with instructions to the district court to dismiss Mr. Williams' claims without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Believing that Utah state law requires UDOC to pay interest on prison accounts, Mr. Williams investigated the relationship between UDOC and Zions First National Bank (Zions Bank). Based on his investigation, he concluded that Zions Bank had a contract with UDOC to hold prisoner funds in an account administered by UDOC, and that the interest earned on the funds was illegally retained by the bank, when it should have been paid to the prisoners who owned the funds. Mr. Williams believed that, in response to this investigation, UDOC retaliated against him by, among other things, seizing his legal papers and giving him a negative parole report, which resulted in the denial of parole. He claimed that he was a model prisoner who was similarly situated to other prisoners who had been granted parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Williams, then proceeding pro se, filed suit pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against UDOC, numerous prison officials, Zions Bank, and several Zions Bank employees. He alleged takings and due-process constitutional violations for withholding interest on inmate funds, and retaliation in violation of the First Amendment for raising these issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the district court appointed counsel for Mr. Williams, all defendants filed motions to dismiss. The district court dismissed all claims except the retaliation claim, and dismissed all defendants except five prison officials. The remaining defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment on the retaliation claim, which the district court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their motion to dismiss, UDOC and the prison-official defendants (collectively, the UDOC Defendants) asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity, claiming that as an arm of the State of Utah, UDOC was immune from suit, and that the prison personnel were similarly immune from suit for claims against them in their official capacities. Mr. Williams presented no argument\n   regarding the Eleventh Amendment, and the district court did not address Eleventh Amendment immunity in any of its rulings. On appeal, the UDOC Defendants renew their argument that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Eleventh Amendment states, \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" U.S. Const. amend XI. The Eleventh Amendment bars suits in federal court against a nonconsenting state brought by the state's own citizens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edelman v. Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179827\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/651/#p662\">\n    415 U.S. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 662-63,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179827\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/651/#p662\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179827\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/651/#p662\">\n    39 L.Ed.2d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974). This immunity extends to arms of the state and to state officials who are sued for damages in their official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536387\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/1197/#p1205\">\n    707 F.3d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1205 (10th Cir. 2013). \"[O]nce effectively asserted[,] [Eleventh Amendment] immunity constitutes a bar to the exercise of federal subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Fent v. Okla. Water Res. Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170784\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/553/#p558\">\n    235 F.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558-59 (10th Cir. 2000) (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As noted above, the district court did not rule on the UDOC Defendants' motion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment immunity. In general, \"the better practice on issues raised below but not ruled on by the district court is to leave the matter to the district court in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    Rife v. Okla. Dep't of Pub. Safety\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277033\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/637/#p653\">\n    854 F.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653 (10th Cir. 2017) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted) (remanding issue to district court). But even though the district court did not rule on the Eleventh Amendment issue, it is a purely legal one that can be decided on the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manzanares v. Higdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034595\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1135/\">\n    575 F.3d 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1146 n.10 (10th Cir. 2009) (\"Although the district court did not reach this issue, it is a purely legal determination that was argued below and that we may decide on the record.\"). Moreover, we may consider Eleventh Amendment immunity sua sponte.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colby v. Herrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277980\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1273/#p1278\">\n    849 F.3d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1278 (10th Cir. 2017) (addressing whether state officials in their official capacities were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity even though the district court did not rule on the question). Therefore, we consider whether the UDOC Defendants are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and conclude that they are.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v. McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453321\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1173/#p1182\">\n    299 F.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1182 (10th Cir. 2002) (affirming dismissal of parties even though the district court did not address the ground for dismissal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the UDOC Defendants again invoke Eleventh Amendment immunity and seek dismissal of the complaint. Mr. Williams does not challenge UDOC's position that it is an arm of the State of Utah. Rather, he argues that Eleventh Amendment immunity does not bar his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Williams also does not pursue claims against the prison-official defendants in their personal capacities. His opening brief consistently refers to \"the Department,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Aplt. Opening Br. at 15, and in his reply brief, he confirms the term \"UDOC\" was \"shorthand that included all those defendants acting on UDOC's behalf,\" Aplt. Reply Br. at 2 n.1. To the extent he argues that his collective characterization of the defendants is sufficient to sustain any personal-capacity claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, his argument is insufficient. He has not explained which of the prison-official defendants are liable for what improper conduct.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robbins v. Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553315\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1242/#p1249\">\n    519 F.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1249-50 (10th Cir. 2008) (explaining that in \u00a7 1983 cases,\n   where the defendants are a \"government agency and a number of government actors sued in their individual capacities[,] ... the complaint [must] make clear exactly\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   is alleged to have done\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    whom\n   </em>\n   , to provide each individual with fair notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her, as distinguished from collective allegations against the state\"). Accordingly, we consider whether Eleventh Amendment immunity bars Mr. Williams' claims against the UDOC and the prison-official defendants only in their official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Williams argues that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to Fifth Amendment takings claims. He relies on\n   <em>\n    Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/\">\n    505 U.S. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), where the Supreme Court addressed a Fifth Amendment takings claim brought against the \"newly created South Carolina Coastal Council,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/\">\n    at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But in that case, the Court was not asked to rule on the Eleventh Amendment or whether the defendant-Council was an arm of the state. To the extent Mr. Williams relies on\n   <em>\n    Lucas\n   </em>\n   as permitting a Fifth Amendment takings claim against all governmental agencies, including UDOC, that reliance is misplaced.

Mr. Williams cites\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. Norwood\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-3189-JAR-DJW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204284971\">\n    2017 WL 4284971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D. Kan. Sept. 27, 2017), where a federal district court liberally construed the pro se complaint as seeking an order to enjoin a named prison official from an ongoing violation of his federal rights. In contrast, Mr.\n   Williams' complaint did not name any prison official to be enjoined from a future violation of his federal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Williams contends he brought a claim against Mr. Haddon for injunctive relief, independent of his claims against the UDOC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the complaint alleges only that Mr. Haddon was a member of a civil conspiracy that provided Mr. Williams with false and misleading information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aplt. App. at 33, 34, 35. Therefore, the record does not support a claim for injunctive relief against Mr. Haddon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, we address Mr. Williams' retaliation claim, which is the only remaining claim he raised on appeal. To the extent he seeks monetary damages, this claim is barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277980\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1273/#p1278\">\n    849 F.3d at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding Eleventh Amendment immunity bars official-capacity damages claims). Although his complaint requested that the \"retaliatory report\" be removed from his file, Aplt. App. at 45, which could be construed as seeking prospective relief, he makes no such appellate argument. Consequently, we do not address it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Talley v.

We affirm the judgment in favor of the UDOC Defendants on the retaliation claim and remand for the district court to indicate that the dismissal is without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We affirm the judgment, but remand with instructions to the district court to dismiss Mr. Williams' claims against the UDOC Defendants without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Mr. Williams also alleged various conspiracies to commit antitrust violations, to conceal wrongdoing, and to retaliate, but he has abandoned the conspiracy claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Mr. Williams also argues that defendant Haddon is not entitled to qualified immunity. \"The defense of qualified immunity is available only in suits against officials sued in their personal capacities, not in suits against officials sued in their official capacities.\"\n    <em>\n     Cox v.
