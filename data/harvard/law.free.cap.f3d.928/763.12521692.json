For the following reasons, this court again affirms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhances sentences for those who possess firearms after three convictions for a \"violent felony or a serious drug offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The district court sentenced Myers as an armed career criminal based on one prior serious drug conviction and two prior violent felonies under Arkansas law-first-degree terroristic threatening and second-degree battery. Myers appeals, arguing neither one is a violent felony. This court reviews de novo the determination that a conviction is a violent felony under the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Keith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199172\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/851/#p852\">\n    638 F.3d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 852 (8th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Myers maintains his Arkansas first-degree terroristic threatening conviction is not a violent felony under the ACCA. The parties agree Myers was convicted under Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a7 5-13-301(a)(1)(A). At the time of his conviction, it said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (a)(1) A person commits the offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (A) With the purpose of terrorizing another person, the person threatens to cause death or serious physical injury or substantial property damage to another person; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-13-301\">\n    Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-13-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) (1995). Myers argues this section is \"overbroad\" because it \"criminalizes the making of threats to cause 'substantial property damage' in addition to threats 'to cause death or serious physical injury,' \" and \"does not ... necessarily involve an element of physical force against the\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   of another.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A violent felony under the ACCA includes \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that-(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). To determine whether a prior conviction is a violent felony, courts apply a categorical approach, looking to the statute of conviction to determine whether that conviction necessarily has, as an element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Castleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706988\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/157/#p168\">\n    572 U.S. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706988,12579095\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1405/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706988,12579095\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1405/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). \"If there is a realistic probability that the statute encompasses conduct that does not involve use or threatened use of violent force, the statute sweeps more broadly than the ACCA's definition of violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518686\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/594/#p596\">\n    904 F.3d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 596 (8th Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \"[i]f the statute of conviction defines more than one crime by listing alternative elements,\" this court applies the \"modified categorical approach, to determine which of the alternatives was the offense of conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Winston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177827\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/876/#p877\">\n    845 F.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877 (8th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties disagree whether the categorical or modified categorical approach applies. This depends on whether A.C.A. \u00a7 5-13-301(a)(1)(A) lists alternative elements or means and is, therefore, divisible\n   or indivisible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

State\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court said that \"[a]s charged and instructed to the jury, the offense of first-degree terroristic threatening required the elements of threatening to cause the death of the victim and the purpose of terrorizing the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093918\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/389/10/\">\n    2012 Ark.

This shows that Arkansas law treats \"death or serious physical injury\" and \"substantial property damage\" as alternative elements, with the jury instructed on one or the other. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Mason v.
