H.R. Rep.

S. Rep. No. 108-166, at 3 (2003). In response to the increasing identity theft threat, the Congress enacted FACTA, which mandates (\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ): \"no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g)(1). Any person who willfully violates this truncation requirement-that is, anyone who willfully prints more than five digits or the expiration date on a receipt-is liable for \"any actual damages sustained by the consumer ... or damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000\" and for \"such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526102\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/525/#p527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Doris Jeffries made a purchase at a Centerplate location. Centerplate provided Jeffries with a receipt containing all sixteen digits of her credit card number, her credit card expiration date and her credit card provider. She immediately recognized that the receipt contained her personal information and held on to it for safekeeping. Jeffries then filed this class action lawsuit against Centerplate, alleging willful\n   violations of FACTA's truncation requirement. According to the complaint, Centerplate's conduct violated Jeffries' statutory right and, as a result, exposed her to an increased risk of identity theft. Because of Centerplate's conduct, Jeffries was also forced to take steps to safeguard the non-compliant receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Centerplate moved to dismiss the case for lack of standing.\n   <em>\n    Jeffries,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526102\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/525/#p527\">\n    319 F.

Thus, printing an expiration date on a receipt without more-although a technical violation of FACTA-does not create a risk of identity theft; accordingly, a plaintiff who has suffered this type of FACTA violation has been able to use his credit card without incurring an increased risk of identity theft-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , has not suffered a concrete injury in fact. That is why our sister circuits, applying\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , have unanimously concluded that a FACTA violation based solely on a failure to truncate an expiration date does not qualify as a concrete injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bassett v.

As explained\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , however, none of these courts encountered a FACTA violation as egregious as the one committed by Centerplate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although not every FACTA violation creates a concrete injury in fact, we conclude that the alleged violation of Jeffries' right does so. The Act requires the truncation of two categories of information at the point of sale: credit card digits and expiration date. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g)(1) (\"[N]o person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt.\"). Centerplate printed all of the information in both categories, creating the nightmare scenario FACTA was enacted to prevent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Remarks on Signing the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, 39 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1746, 1748 (Dec. 4, 2003) (\"Slips of paper that most people throw away should not hold the key to their savings and financial secrets.\"). Unlike a receipt containing only an expiration date, Jeffries' receipt bore sufficient information for a criminal to defraud her. At the point of sale-the time at which FACTA measures liability-there was no way to know whether Jeffries would recognize Centerplate's mistake and mitigate any harm\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   whether the receipt would end up in the trash for anyone to find or otherwise be accessed by a malevolent third party (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an employee or fellow customer). Accordingly, Jeffries was not able to use her credit card without incurring an increased risk of identity theft and, as a result, suffered a concrete injury in fact. She has pleaded enough facts to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Centerplate focuses much of its defense on the fact that Jeffries has not become a victim of identity theft because, through her own efforts, she has mitigated any risk of a third party accessing her credit card information. These facts, although true, are irrelevant. As noted earlier, FACTA itself does not prohibit the crime of identity theft; instead, it establishes a procedural requirement to ensure that consumers can use their credit and debit cards without incurring\n   <em>\n    an increased risk\n   </em>\n   of identity theft. Moreover, there was no guarantee at the point of sale that Jeffries would recognize and safeguard the non-compliant receipt. Just as someone who replaces the\n   pin in a grenade remains, nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    previously\n   </em>\n   at risk of getting blown up, Jeffries' effort to safeguard her receipt does not change the fact that she was prevented from using her credit card without at the same time facing exposure to increased identity theft risk. Because the receipt contained enough information to defraud Jeffries, she suffered an injury in fact at the point of sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Centerplate also contends that a decision in Jeffries' favor will create tension with the Third Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Kamal v. J. Crew Group\n   </em>\n   , which held that a plaintiff failed to establish standing when a merchant printed the first six digits of his credit card number on a receipt,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/#p114\">\n    918 F.3d at 116-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet the Third Circuit determined that a FACTA violation can support standing if the plaintiff faces a real or material risk of identity theft.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/#p114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/#p114\">\n    at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found no standing in that case because the plaintiff failed to allege that \"the receipt included enough information to likely enable identity theft.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/#p114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It expressly stated its \"analysis would be different if, for example, [the plaintiff] had alleged that the receipt included all sixteen digits of his credit card number, making the potential for fraud significantly less conjectural.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/#p114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the Third Circuit recognized its analysis would be different if it were presented with the facts Jeffries presents to us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/#p114\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, and on a separate score, Centerplate argues Jeffries' injury fails the imminence requirement of injury in fact because the risk of her suffering future identity theft is speculative.

To lower the risk of identity theft, Congress enacted FACTA, which imposes a duty on persons accepting credit or debit cards for the transaction of business not to \"print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of sale or transaction.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g)(1).

The vagueness of the \"close relationship\" test leaves ample room for a court to reach either conclusion and therefore does little to advance the standing analysis here.

Op. 1065-66;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muransky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520890,12520891\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1175/\">\n    922 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1189 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The named defendant is Volume Services America, LLC, which does business as Centerplate. The parties refer to the defendant as Centerplate and we follow suit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    There are other indirect harms attendant on a violation of FACTA's truncation requirement. The requirement relieves consumers of having to worry about the content of printed receipts and of having to safeguard or destroy receipts containing too much information. These additional harms, although not the focus of our inquiry, bolster Jeffries' assertion that FACTA protects a concrete interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    We are not necessarily in full agreement with the Third Circuit, which takes the position that FACTA protects an interest in avoiding actual identity theft, rather than\n    <em>\n     increased risk\n    </em>\n    of identity theft.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kamal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520372\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/102/#p114\">\n     918 F.3d at 115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]he FACTA provision at issue was part of Congress's effort to prevent the concrete harm of identity theft.\"). As noted earlier, we disagree with that determination because FACTA (1) does not prohibit identity theft, (2) imposes a truncation duty at the point of sale when identity theft cannot yet have occurred and (3) does not make liability contingent on a showing of actual harm.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 1064. The distinction between risk of identity theft and actual identity theft as the relevant interest makes a difference in the concreteness inquiry. Where we have looked to see whether the alleged statutory violation increased Jeffries' risk of identity theft, the Third Circuit analyzed how close the plaintiff came to suffering actual identity theft, a more onerous burden.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
