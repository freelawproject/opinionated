Petitioner also challenges the ballot titles for proposed initiatives 59, 60, 64, and 67 on the ground that each of the titles impermissibly resembles a previously filed ballot title. ORS 250.035(6).

Petitioner argues that the ballot titles are misleading and inaccurate and, therefore, fail to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2) to (5). After review, we are not persuaded by those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">ORS 250.035(2)(a) requires that the ballot title for a state initiative measure contain a \u201ccaption of not more than 10 words that reasonably identifies the subject matter\u201d of the proposed measure. The certified ballot titles for proposed initiatives 58, 59, 60, 64, and 67 each include a caption of not more than 10 words. Each caption \u201creasonably identifies\u201d the subject matter of its respective proposed initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c) require that the ballot title for a state initiative measure contain \u201csimple and understandable statements of not more than 15 words that describe the result if the state measure\u201d is approved and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>result if the measure is rejected. The result statements must be written, if possible, in such a way that the language of the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d statements is \u201cparallel.\u201d ORS 250.035(3); <em>Mannix v. Kulongoski, </em>323 Or 485, 494, 918 P2d 839 (1996). In addition, the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d statements must correspond, respectively, to affirmative and negative voter responses to the proposed measure. ORS 250.035(4) and (5). The certified ballot titles for proposed initiatives 58,59, 60,64, and 67 each contain \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d result statements of not more than 15 words, written so that the language of the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d statements for each measure is \u201cparallel,\u201d and so that the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d statements correspond, respectively, to affirmative and negative voter responses to each proposed initiative measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Finally, ORS 250.035(2)(d) requires that the ballot title for a state initiative measure include a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d The certified ballot titles for proposed initiatives 58, 59, 60, 64, and 67 contain such a summary of not more than 85 words, which provide an impartial statement of the major effect of the corresponding proposed initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the ballot titles certified by the Attorney General for the five proposed initiatives substantially comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2) to (5). ORS 250.085.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Petitioner also contends that, \u201c[b]ecause of the resemblance between Initiative Nos. 58, 59, 60, 64, and 67, any formally sufficient ballot titles for the measures necessarily will resemble the other ballot titles\u201d and that those titles therefore fail to comply with ORS <em>250.035(6). </em>ORS 250.035(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201cTo avoid confusion, a ballot title shall not resemble any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Petitioner asserts that ORS 250.035(6) \u201cprohibits outright the certification of any ballot title that \u2018resembles\u2019 any title previously filed for a measure\u201d and that, because of that prohibition, this court should decline to certify ballot titles for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>proposed initiatives 59, 60, 64, and 67, and order that the proposed initiatives not be circulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">In order to resolve the issues presented by petitioner\u2019s arguments under ORS 250.035(6), we must interpret that statute. The current wording of the statute was adopted by the legislature in 1995,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its interpretation is a matter of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In interpreting a statute, this court\u2019s task is to discern the intent of the legislature. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). The starting point for interpreting the statute is its text and context. <em>Id. </em>at 610-11. Words of common usage should be given their \u201cplain, natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611. Context includes earlier versions of the same statute. <em>Krieger v. Just, </em>319 Or 328, 336, 876 P2d 754 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The wording of ORS 250.035(6) indicates that any prohibition, unconditional or otherwise, is relevant only if a certified ballot title \u201cresembles\u201d any previously filed ballot title. ORS 250.035(6). \u201cResemble\u201d means \u201cto be like or similar,\u201d so as to suggest another or to give the appearance of another. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, </em>1930 (unabridged ed 1993). Also, by its terms, ORS 250.035(6) prohibits certification of only a <em>ballot title </em>that resembles a previously filed ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We reject petitioner\u2019s argument with regard to the certified ballot titles for proposed initiatives 60 and 67, because those certified ballot titles do not \u201cresemble\u201d each other, nor do they \u201cresemble\u201d the certified ballot title for proposed initiative 58. Because the certified ballot titles for proposed initiatives 60 and 67 resemble neither each other nor the certified ballot title for proposed initiative 58, the standard set by ORS 250.035(6) is not implicated with respect to those proposed initiatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The ballot titles for proposed initiatives 59, 64, and 67 all closely resemble each other. Indeed, the three ballot titles are nearly identical: all three captions are identical, the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d results statements are identical for each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>three proposed initiatives, and there are only minor differences between the summaries. We conclude that there is a strong resemblance among the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles for proposed initiatives 59, 64, and 67. Because of that resemblance, the court must decide whether, as petitioner contends, ORS 250.035(6) \u201cprohibits outright the certification of any ballot title that \u2018resembles\u2019 any title previously filed for a measure.\u201d That requires us to further interpret ORS 250.035(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The interpretative challenge with respect to ORS 250.035(6) lies in determining the meaning of the phrase \u201c[t]o avoid confusion.\u201d If the statute were written without that prefatory phrase, it would be clear that the legislature intended a complete ban on the certification of a ballot title that resembled any previously filed ballot title for a measure to be submitted at the same election. ORS 250.035(6). However, in interpreting a statute, this court should neither insert what has been omitted by the legislature nor omit what the legislature has inserted. <em>Michels v. Hodges, </em>326 Or 538, 544, 956 P2d 184 (1998); <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611 (citing ORS 174.010). The phrase \u201c[t]o avoid confusion\u201d could be interpreted as stating a legislative object or purpose. With that interpretation, the complete statutory text of ORS 250.035(6) would indicate that, in order to accomplish the legislative objective of avoiding confusion, the legislature has forbidden unconditionally the certification of any ballot title that resembles a previously certified title.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Alternatively, the phrase \u201c[t]o avoid confusion\u201d could be read as language of qualification, making conditional the ban on certification of a ballot title that resembles a previously filed ballot title. Under that interpretation, the statute would prohibit resemblance between or among ballot titles where such resemblance would cause voter confusion. The context of ORS. 250.035(6) supports the latter interpretation. <em>Former </em>ORS 250.035(2), the predecessor statute to ORS 250.035(6), expressed such a conditional prohibition on the certification of a ballot title that resembled a previously certified ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201cThe ballot title shall not resemble, <em>so far as probably to create confusion, </em>any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>Former </em>ORS 250.035(2) was clearly conditional, and this court interpreted it accordingly. In <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #13), </em>322 Or 15, 902 P2d 1143 (1995), this court determined that <em>former </em>ORS 250.035(2) allowed certification of two similar ballot titles if such certification did not create a risk of voter confusion (indeed, where proposed initiative measures are very similar or nearly identical, there may be a great risk of voter confusion created by the certification of <em>different </em>ballot titles). 322 Or at 46, 48, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In the construction of amendatory acts, such as the one under consideration here, it is presumed that material changes in the language of the statute create material changes in meaning. At the same time, it is presumed that such changes in meaning do not go further than is expressly declared or necessarily implied. <em>Fifth Avenue Corp. v. Washington Co., </em>282 Or 591, 597-98, 581 P2d 50 (1978). The legislature may have meant ORS 250.035(6) to materially change the meaning of the words in <em>former </em>ORS 250.035(2); however, because the wording of ORS 250.035(6) is ambiguous, it is not possible to determine from an examination of the text and context of the new statute either the nature or the extent of the intended change, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">When the intent of the legislature is not clear after an examination of the text and context of a statute, the court next considers the legislative history of the statute in order to inform the court\u2019s inquiry into legislative intent. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611-12. Unfortunately, there is no legislative history that sheds light on the legislature\u2019s intent regarding ORS 250.035(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Where no legislative history exists, this court will resort to general maxims of statutory construction, <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 612, including the maxim that where no legislative history exists the court will attempt to determine how the legislature would have intended the statute be applied, had it considered the issue. <em>Westwood Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Lane County, </em>318 Or 146, 158, 864 P2d 350 (1993) (citing PGE, 317 Or at 612), <em>adhered to as modified </em>318 Or 327, 866 P2d 463 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Were we to read ORS 250.035(6) as an unconditional ban on the certification of ballot titles that resemble each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>other, as petitioner urges us to do, we would have to conclude that the legislature intended to force this court to resolve a conflict between two irreconcilable results. On the one hand, certification by this court of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles for proposed initiatives 59,64, and 67 would meet the directive to certify accurate ballot titles for proposed initiatives, as required by ORS 250.085(5). On the other hand, that same act of certification would violate the supposed unconditional ban on the certification of a ballot title that resembles any previously filed ballot title for a proposed initiative to be submitted at the same election. There is no way to avoid the dilemma. Where the texts of two or more proposed initiative measures are very similar or nearly identical, no effort to eliminate the prohibited \u201cresemblance\u201d between accurate ballot titles through the use of synonyms and other linguistic devices can overcome the problem, because such efforts will simply produce \u201cresemblance\u201d in a slightly different form. The English language is flexible, but not so flexible as to permit the construction of truly different ballot titles that could at once both comply with ORS 250.085(5) and still avoid resemblance to the point that they also complied with ORS <em>250.085(6).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The correct analytical route for this court is to avoid the statutory interpretation that would produce irreconcilable conflict and, instead, to construe the statute according to the probable intention of the legislature, had it considered the issue. <em>Westwood Homeowners Assn., </em>318 Or at 158; <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 612. Had the legislature actually addressed this problem, in all likelihood it would have authorized this court to certify accurate ballot titles, such as those certified by the Attorney General for proposed initiative measures 59, 64, and 67, even if those ballot titles resembled an earlier certified ballot title. We thus conclude that interpreting ORS 250.035(6) as a conditional ban on the certification of a ballot title that resembles a previously filed ballot title is what the legislature would have intended. This interpretation does the least violence to the interests of the legislature and the voters, in that it tends to facilitate an honest, clear, and reasonably simple procedure for certifying an initiative petition ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>We hold that ORS 250.035(6) does not prohibit unconditionally all resemblance between or among ballot titles. Rather, the statute conditionally prohibits resemblance between or among ballot titles only where such resemblance would cause voter confusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, similar or identical ballot titles are appropriate when their similarities accurately reflect similarities between or among the measures under consideration. As this court held in <em>Rooney, </em>when proposed initiative measures are themselves very similar or nearly identical, there may be \u201ctoo great a risk\u201d of voter confusion created by the certification of <em>different </em>ballot titles. 322 Or at 46, 48, 51.

ORS 250.085(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The judicial review procedure in ORS 250.085 carries two clear consequences. First, if this court determines on review that the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title does not comply substantially with any of the requirements stated in ORS 250.035, including the requirement in subsection (6) that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ballot title shall not \u201cresemble\u201d another ballot title, the court is required to refuse to certify the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title. I refer to this process as the court\u2019s \u201creview\u201d function. Second, if this court declines to certify the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title, ORS 250.085(5) requires the court to draft and certify a ballot title that does comply substantially with ORS 250.035. I refer to this process as the court\u2019s \u201cdrafting\u201d function.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Petitioner argues that the Attorney General\u2019s ballot titles for initiatives 59, 64, and 67 \u201cresemble\u201d the ballot title approved for initiative 58, in violation of ORS 250.035(6), and urges the court, in carrying out its review function, to refuse to certify the Attorney General\u2019s ballot titles for those initiative measures because of that alleged defect. The Attorney General concedes that the ballot titles for initiatives 59, 64, and 67 do resemble the ballot title for initiative 58. It would be impossible to argue otherwise, because those ballot titles are virtual duplicates of each other. However, the Attorney General argues that the statute forbids certification of similar ballot titles if, but only if, the resulting duplication of ballot titles would cause voter confusion. Citing this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #13), </em>322 Or 15, 902 P2d 1143 (1995), the Attorney General claims that the certification of similar ballot titles here will reduce, not increase, the risk of voter confusion. Those competing arguments require the court to interpret ORS 250.035(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The majority concludes that the statutory text is ambiguous because the introductory phrase, \u201c[t]o avoid confusion,\u201d can be read plausibly either as a statement of purpose that does not qualify the balance of the sentence or as a statement of a condition that must be shown to exist before the balance of the sentence becomes operative. I do not agree that the text is ambiguous. A straightforward reading of the text indicates that the introductory phrase, \u201c[t]o avoid confusion,\u201d describes the purpose that the legislature had in mind in drafting the statute. That phrase in no sense qualifies the operation of the prohibition on the certification of ballot titles that resemble each other that is expressed in the balance of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>We cannot discern a statute\u2019s meaning by examining its text alone. The majority correctly acknowledges that we must examine the statutory text <em>in its context, </em>which includes prior versions of the same statute. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993); <em>Kreiger v. Just, </em>319 Or 328, 336, 876 P2d 754 (1994). The majority attempts to examine the prior version of ORS 250.035(6) but, as the following discussion indicates, its examination is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">ORS 250.035(6) was enacted in 1995. Or Laws 1995, ch 534, \u00a7 1. The statute in effect at the time of the amendment, ORS 250.035(2) (1993), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201cThe ballot title shall not resemble, so far as probably to create confusion, any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The former statute expressed a qualified prohibition. It forbade the certification of a ballot title that resembled another ballot title already on file if the later ballot title probably would cause confusion. It required the Attorney General, and this court on review, to determine the probability for confusion resulting from the use of similar ballot titles, and prohibited the use of similar ballot titles only if doing so probably would create confusion. <em>Rooney, </em>322 Or at 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The 1995 amendment enacted a new and substantively different policy choice. The majority commits an analytical error in refusing to acknowledge that different choice and in labeling the 1995 amendment as \u201cambiguous.\u201d The 1995 amendment unconditionally prohibits the certification of a ballot title that resembles another filed ballot title. When the legislature makes a substantive alteration in a statute, this court assumes that the legislature intends to effect a change in the existing statutory policy. <em>See Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 414-15 n 6, 939 P2d 608 (1997) (noting principle);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Fifth Avenue Corp. v. Washington Co., </em>282 Or 591, 597, 581 P2d 50 (1978) (in the construction of amendatory acts, the court assumes that \u201cmaterial changes in the language create material changes in meaning\u201d). The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>refers to that legal principle, but refuses, without explanation, to follow it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The majority also does not explain what is confusing about the legislature\u2019s introduction of the 1995 amendment with a phrase that indicates the legislature\u2019s purpose, \u201c[t]o avoid confusion.\u201d The words that follow that phrase express a clear rule prohibiting \u201cresemblance\u201d between ballot titles. Nothing in the text of the introductory phrase or its placement within the statute casts a doubt on the meaning of that statutory prohibition. Under the majority\u2019s approach, the legislature now must be concerned that combining a clear statutory requirement with a clear statement of legislative purpose will render the resulting statute \u201cambiguous.\u201d In my view, that approach imposes an unnecessary constraint on the legislative drafting process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The majority concludes that its comparison of ORS 250.035(6) with its statutory predecessor does not clarify the supposed ambiguity that arises from the phrase \u201c[t]o avoid confusion\u201d in the current statute. As a consequence, the majority proceeds to examine legislative histoiy. Finding no assistance there, the majority moves to a consideration of \u201cmaxims\u201d of statutory construction. At that stage, the court purports to speculate about how the legislature might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>dealt with the instant problem, had it addressed the question. For the following reasons, that analysis is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">A statute\u2019s context also includes other related statutes. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. However, the majority fails to consider another aspect of the statutory context of ORS 250.035(6), <em>i.e., </em>other statutes that relate to the same subject.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is legal error for the majority to fail to consider all the relevant statutes in deciding whether they can be read together with ORS 250.035(6) in order to create a workable, harmonious construction. In <em>Davis v. Wasco IED, </em>286 Or 261, 266-67, 593 P2d 1152 (1979), in quoting C. Dallas Sands, 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05, 56 (4th ed 1973), this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cA statute is passed as a whole and not in parts or sections and is animated by one general purpose and intent. Consequently, each part or section should be construed in connection with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole. Thus it is not proper to confine interpretation to the one section to be construed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">When it considers statutes in context, the court is obligated to \u201cutilize[ ] rules of construction that bear directly on the interpretation of the statutory provision in context.\u201d <em>PGE, </em>317 at 611. As noted in <em>PGE, </em>we derive those rules of construction from both statutes and case law. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">ORS 174.010 provides that \u201cwhere there are several provisions or particulars such construction is, <em>if possible, </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Case law also supplies several rules of construction of statutes in context that are relevant here. In <em>Fox v. Galloway, </em>174 Or 339, 347, 148 P2d 922 (1944), this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\"><em>\u201cIf </em>the language is plain and unambiguous, if it can be given but one meaning, and <em>that meaning does not lead to an impossibility or an absurdity such as the legislature could not be supposed to have intended, </em>the court must give effect to that meaning if constitutional, even though the result may be, in the court\u2019s opinion, harsh, unjust or mistaken in policy!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\"><em>\u201cWhen, however, a literal application of the language produces an absurd or unreasonable result, it is the duty of the court to construe the act, if possible, so that it is a reasonable and workable law and not inconsistent with the general policy of the legislature[.]\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">This court has relied repeatedly on that statement in <em>Fox </em>to reject proposed statutory constructions that, although supported by a literal reading of statutory text, produced unworkable results in actual application. <em>See Johnson v. Star Machinery Co., </em>270 Or 694, 704-09, 530 P2d 53 (1974) (court construed statute of repose governing \u201cnegligent injury\u201d to apply as well to a strict product liability claim); <em>State v. Irving, </em>268 Or 204, 206-07, 520 P2d 354 (1974) (court rejected a literal interpretation of a criminal procedural statute because it produced a \u201cpatently unreasonable result\u201d); <em>Beck v. Aichele, </em>258 Or 245, 249, 482 P2d 184 (1971) (court rejected a proposed statutory construction that would create a monopoly because, \u201c[i]n light of our everyday knowledge and common sense, this interpretation is absurd\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Another relevant rule of construction of statutes in context appears in <em>Wright v. Blue Mt. Hospital Dist., </em>214 Or 141, 147, 328 P2d 314 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201c[It is a] well-established rule of statutory construction that when one construction will make a statute void for conflict with the constitution, and another will render it valid, the latter will be adopted though the former at first view is otherwise the more natural interpretation of the language.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>I turn next to the relevant contextual statutes. ORS 250.065(3) and ORS 250.067(2) require the Attorney General to prepare and certify a ballot title. ORS 250.035(2) states some of the requirements for a ballot title. The \u201ccaption\u201d must reasonably identify a measure\u2019s subject matter within 10 words. ORS 250.035(2)(a). The \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements must convey a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure\u201d is approved or rejected. ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c). The Attorney General must draft the result statements \u201cso that, to the extent practical, the language of the two statements is parallel,\u201d ORS 250.035(3), and so that an affirmative or negative response to the statements corresponds to an affirmative or negative vote, respectively, on the state measure. ORS 250.035(4) and (5). The prohibition on \u201cresemblance\u201d between ballot titles in ORS 250.035(6) concludes the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The Attorney General contends that, on occasion, the limitations of the English language will prevent compliance with all those statutory requirements. I agree. As this case illustrates, the English language furnishes insufficient vocabulary, grammar, and other means of expression to: (1) construct ballot titles for the closely related initiatives 59, 64, and 67 that comply with ORS 250.035(2) to (5); and, at the same time, (2) eliminate all resemblance between those ballot titles and the ballot title already certified for initiative 58. Compliance with all those statutory requirements in a case such as this is, in a word, impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In determining the legislature\u2019s intention in enacting statutes governing the certification of ballot titles, we must bear in mind one irreducible minimum requirement: the drafting process must take place within the context of the English language. The legislature did not intend to require the Attorney General, in carrying out his ballot title drafting function, to comply literally with ORS 250.035(6) if it is not possible to do so because of the limitations of the English language. Neither did the legislature intend to compel this court, in carrying out its review and drafting functions, to carry out such an impossible task. Such a construction of the statute would produce an impractical, unintended result.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Moreover, a literal application of ORS 250.035(6) would mire the court even deeper in the work of the Legislative or Executive Branches. <em>See Rooney, </em>322 Or at 55 (Unis, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that the requirement in ORS 250.085(5), that the court must draft and certify a ballot title that complies with statutory standards, violates the principle of separation of powers embodied in Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When the court construes statutes in context and selects between alternative constructions of an uncertain text, it is compelled to choose the interpretation that avoids serious constitutional difficulty. <em>Tharalson v. State Dept. of Rev., </em>281 Or 9, 13, 573 P2d 298 (1978). That duty requires the court to reject an interpretation of ORS 250.035(6) that would create or exacerbate a separation of powers problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The real question here is what to do about the conflict between the requirements in ORS 250.035(2) to (5) and the impossibility of literal compliance, at least in some cases, with the rule against \u201cresemblance\u201d stated in ORS 250.035(6). The answer is complicated by the fact that subsection (6) was adopted <em>after </em>the other requirements listed in ORS 250.035(2) to (5). The majority does not consider the effect of that fact. Ordinarily, if the legislature enacts a statutory requirement that conflicts with another earlier-enacted statutory requirement, and the conflict is irreconcilable, the earlier statute must yield to the later statute. <em>State ex rel Huddleston v. Sawyer, </em>324 Or 597, 604-05, 932 P2d 1145 (1997) (repeal by implication is applicable if the repugnancy is plain, unavoidable and irreconcilable); <em>State v. Shumway, </em>291 Or 153, 160, 630 P2d 796 (1981). I conclude that that rule plays no role here because, even under a strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>application of OKS 250.035(6), the preparation of multiple ballot titles that bear no resemblance to each other would not be possible in all cases. The repeal by implication of the ballot title requirements described in ORS 250.035(2) to (5) would undermine, not support, the express purpose behind ORS 250.035(6), \u201c[t]o avoid confusion.\u201d As the discussion below indicates, we can avoid those unreasonable outcomes, and reconcile the apparent conflict in the statutes, by treating the drafting requirement stated in ORS 250.035(6) as being subject to the linguistic limitations of the English language in which every ballot title must appear. Thus, the rule expressed in <em>Shumway </em>is not applicable here, because the conflict between the requirements set forth in ORS 250.035(2) to (6) is not irreconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument suggests that the difficulty in ehminating resemblance between ballot titles arises, not in every ballot title case, but only in those cases in which compliance with ORS 250.035(6) is impossible because of the limitations of the English language. I agree. Accordingly, in order to produce a practical and common sense result, I would recognize that, in the context of similar ballot measures, the legislature intended ORS 250.035(6) to permit only that limited degree of resemblance between multiple ballot titles as is necessary to permit the Attorney General to publish ballot titles in understandable English.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In my view, this court\u2019s task in this case is to recognize that a literal application of ORS 250.035(6) would produce an absurd outcome and, following the ordinary rules that apply to the'interpretation of statutes in context, to construe that statute and other related statutes together to produce a harmonious, workable result. The problem with ORS 250.035(6) arises not from any ambiguity in its text, as the majority erroneously believes, but from the impracticality of literal compliance with its command. In responding to that interpretive problem, this court must adopt a statutory construction that is both functional and, to the extent possible, faithful to the legislature\u2019s goal of prohibiting \u201cresemblance\u201d between ballot titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">My reading of ORS 250.035(6) correctly interprets that statute in context by giving maximum effect to all relevant statutes, and by avoiding the impossible, absurd and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>unworkable result that would flow from a literal application of the text of ORS 250.035(6). That approach keeps faith with ORS 174.010 and the rules of contextual construction described in <em>Davis </em>and Fox. Finally, my approach avoids any arguable interference with a citizen\u2019s right to initiate legislation that might result from declining to certify a ballot title in the name of avoiding resemblance with another ballot title certified at an earlier date.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The analytical approach of this opinion and that of the majority can lead to very different substantive outcomes. Under the majority\u2019s approach, the focus of analysis is the supposed ambiguity of the phrase \u201c[t]o avoid confusion.\u201d The majority\u2019s construction permits the Attorney General to escape the responsibility to comply with ORS 250.035(6) by demonstrating merely that the underlying initiative <em>measures </em>are similar. That view permits the Attorney General to certify identical ballot titles for several measures to be considered at the same election. The majority fails to acknowledge that <em>the legislature drafted ORS 250.035(6) to eliminate the evil that arises from voter confusion due to the certification of ballot titles that closely resemble each other. </em>That is, if several measures bear the same or similar ballot titles, voters will have no practical way to distinguish between them. The majority adopts a statutory construction that seems to ignore the very sort of voter confusion that ORS 250.035(6) was intended to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">I join in the certification of the Attorney General\u2019s ballot titles for initiatives 59, 64, and 67, because I am persuaded that the Attorney General cannot prepare more distinctive ballot titles for those measures, given the limitations of the English language that govern that task. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the use of similar ballot titles here will not cause voter confusion. Indeed, unless and until the legislature revisits the problems created by ORS 250.035(6), voter confusion from the use of nearly identical ballot titles likely will be the order of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Until the legislature reconsiders ORS 250.035(6), the voting public will have to depend on the Attorney General to prepare distinctive ballot titles that will permit the voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>to distinguish between similar measures. In my view, the legislature has broad power to protect the voting public from confusion of that sort, and it should not hesitate to use it. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 l(4)(b) <em>(\u201cInitiative </em>and referendum measures shall be submitted to the people as provided in this section and by law not inconsistent therewith.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-9\"> This concurring opinion comments on the majority\u2019s analysis of the \u201cresemblance\u201d problems posed by the Attorney General\u2019s ballot titles for initiatives 59,64, and 67.1 join fully in the court\u2019s reasoning in certifying the Attorney General\u2019s ballot titles for initiatives 58 and 60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\"> I raise, but do not attempt to resolve, the question of what the term \u201cconfusion\u201d means in this context. The answer is not clear. The certification of markedly different ballot titles for multiple, nearly identical ballot measures has the potential for causing voter confusion by suggesting that the measures are very different when, in fact, they are not. This court noted that potential for voter confusion in <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #13), </em>322 Or 15, 902 P2d 1143 (1995). However, the certification of multiple ballot titles that closely resemble each other carries at least an equal potential for voter confusion because that practice deprives the voters of their only practical means for discriminating between multiple, similar ballot measures. <em>Rooney </em>did not address that potential source of voter confusion. ORS 250.035(6) focuses on the risk of voter confusion resulting from the use of similar ballot titles, not different ones, but the majority sidesteps that focus in interpreting that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">A separate question concerns <em>whose </em>potential confusion is at stake. It is easy to conclude that the legislature was concerned about the potential confusion of voters. However, in drafting ORS 250.035(6), the legislature also may have endeavored to protect the distinct interests of petition signers, petition circulators, parties who seek to challenge ballot titles, and election officials in avoiding \u201cconfusion\u201d in contexts other than simply voting on a ballot measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Finally, the meaning of the term \u201cresemble\u201d in this context is far from clear. Like beauty, it is a quality that may exist only in the eye of the beholder. Because that term calls for what can only be fairly described as a subjective determination, it invites litigation and inevitably will produce the attendant negative consequences of delay in the initiative process and an increased workload for the Department of Justice and this court. This court need not resolve what \u201cresemble\u201d means in this case, because the parties agree that the ballot titles for initiatives 59, 64, and 67 resemble the ballot title filed for initiative 58 within the meaning of ORS 250.035(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\"> In contrast with the amendment at issue in Jones, the 1995 amendment to ORS 250.035(6) materially altered the policy set forth in its statutory predecessor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\"> To be accurate, \u201cprinciples,\" \u201crules,\u201d and \u201cmaxims\u201d of statutory interpretation are not law unless enacted. Those terms describe a host of common sense approaches used by judges to discover a statute\u2019s true meaning in the face of textual ambiguity, inconsistency and contradiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cEach of these common sense approaches fits some cases but not others, each has \u2018exceptions\u2019 and opposite-and-equal counterparts, and each causes more harm than it is worth if it is not cheerfully ignored whenever it is an obstacle to understanding what the legislature enacted.\u201d <em>Davis v. Wasco IED, </em>286 Or 261, 274, 593 P2d 1152 (1979) (Linde, J., concurring) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The mistaken tendency of some judges and lawyers to treat those aids to interpretation as enacted law is due in part to this court\u2019s announcement in 1993 in <em>PGE </em>that it would follow a template for statutory interpretation. But for this court\u2019s announced preference for a methodological approach to interpreting statutes, I would avoid citing interpretive aids in opinions as if they are binding law. They are not. Professor Sinclair makes a similar helpful observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\u2018TWle [should notl expect a general theory of statutory interpretation to be very detailed. The principle of legislative supremacy * * * requires top-down, Euclidean reasoning, and with it, a resort to legislative intent where necessary for the application of underdeterminate statutes. Within that boundary, we should not expect\u2014and nor do we find\u2014strict limitations on method.\u201d M.B.W. Sinclair, <em>Statutory </em>Reasoning, 46 Drake L Rev 299, 382 (1997).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> This court often refers to <em>PGE </em>as a statement of its <em>template </em>for statutory interpretation. <em>Sea-Air Handling Services, Inc. v. Reed, </em>327 Or 25, 30, 956 P2d 953 (1998); <em>Pollin v. Dept. of Rev., </em>326 Or 427, 431, 952 P2d 537 (1998); <em>Foltz v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>326 Or 294, 299, 952 P2d 1012 (1998). That term suggests that this court believes that the methodical application of a system of well considered rules, in the context of statutory construction, is a worthy objective. I fully agree. However, by citing and then disregarding the analysis called for by <em>PGE, </em>the majority tends to defeat the predictability of both the <em>PGE </em>methodology and our statutory interpretations, and lends supporting evidence to the frank but all-too-true empirical observation of Professors Hart and Sacks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">\u201cDo not expect anybody\u2019s theory of statutory interpretation, whether it is your own or somebody else\u2019s, to be an accurate statement of what courts actually do with statutes. The hard truth of the matter is that American courts have no intelligible, generally accepted, and consistently applied theory of statutory interpretation.\u201d Henry M. Hart, Jr. and Albert M. Sacks, <em>The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law, </em>1169 (William N. Eskridge, Jr. &amp; Phillip P. Frickey eds., 2d ed 1994).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b281-5\"> In my view, the separation of powers problem arises not from the requirement that the court must <em>review </em>the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title, but from the requirement that, if the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title is insufficient, the court must <em>draft a new ballot title </em>that satisfies statutory requirements and certify it to the Secretary of State. ORS 250.085(5). Parties that desire to assert that that requirement is unlawful and that the court must confine itself to the permissible work of the Judicial Branch must raise that argument in a brief to this court and, perhaps, in comments to the Secretary of State regarding the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(6) (on review of a ballot title, the court is precluded from considering arguments not raised in comments to the Secretary of State regarding the draft ballot title).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
