For reasons that follow, we decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The plaintiff, Geoffrey Towle, brings this appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s <em>{Gray, </em>J.) order granting a motion for summary judgment for the defendants, Matthew and Nancy Kiman. In his writ, the plaintiff sought recovery from the defendants for injuries that he suffered when he was assaulted by the defendants\u2019 minor child, Kenneth Kiman. Subsequently, the defendants filed an amended motion for summary judgment, in which they argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s writ failed to allege a basis for recovery recognized in New Hampshire. The trial court agreed, ruling that \u201c[ajbsent clear adoption of [a negligent supervision] theory by our Supreme Court or the enactment of legislation specifically allowing such recovery, this court declines to adopt such a theory of liability <em>especially on the facts of the instant case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">When, as here, the trial court grants a motion for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiff has failed, in his pleadings, to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we will review the court\u2019s order as the functional equivalent of an order granting a motion to dismiss. <em>See, e.g., </em>10 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M.K. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2713, at 594 (1983) (Under federal system \u201csummary judgment motion ... made on the basis of the pleadings alone ... is ... functionally ... the same as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim....\u201d). Accordingly, we review the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings to determine whether they constitute a basis for legal relief. <em>Collectramatic, Inc. v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., </em>127 N.H. 318, 320, 499 A.2d 999, 1000 (1985). In doing so, we assume the allegations to be true and construe all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">According to the plaintiff, in the early morning of September 26, 1986, he suffered \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as a result of an assault by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Kenneth Kiman. He claims that Kenneth had \u201ca history of and propensity toward violent activity\u201d and that, at the time of the assault, Kenneth had recently been released from confinement under \u201cCourt Ordered Conditions of Release.\u201d He further alleges that, as the parents of Kenneth, the defendants had custody and control over him, which gave rise to a duty to \u201cmonitor,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d \u201csupervise,\u201d and \u201cprotect the public from [Kenneth\u2019s] acts.\u201d According to the plaintiff, the defendants breached this duty when they \u201callow[ed] Kenneth ... to be out of the home and in places and whereabouts unknown to them when they knew or should have known of [his] propensity... to cause harm,\u201d and as a result of this breach, the plaintiff was injured. It is undisputed that the assault took place several miles from the defendants\u2019 home and that, at that time, Kenneth was seventeen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In <em>Clark v. McKerley, </em>126 N.H. 778, 497 A.2d 846 (1985), we recognized that an action for negligent supervision may exist, but explicitly refused to adopt it in light of an alternative basis for resolving the case. <em>Id. </em>at 780, 497 A.2d at 847. We note that other jurisdictions have applied a variety of standards, in a variety of factual contexts, in finding parents liable for the negligent supervision of their children. <em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Parents\u2019 Liability for Injury or Damage Intentionally Inflicted by Minor Child, </em>54 A.L.R.3d 974 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\"> After careful consideration of the factual allegations made in this case, we conclude that under any of these standards the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings fall short. \u201cSo far as there is one central idea [underlying principles of tort recovery],... it is that liability must be based upon conduct which is socially unreasonable.\u201d PROSSER and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 1, at 6 (5th ed. 1984). Based on the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, and because of the inescapable policy considerations involved in adopting a heretofore unrecognized right of recovery, <em>see </em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 3, we cannot say that the plaintiff has alleged conduct by the defendants that New Hampshire law recognizes as socially unreasonable. Thus, on the facts alleged by this plaintiff, we will not adopt the tort of negligent supervision at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
