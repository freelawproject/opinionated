(the company), appeals the decision of the appellate board of the department of employment security (DES) to reverse a DES appeal tribunal\u2019s denial of a company employee\u2019s claim for unemployment compensation benefits. The issue before us is whether the appellate board (the board) exceeded its jurisdiction, under RSA 282-A:65 (Supp. 1990), in reversing the appeal tribunal\u2019s (the tribunal) finding that the claimant voluntarily left her work without good cause attributable to her employer. <em>See </em>RSA 282-A:32, 1(a); N.H. Admin. Rules, Emp 503.01. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The claimant worked for the company from August 16,1988, until September 14, 1989. After she left that job, she applied for unemployment benefits, alleging that the company\u2019s president had sexually harassed her. Specifically, she alleged that, from June until August 1989, he had on various occasions put his hands inside the sleeves of her short-sleeved sweater, put his hands up as if to grab her breasts, grabbed at the buttons inside the pocket of her skirt, rubbed her shoulders and back, and told her \u201chow sexy\u201d she looked. She alleged that when she protested some of these actions, he asked her, \u201cDo you like your job, Elizabeth?\u201d and, \u201cWhat are you going to do Elizabeth, quit on me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">After interviewing the company\u2019s president, the DES certifying officer concluded that the claimant had left work for good cause attributable to her employer, and granted her unemployment benefits. The company appealed this decision to the tribunal for <em>de novo </em>review, and an evidentiary hearing was held. Appearing before the tribunal were the company\u2019s president, his wife, his son, and three company supervisors. The claimant also testified. The president denied the claimant\u2019s allegations of unprofessional physical contact, but admitted that he told her once, \u201cYou look real sexy today, Lizzie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>babe,\u201d and \u201cprobably\u201d said (in his belief) jokingly, \u201cDo you like your job, Elizabeth?\u201d or \u201cWhat are you going to do, Elizabeth, quit?\u201d In addition, an employee of the company testified that the president had once \u201cput up his hands as if to grab [the claimant\u2019s] breasts and said to her, hey Lizzie babe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The claimant re-asserted her allegations at the hearing as to sexual contact and the president\u2019s statement to her, and confirmed the incident testified to by the employee. Although she agreed with the other witnesses that non-sexual contact was common among most of the company\u2019s principals and workers, she maintained that the president\u2019s actions were sexual in nature, and harassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The president\u2019s son, who is one of the company\u2019s principals and was the claimant\u2019s supervisor, testified that she eventually complained to him about his father\u2019s conduct. The son then told his father about the claimant\u2019s accusation on September 5, 1989, and as a result the company\u2019s five principals decided to \u201ckeep hands off Elizabeth.\u201d The next day, the president and another principal met with the claimant. The president testified that \u201cshe said something to the effect, you won\u2019t put your hands in my pockets anymore, or something like that. And I said, Elizabeth, if I\u2019ve offended you in any way, I apologize.\u201d At the hearing the president denied ever putting his hands in the claimant\u2019s pockets and explained his apology as a \u201cgeneral\u201d one \u201cfor any offense that I might have done to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The claimant testified that from the date of this meeting until the time she left, eight days later, the president did not touch her, but rather avoided her. The president confirmed this. In addition, the claimant testified that after the meeting she failed to receive the assistance from a principal that she needed to complete a project, and that another principal continually interrupted her to inquire when the project would be completed. She found the work environment, at this time, \u201cextremely unnerving,\u201d and she then voluntarily left the employment of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The tribunal ruled against the claimant, finding that \u201csubstantially all of the testimony obtained in the hearing by witnesses appearing at the request of the claimant contradicted the claimant\u2019s testimony on matters of the president\u2019s <em>physical acts </em>with the claimant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) No finding was made as to the claimant\u2019s allegations of verbal sexual harassment. Although the tribunal found the claimant\u2019s description of her last days of work credible, it found that \u201cthe final actions that claimant attests caused her to leave her job were not of sufficient magnitude to warrant the actions the claimant took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>in voluntarily leaving her work in so far as she could then expect to be found eligible for the receipt of unemployment benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The claimant appealed the tribunal\u2019s decision to the board, and won \u00e1 reversal. The board stated in its decision that \u201c[t]he facts in this case do not support the findings of the Appeal Tribunal Chairman,\u201d because \u201c[t]he testimony of [the claimant] as contained in the record and corroborated by other witnesses establishes clear violation of both state and federal law regarding unprivileged contact and sexual harassment.\u201d The company then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The relevant statutes and regulation are as follows. RSA 282-A:32, 1(a) reads: \u201cAn individual shall be disqualified for benefits [if] he <em>left his work voluntarily without good cause </em>in accordance with rules of the commissioner.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The applicable DES rule states, in pertinent part: \u201cAn individual shall be considered to have left his work voluntarily without good cause if of his own choice or volition he terminates the employee-employer relationship for a reason which is not attributable to the employer.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Emp 503.01. Finally, RSA 282-A.-65 (Supp. 1990) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201cThe appellate board shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner or appeal tribunal as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, or as to the prudence or desirability of the determination. The appellate board shall reverse or modify the decision or remand the case for further proceedings only if the substantial rights of the appellant had been prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions, or the decision is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">III. Affected by reversible error of law . .. .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">On appeal, the company argues that the board exceeded its authority by \u201csubstitut[ing] its judgment for that of the ... tribunal as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\u201d Moreover, the company maintains that the facts found by the tribunal support its conclusion that the claimant left her work without good cause attributable to her employer. However, we agree with the claimant and the board that the tribunal\u2019s decision was \u201c[a]ffected by reversible error of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">In <em>Appeal of City of Franklin, </em>125 N.H. 761, 485 A.2d 295 (1984), we articulated the applicable review standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">\u201cThe question on appeal is whether the claimant\u2019s voluntary termination was for a cause attributable to the employer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Our review is confined to the record, and we cannot substitute our judgment as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact for that of the appeal tribunal. However, we will reverse the appeal tribunal where its conclusions are affected by an error of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 762-63, 485 A.2d at 296-97 (citations omitted). For a voluntary termination to be considered \u201cattributable to the employer,\u201d N.H. ADMIN. Rules, Emp 503.01, it must, at the very least, have \u201csome connection with or relation to the employment,\u201d <em>Nashua Corp. v. Brown, </em>99 N.H. 205, 207, 108 A.2d 52, 54 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The company argues that the \u201csome connection with or relation to the employment\u201d standard is vague, and tends to unduly favor claimants. As a further refinement, the company urges us to adopt the test set forth in <em>Jensen v. Siemsen, </em>794 P.2d 271 (Idaho 1990): \u201cwhether a reasonable person would consider the circumstances resulting in a claimant\u2019s unemployment to be real, substantial and compelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. We agree that the standard employed in <em>Nashua Corp. v. Brown </em>is by itself insufficient, but we have already adopted a \u201creasonableness\u201d test to evaluate unemployment claims. In <em>Appeal of City of Franklin, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">\u201cA claimant is not required to exhaust every available remedy within the employer\u2019s organization before voluntarily terminating the employment on account of the employer. A claimant need only have acted reasonably under the circumstances of the employment. <em>Therrien v. Maine Employment Sec. Com\u2019n, </em>370 A.2d 1385, 1389 (Me. 1977) (employee\u2019s beliefs and behavior as justifying good cause in voluntary quit must be measured by reasonableness under all the circumstances).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\"><em>Appeal of City of Franklin, supra </em>at 764-65, 485 A.2d at 298. For clarity, we restate the appropriate analysis as follows: (1) the reason for the employee\u2019s termination must have some connection with or relation to his or her employment; and (2) the employee\u2019s decision to terminate must have been reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Turning to the case before us, our task is to determine \u201cwhether as a matter of law there was any evidence presented to the Appeal Tribunal upon which [it] could reasonably have decided as [it] did.\u201d <em>Hewett v. Riley, </em>94 N.H. 460, 461, 55 A.2d 470, 471 (1947); see <em>also </em>RSA 282-A:67, V(d) (Supp. 1990) (this court shall reverse deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>sion of tribunal only if it is \u201c[c]learly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record\u201d). Where the testimony of the claimant and the employer is contradictory, we must accept the tribunal\u2019s decision as to whom to believe. However, where a claimant\u2019s testimony not only is uncontradicted, but is admitted to and acknowledged by the employer\u2019s president, as in this case, the tribunal may not reject such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">At the hearing before the tribunal, the president admitted telling the claimant, \u201cYou look real sexy today, Lizzie babe.\u201d The president also acknowledged that he \u201cprobably\u201d asked the claimant, \u201cDo you like your job, Elizabeth?\u201d and, \u201cWhat are you going to do Elizabeth, quit?\u201d There is no question that the record reveals that the claimant complained about the president\u2019s verbal statements to her of a sexual nature. She testified that on one occasion she stated, \u201c[Pjlease don\u2019t say that, don\u2019t make remarks like that, cut that out.\u201d The president testified that on one occasion, after he had given her a verbal \u201cshot,\u201d she protested, \u201ccut it out in a yell type of voice ... it was a protest in my estimation of a high decibel.\u201d Admissions by the company president of verbal communications of a sexual nature, followed by protests from the claimant, and taunts by the president concerning her job, cannot be simply ignored by the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Applying the two-part test set forth above, we hold first that the claimant left the company for a reason which was work-connected. <em>See Appeal of City of Franklin, </em>125 N.H. at 765, 485 A.2d at 298. The tribunal found that she quit because of the way the company president and her supervisors treated her. Therefore, the claimant\u2019s termination had \u201csome connection with or relation to the employment,\u201d <em>Nashua Corp. v. Brown, </em>99 N.H. at 207, 108 A.2d at 54, and was not the result of outside factors, <em>see id. </em>(married employee\u2019s voluntary termination of employment to join spouse in another State is not termination attributable to employer); <em>Putnam v. Dept. of Employment Security, </em>103 N.H. 495, 497-98, 175 A.2d 519, 520-21 (1961) (employee\u2019s loss of available transportation to work, where employer was under no obligation to provide transportation, is not termination attributable to employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Second, we hold that the claimant\u2019s decision to terminate was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Appeal of City of Franklin, </em>125 N.H. at 764-65, 485 A.2d at 298. The uncontroverted testimony was that the company\u2019s principals treated the claimant in a different manner after she complained to the president\u2019s son about his father\u2019s sexual harassment. One supervisor became uncooperative, and another harassed her regarding a work project. This sud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>den change in the principals\u2019 behavior clearly created a hostile work environment for the claimant. We find that the company created a working environment hostile enough to compel a reasonably prudent woman to terminate her employment. <em>See Appeal of City of Franklin, </em>125 N.H. at 764-65, 485 A.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In reviewing the decision of the tribunal, there were good and sufficient reasons for the claimant to terminate her employment. Accordingly, we hold that, as a matter of law, the claimant\u2019s termination of employment was for a cause attributable to her employer, and that the DES board correctly overturned the tribunal\u2019s denial of unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\n<em>Decision of appellate board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b639-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
