J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARk\">In this declaratory judgment action, the defendant, Horace Mann Insurance Company (Horace Mann), appeals from a decree of the Superior Court (Dalianis, J.) requiring it to provide uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage to the plaintiff, Norman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Limoges, as a relative who was a resident of his father\u2019s household. On appeal, the defendant argues that the superior court erred in ruling (1) that the plaintiff was a resident of his father\u2019s household, and (2) that the household exclusions in the policies do not apply to bar coverage. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">The incident giving rise to this action occurred on October 21, 1985, when the plaintiff was severely injured in a collision between the motorcycle he owned and was operating and a vehicle driven by another motorist. The plaintiff collected from the other motorist\u2019s liability insurer, underinsured motorist benefits from the insurer of the motorcycle, and benefits from the insurer of a vehicle owned by his mother. The plaintiff\u2019s father and mother are divorced and live in separate households.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The plaintiff commenced this action seeking to recover underinsured motorist benefits under his father\u2019s insurance policies on three vehicles and a motorcycle. Horace Mann denied coverage, asserting that the plaintiff was not a \u201crelative resident\u201d in his father\u2019s household, as required by the insurance policies. In the alternative, Horace Mann asserted that coverage is barred by the policies\u2019 household exclusion for claims arising from the operation of a motor vehicle not insured under the policy, but owned by the insured or a resident relative. The trial court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to coverage, concluding that he was a \u201crelative resident\u201d in his father\u2019s household. The trial court also referred to the ruling in its previous order that the household exclusions did not apply. This reference appears to be inaccurate. In the previous order, the court did not rule that the exclusions were inapplicable, but, rather, concluded that they were valid and unambiguous. However, in the later order, the trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for findings of fact and rulings of law that the exclusions were ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">On appeal, the defendant first asserts that the plaintiff did not live at his father\u2019s home on a regular or permanent basis and therefore cannot be considered a resident of his father\u2019s household. The plaintiff, on the other hand, claims that the insurance policies failed unambiguously to define \u201crelative resident,\u201d and that the trial court properly found that he was a resident of his father\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u201cThe appropriate scope of our review is whether the evidence does support the trial court\u2019s finding____\u201d <em>Holyoke Mutual Ins. Co. v. Carr, </em>130 N.H. 698, 699, 546 A.2d 1070, 1071 (1988) (citations omitted). Whether or not individuals are members of the same household is determined by the facts of each case. <em>See id. </em>The trial court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the plaintiff had a room at his father\u2019s home where he kept clothes and personal belongings, and that he also received mail and telephone calls there. The court also found that the plaintiff and his father shared a close and intimate relationship and that'the plaintiff\u2019s father provided him with financial support. Upon reading the policies and reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was amply supported by the evidence. Horace Mann\u2019s argument that the plaintiff did not permanently dwell in his father\u2019s house and, therefore, was not a resident is without merit. The insurance policies contain no requirement that a family member must permanently dwell in the home in order to be considered a resident relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"> The defendant\u2019s second argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in ruling that the \u201chousehold exclusions\u201d in the four policies do not apply to bar coverage. The \u201cfinal interpretation of the language in an insurance policy is a question of law, one left to this court to decide,\u201d <em>Curtis v. Guaranty Trust Life Ins. Co., </em>132 N.H. 337, 340, 566 A.2d 176, 178 (1989), and \u201c[w]e construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Haley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>129 N.H. 512, 514, 529 A.2d 394, 396 (1987). \u201c\u2018[A]n ambiguous insurance policy will be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer.\u2019\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Desfosses, </em>130 N.H. 260, 263, 536 A.2d 205, 207 (1987) (quoting <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 771-72, 423 A.2d 980, 985 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d at issue in three of the policies reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJMV\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">b. to <em>bodily injury </em>to an <em>insured </em>while <em>occupying a motor vehicle </em>(other than an <em>insured motor </em>vehicle) owned by the <em>named insured, </em>any <em>designated insured </em>or any relative resident in the same household as the <em>named </em>or <em>designated insured, </em>or through being struck by such a vehicle, but this exclusion does not apply to the <em>named insured </em>or his relatives while <em>occupying </em>or if struck by a <em>motor vehicle </em>owned by a <em>designated insured </em>or his relatives . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">(Emphasis in the original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d contained in the fourth policy reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbW\">\u201cThis endorsement does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">(b) to bodily injury to an insured while occupying an automobile (other than an insured automobile) owned by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>named insured or any relative resident in the same household, or through being struck by such an automobile, but this exclusion does not apply to the principal named insured or his relatives while occupying or if struck by such an automobile, owned by an insured named in the schedule or his relatives . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The plaintiff asserts that it is unclear whether the references to \u201can insured motor vehicle\u201d and \u201can insured automobile\u201d in the parenthetical exceptions to the exclusions include the plaintiff\u2019s motorcycle, which is not insured under these four policies but is insured by a carrier other than Horace Mann. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that there is no ambiguity, and that the exclusions bar coverage because plaintiff was operating a motorcycle which was not insured under his father\u2019s policies with Horace Mann.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The term \u201cinsured motor vehicle\u201d is defined, in part, in three of the policies as a motor vehicle \u201cdesignated in the declarations of the policy as an <em>insured motor vehicle </em>to which the <em>bodily injury </em>liability coverage of the policy applies.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) The term \u201cinsured automobile\u201d is defined, in part, in the fourth policy as an automobile \u201cdescribed in the schedule as an insured automobile to which the bodily injury liability coverage of the policy applies.\u201d We have previously addressed the validity of a similar policy exclusion in <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Desfosses, </em>130 N.H. at 263-64, 536 A.2d at 207-08. In that case we found such language to be ambiguous as to which insurance policy was being referred to and ruled in favor of the insured. We also noted that an insurer could eliminate this ambiguity by inserting limiting language into the policy, such as \u201cinsured automobile <em>under this policy.\u201d See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Upon reading the policy and reviewing the record, we conclude that the language \u201cdeclarations of the policy,\u201d \u201cinsured motor vehicle,\u201d \u201cschedule,\u201d and \u201cinsured automobile,\u201d as used in the policies, create ambiguities as to whether or not vehicles insured under other policies are considered \u201cinsured.\u201d We will construe such ambiguities against Horace Mann. <em>See id. </em>at 264, 536 A.2d at 208; <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. at 771-72, 423 A.2d at 985. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff is entitled to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
