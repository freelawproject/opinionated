(BS&amp;G), which is the parent corporation of Mr. Leeman\u2019s employer, Ossipee Aggregates Corp. (OA). The superior court ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings failed to allege adequately a breach of duty owed by BS&amp;G that was sufficiently distinct from OA\u2019s duty, as Mr. Leeman\u2019s employer, to provide a safe workplace, and that <em>Rounds v. Standex International, </em>131 N.H. 71, 550 A.2d 98 (1988), therefore barred recovery. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Because this appeal is taken from a dismissal on the pleadings, we take our facts from the plaintiffs\u2019 writ, accepting them as true and construing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>Collectramatic, Inc. v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., </em>127 N.H. 318, 320, 499 A.2d 999, 1000 (1985); <em>Jarvis v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>122 N.H. 648, 651, 448 A.2d 407, 409 (1982). According to the plaintiffs, OA is a New Hampshire corporation which operates a gravel and sand pit in Ossipee. While working as a truck driver for OA, Albert Leeman injured his knee when he struck it against the sharp corner of the fender of a truck that he was driving for OA. The plaintiffs claim that the truck had a missing step up to the driver\u2019s seat, and, as a result, when Mr. Leeman attempted to enter the truck, he hit his knee on the truck\u2019s fender.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">After collecting workers\u2019 compensation benefits from OA, the plaintiffs filed a multi-count writ in negligence against OA, against OA\u2019s parent corporation, BS&amp;G, and against Dean Boylan, Sr., and Dean Boylan, Jr., as corporate officers of BS&amp;G and OA, respectively. The defendants moved to dismiss the entire writ, arguing that either the employer immunity provision of New Hampshire\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:8 (Supp. 1990), protected them from suit or, alternatively, that the defendants owed the plaintiffs no duty under our decision in <em>Rounds supra, </em>thus precluding the plaintiffs\u2019 action. Focusing on our decision in <em>Rounds, </em>the trial court agreed with the defendants, and dismissed all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">On appeal, the Leemans contest only the dismissal of the count brought against BS&amp;G as the parent corporation of OA and raise two issues for our consideration. First, may an employer\u2019s parent corporation claim the protection of the employer immunity provision under New Hampshire\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute? <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:8,1(a) (Supp. 1990). Second, does our holding in <em>Rounds, </em>that employers have the nondelegable duty to keep their workplaces safe for their employees, <em>Rounds, </em>131 N.H. at 76-77, 550 A.2d at 101-02, foreclose an injured employee from seeking recovery from the employer\u2019s parent corporation based on an allegation that the parent had \u201cthe primary overall responsibility for the safety of [its subsidiary\u2019s employees]\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In New Hampshire an employee who is eligible to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits is \u201cconclusively presumed ... to have waived all rights of action whether at common law or by statute or otherwise: Against [his or her] employer. . . .\u201d RSA 281-A:8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>I(a)(Supp. 1990). In the context of our Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, we have said that a private employment relationship refers to \u2018\u201cany contract of hire, express or implied, oral or <em>written____'\" Swiezynski v. Civiello, </em>126 N.H. 142, 144, 489 A.2d 634, 636 (1985) (quoting RSA 281:2, III, current version at RSA 281-A:2, VI (Supp. 1990)). Whether such a relationship exists requires an examination of \u201cthe employer\u2019s right to the employee\u2019s labor and [its] right to control the employee\u2019s performance, and the employee\u2019s corresponding right to compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 489 A.2d at 637. The plaintiffs argue that BS&amp;G, simply by virtue of its position as OA\u2019s parent corporation, cannot claim that Mr. Leeman was its employee in order to gain the protection of the statutory bar from suit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In <em>Tanguay v. Marston, </em>127 N.H. 572, 503 A.2d 834 (1986), the plaintiff, after having collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his corporate employer, brought suit to recover for his job-related injuries against a defendant who was the principal shareholder and president of the corporate employer. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 503 A.2d at 835. The defendant successfully argued before a master that, as a matter of law, the employer immunity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation statute barred the plaintiff\u2019s suit against him. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 503 A.2d at 836. In reversing the master\u2019s finding, we recognized that, as a corporation, the plaintiff\u2019s employer was a separate legal entity from its principal shareholder. As such, we held that \u201c[a]n individual such as the defendant will share a corporation\u2019s employer immunity only when he is the <em>alter ego </em>of the corporation and is performing corporate responsibilities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">We find this holding applicable to the present case. Although BS&amp;G is a corporation and not a person, it is a separate legal entity from its subsidiary, OA, Mr. Leeman\u2019s employer. Thus, the fact that OA is owned by BS&amp;G \u201cis not conclusive to establish a single employer unit between two corporations [for workers\u2019 compensation purposes].\u201d 1 W. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 43.80, at 788 (1990). As one court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">\u201c[A] business enterprise has a range of choice in controlling its own corporate structure. . . . The owners may take advantage of the benefits of dividing the business into separate corporate parts, but principles of reciprocity require that courts also recognize the separate identities of the enterprises when sued by an injured employee. . . . [T]he tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>system should not deny recovery ... to an injured employee due to the fortuitous circumstance that the [alleged] tortfeasor is not a stranger but is controlled by the same business enterprise that controls his immediate employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><em>Boggs v. Blue Diamond Coal Co., </em>590 F.2d 655, 662 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 836 (1979) (applying Kentucky law).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Accordingly, unless BS&amp;G can demonstrate that it is the <em>alter ego </em>of its subsidiary, it cannot claim the employer immunity of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. Because this appeal is taken from a decision on the pleadings, the factual question of whether BS&amp;G is OA\u2019s <em>alter ego </em>remains. <em>See Tanguay, supra </em>at 576, 503 A.2d at 836; <em>Stevens v. Lewis, </em>118 N.H. 367, 370, 387 A.2d 637, 639 (1978). If on remand, the finder of fact determines that BS&amp;G has failed to demonstrate its status as OA\u2019s <em>alter ego, </em>and thus has no claim to the statutory employer immunity, the second question presented by this appeal will remain. That question is whether the doctrine in <em>Rounds v. Standex International, </em>holding that a co-employee is not liable for breach of his <em>employer\u2019s </em>nondelegable duty to maintain a safe workplace, similarly precludes the plaintiffs\u2019 action against the parent corporation, BS&amp;G, based on the theory that the <em>parent </em>had a duty to keep OA\u2019s workplace safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">In <em>Rounds, </em>we held that, in the context of the employer/employee relationship, the common law duty to provide a safe workplace is \u201cnondelegable\u201d and \u201crests exclusively with the employer, not the employee.\u201d <em>Rounds, </em>131 N.H. at 76-77, 550 A.2d at 101-02. According to the plaintiffs, this holding does not preclude them from suing BS&amp;G based on allegations that the parent corporation had \u201cprimary overall responsibility for the safety of employees of [OA]\u201d and \u201ca duty to ensure that the premises, equipment, and workplace were safe for all employees of [OA].\u201d BS&amp;G, on the other hand, argues that <em>Rounds </em>is clear: An employer\u2019s duty to provide a safe workplace is not only nondelegable, but is also exclusive to the employer. Thus, according to BS&amp;G, the plaintiffs are foreclosed from asserting a negligence claim against a third party, such as BS&amp;G, based on an alleged breach of the duty to provide a safe workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We have, on two occasions, revisited our decision in <em>Rounds, </em>and have reaffirmed the concept that the duty to keep the workplace safe is a nondelegable duty of the employer and, therefore, not a duty of the employee. <em>See Tyler v. Fuller, </em>132 N.H. 690, 569 A.2d 764 (1990); <em>Hall v. Tibert, 132 </em>N.H. 620, 567 A.2d 593 (1989). An impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tant and common element in each of these cases, however, is that the injured employee was seeking recovery from co-employees for injuries allegedly arising from unsafe conditions <em>caused by them. See Tyler supra; Hall supra; Rounds, </em>131 N.H. 71, 550 A.2d 98. It is within this context that \u201cthe employer cannot escape liability for [breaching the duty to maintain a safe workplace] by purporting to delegate to another the duty itself or by delegating merely the performance of the duty.\u201d <em>Rounds, </em>131 N.H. at 76, 550 A.2d at 101 (citations omitted). Because the employee is \u201ccharged with carrying out the employer\u2019s responsibility to provide a safe workplace,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 77, 550 A.2d at 101-02, the employee should not be subject to liability for breaching a duty which rests with the employer. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[t]o charge the employee with the same duty as the employer would effectively sidestep the workers\u2019 compensation law and hold the employee liable for breach of the same duty already compensated for through payment of benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 550 A.2d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In the present case, however, BS&amp;G is not alleged to be a co-employee of Mr. Leeman\u2019s, but rather a party who allegedly carries the primary responsibility for the safety of OA\u2019s employees. The question then is twofold: Does <em>Rounds </em>preclude an injured employee\u2019s recovery from a party, other than the employer or a co-employee, who may have undertaken an <em>independent duty </em>to provide a safe workplace? If not, does the plaintiffs\u2019 writ against BS&amp;G sufficiently allege such an independent duty?</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Several jurisdictions have recognized the right of an injured employee to seek recovery from the employer\u2019s parent corporation based on the breach of an independent duty to maintain a safe workplace. <em>Boggs, </em>590 F.2d at 663; <em>First Nat. Bank of Camden, Arkansas v. Tracor, Inc., </em>851 F.2d 212, 214-215 (8th Cir. 1988) (applying Arkansas law); <em>Heinrich v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., </em>532 F. Supp. 1348, 1354, (D. Md. 1982) (applying Maryland law); <em>Brock v. Alaska Intern. Industries, Inc., </em>645 P.2d 188, 190 (Alaska 1982). A key consideration in determining whether such an independent duty is present is whether the parent corporation specifically undertook an obligation to manage the safety of the injured parties\u2019 workplace by some affirmative act that is distinct from its actions as the managing stockholder. <em>Boggs supra; Tracor, Inc., supra </em>at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In <em>Boggs, </em>for instance, the plaintiffs alleged that the parent corporation provided \u201cmanagement, engineering and safety services\u201d to the subsidiary and took affirmative steps in conjunction with those services. <em>Boggs, </em>590 F.2d at 658. Faced with these allegations, the court held that the parent could be held liable for negligently per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>forming its duties, thus causing injury to its subsidiary\u2019s employees. <em>Id. </em>at 663. Moreover, the court distinguished a parent corporation\u2019s liability based on an independent duty to maintain a safe workplace from an unsuccessful theory of liability in which the parent\u2019s duty to provide a safe workplace is based on a theory that, as the managing stockholder, the parent was derivatively liable for the subsidiary\u2019s breach of its duties to its employees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We find the reasoning of these cases persuasive. Our decision in <em>Rounds, </em>that a co-employee cannot be held liable for negligence in carrying out the employer\u2019s duty to provide a safe workplace, does not require the conclusion that a third party could not be held liable if it had independently undertaken a responsibility for keeping the employees safe from workplace accidents. When, as here, the alleged third party is the employer\u2019s parent corporation, the undertaking must be one which is distinct and separate from the undertaking inherent in the parent\u2019s position as managing stockholder of its subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">As previously noted, this appeal is taken from a dismissal on the pleadings. Consequently, where the plaintiffs have alleged only that BS&amp;G had the \u201cprimary overall responsibility for the safety of employees of [OA],\u201d it is unclear whether this alleged responsibility results from an independent undertaking by BS&amp;G to manage safety at OA or, instead, from BS&amp;G\u2019s position as the managing stockholder of OA. When we read the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and take, as we must, all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we find that their allegations, at this threshold point, are sufficient. This finding, however, in no way relieves the plaintiffs from the obligation to demonstrate that BS&amp;G, by some affirmative act, independently undertook the duty to maintain safe working conditions at OA.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
