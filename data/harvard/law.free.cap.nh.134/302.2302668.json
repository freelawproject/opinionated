The defendant filed pretrial motions (1) to suppress evidence of hair samples found at the scene of the crime and (2) to suppress the defendant\u2019s prior testimony at a so-called <em>Richards </em>hearing held during the trial of Anthony Barnaby, <em>see State v. Richards, </em>129 N.H. 669, 531 A.2d 338 (1987). The court granted both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">On appeal, the State asserts that the trial court: (1) applied an-erroneous legal standard for the admission of expert testimony concerning the hair samples; (2) made erroneous findings of fact regarding the expert witness\u2019s testimony; (3) erroneously concluded that the expert testimony was irrelevant; (4) erroneously concluded that even if relevant, the evidence was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant; (5) erred in requiring the State to prove a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege before admitting his <em>Richards </em>hearing testimony; and (6) erred in concluding that the defendant\u2019s testimony at the <em>Richards </em>hearing was compelled. For reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings on the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The relevant facts are as follows. On the morning of October 3, 1988, the bodies of Brenda Warner and Charlene Ranstroni were discovered in the bedroom of their Nashua apartment. According to the State medical examiner, the two women died as a result of multiple stab wounds. Upon reaching the crime scene, police officers secured the site and gathered any physical evidence which might have been left by the perpetrator(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Among trace evidence recovered from the- crime site were seven pubic hair follicles, which were subsequently sent to the laboratory of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D.C. Special Agent Deedrick, an 18-year veteran of the Bureau\u2019s hair and fiber unit, was assigned to conduct an analysis of the seven hair samples. Agent Deedrick had extensive experience in hair analysis, having previously performed approximately 4,000 analyses. Microscopic examination of the questioned hairs led him to believe that all seven probably came from the same person. Agent Deedrick thereafter compared these hairs with known samples retrieved from each of the\" two victims, the defendant, and another suspect, Anthony Barnaby. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>In his report, Deedrick stated that he could reach no conclusion as to the origin of the seven questioned hairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\">The State brought Anthony Barnaby to trial three times for the two murders, alleging that he acted in concert with Caplin in committing the crimes. Agent Deedrick was called as a witness at each of Barnaby\u2019s trials and testified that the most significant difference between Caplin\u2019s hairs and the questioned hairs involved the tip of the hair follicles. Microscopic examination revealed that all seven of the hairs recovered from the crime scene had scissor-cut tips, while each of the samples taken from Caplin exhibited a naturally tapered tip. Deedrick further explained that if the questioned hairs had come from Caplin, and if Caplin\u2019s pubic hairs exhibited cut tips at the time the crimes were committed, he might or might not find cut tips among the sample of pubic hairs taken from the defendant four months later. Both the State and defense counsel questioned Agent Deedrick extensively in an effort to elicit his opinion as to whether Caplin could have been the source of the seven hairs. Agent Deedrick steadfastly refused to render such an opinion, and testified that it was impossible for him to say whether or not the hairs came from Caplin.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Prior to his trial, Caplin filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude all evidence pertaining to the hairs found at the crime scene. In support of his motion, the defendant contended that Agent Deed-rick\u2019s analysis was inconclusive as to the source of the crime scene hairs, that distinct differences existed between the crime scene hairs and samples obtained from the defendant, and that the hair sample evidence was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.) granted the motion, concluding that the evidence of the characteristics of the defendant\u2019s pubic hair was not relevant and, that even if relevant, the evidence was so unfairly prejudicial to the defendant as to outweigh its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Prior to the first Barnaby trial, Anthony Barnaby informed the court of his intent to call Caplin as a witness. In order to address Caplin\u2019s fifth amendment privilege, the Superior Court <em>(Dalianis, </em>J.) conducted a hearing pursuant to <em>State v. Richards, </em>129 N.H. 669, 531 A.2d 338. At the outset, the court explained the purpose of the hearing, and pointed out that Caplin\u2019s newly appointed attorney was present to assist him with respect to asserting his fifth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">During the hearing, Barnaby\u2019s attorney questioned Caplin about his whereabouts on the night of the murders. The defendant responded to some questions, but many times, after conferring with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>counsel, asserted his privilege against self-incrimination. The superior court ordered the defendant to answer certain questions, notwithstanding his assertion of his fifth amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">At the conclusion of Caplin\u2019s testimony, his attorney advised the court that she had misunderstood the <em>Richards </em>hearing process in thinking that Caplin should first answer questions, whereupon the court would rule on whether he was permitted to assert his fifth amendment right. Because of this misunderstanding, she believed that she did not advise the defendant to assert the privilege when she should have. Counsel acknowledged her error, and the court ordered the transcript \u201cimpounded\u201d after the trial so that there would be no \u201cirremediable\u201d damage to Caplin.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The day after the <em>Richards </em>hearing, new counsel appointed for Caplin asserted Caplin\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination as to any testimony beyond name, date of birth, and present residence address in jail. Barnaby\u2019s attorney was then permitted to read the transcript of the <em>Richards </em>hearing to the jury. The transcripts were then collected and sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Now, at Caplin\u2019s trial, the State seeks to introduce against Caplin the portions of the <em>Richards </em>hearing testimony that he gave without first asserting his fifth amendment privilege. The defendant filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>grounded in his State and federal constitutional rights, seeking to suppress all of his testimony at the <em>Richards </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.) granted the motion, concluding that the defendant\u2019s <em>Richards </em>hearing testimony was involuntary and the product of compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">I. <em>Expert Testimony </em>\u2014 Hair <em>Sample Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">We first address the State\u2019s claim on appeal that the trial court erroneously concluded that the hair sample evidence was irrelevant and improperly excluded it. The State relies upon the cases of <em>State v. Scarlett, </em>121 N.H. 37, 41, 426 A.2d 25, 28 (1981); <em>State v. Staples, </em>120 N.H. 278, 281, 415 A.2d 320, 322 (1980); and <em>State v. Farrow, </em>118 N.H. 296, 307, 386 A.2d 808, 815 (1978), in arguing that the trial court applied an erroneous standard for determining the admissibility of the testimony, requiring that Agent Deedrick must be able to identify a particular person as the source of the crime scene hairs. The State contends that the trial court erroneously concluded that the expert could form no opinion as to the identity of the hairs. The State also argues that the trial court erroneously concluded that, even if the evidence were considered relevant, it was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number> The determination of whether evidence is relevant is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not reverse its determination absent evidence of abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>131 N.H. 512, 521, 556 A.2d 302, 308 (1989). \u201cOpinion evidence is admissible if the court finds that the expert is qualified to give an opinion on the issue raised and that it will aid the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Staples supra; see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 702. New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 402 requires the exclusion of irrelevant evidence. New Hampshire Evidence Rule 401 states that \u201c\u2018[Relevant evidence\u2019-means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The record reveals that at Barnaby\u2019s trial, Agent Deedrick testified concerning the similarities and dissimilarities between the hair samples found at the crime scene and those obtained from Caplin. Deedrick testified that all of the hairs found at the crime scene probably came from the same person. However, the significant dissimilarity of the cut hair follicle tips resulted in his inability to form an opinion as to whether Caplin was the source of the crime scene hairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u201cAttorney Maggiotto:</p>\n<p id=\"AXI\">Q. <em>I guess the question becomes, though, can you tell this jury whether or not in your opinion those hairs are the hairs of David Caplin?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Agent Deedrick:</p>\n<p id=\"AxqS\">A. <em>My conclusion is no conclusion. It is the gray area between could have and could not have.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Q. And I guess what\u2019s troubling or what\u2019s left up in the air is your opinion as to whether or not you can say these are David Caplin\u2019s pubic hairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">A. And I can\u2019t say. . . . There are three conclusions that can be reached. Either they are alike in all respects and could have come from the person, which isn\u2019t positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">Q. That\u2019s the best conclusion you can get?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">A. Well, that\u2019s a good conclusion, yes. If you can do that, you have got a good association.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Q. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">A. On the other hand, you may have two hairs that are \u2014 hair that is distinctly different than the known standard. They could not have come from that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In a situation where you have hairs that are very similar microscopically but something \u2014 some nagging little thing there that doesn\u2019t quite look right microscopically which could be a cut tip, could be a pigment granule out of place or something there that bothers me as an examiner, I don\u2019t include the hair but I don\u2019t throw it out. I just don\u2019t go as strong with it. I have to be pretty darn certain that all the characteristics of the questioned hair and the known hair are alike or I won\u2019t say this person could have been there.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Q. And which category do these hairs fall into, this last\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">A. That\u2019s one of those, and I can\u2019t eliminate them but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s his.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Agent Deedrick evaluated the hair samples and was unable to form an opinion as to their source. To allow admission of his testimony would be improperly to require the jury to assume the role of the expert and to evaluate the technical data. Since this is clearly beyond the jury\u2019s ability, the testimony would be of little value.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s argument that the evidence is relevant under <em>State v. Farrow, </em>118 N.H. at 307, 386 A.2d at 815 and <em>State v. Scarlett, </em>121 N.H. at 41, 426 A.2d at 28. In both <em>Farrow </em>and <em>Scarlett, </em>the expert witness testified that the hair samples at issue were similar in all fifteen recognized microscopic characteristics. In the case before us, Deedrick observed a significant dissimilarity between the hair samples which prevented him from reaching a conclusion as to their source.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">We find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the testimony was not relevant and find no abuse in the exercise of its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tion to prevent admission of the testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial. It follows that we do not need to consider the State\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly concluded that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">II. <em>Richards Hearing Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Next, we consider the trial court\u2019s ruling suppressing the defendant\u2019s <em>Richards </em>hearing testimony. We will not overturn the ruling, absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Steer, </em>128 N.H. 490, 492, 517 A.2d 797, 799 (1986); <em>State v. Brooks, </em>126 N.H. 618, 621-22, 495 A.2d 1258, 1263 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The State sought to introduce at trial the answers to only those questions where Caplin failed to invoke his privilege. On appeal, the State argues that the trial court improperly relied on <em>State v. Phinney, </em>117 N.H. 145, 370 A.2d 1153 (1977), in requiring the State to prove a voluntary waiver before introducing the defendant\u2019s <em>Richards </em>hearing testimony. The State also asserts that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant\u2019s testimony was compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination as set forth in the State and National Constitutions may not be applied by the court to create an all-inclusive immunization from giving testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Richards, </em>129 N.H. at 673, 531 A.2d at 341. Rather, the court will determine during a <em>Richards </em>hearing whether to compel a witness to testify, after balancing the witness\u2019s right to be free from self-incrimination with the right of the accused to produce exculpatory evidence. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Caplin was a suspect, not yet indicted for the murders, at the time he was subpoenaed and testified at the <em>Richards </em>hearing. Ostensibly, counsel for Barnaby- offered Caplin\u2019s testimony in an effort to incriminate Caplin and exonerate Barnaby, and the trial court held the <em>Richards </em>hearing in order to determine the scope of defendant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\u201cThe Court:</p>\n<p id=\"ABqj\">Now, we have convened in camera here without the jury in order to conduct a so-called Richard\u2019s [sic] hearing during which the proponent of the witness \u2014 that is, the defense\u2014 will ask questions and an independent determination will be made as to each question relative to whether it should be answered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>front of the jury or not. The obvious implications here relate to the witness\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights against possible self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">His counsel, Attorney Amadeo-Vickery, is present and will consult with him as to any question about which he has a concern or she has a concern. We recognize that she is newly appointed to represent the witness and may be at somewhat of a disadvantage in that regard. However, it will be the court which determines whether questions will ultimately be answered or not. And counsel\u2019s concerns are sufficiently on the record, I think, to protect the interests that there may be in that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, Caplin\u2019s counsel admitted on the record that she had apparently misunderstood the <em>Richards </em>hearing process, in thinking that the court itself would make an independent determination as to which questions would be answered and what evidence was incriminating, and in thinking that the defendant would not be forced to incriminate himself. It is apparent that the court\u2019s explanation of the <em>Richards </em>hearing contributed to this misunderstanding. As a result, counsel failed to advise Caplin to invoke his fifth amendment privilege in response to certain questions. We conclude, under these circumstances, that the answers to those questions were as much coerced as if Caplin had properly invoked his privilege and then was compelled by the court to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In reviewing the record that the trial court had before it, we find no abuse of discretion or error by the trial court in its decision to suppress the <em>Richards </em>hearing testimony. Since we decide the case on this basis, we need not reach the question of whether defendant effectively waived his fifth amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
