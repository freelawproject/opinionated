We hold that the superior court erred in failing to act upon the Estabrookses\u2019 request for an evidentiary hearing, and therefore reverse and remand. The Estabrookses raise several substantive issues on appeal relating to the ZBA\u2019s denial of their variance application, but because we decide this case only on the basis of the court\u2019s procedural error, we describe only the facts and procedural history that pertain to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">The Estabrookses own two adjoining lots and have constructed a building which straddles the boundary line between them. The building houses an automobile repair shop, and is connected to an apartment building on one side and a store on the other. The Estabrookses would like to eliminate this boundary line, and create two new ones: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>one between the apartment building and the repair shop, and one between the repair shop and the store. In order to do so, they applied to the ZBA for a variance from the Town\u2019s land use ordinance. After the ZBA denied their application for a variance, the Estabrookses appealed the decision to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On April 10, 1990, the superior court issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201cHearing on April 20,1990 shall be limited to determination of whether Plaintiffs\u2019 Appeal may be determined on the record, and if so, oral argument thereon, time not to exceed one hour. If the Court determines that there will be an evidentiary hearing; it will be scheduled at a later date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The attorneys for the Town and the Estabrookses appeared before the court on April 20, 1990, and the court issued another order the same day. It states: \u201cParties are to submit memoranda within 30 days, following which case will be submitted for decision. Further argument will be scheduled on request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The parties each filed a memorandum of law within the stated time limit. Attached to their memorandum, the Estabrookses sent the following letter, dated May 18, 1990, in which they stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">\u201cThe plaintiffs would like to present all arguments and some limited testimony from Mr. Donald Straw. If Attorney Donovan [the Town\u2019s then-attorney] agrees to accept Mr. Straw\u2019s affidavit then the testimony may be unnecessary. In setting up the hearing in this matter please allow adequate time for argument and some limited testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">There is no evidence before us that Attorney Donovan agreed to accept Donald Straw\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The trial court apparently did not respond in any way to the lett\u00e9r quoted above and issued a final order denying the Estabrookses\u2019 appeal on August 24, 1990. The Estabrookses then filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the court erred in failing to allow an evidentiary hearing, and that this error prevented them from presenting material testimony relating to an important issue in the case. The court denied the motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">On appeal, the Estabrookses reiterat\u00e9 the arguments they made below. The Town maintains that the court acted properly and that the Estabrookses simply misinterpreted the court\u2019s April 20,1990 order. According to the Town, the order meant that an evidentiary hearing would be scheduled \u201con request\u201d of the court, not the parties. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The statutes governing the presentation of evidence during an appeal from a ZBA decision are RSA 677:10 and :13. RSA 677:10 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cAll evidence transferred by the zoning board of adjustment or the local legislative body shall be, and all additional evidence received may be, considered by the court regardless of any technical rule which might have rendered the evidence inadmissible if originally offered in the trial of an action at law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">RSA 677:13 states that \u201c[t]he court may take evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same with his findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d We have interpreted these statutes to mean that \u201c[i]f the record of the evidence before the board is either incomplete or non-existent, a party may present further evidence to the trial court.\u201d <em>Lake Sunapee Protective Assoc. v. N.H. Wetlands Bd., </em>133 N.H. 98, 107, 574 A.2d 1368, 1373 (1990) (interpreting RSA 677:10); <em>see also Pappas v. City of Manchester Zoning Bd., </em>117 N.H. 622, 625, 376 A.2d 885, 886 (1977) (interpreting predecessors of RSA 677:10 and :13).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Notwithstanding the Town\u2019s argument to the contrary, we understand the trial court\u2019s April 20, 1990 order to mean that the court intended to schedule an evidentiary hearing if either party requested one. The words \u201c[flurther argument will be scheduled on request\u201d do not support the Town\u2019s assertion that the court meant to hold a hearing only on <em>its </em>request. Further, we find that the Estabrookses\u2019 letter of May 18, 1990, contains a clear request for a hearing. The Town does not dispute this.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\"> \u201cUltimately, \u2018the test of the validity of a form of procedure is . . . whether or not it is what justice and convenience require.\u2019\u201d <em>Chasan v. Village District of Eastman, </em>128 N.H. 807, 813, 523 A.2d 16, 20 (1986) (quoting <em>Morrill v. Bank, </em>90 N.H. 358, 359, 9 A.2d 519, 522 (1939)) (holding that plaintiffs had opportunity to argue case because they were heard on motion to dismiss and not denied any request to present evidence). The Estabrookses argue in their motion for reconsideration that the court\u2019s actions denied them the opportunity to present material evidence. Given the wording of the court\u2019s April 20, 1990 order, we find that it was reasonable for the Estabrookses to rely on an opportunity to present evidence orally or through affidavit agreed to by opposing counsel. In addition, the evidence the Estabrookses wished to present appears from their motion for reconsideration to be material, relevant, non-cumulative, and possibly outcome-determinative. We hold, therefore, that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>particular facts of this case the trial court abused its discretion, and we reverse its final order. <em>See </em>RSA 677:10, :13; <em>Lake Sunapee Protective Assoc. v.

City of Manchester Zoning Bd., </em>117 N.H. at 625, 376 A.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b386-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
