Challenging his conviction, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in allowing a police officer to testify as to her opinion concerning the victim\u2019s delay in reporting the sexual assaults, and that the admission of this testimony was not harmless error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The defendant and his wife, Susan Ann Wright, separated in June 1986, and he subsequently moved in with his sister. Two of their children, Robin, age seven, and Victor, Jr., age five, visited their father at his sister\u2019s home three weekends a month and one night during the week. During these visits, the defendant would frequently sleep between his children on a sofa bed in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">At trial, Robin testified that while they were in the sofa bed watching television in the dark, the defendant engaged in conduct which, if found by the jury to have occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, would constitute a violation of RSA 632-A-.2, XI and of RSA 632-A:3, II. Robin was underneath the covers at the time, and Victor, Jr., was lying with his back turned toward them, watching television. The defendant warned Robin \u201cnot to tell\u201d or \u201c[h]e would try and hurt himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In May 1987, the defendant moved to Virginia, and Robin had no contact with her father after Christmas of 1987. In the spring of 1988, while Robin rode past the State Prison with her family and a young boy for whom her mother babysat, the boy said, \u201cThat\u2019s where my father lives.\u201d Her mother later explained that the boy\u2019s father was in prison for \u201ctouching\u201d his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">A few days later, Robin told her young cousin Dawn that her father \u201cwas hurting [her] in a way.\u201d Dawn convinced Robin to tell her mother about what her father had done to her, and Dawn left a note for Robin\u2019s mother, explaining that Robin needed to talk with her. When Robin\u2019s mother asked her what was wrong, she was distraught and crying and said, \u201cI think my daddy did something to me he wasn\u2019t supposed to do.\u201d Robin\u2019s mother subsequently contacted Robin\u2019s physician, who referred her to the New Hampshire Division for Children and Youth Services and the Concord Police Department. Officer Pauline Phelps, a female victimization officer for the city of Concord, conducted a videotaped interview of Robin on June 2,1988, in which Robin demonstrated, using anatomically correct dolls, how her father had sexually assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">At trial, Officer Phelps testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">\u201cQ. In speaking with Robin, were you able to determine a timeframe in which this had happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Q. And this was quite a while prior to when you were interviewing her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">A. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">Q. What, if any, significance do you attribute to the delay between the time these events occurred and when she spoke with you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The defendant objected, because the question was \u201ccalling for [the police officer] to give an expert opinion why there is a long period of time between when it happened and when it was reported ... and she is not an expert.\u201d The court overruled the objection, and the prosecutor continued with her questioning: \u201cDo you attribute any significance to the delay between when the events occurred in the summer of 1986 and the point in time when Robin spoke with you in June of 1988?\u201d Officer Phelps responded, \u201cYes. There have been some changes that might have made it easier for her to speak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The defendant argues that it was error to admit this testimony, because it did not meet the requirements of either New Hampshire Evidence Rule 702, which allows experts to give opinions, or Rule 701, which permits opinion testimony by lay witnesses when those opinions are \u201crationally based on the perception of the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The State concedes that the opinion testimony offered through Officer Phelps was neither proper expert testimony, <em>see State v. Coleman, </em>133 N.H. 713, 715, 584 A.2d 755, 757 (1990), nor proper lay opinion testimony, <em>see Heath v. Joyce, </em>114 N.H. 620, 622, 326 A.2d 260, 262 (1979). Instead, the State maintains that the admission of Officer Phelps\u2019s opinion was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Ruelke, </em>116 N.H. 692, 694, 366 A.2d 497, 498 (1976) (where it can be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not affect the verdict, error is harmless and court will uphold the conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">The defendant contends that Officer Phelps\u2019s testimony regarding the delay in reporting the assaults directly undermined his defense that Robin fabricated the allegations to bring her father back to New Hampshire. However, our review of the record reveals ample evidence, other than Officer Phelps\u2019s opinion testimony, that the delay was attributable to other factors. First, Robin testified that she was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the assaults and, therefore, she may have been encouraged to talk about them by the revelation that a young friend\u2019s father was in the State Prison for \u201ctouching\u201d his children. Second, she confided in her cousin Dawn, because she felt that Dawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u201cwas someone I could trust that wouldn\u2019t tell the whole wide world.\u201d Third, Robin testified that she didn\u2019t want everybody to know because \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to not like my dad.\u201d Finally, she testified that her father had warned her not to tell and had threatened \u201cto try and hurt himself\u201d if she did tell. Consequently, Officer Phelps\u2019s testimony that the delay in reporting the assaults was due to \u201cfamily factors\u201d and \u201csome changes that might have made it easier for her to speak\u201d only adds to the compelling testimony of Robin herself. Moreover, the testimony that was most damning to the defendant was Robin\u2019s descriptive account of the sexual assaults, not her reasons for the delay in reporting them, and this testimony was unaffected by Officer Phelps\u2019s opinion concerning the delay. Consequently, we hold, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Officer Phelps\u2019s opinion testimony, although erroneously admitted, did not affect the verdict. <em>See State v. Ruelke supra. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
