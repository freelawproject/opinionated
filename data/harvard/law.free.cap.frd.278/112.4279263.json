RICE, United States Magistrate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Direct purchaser plaintiffs (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) seek to compel defendant United Egg Producers, Inc. (\u201cUEP\u201d) to produce or remove from sequestration certain documents and information involving defendant Sparboe Farms (\u201cSparboe\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> UEP maintains the attorney-client privilege, the common-interest privilege, and the work-product doctrine shield the communications at issue from disclosure. All privilege questions, including those raised in this motion, have been referred to me for resolution pursuant to Rule 72(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>Order, <em>In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 08-md-2002 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 2,2011) (Pratter, J.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">This case presents issues concerning the existence and scope of the attorney-client privilege in the context of a trade industry cooperative of egg producers and related entities. At issue are several communications involving UEP officials, one of its member entities, and, at various times, attorneys. Although the parties debate the contours of nearly every aspect of privilege law, resolution of the pending motion depends on one fundamental question: Were any of the communications at issue made for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice? If not, they cannot fall within the bounds of the attorney-client privilege, regardless whether UEP and its members are treated as a single corporate entity or a group of entities sharing a common legal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">For the reasons set forth below, I conclude UEP has failed to meet its burden of establishing the communications at issue are protected by the attorney-client privilege. Only one of the documents at issue was related to a confidential request for legal advice, and any privilege as to that document was waived. I further conclude the record does not permit resolution of the parties\u2019 disputes over information conveyed to Plaintiffs during interviews with Sparboe personnel. Accordingly, the motion to compel is granted in part and denied without prejudice in part.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">The facts underlying this dispute are set forth in <em>In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, </em>821 F.Supp.2d 709, 712-16, No. 08-md-2002, 2011 WL 4465355, at *1-3 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 26, 2011) (Pratter, J.), and I will not repeat them at length here.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">Plaintiffs allege UEP, its members, and other defendants conspired to limit supply and fix prices of eggs in violation of federal antitrust laws. <em>Id. </em>at 712-13, 2011 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>4465355, at *1. To accomplish these violations, Plaintiffs allege UEP proposed, and its members adopted, an \u201canimal welfare\u201d program (\u201cthe Program\u201d), which required egg producers to comply with guidelines reducing cage space densities for hens in order to sell \u201cUEP-certified\u201d eggs. <em>Id. </em>at 714, 2011 WL 4465355, at <em>*2. </em>Sparboe, a member of UEP and a former participant in the Program, settled the claims against it by agreeing to cooperate and provide information to Plaintiffs. <em>See </em>Order on Preliminary Approval of Sparboe Settlement at 2-3, ECF No. 214, <em>In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 08-md-2002 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 23, 2009) (Pratter, J.). The information Sparboe disclosed to Plaintiffs \u2014 both in documents and witness interviews \u2014 in some instances included communications between Sparboe\u2019s officers and attorneys and UEP\u2019s officers and attorneys. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 28-37; UEP\u2019s Br. at 18-44. Of particular interest here are communications from 2003 and later revealing Sparboe\u2019s concerns with, and objections to, the Program. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 28-37; UEP\u2019s Br. at 18-44. UEP suggests those communications are protected by either the attorney-client privilege, the common-interest privilege, or the work-product doctrine. <em>See generally </em>UEP\u2019s Br.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Although Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel is focused on six specific documents and information conveyed in the interviews of four Sparboe witnesses, the parties assert much broader arguments. Specifically, Plaintiffs suggest UEP could not successfully invoke any privilege for communications between its counsel and any of its members before 2009. Pis.\u2019 Br. at 17-21. Conversely, UEP suggests all communications between its counsel or officers and any of its members are entitled to blanket protection under a \u201csingle-entity\u201d theory based on <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). UEP\u2019s Br. at 4-15. Neither of these sweeping pronouncements is necessary or appropriate to resolve the issues presented in Plaintiffs\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is properly resolved by examining the specific communications at issue and the circumstances under which they occurred. <em>Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 396-97, 101 S.Ct. 677 (applying a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d analysis, which \u201cobeys the spirit of the Rules [of Evidence]\u201d).

LEGAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">A. <em>The Attorney-Client Privilege</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The attorney-client privilege is intended to encourage \u201cfull and frank communication between attorneys and their clients.\u201d <em>Wachtel v. Health Net, Inc., </em>482 F.3d 225, 231 (3d Cir.2007). The privilege \u201capplies to any communication that satisfies the following elements: it must be \u2018(1) a communication (2) made between [the client and the attorney or his agents] (3) in confidence (4) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance for the client.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Teleglobe Communications Corp., </em>493 F.3d 345, 359 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 68 (2000)); <em>accord In re Application of Chevron Corp., </em>650 F.3d 276, 289 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The privilege protects \u201cConfidential disclosures by a client to an attorney made in order to obtain legal assistance.\u201d <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976). \u201c[T]he privilege exists to protect not only the giving of professional advice to those who can act on it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him to give sound and informed advice.\u201d <em>Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 390, 101 S.Ct. 677. However, it \u201conly protects the disclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 101 S.Ct. 677. The communication between lawyer and client \u201cis not, in and of itself, the purpose of the privilege; rather, it only protects the free flow of information because it promotes compliance with law and aids administration of the judicial system.\u201d <em>Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 360-61 (emphasis omitted). \u201cThe privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer\u2019s being fully informed by the client.\u201d <em>Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 389, 101 S.Ct. 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Communications made both by a client and an attorney are privileged if the communications are \u201cfor the purpose of securing legal advice.\u201d <em>See In re Ford Motor Co., </em>110 F.3d 954, 965 n. 9 (3d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Amerada Hess Corp., </em>619 F.2d 980, 986 (3d Cir.1980). Communications from an attorney are privileged for two reasons: first, to prevent \u201cthe use of an attorney\u2019s advice to support inferences as to content of confidential communications by the client\u201d; and second, because \u201clegal advice given to the client should remain confidential.\u201d <em>Amerada Hess Corp., </em>619 F.2d at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Nevertheless, the privilege obstructs the truth-finding process and should be \u201capplied only where necessary to achieve its purpose.\u201d <em>Wachtel, </em>482 F.3d at 231; <em>see Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Republic of Phil., </em>951 F.2d 1414, 1423 (3d Cir.1991) (construing the privilege narrowly). Because the privilege promotes the \u201cdissemination of sound legal advice,\u201d it applies only where the advice is legal in nature, and not where the lawyer provides non-legal business advice. <em>Wachtel, </em>482 F.3d at 231. In addition, the privilege applies only to communications made in confidence, because \u201ca client who speaks openly or in the presence of a third party needs no promise of confidentiality to induce a disclosure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">\u201cRule 501 requires the federal courts, in determining the nature and scope of an evidentiary privilege, to engage in the sort of case-by-case analysis that is central to common-law adjudication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230; <em>see Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 386, 396-97, 101 S.Ct. 677; <em>see also Harper-Wyman Co. v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 86-9595, 1991 WL 62510, at *5 (N.D.Ill. Apr. 17, 1991) (analysis of whether communications between a trade association\u2019s counsel and association members are privileged \u201cmust be on a case-by-ease basis, employing the usual concepts of attorney-client privilege\u201d). \u201cThe party asserting the privilege bears the burden of proving that it applies to the communications at issue.\u201d <em>King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., </em>No. 06-1797, 2011 WL 2623306, at *4 n. 5 (E.D.Pa. July 5, 2011) (Goldberg, J.) (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>In re Grand Jury Empanelled Feb. 14, 1978, </em>603 F.2d 469, 474 (3d Cir.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">B. <em>The Commonr-Interest </em>Privilege<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The common-interest privilege \u201callows attorneys representing different clients with similar legal interests to share information without having to disclose it to others.\u201d <em>Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 364; <em>accord King Drug, </em>2011 WL 2623306, at <em>*2. </em>Although the doctrine originated in the context of criminal co-defendants, it now \u201capplies in civil and criminal litigation, and even in purely transactional contexts.\u201d <em>Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">To qualify for protection under the common-interest privilege, \u201cthe communication must be shared with the attorney of the member of the community of interest,\u201d and \u201call members of the community must share a common legal interest in the shared communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted); <em>accord King Drug, </em>2011 WL 2623306, at *2-3. \u201cThe attorney-sharing requirement helps prevent abuse by ensuring that the common-interest privilege only supplants the disclosure rule when attorneys, not clients, decide to share information in order to coordinate legal strategies.\u201d <em>Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 365. Meanwhile, the requirement that the parties to the communication share \u201cat least a substantially similar legal interest\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prevents abuse of the privilege and \u201cunnecessary information sharing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The common-interest privilege \u201cdoes not apply unless the conditions of privilege are otherwise satisfied.\u201d <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liability Litig., </em>MDL No. 1203, 2001 WL 34133955, at *5 (E.D.Pa. Apr. 19, 2001); <em>accord In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, </em>902 F.2d 244, 249 (4th Cir.1990). This is so because \u2014 despite its name \u2014 the common-interest privilege \u201cis not an independent privilege, but merely an exception to the general rale that no privilege attaches to communications that are made in the presence of or disclosed to a third party.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Tex. Auto. Dealers Ass\u2019n, </em>214 F.R.D. 432, 443 (E.D.Tex.2003); <em>accord United States v. BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>492 F.3d 806, 815 (7th Cir.2007); <em>see Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 365 (the privilege is \u201can exception to the disclosure rule\u201d). Thus, the party asserting the privilege has the burden of establishing the elements of the attorney-client privilege generally, as well as those of the common-interest privilege. <em>See United States v. LeCroy, </em>348 F.Supp.2d 375, 382 (E.D.Pa.2005); <em>Diet Drugs, </em>2001 WL 34133955, at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">C. <em>The Workr-Product Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">\u201c[A] party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial\u201d unless otherwise discoverable or a party shows substantial need for the material. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). Pursuant to the work-product doctrine, documents reflecting the \u201cmental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative concerning ... litigation,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3)(B), are \u201cgenerally afforded near absolute protection from discovery,\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>110 F.3d at 962 n. 7. <em>See Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 400, 101 S.Ct. 677 (\u201cRule 26 accords special protection to work product revealing the attorney\u2019s mental processes.\u201d). Such information is discoverable \u201conly upon a showing of rare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>343 F.3d 658, 663 (3d Cir.2003). \u201cThe burden of demonstrating that a document is protected as work-product rests with the party asserting the doctrine.\u201d <em>Conoco, Inc. v. US.

The doctrine does not protect documents prepared \u201c\u2018in the ordinary course of business, or pursuant to public requirements unrelated to litigation, or for other nonlitigation purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martin v. Bally\u2019s Park Place Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>983 F.2d 1252, 1260 (3d Cir.1993) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3) advisory committee note). The doctrine recognizes a lawyer must have a \u201ccertain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel.\u201d <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 511, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">For the doctrine to apply, Rule 26(b)(3) requires only \u201cthat the material be prepared in anticipation of some litigation, not necessarily in anticipation of the particular litigation in which it is being sought.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>110 F.3d at 967 (emphasis omitted). \u201c[T]he preparer\u2019s anticipation of litigation [must] be objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>983 F.2d at 1260. Litigation need not be threatened before a document can be found prepared in anticipation of litigation. <em>Hydramar, Inc. v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., </em>115 F.R.D. 147, 150 n. 3 (E.D.Pa.1986). However, a document will fall within the scope of the work-product doctrine only if it was prepared primarily in anticipation of future litigation. <em>See Diet Drugs, </em>2001 WL 34133955, at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The parties implore me to draw broad conclusions about whether entire categories of communications are privileged. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 37 (seeking a ruling \u201cthat UEP has not sustained its burden of demonstrating that a common interest privilege existed over pre-2009 communications\u201d); UEP\u2019s Br. at 8 (arguing \u201ccommunications between counsel for UEP and individual representatives of UEP members must be treated and protected like those among counsel for a corporation and its employees\u201d). Although such conclusions might be helpful to guide the parties as they engage in future discovery in this litigation, I must confine my analysis to the actual disputes at hand. <em>Cf. Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 386, 101 S.Ct. 677 (\u201c[W]e sit to decide concrete cases and not abstract propositions of law. We decline to lay down a broad rule or series of rules to govern all conceivable future questions in this area, even were we able to do so.\u201d). Accordingly, I must focus on the specific contents of each disputed communication, coupled with \u201cthe unique context that led to [each document\u2019s] creation.\u201d <em>Faloney v. Wachovia Bank, </em>254 F.R.D. 204, 210 n. 7 (E.D.Pa.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">UEP has the burden of establishing each document at issue is privileged. <em>LeCroy, </em>348 F.Supp.2d at 382. To satisfy its obligation, UEP primarily has chosen to rely on the content of the documents themselves, as well as an affidavit of its current general counsel, Kevin Haley (\u201cthe Haley affidavit\u201d). <em>See </em>UEP\u2019s Br. at 19-44. It offered no testimony or affidavits from the parties to the communications at issue, or from any UEP members, revealing their understanding of their relationship with UEP counsel or whether they intended such communications to be confidential. As a general matter, \u201cstatements in briefs cannot be treated as evidence and a document for in camera inspection cannot establish all the privilege\u2019s elements.\u201d <em>Faloney, </em>254 F.R.D. at 212-13. With that in mind, I will address each communication in turn and explain how UEP has failed to satisfy its burden of establishing privilege.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">A. <em>January 2008 Memorandum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The earliest document at issue is a January 17, 2003 memorandum by Garth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Sparboe, Sparboe\u2019s vice president and a member of UEP\u2019s Animal Welfare Committee. The memorandum is addressed to UEP\u2019s senior vice president Gene Gregory, UEP\u2019s board and executive committee chairman Mike Bynum, UEP\u2019s Animal Welfare Committee chairman Paul Bahan, and UEP\u2019s general counsel Irving Isaacson. It \u201cprovides information and analysis ... regarding the economic impact of the animal welfare program.\u201d UEP\u2019s Br. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Although it would be possible for members of a UEP committee to engage in privileged attorney-client discussions with UEP\u2019s general counsel about legal matters related to the committee\u2019s work, <em>see In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </em>268 F.R.D. 114, 116 (D.D.C.2010), \u201cmerely copying an attorney on [a communication] does not establish that the communication is privileged,\u201d <em>IP Co., </em>2008 WL 3876481, at *3. UEP claims the memorandum is protected, arguing Isaacson was one of the recipients, Isaacson \u201cunderstood [it] to be confidential and maintained it as such,\u201d and its topic was \u201cthe contours of the animal welfare program ... which was, at least in part, a legal exercise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32-33 (citing and quoting the Haley affidavit).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">UEP\u2019s assertions fail to establish the memorandum is privileged. First, nothing about the memorandum or its contents suggests\u2014 either explicitly or implicitly \u2014 that the document was prepared in connection with a request for, or the provision of, legal advice. It is not marked \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cattorney-client privileged.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It contains no requests for Isaacson\u2019s opinion about any legal matter. It does not refer to any request by Isaacson for factual information from the committee related to a legal issue Isaacson was considering on behalf of UEP. Rather, the memorandum describes certain decisions made by a \u201cscientific committee,\u201d primarily regarding cage density. As UEP correctly observed, it describes the \u201ceconomic impact\u201d of the Program, not any of the Program\u2019s legal ramifications. UEP\u2019s Br. at 32. Thus, the memorandum is not facially \u201cfor the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance.\u201d <em>See Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Second, nothing else in the record supplements the contents of the document and establishes the memorandum was, in fact, a request by Sparboe or his committee for legal advice or a response to a request by Isaacson for facts necessary to provide legal advice. The Haley affidavit asserts only that Isaacson \u201cunderstood the ... memo ... to be the provision of factual information to assist [him] in providing legal advice to UEP regarding the development and negotiation of the [Program].\u201d UEP\u2019s Br. at Ex. A \u00b6 10; <em>accord id. </em>at Ex. B p. 4. Even if I were to credit that assertion, it sheds no light on the intent of the document\u2019s drafter or on the circumstances that led to the document\u2019s preparation. The Haley affidavit does not establish Isaacson asked the committee for facts that were necessary to resolve a legal issue on behalf of UEP, or that the memorandum was related to a request by the committee for legal guidance from Isaacson. Absent such evidence, UEP has not established a critical element of privilege.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 359; <em>IP Co., </em>2008 WL 3876481, at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>B. <em>June &amp; July 2003 Letters</em></p>\n<p id=\"AN1\">The documents that appear to be at the heart of this motion, and the primary focus of the parties\u2019 briefs, are letters dated June 26 and July 10, 2003, from Robert Sparboe, Sparboe\u2019s president, to Al Pope, UEP\u2019s president. The parties agree neither letter was ever sent. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 29, 31; <em>id. </em>at Ex. F pp. 3-4, 6. Neither Sparboe nor Pope is an attorney. The June letter is designated \u201cPersonal <em>&amp; </em>Confidential\u201d; the July letter bears only a \u201cCertified Mail\u201d marking. Sparboe\u2019s counsel was copied only on the July letter, while UEP\u2019s counsel was copied on neither. In both letters, Sparboe expresses concerns about the legality and economic impact of the Program. Similar\u2014 and, in some instances, nearly identical\u2014 concerns appear in a November 5, 2003 letter from Sparboe\u2019s counsel to UEP\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">UEP claims the June and July 2003 letters are privileged, characterizing them as drafts of the November 2003 letter, which it claims is privileged. <em>See </em>UEP\u2019s Br. at 19-29. Although \u201cpreliminary drafts of a document that is ultimately sent to counsel\u201d may constitute privileged communications, <em>Laethem Equip. Co. v. Deere &amp; Co., </em>261 F.R.D. 127, 140 (E.D.Mich.2009); <em>accord WebXchange Inc. v. Dell Inc., </em>264 F.R.D. 123, 127 (D.Del.2010), not every document containing facts later conveyed to counsel is automatically blanketed in privilege, <em>cf. Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 395, 101 S.Ct. 677 (facts underlying an attorney-client communication are not privileged). As the party claiming the privilege, UEP must establish the June and July 2003 letters constitute drafts of a privileged communication. <em>Cf. King Drug, </em>2011 WL 2623306, at *4 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">To sustain its privilege claims, UEP must offer evidence showing: (1) Sparboe prepared the June and July 2003 letters as drafts of the November 2003 letter; (2) Spar-boe intended the November 2003 letter to convey a privileged request for legal advice; and (3) Sparboe\u2019s disclosure of the June and July 2003 letters to Plaintiffs did not constitute waiver of any privilege. UEP has not adduced sufficient evidence to support any of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">First, UEP relies entirely on the text of the two letters at issue to support its view that they are drafts of the November 2003 letter. Indeed, both letters contain passages that are echoed, sometimes verbatim, in the November 2003 letter. Nevertheless, there are also substantial differences in the letters\u2019 content,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and several passages that UEP construes as \u201cexplicit[] requests\u201d for legal advice in the November 2003 letter, UEP\u2019s Br. at 22, are absent from the two earlier letters. UEP has offered no affidavits or other evidence showing Sparboe prepared the two earlier letters as drafts of the later one, or that Sparboe views them as such.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although UEP suggests Sparboe\u2019s claim of privilege with respect to the November 2003 letter implies its production of the earlier letters was inadvertent, Sparboe has not claimed inadvertence or sought to claw back the earlier letters. Moreover, as Plaintiffs suggest, <em>see </em>Pis.\u2019 Reply at 19, Sparboe\u2019s production of the two letters while withholding the November 2003 letter could also imply it does not view the letters as drafts. Without additional evidence resolving these ambiguities and clarifying Sparboe\u2019s intent, UEP has not established the June and July 2003 letters are drafts of a privileged communication. Considered on their own, the two letters are merely communications from one executive to another with no apparent involvement by either executive\u2019s attorney and, therefore, are not privileged, even if Sparboe and UEP were viewed as parts of a \u201csingle entity\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>UEP urges. <em>Cf. Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 394, 396, 101 S.Ct. 677 (finding communications between corporate employees and general counsel \u201cmade at the direction of corporate superiors in order to secure legal advice from counsel\u201d are protected, and declining to extend ruling beyond facts presented).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Second, assuming the documents at issue are drafts of the November 2003 letter, UEP has offered nothing beyond the text of the November 2003 letter to establish its privileged nature. According to UEP, the November 2003 letter contains six separate requests for legal opinions from UEP\u2019s counsel. UEP\u2019s Br. at 22. UEP, however, has failed to acknowledge, and offer evidence to resolve, ambiguities apparent on the face of the letter. <em>Cf. Faloney, </em>254 F.R.D. at 212-13 (a party cannot establish all elements of privilege through the contested document itself). The November 2003 letter does not contain any \u201cattorney-client privileged\u201d markings. In fact, the record suggests the author of the letter \u2014 Sparboe\u2019s in-house counsel \u2014 \u201cdid not think [UEP\u2019s counsel] was acting as Spar-boe\u2019s lawyer.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at Ex. H (entry 14). The language used by Sparboe\u2019s counsel suggests he was writing on behalf of Sparboe as a separate corporation with its own legal advisor, and not as an agent or quasi-employee of UEP.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The letter itself contains some passages that resemble requests for legal advice, while other portions are better described as accusations and demands for explanations. For example, the third paragraph of the letter appears to be seeking a legal opinion about UEP\u2019s status under the Capper-Volstead Act. The fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs, however, simply demand that UEP justify its legally questionable acts. In fact, those demands are the portions of the letter that also appear, in some form, in the earlier letters, both of which also included what might be viewed as a threat by Sparboe to terminate its membership in UEP. Without more, UEP has not established the November 2003 letter is privileged in its entirety.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Third, even if I were to conclude the June and July 2003 letters were privileged as drafts of a protected attorney-client communication, Sparboe\u2019s production of the June and July 2003 letters to Plaintiffs would constitute waiver of any privilege.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> UEP has failed to adduce any evidence showing Sparboe \u2014 or any of its members \u2014 intended to be a party to a privileged, confidential, common-interest relationship with UEP\u2019s counsel for purposes of the letters at issue. The content of the letters suggests Sparboe, advised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>its in-house counsel, was protecting its own interests by challenging what it perceived to be questionable policies and decision-making on the part of UEP. UEP has not established Sparboe\u2019s counsel intended the November 2003 letter (or the earlier letters) to be \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a common-interest relationship. <em>See LeCroy, </em>348 F.Supp.2d at 381; <em>see also Robinson, </em>214 F.R.D. at 451-52 (assessing an association member\u2019s relationship with association counsel on a case-by-case basis, and requiring proof beyond association counsel\u2019s perception that \u201can actual or sought after attorney-client relationship\u201d existed between all association members and association counsel before applying a common-interest privilege).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Finally, UEP\u2019s claim of work-product protection fails as to the June and July 2003 letters as well. Neither letter reveals anything about the mental processes of UEP\u2019s counsel, nor is there any evidence they were prepared at the direction of UEP\u2019s counsel. The only arguable link to any counsel is to Sparboe\u2019s in-house attorney \u2014 if the letters are viewed as drafts of the November 2003 letter. Sparboe has not claimed the letters are work-product protected, and it is not within UEP\u2019s power to invoke such a claim on Sparboe\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">C. <em>October 2003 and October 2008 Emails</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Two other disputed communications are related in content and subject to similar anal-yses. Both are internal Sparboe E-mails that summarize conversations to which both Sparboe and UEP representatives were parties. The first, dated October 2, 2003, is from Sparboe\u2019s in-house counsel to its outside counsel, with Sparboe executives copied. It relates to a previous conversation among Sparboe\u2019s counsel regarding aspects of the Program and a July 2003 meeting between Sparboe representatives and UEP\u2019s president. The same meeting is referenced in the July and November 2003 letters discussed above. The E-mail is marked \u201cattorney/client privileged communication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The second set of E-mails are dated October 16 and 17, 2008, and were exchanged among a group of nine Sparboe executives. None of Sparboe\u2019s in-house or outside counsel are copied. The E-mails summarize a recent UEP Annual Meeting, and in two locations reference general comments made by UEP\u2019s counsel before the meeting about pending lawsuits. The E-mails do not describe under what circumstances, or to whom, such comments were made, nor do they contain any \u201cprivileged\u201d or \u201cconfidential\u201d markings.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Although neither its counsel nor any of its representatives were parties to the October 2003 and 2008 E-mails, UEP asserts both Emails are privileged. <em>See </em>UEP\u2019s Br. at 30-32, 34-35. It argues the 2003 E-mail references a meeting between Sparboe and UEP, including \u201c[n]o nonmembers,\u201d and is therefore a privileged communication under <em>Upjohn. Id. </em>at 31. It further suggests the Email is privileged because it reveals the substance of a subsequent \u201cdirect request for legal advice\u201d made by Sparboe\u2019s counsel to UEP\u2019s counsel in the November 5, 2003 letter. <em>Id. </em>UEP characterizes the 2008 E-mails as including \u201cclassic legal advice\u201d from Haley, and further suggests they \u201cmemorialize Haley\u2019s proposed litigation strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. In his affidavit, Haley avers he \u201cdo[es] not recall making [the] statement [attributed to him] in any UEP Board or Committee meeting ... or in the presence of non-UEP members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Ex. A \u00b6 12; <em>see also id. </em>at Ex. B pp. 6-7 (\u201cHaley does not recall specifically providing the legal advice attributed to him ... [and] does not believe he would have communicated this advice to anyone other than UEP members, UEP staff, and UEP committee members or advisors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Again, UEP has failed to establish the E-mail communications are entitled to protection.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the October 2003 E-mail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Sparboe\u2019s in-house counsel describes the July 2003 meeting with UEP\u2019s president as one in which Sparboe expressed its concerns about certain issues, but specifically notes it made no formal request that UEP should obtain any legal opinions from its counsel (who was not present at the meeting).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> UEP has offered no evidence to demonstrate that, notwithstanding the language of the document itself, the 2003 E-mail reveals a request by Sparboe for legal advice from UEP. Its primary argument in support of its privilege claim regarding the 2003 E-mail depends on UEP\u2019s view that the E-mail reveals the content of the November 5, 2003 letter. Although the concerns referenced in the E-mail are similar to those outlined in the letter, for the reasons discussed above, <em>see supra </em>section III.B, UEP cannot rely on the letter to retroactively render privileged all previous communications on certain topics or containing certain facts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">UEP fares no better with respect to the October 2008 E-mails. The documents themselves shed no light on precisely who was present when UEP\u2019s counsel commented on the pending litigation before the October 2008 meeting. Plaintiffs have adduced evidence suggesting UEP meetings, including committee meetings and sessions at which UEP\u2019s counsel spoke, were open to the public and the trade press until 2009. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at Ex. B (deposition transcript at Ex. 10, announcing certain UEP committee meetings no longer \u201copen to everyone\u201d as of January 2009); <em>see also id. </em>(deposition transcript at Ex. 9, showing trade press present for UEP meetings, including those at which UEP counsel discussed legal issues). UEP\u2019s only evidence as to the circumstances under which its counsel made the statements summarized in the October 2008 E-mails is essentially an averment by counsel that he cannot recall the statements, but probably would not have made them to anyone unaffiliated with UEP or its membership. <em>See </em>UEP\u2019s Br. at Ex. A \u00b6 12; <em>id. </em>at Ex. B p. 6-7. That sort of speculation and conjecture cannot satisfy UEP\u2019s burden of proving the 2008 E-mails contain confidential, privileged legal advice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">D. <em>September 2005 Fax</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">The final document at issue is a two-page fax dated September 12, 2005, sent to Al Pope (UEP\u2019s president) by Haley (its general counsel). The fax cover sheet contains boilerplate language stating it \u201cmay contain information that is privileged, confidential, and exempt from disclosure under applicable law.\u201d The second page of the fax contains what appears to be advice to UEP about its policies regarding contact with its members\u2019 customers. If that were the end of the story, the document likely would be protected, and Plaintiffs probably would not be seeking to compel its production.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">However, the fax was precipitated by Sparboe\u2019s withdrawal from the Program, as well as a September 6, 2005 letter from Sparboe\u2019s president to UEP\u2019s chairman accusing a UEP staff member of interfering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>with Sparboe\u2019s relationships with its customers, and threatening legal action if the interference continued. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at Ex. A (UEPPRIV009). Moreover, the record reveals UEP forwarded the fax, in its entirety, to Sparboe\u2019s president as an attachment to its September 12, 2005 response to Sparboe\u2019s letter. <em>See </em>UEP\u2019s Br. at Ex. W; <em>see also id. </em>at Ex. B p. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">UEP claims the fax is privileged, offering an E-mail from its counsel to its president discussing the fax as evidence it contained legal advice sought by a client from his attorney. UEP\u2019s Br. at 35-37 &amp; Ex. V (submitted in camera). Based on that evidence, I agree the fax would qualify for protection, assuming it remained confidential. Plaintiffs argue, however, that any privilege was waived when UEP\u2019s president and chairman attached the fax to their letter to Sparboe.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Pis.\u2019 Br. at 33-34. UEP responds by invoking a broad view of the common-interest privilege, pointing to Sparboe\u2019s status as a UEP member at the time, and characterizing the exchange as \u201csharing [a] corporation counsel\u2019s advice with the person within the corporation who raised [a] concern.\u201d UEP\u2019s Br. at 37 (citing Upjohn).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Although counsel for UEP suggested this document is the \u201cclosest call and probably the hardest one in the stack,\u201d Oral Arg. Tr. at 88, I disagree. Sparboe\u2019s September 6, 2005 letter to UEP was essentially a cease- and-desist letter. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at Ex. A (UEPPRIV009). It cannot be characterized as \u201craising] a legal question\u201d or \u201cconcern.\u201d UEP\u2019s Br. at 37. The letter did not request legal advice or assistance. It accused UEP of committing a tort, demanded that the actions cease, and threatened a lawsuit if they did not. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at Ex. A (UEP-PRIV009). With respect to the issues raised in the letter and addressed in UEP\u2019s response, Sparboe and UEP shared no common legal interest; rather, they were poised as adversaries in threatened litigation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, UEP has not established a central element of the common-interest privilege with respect to the September 2005 fax.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>See Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 364 (\u201c[A]ll members of the community must share a common legal interest in the shared communication.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Moreover, for purposes of this exchange, there is no evidence Sparboe was acting as an agent of UEP, in its role as a member of the organization or any of its boards or committees. Instead, Sparboe was acting in its own interests, as an independent corporation advised by its own counsel. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at Ex. A (UEPPRIV009). To treat Sparboe as \u201cperson within [the UEP] corporation,\u201d at least as to this communication, would \u201cfail[ ] to respect the corporate form.\u201d <em>Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 371. There may be instances in which the principles from <em>Upjohn </em>would render privileged communications between UEP\u2019s counsel and employees of its member companies. <em>See supra </em>note 16. For example, if Sparboe\u2019s president, acting in his capacity as a member of a UEP committee, sought advice about a legal issue confronting the organization as a whole; or if UEP\u2019s counsel were conducting a factual investigation related to a legal issue facing UEP, and in the course of his investigation interviewed Sparboe executives after making them aware of the purpose for the interview. This, however, is not one of those instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">E. <em>Witness Interviews</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">In addition to the six documents discussed above, UEP has asserted that certain information shared during interviews of Sparboe\u2019s representatives by Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel is privileged. UEP\u2019s Br. at 38-44. Those interviews were apparently memorialized in notes taken by Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, and then summarized with little detail in a chart prepared by Plaintiffs for UEP\u2019s review. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Ex. H. After receiving the chart, UEP prepared its own chart raising potential privilege claims regarding many of the entries on Plaintiffs\u2019 chart. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br., at Ex. E.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Neither chart is sufficient to allow me to determine whether, and to what extent, Plaintiffs have elicited privileged information from Sparboe witnesses. Although the burden is on UEP to establish the elements of its privilege claim, it cannot be faulted for failing to satisfy its burden when it had limited information from which to assess its claims as to the content of the interviews. I will deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion with respect to the witness interviews without sustaining UEP\u2019s claims of privilege with respect to the chart. The parties should revisit the issue, mindful of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">\u2022 Any statements by Sparboe witnesses during interviews or in interrogatories related to the six documents at issue in this motion are not privileged, as I have determined the underlying documents are not privileged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">\u2022 Any statements related to communications between a Sparboe representative and UEP\u2019s counsel would be privileged only if UEP can establish either: (i) the Sparboe representative was acting in his capacity as a UEP member representative and communicated with UEP\u2019s counsel in connection with counsel\u2019s provision of legal advice to UEP; or (ii) the Spar-boe representative intended to enter a privileged relationship with UEP\u2019s counsel and sought confidential legal advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">\u2022 Failure to adduce evidence showing Sparboe\u2019s intent and expectations in connection with any disputed communications will likely complicate, if not defeat, any future privilege claims by UEP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">If the parties are unable to resolve the privilege issues related to the witness interviews on their own, they may request that I review Plaintiffs\u2019 interview notes to determine what, if any, attorney-client privileged or work-produet protected information they contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">An appropriate order follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">AND NOW, this 19th day of October, 2011, upon consideration of Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Compel Production of Sparboe Documents and Other Information (doc. 511), the accompanying memorandum of law (doc. 514), any responses and replies thereto (docs. 521, 528, 535), after oral argument on September 13, 2011, and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion, it is hereby ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED without prejudice in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">The motion is granted with respect to the six documents at issue.

That observation does not dictate any particular result here, now that the parties have extensively briefed the nuances of privilege law as it applies to the specific communications at issue.

Although I may consider Haley\u2019s account of what Isaacson told him for purposes of this motion, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 104(a), I conclude those portions of Haley's affidavit are entitled to little weight. First, they recount conversations between Haley and Isaacson that took place nearly a year ago. UEP\u2019s Br. at Ex. A 11 9. Second, they pertain to events that took place approximately eight years ago. <em>Id. </em>Third, I have no way of assessing whether, and to what extent, Isaacson\u2019s age and health problems may have impacted his ability to recall and accurately recount this information at the time of his conversations with Haley.

Sparboe has not produced the November 2003 letter to Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs have not sought to compel its production here. <em>See </em>Pis.' Reply at 19, 21 &amp; n. 32. It is relevant to my discussion, however, because UEP\u2019s claims of privilege regarding the June and July letters largely depend on the status of the November letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">. For example, the June 2003 letter contains discussions of consumer confidence in the egg industry's \"animal welfare friendliness,\u201d and the need for \"consistent and thorough auditing procedures,\u201d neither of which appear in the subsequent letters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b169-11\">.

The letter refers to \"UEP, or you as their counsel,\u201d and asks how \"UEP has prepared itself\u201d to respond to certain claims. It does not use terms like \"us,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \"our counsel\u201d which would show Sparboe viewed itself and UEP as part of a single entity with the same attorney, as UEP maintains.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b170-6\">. To date, Sparboe has withheld the November 2003 letter from its production to Plaintiffs. Based on the language of the letter, it is difficult to imagine either UEP or Sparboe establishing a legitimate privilege claim over the entire letter. However, Plaintiffs are not currently challenging Sparboe\u2019s privilege claim, so I will not evaluate it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. For purposes of these letters, the record could not reasonably support the finding, urged by UEP, that Sparboe \u2014 which it views as a quasi-employee of \"single entity\" UEP \u2014 was incapable of waiving any privilege. <em>See </em>UEP\u2019s Br. at 26-27 (citing only cases holding dissenting corporate officers cannot waive the corporation's privilege). There is no evidence the letters were drafted by Sparboe\u2019s counsel while he was wearing his \"UEP member representative hat,\u201d and not his \"in-house counsel for Sparboe hat.\u201d <em>Cf. Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 372. At most, he may have been seeking legal advice for Sparboe from UEP's counsel, thus rendering Sparboe the \"client\u201d for privilege purposes. Any other view would extend <em>Upjohn </em>beyond its intended reach and ignore Sparboe\u2019s separate corporate form. <em>See id. </em>(\"[A]bsent some compelling reason to disregard entity separateness, in the typical case courts should treat the various members of [a] corporate group as the separate corporations they are and not as one client.\u201d). UEP has cited cases acknowledging that, in some instances, communications between representatives of an organization\u2019s member entities and the organization\u2019s counsel may be privileged. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

The parties dispute whether the letters were prepared \"in anticipation of litigation.\u201d <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 30; UEP\u2019s Br. at 28-29. I need not reach that issue.

UEP\u2019s other privilege theories are inapplicable to the 2003 E-mail because its counsel was not present at the July 2003 meeting referenced therein, and it has offered no evidence the meeting took place at the request of its counsel or as part of a fact-gathering process initiated by its counsel. <em>Cf. Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 394-95, 101 S.Ct. 677 (\u201cThe communications at issue were made by Upjohn employees to counsel for Upjohn acting as such, at the direction of corporate superiors in order to secure legal advice from counsel.\u201d); <em>Teleglobe, </em>493 F.3d at 364 (common-interest privilege permits attorneys to share information with one another).

My review of the 2008 Emails reveals they contain no \"proposed litigation strategy,\u201d UEP\u2019s Br. at 34; rather, the only comment attributed to UEP\u2019s counsel is a general statement that discussion of topics related to the litigation should occur privately. Such a comment does not amount to the sort of \"mental processes\u201d necessary to \"analyze and prepare [a] client\u2019s case\u201d that the work-product doctrine was intended to shelter, <em>see Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 238, 95 S.Ct. 2160, particularly where the record is devoid of proof regarding where, and to whom, the statement was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b173-6\">.
