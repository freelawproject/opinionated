In the context of informing parents of two and three year olds that the children\u2019s teacher has been terminated, defendant\u2019s statements were reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning and slanderous per se because they directly implied that plaintiff had done something so egregious that it made her unfit to practice her profession even one more day <em>(see People v Grasso, </em>21 AD3d 851 [2005]; <em>Chiavarelli v Williams, </em>256 AD2d 111 [1998]).
