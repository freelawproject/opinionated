Tried below before the Hon. R. E. Beckham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A50\">This was an action by appellee, Bowie, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by his wife. Mrs. Bowie, with her child, was a passenger for hire in the two-horsestage run by appellant, Gallagher, between Weatherford and Graham. At a stopping place on the road the driver left the stage, without fastening the horses, or leaving anyone to hold them. They took fright, and, while running away, Mrs. Bowie jumped from the stage and sustained serious bodily injuries. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee for $250.50.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Am6\"><em>Harcourt &amp; Ball, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGz\">on the duty 'of carriers of passengers, cited: 2 Wait\u2019s Acts. and Def., 63, 68, 69. and cases cited; Railway Company <em>v. </em>Underwood, 64 Tex., 469; Albright v.

The elements of damage in such cases have been repeatedly stated in former decisions, and mental suffering has never been excluded from the list. The charge of the court on this branch of the case was entirely unexceptionable</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">Mrs. Bowie was a passenger in appellant\u2019s stage for hire, and appellant owed her the degree of care due by a common carrier of passengers. The court instructed the jury that it was the duty of the carrier to employ a competent driver, and of the driver to use the \u201cutmost care\u201d for the safety of the passengers. The jury was not instructed that the negligence of the driver was that of his master. This omission could only have prejudiced appellee. The charge properly stated the degree of care exacted by the law of carriers of passengers. Thompson on Carriers, 200; Hutchins on Carriers, sec. 501; Shear. &amp; Redf. on Neg., sec. 266. That degree is generally described by the authorities as \u201cthe utmost,\u201d and the use of this expression in the charge was not objectionable. If it needed explanation or qualification, appellant should have requested a special charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-29\">There was no lack of evidence to sustain the verdict. The horses were left practically free to run away, if they had that disposition. Any reasonable caution would have prevented the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-31\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-32\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-33\">[Opinion delivered May 18, 1886.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
