On this appeal only the attorney, or attorneys, for the guardian ad litem, and attorney, or attorneys, for the guardians appointed by the probate judge will be heard,\u201d and on the points properly raised by said appeal and, <em>inter alia,, </em>the two as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\u201c(a) Whether there was reversible error in the failure of the probate judge to notify the guardian ad litem on the hearing held by the probate judge on the qualification of permanent guardians; and</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">\u201c(b) On the question whether the present guardian ad litem has assumed an inconsistent position as a candidate for appointment as a permanent guardian and should, therefore, be replaced as a guardian ad litem.\u201d <em>Philip L. Riee, </em>Chief Justice, <em>Ingram M. Stainbaolc, </em>Associate Justice, <em>Masaji Marumoto, </em>Associate Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
