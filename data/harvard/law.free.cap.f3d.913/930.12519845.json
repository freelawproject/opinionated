In 2012, while still in prison, Taylor filed a state post-conviction petition advancing newly discovered evidence: an expert, using new and more sophisticated investigative techniques, determined that arson did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   cause the hotel fire. The government disputed Taylor's new theory but nevertheless agreed to the following procedure. The government and Taylor entered into a plea agreement in 2013 under which the original convictions were vacated and, in their place, Taylor pleaded no contest to the same counts, was resentenced to time served, and was released from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Taylor then sued Pima County and the City of Tucson in state court, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging violations of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. With respect to the County, Taylor alleged unconstitutional practices, policies, and customs regarding criminal prosecutions, including racially motivated prosecutions of African-Americans and a failure to train and supervise deputy prosecutors. The City removed the case to federal court, and the County consented to removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The County then moved to dismiss Taylor's operative complaint. Two of the County's arguments are relevant on appeal. First, the County argued that the relevant government officials acted on behalf of the State, not the County; the County asserted that, accordingly, it was entitled to \"Eleventh Amendment immunity.\" Second, the County argued that, because all of Taylor's time in prison was supported by the valid 2013 criminal judgment, Taylor could not recover damages for wrongful incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The district court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. The court held that the County was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. But the court agreed with the County that Taylor could not recover damages for wrongful incarceration. The district court then certified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), concluding that resolution of several legal issues \"may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Both parties applied to this court for permission to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (permitting an \"application for\n   an appeal hereunder\"). The County sought permission to appeal the district court's denial of immunity, and Taylor sought permission to appeal the district court's ruling that he may not recover damages for wrongful incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A motions panel of this court denied both applications to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1292(b). But the motions panel construed the County's application, in part, as a timely notice of appeal from the denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cortez v.

On preliminary review, the motions panel concluded that appellate jurisdiction appeared to be proper under the collateral-order doctrine because the County asserted \"Eleventh Amendment immunity.\" \"Although we defer to the ruling of the motions panel granting an order for interlocutory appeal, we have an independent duty to confirm that our jurisdiction is proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Reese v.

The rationale of\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico Aqueduct\n   </em>\n   is that an interlocutory appeal is necessary to vindicate a state entity's entitlement to immunity from suit, which would be lost if a case were permitted to go to trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925055\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/139/#p147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But an immunity from liability may be vindicated fully after final judgment, so the collateral-order doctrine does not encompass an interlocutory appeal from a denial of immunity from liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SolarCity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276517\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/720/#p725\">\n    859 F.3d at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Unlike immunity from suit, immunity from liability can be protected by a post-judgment appeal.

In response, the County cited decisions from other circuits that have held that removal waives immunity from suit but does not waive immunity from liability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stroud v.

The County clarified that, in this case, it was asserting\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   immunity from liability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Reply Brief at 17 (\"Pima County asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity as a substantive bar to Taylor's claim.... In other words, it was asserted as\n   <em>\n    a bar to liability\n   </em>\n   rather than a bar to the federal court's ability to hear Taylor's claim.\" (emphasis added) ). The County's asserted immunity from liability can be vindicated fully after final judgment; accordingly, the collateral-order doctrine of \u00a7 1291 does not apply here.\n   <em>\n    SolarCity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276517\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/720/#p725\">\n    859 F.3d at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In conclusion, we exercise our discretion under \u00a7 1292(b) to deny the County's application for permission to appeal, and we conclude that \u00a7 1291 's collateral-order doctrine does not apply.

He asks that we review the district court's ruling that he may not recover compensatory damages for wrongful incarceration. In the highly unusual circumstances of this case, we agree to review that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Taylor seeks other forms of relief, such as nominal damages, so the district court's ruling does not dispose of his case entirely. But Taylor emphasizes the importance of the incarceration-related damages. From a practical standpoint, the district court's\n   ruling likely resolves a substantial portion of his case. Moreover, if we decline to review this issue now, he will not be able to obtain review until after discovery and, possibly, a trial. That ordinary result from a denial of interlocutory review has, in Taylor's view, uncommon consequences here. Taylor notes that he is in his sixties, having spent most of his life-42 years-in prison. The entire basis of his complaint is that his decades in prison were unconstitutional. He characterizes having to wait additional years before this important issue is resolved as \"yet another miscarriage of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As noted, we ordinarily do not disturb a motions panel's determination under \u00a7 1292(b).\n   <em>\n    Kuehner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793400\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/316/#p318\">\n    84 F.3d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But we agree with Taylor that a departure from our ordinary practice is justified, both because his situation is rare and because our own rulings have added to the delay. We initially denied discretionary review but ordered briefing on the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity, further forestalling final resolution of this case. We are persuaded to exercise our discretion under \u00a7 1292(b) to resolve this issue now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Taylor seeks damages for wrongful incarceration stemming from the 42 years that he spent in prison.

Under\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff in a \u00a7 1983 action may not seek a judgment that would necessarily imply the invalidity of a state-court conviction or sentence unless, for example, the conviction had been vacated by the state court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Taylor's 1972 jury conviction has been vacated by the state court, so\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   poses no bar to a challenge to that conviction or the resulting sentence. But Taylor's 2013 conviction, following his plea of no contest, remains valid. Accordingly, Taylor may not state a \u00a7 1983 claim if a judgment in his favor \"would necessarily imply the invalidity of his [2013] conviction or sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the district court summarized, \"\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   does not bar [Taylor] from raising claims premised on alleged constitutional violations that affect his 1972 convictions but do not taint his 2013 convictions.\" Recognizing that limitation, Taylor stresses that \"[h]e challenges his 1972 prosecution, convictions and sentence and does not challenge his 2013 'no contest' pleas\n   <em>\n    or sentence\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Taylor alleges that his 1972 conviction and resulting sentence were plagued by constitutional violations and that those errors initially caused his incarceration. Critically, however, all of the time that Taylor served in prison is supported by the valid 2013 state-court judgment. The state court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Taylor to time served. For that reason, even if Taylor proves constitutional violations concerning the 1972 conviction, he cannot establish that the 1972 conviction caused any incarceration-related damages. As a matter of law, the 2013 conviction caused the entire period of his incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

At the time of Tucson's Pioneer Hotel fire in 1972, Louis Taylor was an African American male of sixteen. Arrested near the hotel, he was convicted on the basis of little more than that proximity and trial evidence that \"black boys\" like to set fires. He has spent a lifetime of 42 years in prison following his wrongful conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   When he filed his state court petition the county that had prosecuted him did not even respond to his allegations of grievous deprivations of civil rights, including the withholding of evidence that the fire was not caused by arson at all, and the indicia of racial bias underlying the entire prosecution. Instead of responding, the county offered Taylor his immediate freedom in return for his pleading no contest to the original charges and agreeing to a sentence of time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   He accepted the offer, since his only alternative was to stay in prison and wait for his petition for collateral relief to wend its way through the courts, a process that could take years. Because his original conviction had been vacated and all of the prison time he had served was as a result of that invalid conviction, he filed this action to recover damages for his wrongful incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Yet the majority holds that he can recover nothing. Why? Because it interprets the few cases with circumstances remotely similar to this one to require the admittedly unfair holding that his plea agreement somehow validates or justifies the original sentence that deprived Taylor of a meaningful life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In my view our law is not that unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Our Circuit law actually supports the award of damages for the time Taylor served in prison as a result of an unlawful, and now vacated conviction. Our leading case is\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065308\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/755/\">\n    749 F.3d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2014), where, as here, the plaintiff's original conviction was vacated on habeas review. Hence, a claim for damages resulting from wrongful incarceration was not barred by\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065308\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/755/\">\n    749 F.3d at 760-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority acknowledges the same is true here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff could not recover damages, however, because the wrongful conviction had not yet resulted in any wrongful incarceration. This was because he was still serving other, earlier imposed sentences and never began serving the term imposed as a result of the unlawful conviction. In other words, there was a lack of causation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 762. Taylor, by contrast, served decades of imprisonment as a result of his first, vacated conviction, so there is no lack of causation here. Under\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , he should recover. That Taylor later, in order to gain prompt release, pleaded no contest to the charges and to a sentence of time served, does not undo the causal sentencing chain set in motion after the original, invalid conviction. The majority's\n   discussion is not consistent with\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Poventud\n   </em>\n   also supports reversal.\n   <em>\n    Poventud v. City of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067863\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/121/\">\n    750 F.3d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2014) (en banc). Poventud's conviction was vacated on collateral attack, on the basis of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, and a new trial was ordered.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 124. He then pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, pursuant to a plea agreement that dismissed all other charges and stipulated to a one-year sentence, with time already served.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Second Circuit held that Poventud's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   -based claim was not\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   -barred insofar as it related to his first conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 124-25, 134-36. As the en banc court explained, were Poventud to win at trial in his civil rights suit, \"the legal status of his [second conviction] would remain preserved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 138 (\n   <em>\n    quoted by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065308\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/755/\">\n    749 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   761 ). He was permitted to pursue a claim of damages for the time he served beyond the one year plea agreement stipulation. Judge Lynch's concurrence is also instructive, as it focuses on the injustice of relying on the subsequent guilty plea to deny Poventud a remedy for the unfairness of the first trial.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 138-47. The majority's decision ignores such injustice in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Taylor's case is even more compelling than those of\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Poventud\n   </em>\n   because his first conviction was so deeply tainted that we now know the disastrous fire may not have been set by anyone, and the prosecution was without adequate foundation from the beginning. He won more than a new trial, but virtual exoneration. His situation is therefore also different from the situation in\n   <em>\n    Olsen v. Correiro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1733534\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/189/52/#p55\">\n    189 F.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 1999), where the plaintiff's murder conviction was overturned but he was subsequently convicted of manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Far from being the product of a new, constitutionally-conducted second trial, Taylor's second conviction was the product of his desperate circumstances. In his 60's, he faced acceptance of the plea offer or waiting years for a habeas petition to work its way through the courts. We should not tolerate such coercive tactics to deprive persons of a remedy for violations of their constitutional rights. To say such a plea justifies the loss of 42 years, as the majority asserts, is to deny the reality of this situation and perpetuate an abuse of power that \u00a7 1983 should redress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Our court has spoken to this before:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"When prosecutors betray their solemn obligations and abuse the immense power they hold, the fairness of our entire system of justice is called into doubt and public confidence in it is undermined.\"\n   <em>\n    Silva v.
