In the course of processing millions of claims for benefits, United at times erroneously overpays service providers. United can generally recover these overpayments from \"in-network\" providers because it has agreements with those providers that allow it to \"offset\" the overpayment by withholding the overpaid amount from subsequent payments to that provider. In 2007, United implemented an aggregate payment and recovery procedure in which it began to offset overpayments made to \"out-of-network\" providers, even where the overpayment was made from one plan and the offset taken from a payment by a different plan, a practice known as cross-plan offsetting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The named plaintiffs in these consolidated class action cases are out-of-network medical providers who United intentionally failed to fully pay for services rendered to United plan beneficiaries in order to offset overpayments to the same providers from other United administered plans. The plaintiffs, litigating under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") on behalf of their patients, the plan beneficiaries, claim the relevant plan documents do not authorize United to engage in cross-plan offsetting. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   agreed and entered partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the issue of liability. United appealed the summary judgment order. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   United describes itself as \"the nation's leading health and well-being company.\" The United-administered health insurance plans at issue here are governed by ERISA as \"employee welfare benefit plans.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Many of these plans are self-insured, meaning the plan sponsor (often an employer) funds the plan while United administers it. United also administers fully-insured plans, which it both funds and administers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2007, United instituted its new aggregate payment and recovery procedure that included cross-plan offsetting. Class actions were filed in 2014 by Dr. Louis J. Peterson and in 2015 by Riverview Health Institute, each challenging United's practice of cross-plan offsetting. Dr. Peterson sued as an authorized representative of his patients. Riverview sued pursuant to an assignment of rights in its patient agreement. United moved to dismiss Riverview's action, in part because many of the plans contained provisions prohibiting assignments. The district court denied the motion. The district court consolidated the two class actions for purposes of discovery and as to summary judgment on whether the governing documents of the United-administered plans authorized cross-plan offsetting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   United filed motions for summary judgment and Dr. Peterson and Riverview filed motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. The district court denied United's motions and granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs. It rejected United's argument that Dr. Peterson lacked authority to sue as an authorized representative of his patients. On the\n   merits, the court reviewed the underlying plan documents and concluded that, of those plans that did address offsetting, \"all of those plans explicitly authorize same-plan offsetting; and not one of those plans explicitly authorizes cross-plan offsetting.\" Applying the factors set forth by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Finley v. Special Agents Mutual Benefit Association, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520235\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/617/#p621\">\n    957 F.2d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (8th Cir. 1992), the district court concluded that United's interpretation of the plan documents was not reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court certified its summary judgment order for immediate appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and this Court allowed United to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We will first address whether United's argument regarding the validity of Riverview's assignments from its patients is within the scope of our appellate jurisdiction in this interlocutory appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and whether Dr. Peterson is authorized to bring this action as a representative of his patients. We will then address the merits of the summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   a. Appellate Jurisdiction and Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   United advances two arguments as to why it believes Riverview and Dr. Peterson are not authorized to bring these actions. It argues that Riverview lacks standing to proceed as an assignee of its patients' claims because some of the relevant plan documents contain an enforceable anti-assignment provision. It also argues that Dr. Peterson lacks standing\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because he did not sufficiently disclose a conflict of interest with his patients, thus nullifying the agreements granting him the authority to act as their \"authorized representative.\" We conclude we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the district court's order regarding Riverview, but that Dr. Peterson does have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (i) Appellate Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court certified its summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which allows certification if \"such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" Prior to the certified summary judgment order, the district court denied United's motion to dismiss Riverview's claim. This ruling was alluded to in the district court's summary judgment order when it noted in a footnote that \"Riverview brings its action as the assignee of its patients' benefit claims.\" United asks this Court to review the district court's order regarding the validity of Riverview's assignment in this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Supreme Court has explained that in an appeal under \u00a7 1292(b), \"appellate jurisdiction applies to the\n   <em>\n    order\n   </em>\n   certified to the court of appeals, and is not tied to the particular question formulated by the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A. v.

True, the issue of the validity of Riverview's assignments is in some sense antecedent to the cross-plan offsetting issue in that it could be dispositive of Riverview's claim. But the mere fact that a separate and discrete legal issue could be dispositive of a claim is not alone sufficient to render it \"fairly included\" in, or \"inextricably intertwined\" with, the order subject to interlocutory review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706103\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/445/#p458\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706103\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/445/#p458\">\n    at 458-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, it argues that he has not sufficiently disclosed a conflict of interest between himself and his patients. United argues that the alleged risk to Dr. Peterson's patients, the plan beneficiaries, is that a provider like Dr. Peterson would \"balance bill\" them, charging them for the amount United failed to pay as an offset for an overpayment. United argues that for Dr. Peterson to prevail, he must show that he has the right to balance bill his patients, thus creating a conflict between himself and his patients that he has not sufficiently disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ERISA authorizes civil actions to recover benefits due under a plan to be brought by plan participants and beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Healthcare providers are generally not authorized under ERISA to sue on their own behalf, even if they are entitled to direct payment from the plan administrator by virtue of the plan's obligation to the patient and beneficiary, because the provider\n   is not itself a plan participant or beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grasso Enters., LLC v.

First, it overstates the extent of any potential conflict of interest. Having United pay for the services provided by Dr. Peterson with money rather than with an offset would of course be in Dr. Peterson's interest and would also be in the patients' interest (if it turns out the offset was not a valid \"payment\" of their obligation to Dr. Peterson) or at least not be adverse to their interest (if it turns out the offset was valid payment). Thus, there is no meaningful conflict between Dr. Peterson and his patients. Second, Dr. Peterson's disclosure of the supposed conflict of interest was sufficient. The engagement letter signed by Dr. Peterson's patients fairly and adequately explained United's contention that there was a conflict of interest. We conclude that Dr. Peterson is authorized to bring this action as a representative of his patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   b. United's Plan Interpretation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At issue in this interlocutory appeal is the question of whether the plan documents allow United to engage in cross-plan offsetting. While there are many different plans at issue here, with varying plan language, each plan grants United broad authority to interpret and implement the plan. \"Where an ERISA plan grants the administrator discretion ... to interpret the plan's terms, courts must apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review.\"\n   <em>\n    Wengert v. Rajendran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516477\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/725/#p727\">\n    886 F.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 727 (8th Cir. 2018) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Green v.

First, nothing in the plan documents even comes close to authorizing cross-plan offsetting, the practice of not paying a benefit due under one plan in order to recover an amount believed to be owed to another plan because of that other plan's overpayment. We agree with the district court's summation that \"not one of th[e] plans explicitly authorizes cross-plan offsetting.\" To adopt United's argument that the plan language granting it broad authority to administer the plan is sufficient to authorize cross-plan offsetting would be akin to adopting a rule that anything not forbidden by the plan is permissible. Such an approach would undermine plan participants' and beneficiaries' ability to rely on plan documents to know what authority administrators do and do not have. It would also conflict with ERISA's requirement that \"[e]very employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201102\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). United's assertion that it has the authority to engage in cross-plan offsetting can hardly be called an interpretation because it has virtually no basis in the text of the plan documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, the practice of cross-plan offsetting is in some tension with the requirements of ERISA. While we need not decide here whether cross-plan offsetting necessarily violates ERISA, at the very least it approaches the line of what is permissible.

Cross-plan offsetting is in tension\n   with this fiduciary duty because it arguably amounts to failing to pay a benefit owed to a beneficiary under one plan in order to recover money for the benefit of another plan.

It also may constitute a transfer of money from one plan to another in violation of ERISA's \"exclusive purpose\" requirement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Similarly to how we consider \"whether [an] interpretation conflicts with the substantive or procedural requirements of the ERISA statute\" in evaluating whether a plan interpretation is reasonable,\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520235\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/617/#p621\">\n    957 F.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we view interpretations that authorize practices that push the boundaries of what ERISA permits with some skepticism.
