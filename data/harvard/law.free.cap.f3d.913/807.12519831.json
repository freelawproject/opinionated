Because Lopez admitted to the offense conduct, the only issue before the jury was the affirmative defense of duress. Lopez claims that she purchased a handgun for Hector Karaca using her identical twin sister's ID in violation of her probation and federal law because Karaca threatened to harm Lopez and her family if she failed to acquire a gun for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In support of her duress defense, Lopez asked the district court to allow her to introduce expert testimony on Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS) and the effects of past abuse. Lopez, who had been physically and sexually abused by her stepfather, contended that this evidence would \"help provide context\" to the jury regarding her fear of Karaca and why she did not seek help from the police. Lopez similarly asserted that the expert's description of the \"characteristics of [a] domestic violence victim\" would help explain her \"counterintuitive\" behavior regarding Karaca. The court, however, excluded this evidence in a series of oral rulings, concluding that BWS evidence is incompatible with the duress defense's use of an objective reasonable-person standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We join the weight of authority in holding that such expert testimony may be used by a defendant to support her duress defense and rehabilitate her credibility. We therefore find that the district court committed legal error in precluding Lopez's expert witness from testifying and conclude that this decision was prejudicial to her defense. Accordingly, we vacate her conviction and remand this case to the district court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lopez, who was twenty-seven years old at the time of the crimes at issue, dated Karaca when the two were teenagers. The relationship ended when Karaca was sentenced to eight-years imprisonment in\n   2006 for a convenience-store shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Karaca was released from prison during the Fall of 2013, but mere weeks later, police were searching for him in connection with a double homicide in Phoenix, Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2013, Karaca arrived at Lopez's home in Tucson, where she lived with her mother, her identical twin sister, her sister's two young children, and a teenage sibling. Karaca and Lopez spoke for several hours and drank together. Karaca eventually admitted to Lopez that night that he was \"on the run\" from the police due to a shooting and asked her if she knew where he could get a gun. She told him she did not, and Karaca accepted her answer. He later began making sexual advances towards Lopez, suggesting that they restart their relationship. Lopez initially rejected these overtures, telling Karaca that she was currently involved with someone else. Lopez \"push[ed] him away\" and \"told him no ... but he didn't stop\" and \"so [Lopez] just gave in.\" Karaca eventually left without further incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Two days later, however, Karaca returned to Lopez's home and again asked her about acquiring a gun. She explained to him at this point that she could not purchase a gun or \"be around\" one because she was on probation on a felony drug conviction. Karaca responded by grabbing Lopez by the arm and threatening that, if she failed to get him a gun, \"he[ ] [would] come back and shoot up [her] house and he [would] hurt [her] family.\" Several days later, Karaca returned to Lopez's home and was limping. He told her that he was in a \"shootout\" in the desert during a drug deal and was shot in the leg. Lopez later testified at her trial that Karaca's reference to a \"shootout\" made her believe that he already had a gun, which increased her fear that he would harm her family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Four days later, Karaca returned and demanded that Lopez purchase a gun for him that day from a nearby pawnshop. She again responded that she was on probation. Karaca then insisted that Lopez pose as her identical twin sister during the purchase, demanding that they go to Lopez's home and retrieve her sister's ID. After Lopez made various excuses as to why she could not obtain the ID that day, Karaca grabbed her again and threatened: \"I already told you what I was going to do if you don't get this gun for me. I know you don't want anything happening to your mom or your sisters.\" The two retrieved the ID and went to the pawnshop that same day, where Lopez purchased a Ruger pistol using the ID and her sister's identifying information. Shortly after she left the store, Karaca grabbed her purse, removed the gun, and walked away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two days later, Lopez saw Karaca one last time before her arrest. The two went together to a family barbeque hosted by her twin sister's ex-husband, who was also Karaca's friend. The three left the party at one point to go to the store, where Karaca accused Lopez of flirting with her sister's ex-husband and slapped her in the face. Karaca initially left but eventually returned to the party. Later that evening, Karaca grabbed Lopez's arm and told her he would \"f--- [her] up, and no one will do anything about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Twelve days after purchasing the gun for Karaca, Lopez met with her probation officer and a U.S. Marshal, who was searching for Karaca. Lopez initially denied knowing Karaca, but after the probation\n   officer found the pawnshop receipt in Lopez's purse, she admitted that she had purchased a gun for Karaca. Lopez also stated she was seeing Karaca romantically, referring to him at one point as \"my man.\" Lopez did not explain to the officers at this juncture why she had bought the gun for Karaca and did not claim that Karaca had threatened her. After refusing to provide them with any specifics on Karaca's location, Lopez was sent to jail. She later explained at trial that she was afraid that Karaca would harm her if he discovered she had spoken to the authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following day, two agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) interviewed Lopez in a private room in the jail. For the first time, Lopez claimed that she had purchased the gun for Karaca because he had threatened her and her family. She also informed the agents that Karaca had told her he had another gun. At trial, Lopez claimed that she only told the ATF agents these details-as opposed to her probation officer the previous day-because she felt \"safer in the jail\": \"[Karaca] can't get me when I'm ... in jail. There is no way of him getting ahold of me and finding out what I'm saying\" to the agents. Shortly thereafter, the police located Karaca in Tucson. He stole a vehicle using the gun purchased by Lopez and led the police on a lengthy car chase, which ended with Karaca taking his own life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In late 2014, Lopez was indicted on three federal charges: (1) false statement during the purchase of a firearm under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6), 924(a)(2) ; (2) aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(1), (c)(3) ; and (3) felon in possession of a firearm under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), 924(a)(2). The case proceeded to a jury trial. Lopez stipulated to many of the elements of these offenses and conceded that she purchased the firearm using the false\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Her trial strategy thus consisted entirely of proving that she acted under duress as a result of Karaca's threats against her and her family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Duress is not a statutory defense, but a common-law defense that allows a jury to find that the defendant's conduct is excused, even though the government has carried its burden of proof.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In order to establish the defense, a defendant bears the burden of proving three elements by a preponderance of the evidence: \"(1) [s]he was under an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury, (2) [s]he had a well grounded fear that the threat would be carried out, and (3) [s]he had no reasonable opportunity to escape.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/931/#p947\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If successful, a defendant is \"legally excuse[d]\" of the crime committed and must be found not guilty.\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687129\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/608/529/#p532\">\n    608 F.3d at 532-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to trial, Lopez advised the district court of her intent to introduce testimony from Dr. Cheryl Karp, an expert \"on issues of trauma, domestic violence, and victim behaviors.\" Lopez asserted that Dr. Karp's testimony would assist the jury \"in understanding the evidence because ... the trial [would] involve evidence as to coercion and threats of violence leading up to the day Karaca took her from her home and forced her to purchase a firearm for him.\" Lopez further contended that Dr. Karp's testimony regarding \"behaviors of victims of domestic violence\" would \"help provide context\" to her duress defense, including whether her fear of Karaca was\n   \"well-grounded\" and whether she had a \"reasonable opportunity\" to escape from him. Finally, Lopez asserted that Dr. Karp's testimony would \"liken to that of standard government expert testimony in a domestic violence case where there is the counter-argument that the victim's behavior was not consistent or credible victim behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The government moved in limine to exclude this testimony, primarily arguing that the testimony would be irrelevant because the duress defense applies an objective standard. In an oral ruling, the district court described the issue as \"pretty close\" but ultimately granted the government's motion: \"I don't see how [Dr. Karp] can do anything to tell this jury how a reasonable person would have acted under the circumstances, so I'm not letting her in for that purpose.\" Lopez moved for reconsideration at several points during trial, which the court orally denied each time. The district court did, however, instruct the jury on the duress defense and permitted Lopez herself to testify about how her experience as an abuse victim influenced her interactions with Karaca.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the jury rendered a guilty verdict on all counts, Lopez moved for a new trial, arguing in part that the preclusion of Dr. Karp's testimony prejudiced her defense. Included with the motion was Dr. Karp's affidavit, in which she provided more detail as to her intended testimony. Specifically, Dr. Karp asserted that \"[t]he jury [did] not have the proper knowledge base to understand some of the psychological explanations as to the dynamics involved in Battered Woman Syndrome and why Battered Women remain with abusive men, including the theory of Learned Helplessness.\" She further attested that her \"testimony would also have given the jury an opportunity to hear from an expert on Trauma and how that may have influenced [Lopez's] feelings when she did not seek the help of the police, given her own trauma history of being sexually abused by her stepfather and the police never protecting her.\" The court denied the motion in an oral ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court eventually sentenced Lopez to a combined 30-months imprisonment. Lopez filed a timely appeal, and we have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lopez claims that two erroneous evidentiary rulings prejudiced her duress defense. First, she argues that the district court erroneously excluded Dr. Karp's testimony regarding BWS. Because we hold that the district court committed reversible error by barring this expert testimony, we devote the bulk of our discussion below to addressing why such evidence is generally admissible. We then conclude by briefly addressing (and ultimately rejecting) Lopez's separate argument that the district court erred by excluding a video of her entire interview in jail with the ATF agents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Lopez argues that Dr. Karp's testimony supports two elements of the duress defense: (1) whether Lopez had a\n   <em>\n    well-grounded\n   </em>\n   fear that Karaca would harm her and her family if she refused to purchase a gun for him and (2) whether she had a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   opportunity to escape from him by calling the police. The government continues to counter that BWS evidence is incompatible with a duress defense because both aforementioned elements assess objective reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Willis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852614\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/170/#p176\">\n    38 F.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 (5th Cir. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n    956 F.2d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . BWS, the government argues, reflects only a defendant's \"subjective vulnerability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Like the majority of courts that have addressed this question, we are unpersuaded by this proposed distinction. Before turning to these authorities, however, we must first address our decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , which the government argued before the district court controls this question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   involved several female defendants who were convicted for their nominal participation in a violent drug organization.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n    956 F.2d at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Three of the defendants-Wood, Johnson, and Breck-had claimed that they acted under duress from the organization's \"kingpin,\" who threatened and assaulted two of the defendants and their immediate family members.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n    at 897-99, 901-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, we remanded these defendants' cases for resentencing, in part, because the district court erroneously believed that it lacked the authority under the sentencing guidelines to depart downward based on duress if a defendant failed to prove the affirmative defense at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n    at 900-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Before addressing each defendant's claims, we discussed the principles underlying duress generally. We specified that the defense applies an objective, reasonable-person standard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The formula is addressed to the impact of a threat of force upon a reasonable person: The fear must be \"well-grounded.\" There must be no \"reasonable\" opportunity to escape. The formula is in harmony with the analysis of duress in the Model Penal Code which recognizes duress in the use of unlawful force \"that a person of reasonable firmness in his [or her] situation would have been unable to resist.\" American Law Institute,\n   <em>\n    Model Penal Code\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.09(i) (1985).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n    at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In determining whether a fear is well-grounded, the jury may \"take into account\n   <em>\n    the objective situation\n   </em>\n   in which the defendant was allegedly subjected to duress.

In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , for instance, there was little doubt that the jury, in assessing the reasonableness of the defendants' fear, could properly consider the fact that the defendants had witnessed the kingpin commit brutal acts against others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n    at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Given the violence that [one defendant] had already observed on the part of [the kingpin], including his putting of dynamite in her housemate['s] ... mouth, she was under threat of immediate severe physical harm.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The more difficult question was \"whether a\n   <em>\n    special\n   </em>\n   vulnerability to fear-a vulnerability\n   <em>\n    not produced by those persons causing the defendant's criminal action\n   </em>\n   -may be taken into account.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n    at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). We noted that, \"[a]s a defense to a charge of criminal conduct, such subjective vulnerability has not been admitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Our analysis at this juncture was brief and opaque, however, as we provided no elaboration on what constitutes a special, subjective vulnerability to fear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Instead, we reasoned that there are factors related solely to\n   <em>\n    the defendant\n   </em>\n   -rather than to the coercing, threatening party-that may be considered in the reasonableness inquiry. Relying on the Model Penal Code (MPC), we highlighted \"[s]tark, tangible factors,\" such as a person's \"size, strength, age, or health.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (quoting MODEL PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.09 cmt. 3 ( AM. LAW INST. 1985) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MODEL PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.09 cmt. 3 (\"The ['person of reasonable firmness'] standard is not, however, wholly external in its reference; account is taken of the actor's 'situation,' a term that should here be given the same scope it is accorded in appraising recklessness and negligence.\"). Indeed, a 5'3?, 100 lbs., 80-year old individual will, all else equal, likely perceive a threat of physical violence differently than a 6'4?, 200 lbs., 25-year old. While we then acknowledged that the MPC did not list \"gender as one of the 'stark, tangible factors,' \" we assured that our analysis would demonstrate that \"there are sets of circumstances in which gender is also a factor to be considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520107\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/894/#p897\">\n    956 F.2d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Once we turned to the claims raised by three of the female defendants, it became evident that our mention of \"gender\" referred to BWS evidence. At trial, one of the defendants, Wood, \"buttressed her contention of duress with the\" expert testimony of a psychologist who \"had substantial experience in dealing with battered women.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 899. Summarizing this testimony and the texts the psychologist cited, we explained that BWS\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   is a set of psychological and behavioral reactions exhibited by victims of severe, long-term, domestic physical and emotional abuse. L. Walker,\n   <em>\n    The Battered Woman Syndrome\n   </em>\n   (1984). Battered woman syndrome is not a mental disease or defect; rather, battered woman syndrome is a post-traumatic stress disorder. Its psychological effects are often similar to the effects of imprisonment on kidnap victims and prisoners of war. Once battered women believe themselves to be helpless victims of abusive men, they behave like hostages and link themselves to their captors out of fear that it is the only way to survive. Battered women are unable to respond effectively to violence because they are psychologically trapped in the violent relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Repeated beatings diminish the battered woman's motivation to respond and instill in her a negative belief about the effectiveness of her actions. This \"learned helplessness\" keeps the battered woman from leaving her batterer. One of the primary survival skills of\n   battered women is hyperalertness. The battered woman learns to be sensitive to her environment to prevent further violence to herself. The development of survival skills, however, comes \"at the expense of escape skills.\" L. Walker at 33 &amp; 87-89. Society often misinterprets the survival skills of battered women as signs of passivity and weakness coupled with an unwillingness to leave the violent relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. A common misunderstanding is that the battered woman's responses are indicative of weak character. Rather, these responses must be seen as attempts to cope with the abusive and controlling environment in which she lives and from which she is helpless to escape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the duress defense did not sway the jury, we held that the district court \"should properly consider the individual before the court and her particular vulnerability\"\n   <em>\n    in sentencing\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   BWS evidence, we concluded, \"has a particular relation to the defense of duress as it has been expanded by the commentary to the Model Penal Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 900. We highlighted the MPC's citation to \"[a] leading authority on the common law [who] added that the defense applies when the defendant is so far 'in thrall to some power' that a legal sanction would be ineffective in controlling any choice that may be made.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

We described this model of duress as a \"substantial expansion of the defense,\" which we cautioned \"may go too far if not linked to gross and identifiable classes of circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . But we concluded that \"[b]attered women are in circumstances forming such a class.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Regrettably, our discussion in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   of BWS provides no guidance on the appropriate role of such evidence in supporting the affirmative defense of duress\n   <em>\n    at trial\n   </em>\n   . We noted, without approval or disapproval, that Wood was permitted to call an expert on BWS, who testified not only on BWS generally, but opined that Wood \"fitted the profile of a battered woman.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 899.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nor did we add clarity in addressing the claims raised by the other defendants. Johnson claimed that she should have been permitted either to call the same expert as Wood or cross-examine her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 901. We found no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of such evidence because the expert had never examined Johnson and could only have testified as to \"a stereotype applied to a case she knew only in the most external way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The third defendant, Breck, also contended that the district court erred in denying her a jury instruction on duress and by precluding her from calling the BWS expert on her own behalf.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 902. Unlike the other two defendants who had claimed duress, \"Breck began to work for [the kingpin] without any overt threat on his part, and she continued to work for him without such threats being made directly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Rather, Breck's defense relied solely on her testimony that she had once seen his bodyguards strike a woman and had \"herself heard on numerous occasions from [the kingpin] of his violent treatment of persons who crossed him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We upheld her conviction. Breck, we reasoned, \"had not made out a prima facie case of duress because she had made no showing that she could not far earlier have escaped [the kingpin], as she in fact finally did.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the expert witness' \"testimony, going to [Breck's] special subjective vulnerability, would not have established the lack of opportunity to escape that the defense of duress requires.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ultimately, we remanded all three defendants to the district court for resentencing. Even though the defendants had not proven their defense of duress at trial, the district court could take into account at sentencing their \"subjective vulnerability\" and, as appropriate, \"depart downwards on the grounds of incomplete duress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 903.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   There is language in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   that lends support to the government's argument here that BWS evidence is incompatible with the duress defense's objective reasonableness standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 898. But we decline to apply such a broad reading to our brief discussion of the three defendants' evidentiary challenges. Wood\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   permitted the use of an expert to testify at trial as to BWS generally and as to Wood's own profile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 899. Johnson was denied the use of the same expert, in part because she wanted the expert to testify as to\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   motivation, and the expert had never examined Johnson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 901. As to the third defendant, Breck, we held only that she lacked the elements of a prima facie duress defense because she was not actually threatened directly by the drug kingpin and ultimately escaped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 902.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Unfortunately, our\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision never elaborated on what it meant for Breck to have had a reasonable opportunity to escape from the kingpin. We thus have no means of discerning what factors led us to conclude that Breck's duress defense was so lacking in evidentiary support that she failed to make out a prima facie case, nor can we discern how BWS evidence might have influenced those factors. If, for instance, Breck had decided not to call the police at the first opportunity, then a decision holding that BWS evidence was inadmissable in assessing the reasonableness of her decision would certainly be relevant to the case before us. Unfortunately,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   does not supply these answers. We must, therefore, conclude that our holding was limited to the dearth of duress evidence in Breck's case. We are unwilling to read\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   as establishing a categorical bar on BWS evidence in support of a duress defense at trial; we think that reads too much into\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The police would often \"take the report and leave,\" and after one of the few occasions they arrested her stepfather, \"he was out the next day\" and \"broke into the house.\" Lopez attributed these experiences to why she decided not to call the police after Karaca threatened her, explaining that she feared they would not help her and that Karaca would discover that she had called them. The government attempted to assail this point throughout its closing argument, contending that Lopez's fear \"just doesn't make sense\" and referring to her explanation as \"really incredible.\" Dr. Karp, however, attested that Lopez's past trauma \"may have influenced [Lopez's] feelings when she did not seek the help of the police, given her own trauma history of being sexually abused by her step-father and the police never protecting her.\" We, of course, offer no opinion as to whether a jury would believe Lopez or, as the government argues, find her \"really incredible,\" but that is the jury's role.\n   <em>\n    Kuok\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872618\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/931/#p947\">\n    671 F.3d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Lopez moved the district court several times before and during trial to admit the entire interview, raising numerous theories of admissibility. In her motion for a new trial, Lopez again argued that the entire taped interview should have been admitted. She contended that the ATF agents' statements were non-hearsay because she offered them to show their\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   on her as the listener rather than for the truth of the matter asserted. For instance, one of the agents told Lopez during the interview that Karaca \"is not gonna touch you. He has no power in here. He is gonna be in jail or dead within a week.\" Lopez argued, as she does on appeal, that such statements would not have been offered to prove that Karaca could not harm her in jail, but rather to show that the statements had the effect of making her feel safe, which therefore led to her telling the agents about Karaca's threats. Lopez contended that this evidence would have helped her counter the government's argument at trial that the impact of spending a night in jail led to her fabricating a story of acting under duress the very next day. In a brief oral ruling, the court denied the motion for a new trial, merely commenting as to this issue that the statements were \"self-serving hearsay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A district court's evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This conclusion is underscored by the fact that there would be little relevance to the truth of the agents' statements that Karaca could not harm Lopez while she was in jail. In contrast, the non-hearsay application of these statements would be relevant to rebutting the government's argument that Lopez's night in jail convinced her to fabricate her duress story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Nonetheless, the district court did not err in excluding this evidence because Lopez consistently sought to introduce the video of the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   interview.

On appeal, the government concedes that the \"that's just a lie\" comment was improper but contends that the curative instruction was sufficient and that any potential error was harmless. Given the government's concession and the fact that we are remanding for a new trial, we need not address this claim.
