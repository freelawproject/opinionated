The district court concluded that Lund's motion was untimely under each of the potential statutes of limitations and that Lund could not invoke the actual innocence exception to the statute of limitations because his claim of actual innocence was based on a case that interpreted the substantive law of his conviction:\n   <em>\n    Burrage v.

Lund challenges only this conclusion, arguing that a claim of actual innocence can be based on a change in the law. To resolve this case, however, we need not rule on this issue. Even assuming actual innocence can be premised on a change in the law, Lund cannot take advantage of the exception because he rests both his actual innocence claim and his claim for relief on\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   .

Lund pleaded guilty to the single-count indictment, but denied responsibility for the deaths of Goetzke and Knuth, arguing that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy prior to their deaths. The district court judge rejected that argument and sentenced him in accordance with the twenty-year mandatory minimum-sometimes referred to as the \"death results\" enhancement or penalty-under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).

This suggests that the underlying claim must be a constitutional claim, rather than a statutory claim like\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lund argues that he does not need to bring a separate constitutional claim because\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   is itself cognizable in \u00a7 2255 proceedings. By contrast, he argues, a state prisoner would need to bring an underlying constitutional claim because neither a claim of actual innocence based on new evidence nor a claim based on a state law error would be cognizable in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding. We do not find this persuasive. The Supreme Court has never mentioned a difference in the purpose or application of the actual innocence exception between \u00a7 2254 and \u00a7 2255 proceedings. Therefore, we concur that it is \"doubtful\" that Lund's\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   claim could be both his argument for actual innocence and his claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 902-03 (holding that the parties' assumption that a claim of actual innocence based on\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   could do \"double duty\" was \"doubtful\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Lund also argues that he has raised underlying constitutional claims. We disagree. Lund claims that his pro se pleadings should have been construed to include an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In his reply brief below, he argued that his \"main cause for not putting forth [a] petition in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Alleyne [wa]s Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.\" Reply Br.

The district court held that Lund \"d[id]\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his petition.\" Dist. Ct. Order 3 n.3. It read Lund's argument regarding his attorney's effectiveness to relate only to his position that his claims should have been equitably tolled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lund asserts that the district court should have construed his reference to ineffective assistance of counsel as a request to amend his\n   \u00a7 2255 claim to include a separate ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which then should have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court did not err.

Instead, it appears from his pro se filings that he was seeking to use ineffective assistance of counsel as cause to excuse his procedural default and untimeliness. Therefore, the district court need not have construed Lund's response as a request to amend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   More to the point, allowing\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   to serve as both Lund's basis for actual innocence and his claim for relief on the merits directly contracts a Congressionally-imposed statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    McQuiggin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p386\">\n    569 U.S. at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p386\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , involved the time limit in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(D), which starts the clock for the one-year limitation on the date when the facts of the claim could have been discovered. Lund's\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   claim, by contrast, is barred by the statute of limitations which prohibits petitioners from bringing habeas claims based on rights recognized by the Supreme Court, and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, more than one year after the right was recognized by the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McQuiggin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p386\">\n    569 U.S. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p386\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that, as there is \"no clear command [in \u00a7 2244(d)(1) ] countering the courts' equitable authority to invoke the miscarriage of justice exception,\" it survived the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), at least as it relates to the statutes of limitations contained within that section. The Court noted, however, that other provisions of AEDPA did contain language modifying the actual innocence exception.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/#p317\">\n    513 U.S. at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/#p317\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2244(b)(1)(B) (providing that a claim presented in a successive habeas petition that was not presented in a prior \u00a7 2254 petition will be dismissed unless the facts establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Likewise, here, there is a clear statutory command limiting courts' equitable discretion to use the actual innocence gateway to excuse failure to comply with \u00a7 2255(f)(3). Congress set a one-year limit for petitioners to bring \u00a7 2255 motions based on new rights recognized by the Supreme Court. Allowing a claim like\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   to serve as both the basis for actual innocence and the basis for relief would render this statute of limitations superfluous, at least as it applies to newly recognized statutory rights.
