STRANCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In seeking to harmonize the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the majority opinion in this case takes up an issue of exceptional importance. Its holding that the CWA does not apply to discharges of pollutants from coal ash ponds that reach surface waters after traveling through groundwater (1) relies on a single preposition that is not found in the CWA provision at issue and (2) is at odds with every other circuit and our own precedent. I therefore respectfully dissent from the denial of en banc review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court concluded its 123-page opinion by explaining that, with the benefit of hindsight and decades of data, \"it is difficult to imagine why anyone would choose to build an unlined [coal] ash waste pond in karst terrain immediately adjacent to a river.\" (R. 258, PageID 10,542) TVA does not contest the district court's factual finding that pollutants from these ash ponds reached a navigable river. Nor could it. TVA's expert \"conceded that there is coal ash in the Cumberland River in the area surrounding the Gallatin Plant, as shown by TVA's own testing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 10,486) The danger of coal ash to riverine environments and to the communities that depend on that river is indisputable-and, indeed, the majority does not attempt to dispute it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tenn.

TVA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518789\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/436/#p447\">\n    905 F.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (6th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We need not look far to find a vivid example of how that danger affects Tennesseans. Just last month, an East Tennessee jury returned a verdict against Defendant TVA in a suit brought by the workers who cleaned up a 2008 coal ash spill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adkisson v. Jacobs Eng'g Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:13-CV-00505, D.E. 408 (E.D. Tenn.). Media coverage of the case stated that 30 of the workers are dead and more than 250 are sick or dying.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the problems did not end with the cleanup. Recent journalism reports that coal ash storage facilities established in the wake of that disaster are already leaking arsenic and radium into groundwater and that the EPA has found a spike in coal ash constituents in groundwater test wells.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This environmental issue reaches beyond Tennessee's problem with TVA's coal ash ponds. Many other types of installations pollute navigable waters via discharges to groundwater.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Upstate Forever v. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516584\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/637/#p643\">\n    887 F.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643-44 (4th Cir. 2018) (describing 369,000 gallons of gasoline spilled from an underground pipeline that leaked through groundwater into creeks, lakes, and a river).

(\"The Act does not forbid the 'addition of any pollutant\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   to navigable waters from any point source,' but rather the 'addition of any pollutant\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   navigable waters.' \" (citations omitted) ). Pollutants are discharged from coal ash ponds\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   navigable waters just as a rocket is launched from the ground\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   space or a path leads from a city\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   a forest-inevitably, but not immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The majority opinion's only other rationale is that \"allowing the CWA to cover pollution of this sort would disrupt the existing regulatory framework\" under RCRA.\n   <em>\n    Tenn.

But we have answered that claim before and clarified how the CWA (which governs water pollution) and RCRA (which governs disposal of solid and hazardous waste) interact. When a polluting factory operator claimed that the hazardous waste dumped into a lagoon was exempt from RCRA because the lagoon was governed by the CWA, we explained that \"only the actual discharges from a holding pond or similar feature into surface waters ... are governed by the Clean Water Act, not the contents of the pond or discharges into it.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

So too with coal ash ponds. \"Actual discharges\" from the ponds to surface waters are governed by the CWA, and everything else-from the strength of the embankment surrounding a pond to the frequency of its inspections and the design of its liner-is governed by RCRA. This reading acknowledges the realistic interaction between the two Acts, and their sensible enforcement relationship. It does not \"effectively nullify\" RCRA's implementing regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Tenn.

The majority reasons that, if a coal ash pond received a CWA permit, it would be removed from RCRA's coverage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518789\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/436/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By this logic, if a landfill has a system for collecting rainwater and discharging it into a river, governed by the CWA pursuant to 40 C.F.R. Part 445, the rest of the landfill's\n   operations would be exempt from RCRA. Likewise, if TVA's own power plants have CWA permits pursuant to 40 C.F.R. Part 423, the plants' other operations would be exempt from RCRA-including, presumably, its rules about disposal of coal ash. But that is indisputably not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In light of my disagreement with the two bases of the majority's decision, I do not think splitting from every other circuit that has considered this issue is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Upstate Forever\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516584\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/637/#p643\">\n    887 F.3d at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] point source is the starting point or cause of a discharge under the CWA, but that starting point need not also convey the discharge directly to navigable waters.\");\n   <em>\n    Haw.

Scope of the Clean Water Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs have invoked the CWA's citizen-suit provision, which provides that \"any citizen may commence a civil action ... against any person ... who is alleged to be in violation of ... an effluent standard or limitation under this chapter[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"For purposes of this section, the term 'effluent standard or limitation under this chapter' means,\" among other possibilities, \"an unlawful act under subsection (a) of section 1311 of this title.\" \u00a7 1365(f). In turn, \u00a7 1311(a) prohibits \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The broad sweep of a defendant's potential CWA liability is limited in two ways. First, Congress included a list of exceptions in \u00a7 1311(a) itself: the discharge of a pollutant is unlawful \"[e]xcept in compliance with this section and sections 1312, 1316, 1317, 1328, 1342, and 1344 of this title.\" Second, Congress gave the phrase \"discharge of a pollutant\" a very specific definition: it means \"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A). Taken together, Congress thus authorized citizen suits to prevent the \"addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(12)(A), but if a listed statutory exception applies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1311(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The majority argues that this standard cannot be satisfied when, as here, pollution travels briefly through groundwater before reaching a navigable water. Plaintiffs counter that such an exception has no statutory basis and would allow polluters to shirk their CWA obligations by placing their underground drainage pipes a few feet away from the shoreline. This case could have profound implications for those in this Circuit who would pollute our Nation's waters. And the issue is novel. This Court has never before considered whether the CWA applies in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have. Both courts determined that a short journey through groundwater does not defeat CWA liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Upstate Forever v. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516584\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/637/#p643\">\n    887 F.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649-51 (4th Cir. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Hawai'i Wildlife Fund v.

The Second Circuit reached a similar conclusion where the pollutants traveled briefly through fields (which are not necessarily point sources) and through the air.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Concerned Area Residents for Env't v.

Until today, no Circuit had come out the other way. The reason is simple: the CWA does not require a plaintiff to show that a defendant discharged a pollutant from a point source\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   into navigable waters; a plaintiff must simply show that the defendant \"add[ed] ... any pollutant\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   navigable waters\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   any point source.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1362(12)(A) (emphases added), 1365(a), 1311(a);\n   <em>\n    Upstate Forever\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516584\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/637/#p643\">\n    887 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   650 ;\n   <em>\n    Hawai'i Wildlife Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516480,12516479\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/737/\">\n    886 F.3d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Supreme Court addressed this precise issue in\n   <em>\n    Rapanos v.

By contrast, the majority's approach defeats the CWA's purpose by opening a gaping regulatory loophole: polluters can avoid CWA liability by discharging their pollutants into groundwater, even if that groundwater flows immediately into a nearby navigable water. This exception has no textual or logical foundation. As one district court observed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   it would hardly make sense for the CWA to encompass a polluter who discharges pollutants via a pipe running from the factory directly to the riverbank, but not a polluter who dumps the same pollutants into a man-made settling basin some distance short of the river and then allows the pollutants to seep into the river via the groundwater.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

Cal. Sept. 1, 2005). In addition, this exception has no apparent limits. Based on the majority's logic, polluters are free to add pollutants to navigable waters so long as the pollutants travel through any kind of intermediate medium-for example through groundwater, across fields, or through the air. This would seem to give polluters free rein to discharge pollutants from a sprinkler system suspended above Lake Michigan. After all, pollutants launched from such a sprinkler system would travel \"in all directions, guided only by the general pull of gravity.\"\n   <em>\n    Kentucky Waterways Alliance\n   </em>\n   , 18-5115 at 11. According to the majority, this would defeat CWA liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   I have a very different view. In cases where, as here, a plaintiff alleges that a defendant is polluting navigable waters through a complex pathway, the court should require the plaintiff to prove the existence of pollutants in the navigable waters and to persuade the factfinder that the defendant's point source is to blame-that the defendant is unlawfully \"add[ing] ... any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A). The more complex the pathway, the more difficult the proof.

For its textual argument, the majority refers us to the term \"effluent limitations.\" This term, the majority says, is defined as \"restrictions on the amount of pollutants that may be 'discharged from point sources\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   navigable waters.' \" Maj.

Seizing on the word \"into\"-which denotes \"entry, introduction, insertion\"-the majority concludes that the effluent-limitation definition implicitly creates an element of \"directness.\" In other words, the majority reasons, \"for a point source to discharge\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   navigable waters, it must dump\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   into those navigable waters[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The majority is way off the rails.

The majority should heed this commonsense advice. Congress did not hide a massive regulatory loophole in its use of the word \"into.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But more importantly, the majority's quoted definition of \"effluent limitation\" from \u00a7 1362(11) -the supposed origin of the loophole-is not relevant to this case. The citizen-suit provision uses the term \"effluent standard or limitation\"-not the term \"effluent limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). As the majority itself argues, minor distinctions in statutory language sometimes matter. This one does. The phrase \"effluent standard or limitation\" is a term of art and is wholly distinct from the term \"effluent limitation.\" This conclusion is supported not by tea leaves or a carefully selected dictionary, but rather by the CWA itself. The citizen-suit provision of the CWA provides that \"effluent standard or limitation\" means, among other things, \"an unlawful act under subsection (a) of section 1311 of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Turning to \u00a7 1311(a), we find that, absent certain exceptions, \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful,\" \u00a7 1311(a), and the \"discharge of a pollutant\" means \"any addition of any pollutant\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   navigable waters from any point source,\" \u00a7 1362(12)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, even assuming the majority correctly parses the definition of \"into\"-a dubious proposition at best-the word \"into\" is not contained in any of the statutory provisions at issue. Rather, we find the word \"to,\" which does not even arguably suggest a requirement of directness; the word \"to\" merely \"indicate[s] movement or an action or condition suggestive of movement toward a place, person, or thing reached.\"\n   <em>\n    To\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is therefore entirely unclear why the majority relies on the definition of \"effluent limitation.\" That definition is simply irrelevant to this lawsuit. As a result, the majority's criticisms of the approach taken by the Fourth and Ninth Circuits miss the mark. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit analyzed the correct statutory text when it rejected the argument that the citizen-suit provision requires directness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [t]he plain language of the CWA requires only that a discharge come \"from\" a \"point source.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A).

It is true that\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   dealt with different facts. But it is irrelevant that the pollution in\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   traveled through point sources before reaching a navigable water, whereas the pollution in this case traveled through groundwater, which, according to the majority, is not a point source. In both cases, the legal issue is the same: whether the CWA applies to pollution that travels from a point source to navigable waters through a complex pathway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/#p743\">\n    547 U.S. at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/#p743\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (asking whether \"the contaminant-laden waters ultimately reach covered waters\").

On this view, the states alone are responsible for regulating pollution of groundwater, even if that pollution later travels to a navigable water. Wrong again. To be sure, the CWA recognizes the \"primary responsibilities and rights of States\" to regulate groundwater pollution.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). But imposing liability in this case would not marginalize the states. To the contrary, the district court made clear that it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   regulating the pollution of groundwater itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tennessee Clean Water Network v.

Instead, the district court was addressing pollution of a navigable water-specifically, the Cumberland River-via groundwater.

Accordingly, imposing liability in this case fits perfectly with the CWA's stated purpose: to \"restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the majority offers a narrow reading of the CWA because, in its view, a more inclusive reading would render \"virtually useless\" the Coal Combustion Residuals (\"CCR\") Rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"). Maj. Op. at 13. The majority notes that if a polluter's conduct is regulated through a CWA permit, then RCRA does not also\n   apply. The majority therefore suggests that a straightforward reading of the CWA is incompatible with RCRA. The majority would gut the former statute to save the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   But the EPA has already dismissed the majority's concern. Indeed, the EPA issued federal regulations on this issue many decades ago. The EPA's interpretation is that the industrial discharge of waste such as CCR is subject to regulation under both RCRA and the CWA: RCRA regulates the way polluters store CCR, and the CWA kicks in the moment CCR enters a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The EPA first articulated this approach in a set of regulations from 1980, which provide that \"[i]ndustrial wastewater discharges that are point source discharges subject to regulation under section 402 of the Clean Water Act\" \"are not solid wastes for the purpose of\" the RCRA exclusion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). This exclusion, the regulation explains, \"applies only to the\n   <em>\n    actual point source discharge\n   </em>\n   . It does not exclude industrial wastewaters while they are being collected, stored or treated before discharge, nor does it exclude sludges that are generated by industrial wastewater treatment.\" \u00a7 261.4(a)(2) (comment) (emphasis added). Thus, under the EPA's reading, a polluter can be liable under RCRA for improperly storing CCR-even if the CCR never enters a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Conversely, a polluter can be liable under the CWA for adding CCR to a navigable waterway-even if the polluter's storage methods comport with RCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And of course, a polluter can be liable under both statutes if the polluter both improperly stores CCR and discharges it to a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The EPA settled any doubts on this matter by publishing a detailed description of its rationale in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033098\">\n    45 Fed.

The EPA says that imposing CWA liability for the discharge of CCR to navigable waterways does not eliminate the possibility of RCRA liability for the storage and treatment of CCR. The majority suggests the exact opposite. Unfortunately for the majority, but fortunately for those who enjoy clean water, the majority lacks the authority to override longstanding EPA regulations on a whim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/#p980\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For all these reasons, I believe the CWA clearly applies to the pollution in this case.

Under this standard, the unpermitted leaks from NRS and Complex are clearly unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Permit's Sanitary Sewer Overflow Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The permit prohibits \"Sanitary Sewer Overflows,\" which it defines as \"the discharge to land or water of wastes from any portion of the collection, transmission, or treatment system other than through permitted outfalls.\" (R. 1-2, permit, PageID# 79.) The district court found, and TVA no longer disputes, that the Complex discharges coal ash waste to groundwater through its unlined, leaking sides and bottoms. These discharges are not authorized by the permit. Therefore, Plaintiffs have proven a permit violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The majority avoids this result by overcomplicating the issue. Ignoring the plain text of the permit, the majority instead champions the EPA's standard definition of \"Sanitary Sewer Overflow,\" which is narrow and arguably saves TVA from liability. This reasoning is perplexing. The EPA's definition should play no role in the legal analysis here because the permit itself defines \"Sanitary Sewer Overflow.\" Indeed, TVA's permit expert conceded in the district court that the permit's definition is broader than the EPA's definition. Accordingly, this Court should apply the plain text of the permit's definition, as it would apply the plain text of any contract. This Court has no plausible authority or reason to substitute a definition provided in the permit with one drafted in a different context by a nonparty who has no relation to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Further, the EPA's standard definition makes little sense in this context. As the majority recognizes, that definition applies only to sewage from sanitary sewer systems. But a coal ash pond is not a \"sanitary sewer system.\" It does not contain \"sewage.\" Consequently, interpreting the Sanitary Sewer Overflow provision to regulate sewage alone would render the provision meaningless. This Court should avoid such an interpretation, especially when the permit itself provides a definition that does not trigger any such concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallo v.
