As Simmont spoke with Johnson, he smelled a combination of burnt and fresh marijuana, which he recognized through his work patrolling East Palo Alto and on the San Mateo County Narcotics\n   Task Force. Simmont asked Johnson for his registration and proof of insurance, to which Johnson responded that he was borrowing the car and did not have registration or insurance information. Simmont asked if Johnson was sure, and Johnson opened the glove box as if to check. Simmont observed empty plastic bags and pill bottles in the glove box and noticed that Johnson \"moved his hand around on the few items that were in there, but he didn't actually manipulate any items.\" This manner was \"inconsistent with the way someone would genuinely search for paperwork.\" Simmont then learned from a police dispatch agent that Johnson had been arrested for parole violations, which indicated to Simmont that Johnson had been convicted of a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Simmont asked Johnson to step out of the vehicle and searched his person. Simmont discovered that Johnson was wearing a bulletproof vest and arrested him for being a felon in possession of body armor. After backup police units arrived, Simmont and the other officers searched Johnson's car and discovered a loaded handgun, a pill bottle containing acetaminophen/hydrocodone pills, plastic bags, scales, and concentrated cannabis. Johnson was transported to a police station, where a second search of his person revealed additional controlled substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following year, a separate investigation in San Mateo County linked Johnson to controlled substance distribution. On March 16, 2016, a judge in San Mateo Superior Court issued a warrant to search Johnson, a vehicle allegedly belonging to him, and a residence in east Palo Alto allegedly belonging to him. Detective Christopher Sample subscribed and swore to an affidavit in support of the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to his affidavit, Sample met with a confidential informant (CI) who purportedly could call a man named \"Lamar\" at a specific phone number and arrange a sale of cocaine base. The CI called the number and a male voice answered the phone and gave a location to meet. Police observed the CI meet Johnson at that location and exchange items. Sample then tested the substance the CI received from Johnson and identified it as cocaine. Sample followed Johnson from the exchange and stopped him in front of a house for a minor traffic violation. Johnson's driver license stated he lived at the house where they had stopped, and Johnson told Sample that it was his house. Sample then observed Johnson entering the house before he drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sample then arranged a second buy through the same CI. Again, the CI called the phone number, the man provided a location to meet, and the CI exchanged items with Johnson after they met at that location. Sample tested the substance the CI received from Johnson and it again tested positive as cocaine. Again, police followed Johnson and observed him return to the same home. The first buy occurred within the 20 days preceding the affidavit, and the second buy within 10 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sample's affidavit also provided information about his training and experience. Sample averred that drug traffickers who sold cocaine base often purchased it in bulk quantities and stored it in their cars and homes. Based on the factual information recited above and Sample's description of his training and experience, the superior court issued a search warrant. The search of Johnson's home recovered a firearm, ammunition, scales, plastic bags, pills in bottles, and cocaine base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Johnson was indicted on nine counts of drug and firearm offenses. Before trial, Johnson moved to suppress all evidence recovered from the warrantless search of his person and car and the warrant search of his house. The district court denied the\n   motion in two separate orders. Johnson then stipulated to certain facts and the district court held a bench trial. The government dismissed two counts and the district court convicted Johnson on the remaining seven. At sentencing, the district court increased Johnson's offense level by four levels because he had used body armor during the commission of a drug trafficking crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Johnson appeals, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress and by applying the body armor enhancement to his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"We review de novo the district court's denial of a motion to suppress.

Johnson contends that to do so would create a \"search incident to probable cause\" rule, allowing officers\n   to search a person whenever probable cause to arrest exists. Johnson argues that the existence of such a rule will cause widespread fishing expeditions that are pre-textual and discriminatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We conclude that the search of Johnson's person was constitutional. The search incident to a lawful arrest exception is \"based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence,\" but it \"does not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, we do not balance Johnson's interests in not being searched against Sergeant Simmont's interest in searching him. Instead we evaluate whether, as a general matter, the justifications for the search incident to lawful arrest exception retain force in the context of a search performed by an officer who has probable cause to arrest and shortly thereafter does arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knowles v.

The safeguards of probable cause and an actual custodial arrest, here as there, are what protect individuals' Fourth Amendment rights.

First, he argues that Sample's affidavit did not establish probable cause that contraband would be found in his home. Second, he argues that the affidavit did not establish the CI's reliability. Third, he argues that the affidavit omitted the quantity of cocaine involved in the controlled buys, misleading the magistrate into issuing the warrant. We disagree with these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to probable cause, this case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    United States v. Terry\n   </em>\n   . In that case, we held that an officer's \"first hand knowledge\" of the defendant's possession of controlled substances, combined with the officer's \"experience with other drug dealers,\" provided the \"substantial basis\" for the magistrate to determine that probable cause existed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 276. The same holds true here. Sample averred that he had twice observed Johnson distribute cocaine in the 20 days preceding the warrant, including once within 10 days. He also averred that, after the buys, he observed Johnson return to the address listed on the warrant application, which Johnson entered and told police was \"his house.\" These facts-combined with Sample's description of how drug traffickers buy cocaine in bulk, sell in small amounts, and use their homes as store caches for the remainder-provided a substantial basis for the San Mateo Superior Court to issue the warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 275-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the CI's reliability, this argument is largely beside the point. As we have just explained, the basis for probable cause in the affidavit was Sample's \"first hand knowledge\" of Johnson's drug dealing and his \"experience with other drug dealers\" in how and where a confirmed drug dealer might store contraband.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 276. The warrant was not issued, unlike in other cases where informant credibility is crucial, based on the CI's tip that drugs would be found in Johnson's home, but on Sample's observations of the controlled buys and Johnson's actions thereafter. The CI's only role in establishing probable cause was therefore to effectuate the controlled buys, and the CI did establish reliability in this regard because police observed the buys, corroborating the CI's information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, as to the omission of the size of the cocaine rocks sold, we conclude that any omission was immaterial to the magistrate's decision. A defendant challenging omissions from a warrant must make a substantial showing that \"the affiant intentionally or recklessly omitted\n   facts required to prevent technically true statements in the affidavit from being misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stanert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366284\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/775/#p781\">\n    762 F.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781 (9th Cir. 1985). Johnson has not met that standard here. Assuming arguendo that Sample's omission of the precise sizes of the cocaine rocks was intentional or reckless, it was clear from the affidavit that the controlled buys involved small amounts of cocaine. Therefore, inclusion of those facts would not have changed the meaning of any statement in the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.5 provides: \"If ... the defendant was convicted of a drug trafficking crime or a crime of violence; and ... the defendant used body armor during the commission of the offense, in preparation for the offense, or in an attempt to avoid apprehension for the offense, increase by 4 levels.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.5(1), (2)(B). The district court increased Johnson's offense level by four levels under this provision because Johnson was wearing a bulletproof vest during the 2015 traffic stop. Johnson argues that the district court erred in doing so because \"use\" does not mean simply wearing body armor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First interpreting the meaning of the guidelines de novo, we reject Johnson's construction argument. The commentary to the guidelines states that \" '[u]se' means (A) active employment in a manner to protect the person from gunfire; or (B) use as a means of bartering. 'Use' does not mean mere possession (e.g., 'use' does not mean that the body armor was found in the trunk of the car but not used actively as protection).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366284\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/775/#p781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3B1.5, cmt. (n.1). There is no reasonable way to construe this language that would exclude wearing body armor from the definition of \"use.\" Wearing body armor is the precise means by which a person \"employ[s] [the body armor] in a manner to protect the person from gunfire.\" Accordingly, Johnson \"used\" the body armor within the meaning of the guidelines simply by wearing it.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Johnson argues that he had an alternative explanation for why he wore the body armor. But Johnson also had cocaine base, heroin, marijuana, and oxycodone on his person while he wore the body armor, as well as a loaded handgun, hydrocodone, plastic bags, scales, and concentrated cannabis in his car. On these facts, the district court did not abuse its discretion by determining that the enhancement should apply because Johnson wore body armor during a drug trafficking offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-44\">\n   WATFORD, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   I join the court's opinion because it faithfully applies the rule we adopted in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under that rule, however, the search in\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   would have been permissible, because the officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for speeding and he arrested the defendant shortly after the search uncovered illegal drugs. It's true that in\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   the officer had already issued a citation by the time the search took place, which some courts have interpreted to mean that a search incident to arrest is permitted so long as the officer has not yet decided whether to arrest or cite the suspect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

What those courts have overlooked is that the critical fact in\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   was not the officer's issuance of the citation, but rather the absence of an arrest. That absence is key because, as discussed above, the exigency that justifies a warrantless search in this context arises from the\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   of arrest,\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/#p235\">\n    414 U.S. at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/#p235\">\n    94 S.Ct. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , not from the existence of probable cause to arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The rule we adopted in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   is doctrinally unsound for another reason: It makes the legality of the search dependent upon events that occur after the search has taken place. Under our rule, the same search conducted on the basis of the same\n   showing of probable cause is valid if the officer arrests the suspect afterward, but becomes illegal if the officer subsequently decides not to make an arrest (say, because the search turns up nothing).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menotti v.

That approach is at odds with the background principle that the reasonableness of a search turns on \"whether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Rawlings\n   </em>\n   did state that \"[w]here the formal arrest followed quickly on the heels of the challenged search of petitioner's person, we do not believe it particularly important that the search preceded the arrest rather than vice versa.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787600\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/98/#p111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787600\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/98/#p111\">\n    at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787600\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/98/#p111\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that language cannot fairly be read as having jettisoned the requirement that an arrest occur before an officer may conduct a search incident to arrest. At the time he was searched, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Rawlings\n   </em>\n   had plainly been subjected to a Fourth Amendment seizure amounting to an arrest, based on probable cause that existed beforehand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As I read\n   <em>\n    Rawlings\n   </em>\n   , the Court merely held that the search was not invalidated by the fact that the \"formal arrest\" (handcuffing, etc.) occurred shortly after the search took place, rather than before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, interpreting\n   <em>\n    Rawlings\n   </em>\n   to permit a pre-arrest search, so long as an officer has probable cause to arrest, seems to conflict with the Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

In most instances, an officer conducting a valid traffic stop will have probable cause to believe that the driver has committed some traffic infraction, which carries with it the latent authority to arrest even if the infraction is a minor one that could not result in jail time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atwater v.

Thus, as long as the officer has not yet issued a citation, there remains the possibility, however remote, that the driver could be arrested for the infraction. Under our holding in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , an officer in these circumstances could presumably conduct\n   a search \"incident\" to an arrest for the traffic violation, knowing that if incriminating evidence is found he can opt at that point to arrest the driver and thereby validate the search. That regime would authorize full-blown investigatory searches of the driver's person (and in some instances of the vehicle's passenger compartment as well) as a normal incident of any traffic stop.

That focus makes sense in this context because the arrestee's perception that he has been placed under arrest is what triggers the need for an immediate search, to ensure that the arrestee cannot use any weapons to resist or escape and cannot conceal or destroy any evidence on his person. The officer's subjective intent is of course irrelevant to the existence of a custodial arrest, unless \"that intent has been conveyed to the person confronted.\"\n   <em>\n    Chesternut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221076\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/567/#p573\">\n    486 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   575 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221076\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/567/#p573\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   If it turns out that an officer conducts a search prematurely-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , before the suspect was in fact arrested for Fourth Amendment purposes-that will not invariably result in suppression of any evidence discovered during the search. The government can still attempt to prove, under the inevitable discovery doctrine, that the officer would have arrested the suspect anyway, without regard to what was found as a result of the search.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.
