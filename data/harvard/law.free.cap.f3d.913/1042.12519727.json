From the fourteenth through the eighteenth centuries, one \"method of accelerating unanimity\" was to prohibit jurors from eating or drinking until they all agreed on a verdict. 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries *375. And if jurors did not unanimously agree on one before the judges left town, Blackstone recounted, \"the judges are not bound to wait for them, but may carry them round the circuit from town to town in a cart.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *376.

One of the safeguards against the conviction of innocent persons built into our criminal justice system is that a jury may not be able to reach a unanimous verdict.\"). We no longer try to coerce holdout jurors to reach a verdict that they cannot abide. Or at least most of the time we don't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jury that convicted our appellant, Sumnar Brewster, might feel some affinity with juries of yesteryear. Over the period of two days of deliberations the jurors repeatedly told the judges-there was one judge on the first day of deliberations and a different one on the second day-that they could not reach a unanimous verdict. And the judges repeatedly ordered them to keep trying. All told, the jurors sent six notes to the two judges stating that they could not reach a verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Three times the jurors disclosed how they were divided: first reporting that they were deadlocked 9 to 3 for conviction, later that they were still deadlocked but now 11 to 1 in favor of conviction, and still later that the one holdout juror was continuing to hold out. Throughout the deadlocking, the judges gave a formal\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge, later two additional admonitions that the jurors must continue deliberating, and finally, another long charge that included instructions to keep on deliberating. That lengthy charge emphasized that the jurors had taken an oath to follow the law, which meant they must deliberate more. The judge ended his instructions with the challenge that he had taken his oath seriously and hoped they would do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly thereafter, when told that the one juror who wouldn't vote to convict was doing crossword puzzles, the judge ordered all the reading materials taken out of the jury room. That tactic turned out to be even more effective than threatening to kill the hapless Bushel had been in William Penn's case three hundred years before. Just 18 minutes after all reading materials were removed, Brewster's jury dutifully-and we do mean\n   <em>\n    dutifully\n   </em>\n   -returned a guilty verdict. Through it all Brewster's two attorneys neither objected nor moved for a mistrial. Not once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This is Brewster's appeal from the denial of his\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object, or move for a mistrial, at any point during the deadlocked deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here are the details. Brewster was tried on two counts of armed robbery. The case went to the jury at 11:23 a.m. on the second day of trial. About three-and-a-half hours later, at 2:55 p.m., the jury sent a note to the trial judge asking: \"If one person on the jury votes not guilty, what is outcome?\" The judge responded: \"The Court cannot answer this question but will recharge you on any instructions you wish.\" There is no indication that the jury asked at that time to be recharged on anything or that they were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Less than two hours later, at 4:20 p.m., the jury sent the judge a second note, which stated: \"We are nine guilty and three not guilty. What instructions would you give us as to what to do now? Everyone is firm in their decision.\" The judge brought the jury into the courtroom and\n   asked the foreman, \"[D]o you think there's any way this case will be resolved on a unanimous verdict?\" He answered \"no.\" The judge responded by reading the jury Alabama's pattern\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   instruction, colloquially known as a dynamite charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

Crim. App. 2002). Among other things, the judge informed the jurors that if they could not agree on a verdict, \"a mistrial would be declared and this case would have to be tried again.\" He told them that each juror was \"entitled to his or her opinion of the evidence\" and that none of them should \"surrender an honest conviction,\" but he directed them to talk over their differences and to \"make further efforts to arrive at a verdict\" if they could conscientiously do so. The jurors deliberated for another half-hour before being sent home for the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury returned at 9:00 the next morning and continued deliberating. For reasons not explained in the record, another judge took over from the one who had presided the day before. At 10:57 a.m., almost two hours after deliberations had resumed that morning, the jurors sent out a third note. That note, as recounted by the judge, stated that they could not reach a unanimous decision, that one juror had decided not guilty, and that \"no amount of time was going to sway them.\" The judge brought the jurors into the courtroom and instructed them to \"keep an open mind and go back point by point over the evidence that you have heard in this case and the law that was given to you by the Court and to keep deliberating.\" The jurors returned to the jury room at 11:00 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nearly three hours later, at 1:45 p.m., in a fourth note, the jury once again declared itself deadlocked-really, really deadlocked-telling the judge, as he informed the attorneys, that \"all jurors have decided\n   <em>\n    firmly\n   </em>\n   , eleven guilty, one not guilty,\n   <em>\n    no possibility of resolve\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The State requested that the judge give the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge again, but instead he gave the jury a written instruction ordering it to continue deliberating and telling the jurors if they needed to be \"reinstructed on any elements of the crime, count one or count two, or reinstructed on any issues, i.e., the burden of proof or reasonable doubt,\" the court would reinstruct them. The jury did not ask for any more instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At 2:02 p.m., the jury sent a fifth note, telling the judge that the lone holdout juror was \"unwilling to discuss the case with them.\" The judge brought the jury back into the courtroom and gave it the longest additional instruction yet, covering seven-and-a-half pages of the transcript. He began by asking the jurors: \"Do you remember ... [y]ou all took a solemn oath that you would well and truly try all issues submitted to you and true verdicts render ... according to the evidence in the case and the law as given to you by the Court?\" He went on: \"You are not at liberty to just ignore the instructions of the Court. I'm not telling you to change your mind, but I am asking you and reminding you of the oaths that you took and to take those seriously and to deliberate this case and talk.\" In his instruction, the judge used the word \"oath\" nine times. He also reminded the jury that \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" does not mean absolute certainty, and that \"[t]here is no such thing as absolute certainty in human affairs. For justice is after all, but an approximate science.\" The judge concluded his lengthy instructions by telling the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I have indicated to you that there's two counts. I have reminded you of the oath that you have taken. I have given you reinstructions on reasonable doubt. I\n   want you to go back, and I want you to continue to deliberate. Start at the beginning, if you have to. Go over every element or any part of this case you want to discuss.\n   <em>\n    But you took an oath. I take mine seriously. I hope you do the same. Take them out.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The jurors went back into the jury room for more deliberations at 2:14 p.m. Eleven minutes later, at 2:25 p.m., out came the jury's sixth note. It stated that the holdout juror was refusing to discuss the case and had begun doing crossword puzzles. The judge responded by ordering the bailiff \"to go to the jury room and take all of the newspapers and all of the books and magazines-and whatever they need to write on is fine and dandy. Remove the others.\" Eighteen minutes later, deprived of a way to shield herself from the importuning of the other jurors, the holdout held out no more. At 2:48 p.m., a unanimous guilty verdict, to use the old term, \"bounced out\" of the jury room. Convicted of both counts of armed robbery, Brewster was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Brewster's conviction and sentence in a two-paragraph opinion.\n   <em>\n    Brewster v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20So.%203d%20407\">\n    51 So.3d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unpublished table decision) (Ala. Crim. App. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Brewster petitioned the state trial court for postconviction relief under Rule 32 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. He claimed, among other things, that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to move for a mistrial based on the jurors' repeated declarations that they were deadlocked \"and/or\" failing to object to the court's repeatedly ordering the jurors to continue deliberating. This is how his\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   petition stated that claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Counsel w[ere] Ineffective and Petitioner was prejudiced thereby when counsel fail[ed] to move for a mistrial and/or object to the Court further instructing the jury after the jury indicated that they were deadlocked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Petitioner avers that the record in this case[ ] reveals that the jury could not reach a verdict on the charges against the petitioner, the jury indicated on several occasions that they were deadlocked. The Court gave several instructions for the jury to continue to deliberate, however the jury returned and stated that they were deadlocked and could not reach a verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The Trial Court, this time, with a substitute judge, again instructed the jury to reach a verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Petitioner contends that he was prejudiced by the Court's multiple charges to the jury to continue to deliberate as such coerced the j[u]ry into reaching a verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Counsel['s] error in this regard[ ] prejudiced the petitioner and deprived him of a fundamental fair trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The state post-conviction court summarily dismissed Brewster's petition. The Court of Criminal Appeals vacated that dismissal and remanded the case for the trial court to take evidence and enter findings of fact. On remand, the trial court did that and denied relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is what that\n   court said about why it was rejecting Brewster's claim that his counsel were ineffective for failing to object or move for a mistrial based on the jury's repeated statements that it was deadlocked and the judges' repeated instructions ordering it to keep deliberating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   It is well settled in this State that an\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge in a criminal case is proper so long as it is not coercive or threatening. Here, Appellant states that the jury was coerced into reaching a verdict; but\n   <em>\n    he fails to cite the language that he finds coercive or threatening\n   </em>\n   . Indeed,\n   <em>\n    a review of all of the language in the supplemental charge fails to show that any of it was coercive or threatening. Absent such, trial counsels' [sic] performance cannot be deficient\n   </em>\n   in failing to move for a mistrial where none was warranted, or objecting where no objection was merited. As a result thereof, the Appellant has failed to show that his trial counsels' [sic] performance was deficient, and this ground is found by the Court to be without merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Emphasis added and citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Brewster appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals, which affirmed the post-conviction trial court's decision, concluding that its \"findings [were] supported by the record on remand, the record of the Rule 32 evidentiary hearing, and the record on direct appeal.\" (Quotation marks omitted.) The Alabama Supreme Court denied Brewster's petition for a writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Brewster then filed this \u00a7 2254 petition in federal district court. He again alleged that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to object or move for a mistrial based on the trial court's multiple instructions to the jury to continue deliberating. His federal claim was worded almost identically to the one he had raised in his state court Rule 32 petition. But this is how the magistrate judge interpreted Brewster's claim: \"Brewster next argues that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to make a motion for a mistrial or for failing to object when the trial court instructed the jury to continue deliberations after the jury informed the court that it was deadlocked.\" Relying on the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act's deferential standard of review for claims adjudicated on the merits in state court, and the state court's reasoning that Brewster had failed to cite any coercive or threatening language in \"the supplemental charge,\" the magistrate judge rejected the claim. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and dismissed Brewster's \u00a7 2254 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Brewster appealed and we granted a certificate of appealability on three claims, only two of which are relevant to our resolution of this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Whether the state post-conviction court and the district court misconstrued Brewster's claim-that his trial counsel w[ere] ineffective for failing to object or move for a mistrial when the trial court continued to instruct the jury to deliberate after the jury indicated on three occasions that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict-as arguing that trial counsel w[ere] ineffective for failing to challenge the language of the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   instruction as coercive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Whether Brewster's trial counsel w[ere] ineffective for failing to object or move for a mistrial when the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury to continue deliberating, after the jury indicated on three occasions that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   the district court's denial of a habeas petition.\n   <em>\n    McNair v.

Instead, they recast his claim as an attack on the language of one of the supplemental instructions (without specifying which of the supplemental instructions they were examining or how they selected that one). The state courts rejected the recast claim after finding that \"a review of all of the language in the supplemental charge fails to show that any of it was coercive or threatening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   That may be well and good, as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough to cover Brewster's claim. His claim is that the total force and effect of the two trial judges instructing the jury over and over again that it must keep deliberating after the jury declared over and over again that it was unable to reach a verdict, was coercive.

The jury's first deadlock note reported that the split was 9 to 3 and \"[e]veryone is firm in their decision.\" When asked whether there was \"any way this case will be resolved on a unanimous verdict,\" the foreman answered \"no.\" The second deadlock note reported that the jury \"could not reach a unanimous decision\" and that one juror \"had decided not guilty and no amount of time was going to sway them.\" The third one reported that \"all jurors have decided firmly, eleven guilty, one not guilty, no possibility of resolve.\" The fourth one stated that the holdout juror was \"unwilling to discuss the case.\" And the fifth one informed the judge that the holdout juror was still refusing to discuss the case and was doing crossword puzzles instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   After each of the first four deadlock reports, the judge gave the jurors instructions of varying formality requiring them to continue deliberating and try to reach a unanimous verdict. After the fifth and final deadlock report, the judge's action in having all of the reading materials taken out of the jury room sent a strong message to the jury to get back to deliberating. One or two, or even three, instructions requiring a deadlocked jury to keep on deliberating might not be a problem, depending on the surrounding circumstances. But five instructions aimed at breaking a deadlock is a lot (especially, as we will discuss, when the judge knew exactly how the jury was divided).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   While \"[w]e have never adopted a\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   rule against successive\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charges,\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011947\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/1305/#p1312\">\n    779 F.3d at 1312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the more times a jury tells the court that it is deadlocked, and the more times the court responds by instructing the jury to continue deliberating, the greater the risk of coercion. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fossler\n   </em>\n   , for instance, we concluded that the use of two\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charges at the defendant's trial coerced a verdict where the jury \"indicated at three separate points in time, over a three day period, that it could not reach a decision,\" and \"[o]nly one hour after the second [\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ] charge was sent to the jury, a guilty verdict was returned.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385847\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/597/478/#p485\">\n    597 F.2d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The circumstances in this case are more extreme. The jurors faced the cumulative effect of a formal\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge, three additional instructions from the court to continue deliberating after the judge knew that there was only one holdout left, and the removal of all reading material from the jury room in direct response to a report that the holdout juror was using that material to keep holding out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Pressure on jurors, especially on holdout jurors, is increased when the instructions to keep trying to reach unanimity come from a judge who knows how split the jury is and in which direction. That is why the Supreme Court has exercised its supervisory authority to prohibit federal judges from inquiring how deadlocked juries are split. The Court has explained that inquiring about the specifics of the split \"serves no useful purpose,\" tends to be coercive, and \"can rarely be resorted to without bringing to bear ... an improper influence upon the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Brasfield v.

The problem exists whether the judge asked for the information or the jury disclosed it without any prompting.

In that instruction the judge used the word oath nine times, the last time being when he concluded his charge with this statement: \"[Y]ou took an oath. I take mine seriously. I hope you do the same.\" Though the judge addressed his admonitions to the entire jury, the lone holdout must have felt as though they were aimed at her.

Things kept getting worse for the defense. It doesn't take \"the pricking of my thumbs\" to know that \"something wicked this way comes\" for a defendant when a jury goes from 9 to 3 for conviction to 11 to 1 for conviction and the lone holdout faces the coercive circumstances that this one did.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   William Shakespeare, The Tragedy of Macbeth, act 4, sc. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As the Second Circuit observed: \"In deciding whether to move for a mistrial when a jury reports deadlock, a defendant acting completely rationally would compare the likely consequences of allowing the jury to deliberate longer with the likely consequences of obtaining a mistrial.\"\n   <em>\n    Lane v.

Tactical decisions need rational reasons behind them.

The\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   case involved an attorney who did not move for a mistrial to which the defendant was entitled under state law based on a prosecutor's inappropriate comment during the sentencing phase of a capital case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   , 586 F.3d at 1332.

First, the defendant in that case was a black man accused of murdering a white woman, and his attorney had managed after five days of extensive voir dire to have a jury selected that consisted of eight black jurors and four white jurors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We noted that \"[a]n attorney reasonably could have considered the jury composition favorable and not wanted to risk losing it in a do-over.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, if a mistrial had been declared, the original jury (which had found Hammond guilty) would have been excused and a new one empaneled to determine only the sentence. The new jury would \"be instructed that Hammond had been found guilty and then would be immersed in the horrible details of the crimes he had committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We concluded that a reasonable attorney might want to avoid that prospect in favor of keeping the original jury because it might have some residual doubts from the guilt phase of the trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1333-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Third, we also found that \"an attorney could have reasonably believed that a new sentence hearing months in the future would open up for reconsideration some evidentiary rulings that had been made in\n   Hammond's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1334. Finally, we considered that a reasonable attorney could have relied on the presumption that the jury would disregard the prosecutor's improper remark when it was told to do so by the court and that this was a better option than seeking a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"In sum,\" we concluded, \"not asking for a mistrial was objectively within the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1335 (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In Brewster's case \"[t]here is no indication in the record that [counsel's] failure even to raise an objection [or move for a mistrial] ... was a product of any tactical forethought and we can only speculate as to the reasons for [their] silence.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Perhaps they thought that any objection would be meritless. If so, they were really wrong. Or perhaps they didn't see the obvious signs of coercion or didn't know that a coerced verdict was unlawful.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   , there was no conceivable reason, no reasonable strategy, for sitting silent and seeing how things would turn out.
