The ZBA said no. So, relying on a provision of federal law that allows a disappointed wireless service provider like T Mobile to seek review in a district court \"within 30 days after\" a zoning authority's \"final action,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(B)(v), T Mobile filed suit. After the case had proceeded for over a year, however, the District Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction. The Court reasoned that because T Mobile filed its complaint before the ZBA released a written decision confirming an earlier oral rejection of the zoning application, the claim was not ripe. And, since T Mobile did not supplement its complaint to include the ZBA's written decision within 30 days of its issuance, the\n   Court also concluded that relation back could not remedy the ripeness defect. The District Court thus granted the City's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   T Mobile now appeals. It argues that its complaint was not premature or, in the alternative, that its supplemental pleading cured any ripeness problem. We agree that the grant of summary judgment was improper and, for the reasons that follow, will remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

At the same time, the TCA also serves to preserve local zoning authority.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At issue here are three key sections of the statute. First, the TCA mandates that \"[a] State or local government or instrumentality thereof shall act on any request for authorization to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(ii). The Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") has interpreted \"reasonable period of time\" in that statutory provision to mean that zoning authorities have a \"shot clock\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and must act within 90 days of an application to attach an antenna to an existing structure or 150 days of an application where a new support structure is to be built.\n   <em>\n    Petition for Declaratory Ruling to Clarify Provisions of Section 332(c)(7)(B)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20FCC%20Rcd%2013994\">\n    24 FCC Rcd. 13994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14008, 14012 (2009). Second, in what we will call the \"review provision\" of the statute, the TCA grants \"[a]ny person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof\" a right to have that locality's decision reviewed by \"commenc[ing] an action\" \"within 30 days\" in district court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(B)(v). Third, in the statute's \"denial provision,\" the TCA states that \"[a]ny decision by a State or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). Notably, the terms \"act,\" \"final action,\" and \"decision ... to deny\" are not defined in the TCA. Furthermore, the statute does not make clear whether \"final action\" should be read to encompass all decisions to deny, including oral ones, nor does it address whether there is a difference between an \"act\" for\n   purposes of the shot clock and a \"final action\" for purposes of judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   T Mobile is a telecommunications service provider. It says that it needs to erect a cellular antenna to fill \"a significant gap\" in coverage for its customers in Wilmington, Delaware, (Opening Br. at 3) presumably where there has been an increase in phone calls and data usage. T Mobile wants to put its antenna on top of a senior living high-rise in the City, but, because a special exception to local zoning laws is needed, it first had to go to the ZBA. It filed an initial application and then, on August 25, 2016, a final amended application, seeking the exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ZBA held a hearing on October 26, 2016, to consider T Mobile's request, some two months after the final amended application was submitted. During the hearing, T Mobile presented evidence of the need for the antenna and discussed proposals to address aesthetic concerns. The ZBA also received objections from members of the local community, some of whom were outspoken in worrying about the effects of radio frequency emissions. At the end of the hearing, the ZBA denied T Mobile's application in a unanimous oral decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Board gave several reasons for the denial. One board member said the ZBA should not encourage the use of a senior living community rooftop as the base for an antenna because of the potential adverse effect on the properties in the neighborhood. Another board member said there was not enough proof of a need for additional coverage to support the application. The Chairman said there was not enough evidence that T Mobile needed the antenna and that it did not appear to satisfy the zoning code in terms of placement and height restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ZBA's oral decision to deny the application was not put in writing on October 26 or anytime soon thereafter. According to T Mobile, that fits a \"pattern and practice of [the ZBA] not issuing a written decision of land use denials unless or until the City is sued.\" (Opening Br. at 7.) Only after T Mobile had filed its initial complaint in the District Court, and after the City filed its answer, did the ZBA issue its written decision and explanation of its reasoning for denying the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   T Mobile asserts that the denial of its application violates the TCA. Under the statute, such a denial is invalid if it has the \"effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(B)(i)(II), or is \"on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iv). T Mobile claims that Wilmington's denial was improper on both of those grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But those assertions go to the merits and are not actually before us on this appeal. At issue now is whether T Mobile's claim can be heard at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Evidently with its eye on the 30-day deadline in the TCA's review provision, T Mobile filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware within 30 days of the ZBA's oral decision, challenging that denial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to its\n   claims on the merits, T Mobile's initial complaint alleged that the City violated procedures mandated in the TCA, specifically those in the denial provision, by failing to provide a written decision contemporaneous with its oral decision and by not supporting the denial with substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties entered into a stipulation asking the District Court for an expedited case schedule, as provided for in the review provision of the TCA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(B)(v). That request was granted. Wilmington then answered the complaint, asserting a number of affirmative defenses, including that the complaint was not ripe because the ZBA had not yet issued a final written decision. Nevertheless, the City did not, at that time, file a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or for lack of jurisdiction. Two days after the City filed its answer, the ZBA issued a written decision on T Mobile's application. The parties pressed forward with the suit and prepared a discovery plan, which specifically mentioned the written decision. T Mobile filed a motion for summary judgment, which the City met with a cross-motion for summary judgment. The City's motion was styled in the alternative as a motion to dismiss the complaint as unripe because it was filed prematurely, i.e., before the written decision had been issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Not until December 21, 2017, nearly a year after the ZBA issued its written denial, did T Mobile file a motion seeking leave to amend or supplement the initial complaint to note the issuance of that written decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court granted the motion to supplement. Wilmington then responded by moving to dismiss the supplemental complaint as untimely because it failed to cure the defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ultimately, the District Court granted Wilmington's cross-motion for summary judgment for want of jurisdiction, without ruling on the City's motion to dismiss. The Court first concluded that the initial complaint was irreparably unripe because both the TCA and Delaware law require the ZBA to issue a written decision before the agency's action could be considered final, and T Mobile had thus filed its initial complaint too soon. Second, the Court said that the supplemental complaint could not fix the ripeness problem because it was filed past the 30-day window for seeking review of the ZBA's final action. Because the Court reached that determination, it found it unnecessary to conclude whether T Mobile's supplemental complaint was entitled to the benefit of the relation-back doctrine under Rule 15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   T Mobile challenges the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Wilmington, contending that there is jurisdiction to hear its case. It advances two alternative grounds for reversal: that its complaint was ripe because the ZBA's oral decision qualifies as a \"final action\" under the review provision of the TCA, and, in the alternative, that the supplemental complaint relates back to and cures any ripeness problem with its initial complaint. Those arguments in turn raise three questions for determining whether the District Court's jurisdictional ruling was proper. First, whether the oral decision of the ZBA was a final action. Second, whether the timing requirement in the TCA's review provision is jurisdictional. And third, whether an untimely supplemental complaint can relate back and cure an unripe initial complaint. Although we disagree with T Mobile that an oral decision of the ZBA qualifies as a \"final action,\" we agree that jurisdiction was proper in the District Court because the timing requirement in the TCA's review provision is non-jurisdictional, and T Mobile's supplemental complaint therefore relates back and cures the ripeness problem with the initial complaint. The District Court should thus have reached the merits of the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Oral Decision Was Not a Final Action of the ZBA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The ripeness of T Mobile's initial complaint depends upon whether the ZBA's oral decision was a \"final action\" within the meaning of the TCA. Consideration of that issue uncovers another: whether the TCA requires a locality to render its decision in writing for that decision to qualify as a final action. The District Court held that, under both federal and Delaware law, only a written decision can serve as a final action of the ZBA. Because traditional hallmarks of agency action and the statutory text and structure of the TCA favor that approach, we agree that only a written decision can serve as a locality's final action when denying an application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Delaware Riverkeeper Network v. Secretary Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ( Riverkeeper III )\n   </em>\n   , we determined that, when reviewing finality under the Natural Gas Act, \"[a]lthough the decisionmaking process we are reviewing is defined by [state] law, we nevertheless apply a federal finality standard to determine whether Congress has made the results of that process reviewable[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518572\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/65/#p72\">\n    903 F.3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72 (3d Cir. 2018). The same reasoning holds true here, since, for the TCA just as for the Natural Gas Act, \"the finality requirement itself, along with the presumption that Congress intended us to apply it, are creatures of federal, not state, law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under federal law, not all agency determinations are final actions.\n   <em>\n    Bacon v.

We noted those hallmarks on an earlier occasion\n   when we said that, \"[f]inal agency action must mark the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process, must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature, and must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\"\n   <em>\n    Riverkeeper III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518572\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/65/#p72\">\n    903 F.3d at 72, 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To decide what the TCA requires for finality, we begin, of course, with the text.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

We see no reason why the same should not be true for actions besides denial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but we need not decide that today. It is enough to say that, in those zoning decisions governed by the TCA, a locality's oral declaration of a denial is \"of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Riverkeeper III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518572\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/65/#p72\">\n    903 F.3d at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (speaking in reference to the Natural Gas Act);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Athens Cellular, Inc. v.

Federal law governs finality, but Delaware's procedures still matter, and the Delaware Superior Court has concluded that a written document must be filed for a ZBA action to be final.\n   <em>\n    McDonald's Corp. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment for the City of Wilmington\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.

Jan. 10, 2002). The court reasoned that Section 328 of Title 22 of the Delaware Code, the section that governs appeals from ZBA proceedings, requires a written document to be filed because the statute \"provides that [s]uch petition shall be presented to the Court within 30 days\n   <em>\n    after the filing of the decision in the office of the board\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (internal quotation marks omitted).

Requiring a written decision focuses review on a particular, documented statement of reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    USCOC of Greater Mo. v.

It also prevents ambiguity with respect to when a claim can be brought. As the District Court here stated, to hold otherwise \"would promote a pernicious ambiguity as to when that short period of time begins to run.\" (App. at 7.) And it promotes uniformity of federal procedures by clarifying when, across all jurisdictions, an action becomes final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    T-Mobile South, LLC v. City of Roswell, Georgia\n   </em>\n   , also adds support to the conclusion that only a written denial can constitute final action, triggering a party's right to review. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594216\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/808/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594216\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/808/\">\n    190 L.Ed.2d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).

In doing so, the Court tied together a local zoning authority's final action, which triggers judicial review, and its decision to deny, which must be in writing.

That further counsels against treating an oral determination as a final action since, if an oral determination is deemed a final action, localities will be unable to take advantage of the permissible delay afforded by the shot clock for publishing their reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Two of our sister courts of appeals agree that only a written decision can constitute final action. The Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    USCOC of Greater Missouri v.

The Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Preferred Sites LLC v.

No circuit has held otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Persuasive authority thus indicates that any action, and certainly a denial, must be in writing to be final. But, there is another possible interpretation of the statutory text. The words \"shall be in writing\" could be read not as a condition of finality, but instead as a simple directive to state and local governments to place their final action in writing. \"The TCA provides no express answer to ... when a local government's permitting decision becomes a 'final action,' which starts the thirty-day clock.\"\n   <em>\n    Athens Cellular\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516381\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/1094/#p1104\">\n    886 F.3d at 1102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Decisions to grant are not limited in the same way.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And, Congress used the words \"decision to deny\" in one statutory subsection and \"final action\" in another, which could evince an intent to give those terms different meanings. As the Supreme Court has \"recognized ... Congress's use of certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another can indicate that different meanings were intended.\"\n   <em>\n    Sebelius v. Auburn Reg'l Med.

Therefore, as that oral determination was not reduced to writing until December 22, 2016, preceding the filing of T Mobile's initial complaint, that complaint's cause of action was not ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. No Separate Time Limit Exists Following an Oral Determination.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As an alternative to its argument that the ZBA's oral decision was a final action, T Mobile asks us to consider whether a \"local government must issue the 'writing' close in time to the 'decision ... to deny' to establish a 'final action' that will be subject to expedited review.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Opening Br. at 41.) Essentially, T Mobile is asserting that the \"shot clock\" governing the time to act, which allows a wireless carrier to sue for a locality's failure to act, is insufficient, and that a new requirement, albeit not in the statute, should be imposed on localities. Under T Mobile's proposed rule, an oral decision would have to be reduced to writing within a specified time period. That argument assumes that an oral determination can serve to satisfy the requirement to \"act\" on a request within the limits of the shot clock, and that, without a separate judicially created time limit, there would be no deadline for the locality to release its written decision to deny, despite\n   <em>\n    City of Rowell's\n   </em>\n   contemporaneous writing requirement. Because we conclude that a denial must be in writing to be a final action, the issuance of that writing is the government \"act\" ruled by the shot clock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aside from the time limits associated with the \"shot clock,\" there is no other deadline governing the issuance of a written decision following an oral determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(b). Any time limit we fabricated would be inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   T Mobile argues that, without a requirement for localities to issue a written decision within a set amount of time following an oral determination, wireless carriers are left \"to wait until the FCC 'shot clock' expires - which could be 90 or 150 days depending on the type of installation involved - and then [to] file an action alleging that the City has failed to act in a reasonable time[.]\" (Opening Br. at 45.) It also contends that a \"failure to act\" lawsuit is insufficient because the remedy for a successful suit is simply an order telling the City to issue a written decision. In T Mobile's view, forcing wireless providers to sue both to compel a written decision once the shot clock is violated and again to contest the written decision serves only to \"create yet further delay.\" (Opening Br. at 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Those concerns are overstated and, in any case, irrelevant. The shot clock begins to run once a wireless provider files its application, so it is already ticking before any oral decision is made. If the locality fails to meet that deadline by not issuing a written decision before the shot clock expires, the wireless provider can bring a claim for a \"failure to act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20FCC%20Rcd%2013994\">\n    24 FCC Rcd. 13994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14012 (2009). T Mobile asserts that requiring a separate failure-to-act suit, in addition to a suit on the merits, undercuts the statutory purpose of expedited judicial review, particularly in cases where the locality has a \"pattern and practice of not issuing a written decision of land use denials unless or until [it] is sued.\" (Opening Br. at 7.) But the statute's own remedies cannot possibly undercut its purpose. A separate failure-to-act claim is the very remedy Congress chose for shot clock violations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20FCC%20Rcd%2014013\">\n    24 FCC Rcd. 14013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 4 (2009). Whether or not T Mobile likes that policy choice, it is the one Congress made, and we are not free to change it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Timing Requirement Is Not Jurisdictional.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because we hold that a writing is required for a denial to constitute a final action, T Mobile's initial complaint was not ripe for review when filed. And, T Mobile's supplemental complaint was filed more than 30 days after the ZBA issued its written decision and was therefore untimely under the TCA's review provision.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(B)(v). Thus, the District Court only had jurisdiction if T Mobile's supplemental complaint cured the ripeness flaw in its initial complaint by relating back to the original filing date. If the 30-day time limit in the TCA's review provision is nonjurisdictional, we can safely say that relation back is possible and allows a supplemental complaint to cure a defective premature filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the outset, then, we must determine whether that 30-day time limit is jurisdictional, being mindful both of the Supreme Court's counsel to exercise caution before holding timing requirements to be jurisdictional and of its guidance regarding what constitutes a jurisdictional limit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p156\">\n    568 U.S. at 149, 153-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p156\">\n    133 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We disagree. The differences between the review provision's timing requirement and the timing requirement we held to be jurisdictional in\n   <em>\n    Kalb\n   </em>\n   , and the similarities between the review provision's timing requirements and those at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Musacchio\n   </em>\n   , which the Supreme Court held to be nonjurisdictional, actually support treating the timing requirement in the TCA's review provision as nonjurisdictional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, although Wilmington says that the text of the statute indicates Congress's desire to make the 30-day timing requirement jurisdictional, the text does not use the term \"jurisdictional\" or any variation of it to describe the timing requirement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(B)(v). To the contrary, the statute uses permissive rather than mandatory language. Unlike the timing requirement we held to be jurisdictional in\n   <em>\n    Kalb\n   </em>\n   , which mandated that an action would be barred if not filed in time, the TCA's review provision states that an action \"may\" be filed within 30-days.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalb\n   </em>\n   , 891 F.3d at 460\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(B)(v).

In\n   <em>\n    Kalb\n   </em>\n   , moreover, we made the same point the City now does, stating that a timing requirement was jurisdictional because \"the thirty-day appeal period here is embedded in the same statutory section that grants jurisdiction to the court of appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But the location of the timing requirement within the statutory structure, without more, does not clearly reveal Congressional intent. As noted by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   , a timing requirement should not be classified as jurisdictional solely based on its placement in a jurisdictional provision.\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p156\">\n    568 U.S. at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p156\">\n    133 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A requirement we would otherwise classify as nonjurisdictional ... does not become jurisdictional simply because it is placed in a section of a statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

In\n   <em>\n    Musacchio\n   </em>\n   too, the Supreme Court held that a timing requirement was nonjurisdictional despite its presence in the jurisdiction-granting section of the statute at issue. 136 S.Ct. at 717. The Court emphasized that the statute did not directly speak of the timing requirement as jurisdictional, despite its mandatory language.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . That reasoning applies with at least equal force here, so the context of the review provision's timing requirement does not make the requirement jurisdictional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, Wilmington asserts that the timing requirement is jurisdictional because of the historical treatment of similar provisions. The City asserts that the phrase \"within 30 days after\" creates a \"window,\" during which a complaint must be filed, and not a \"deadline.\" (Answering Br. at 11-12 (citing\n   <em>\n    W. Union Tel. Co. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3601414,18239\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/773/375/\">\n    773 F.2d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ) (noting that \"within 60 days after\" creates a 60-day filing window while \"no later than 60 days after\" creates a filing deadline).) But that argument misses the point because it goes to whether the rule bars suit\n   between certain dates or only after a certain date, not to whether the timing requirement is jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Union Tel.

And just because a complaint may be unripe before a particular date does not mean that a deadline by which suit must be filed is jurisdictional. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Kalb\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Bowles\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reed Elsevier\n   </em>\n   both looked to \"the Court's prior treatment of [similar timing requirements.]\"\n   <em>\n    Kalb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517103\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/455/#p460\">\n    891 F.3d at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   , the timing requirement, as here, used the phrase \"within\" and thus, under Wilmington's logic, it would have been a jurisdictional limit.\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p156\">\n    568 U.S. at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p156\">\n    133 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Supreme Court held otherwise,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., and that is of high importance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because the text and context of this statute, and historical treatment of timing requirements in similar statutes, do not reveal a clear intent from Congress to make the review provision's timing requirement jurisdictional, we conclude that it is not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Rule 15 Allows a Supplemental Complaint Filed After a Claims Processing Deadline To Relate Back and Cure an Unripe Initial Complaint.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We next consider whether an untimely supplemental complaint can, by relating back, cure an initial complaint that was unripe. We believe it can, and because T Mobile's motion to supplement its complaint was properly granted, that supplemental complaint relates back and is ripe. The District Court therefore had jurisdiction and should not have granted Wilmington's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At the outset, we note that the parties do not dispute, and we agree, that the District Court was within its discretion to grant T Mobile's motion to supplement its complaint. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d), \"[o]n motion and reasonable notice, the [district] court may, on just terms, permit a [moving] party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any ... event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3 James Wm. Moore et al.,\n   <em>\n    Moore's Federal Practice\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.30 (3d ed. 2018) (\"Supplemental pleadings ... are limited to subsequent events related to the claim or defense presented in the original pleading.\"). Here, the District Court rightly granted T Mobile's motion to supplement. That decision was just, since Wilmington had long since had notice of the event - the filing of the written denial - that occurred after the initial pleading. After all, the City issued that denial, and the denial was featured in the parties' discovery plan. The issuance of it was also plainly related to T Mobile's initial complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   That the initial complaint was premature is not a bar since, under Rule 15(d), \"[t]he court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim for relief or defense.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d). As the Advisory Committee Notes make clear, \" Rule 15(d) is intended to give the [district] court broad discretion in allowing a supplemental pleading.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) advisory committee's note to 1963 amendment. It is furthermore \"within the discretion of the court to allow a supplemental pleading to be filed at any stage of the case[.]\" Moore\n   et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.30. The District Court here was thus well within its discretion in granting T Mobile's motion to supplement the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Rule 15 does not indicate whether or under what circumstances a supplemental pleading can relate back to the date of the original pleading to avoid the effect of a time limit. 6A Charles Alan Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1508 (3d ed. 2018). Subsection (c) of the Rule, which provides for the relation back of amended pleadings, does not specifically refer to supplemental pleadings. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c). Nor does Rule 15(d) make any mention of relation back. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d). But case law and secondary sources have long instructed that once a supplemental complaint is granted, it is treated like an amended complaint for purposes of relation back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even though Rule 15(d) is in a separate statutory provision from Rule 15(c), a supplemental complaint can relate back.

That stands to reason, since, if a \"defendant had notice of the subject matter of the dispute and was not prejudiced in preparing a defense ...[,] the policy against stale claims becomes subsidiary to the policy expressed throughout the rules in favor of allowing a party to set forth all the grievances against another party in one action and resolving them on their merits.\" Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1508.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   So a pleading filed according to Rule 15(d) can relate back, assuming it meets \"the basic test for relation back prescribed by Rule 15(c).\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Moore et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.30 (\"A supplemental pleading may relate back to the date of the original complaint if the requirements under Rule 15(c) for relation back are satisfied\");\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The District Court here concluded that\n   there was no need to determine whether T Mobile's supplemental complaint related back, because, even if it did, \"it fail[ed] to cure the deficiencies of the initial complaint[.]\" (App. at 8.) But given our view that the supplemental complaint could indeed cure the ripeness problem with the initial complaint, we must contend with the relation-back question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To determine if relation back is proper, the only issue is whether there is a \"common core of operative facts in the two pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Bensel v.

Here, that test is met. Both complaints rely on the same core facts.

At no point in that case was the complaint ripe, and the petitioner still had a petition for reconsideration pending before the relevant agency on the date the case was decided.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 287. Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    Council Tree\n   </em>\n   explicitly acknowledged that a supplemental complaint can cure an unripe complaint when there is jurisdiction over that supplemental pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 291 (\"[W]e note that 'nothing prevented [the petitioners] from supplementing their premature petition with a later protective petition.' \" (second alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Horsehead Res.

Cir. 1997) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Wilmington also makes three policy arguments in support of its position that an untimely supplemental complaint should not be able to cure an unripe complaint. First, it contends that allowing suits to be filed before an action is ripe would \"extend[ ] federal court jurisdiction over local government actions before those actions are final[.]\" (Answering Br. at 9.) Second, such filings would waste judicial resources and, in this case, cost taxpayers money, by forcing courts to deal with a higher volume of unripe complaints. Third, the purpose of \u00a7 332 is to preserve local zoning authority, which would be undermined by allowing plaintiffs to file suit early and thereby places undue pressure on zoning commissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Those contentions, however, are unpersuasive. First, a court would remain without jurisdiction if the claim had not ripened by the time of the supplemental complaint. Second, it seems that Wilmington overstates the impact that a decision allowing an unripe complaint to be cured would have, since our holding today makes it clear that an action is not final until a written decision has been issued. Clarifying when a determination is ripe for review\n   should end any incentive for aggrieved parties to file early to ensure they have not filed too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Perhaps more importantly, however, courts can police any potential abuse on a case-by-case basis using Rule 15(d) and the Rule 15(c) test for relation back. It is understood that \"relation back of a supplemental pleading should not result in providing unfair procedural advantages to a plaintiff[,] so ... relation back may not be for all purposes.\" Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1508. But here no unfair advantage has resulted, and defendants in general will be adequately protected by a district court's Rule 15(d) analysis, which will determine if a supplemental complaint should be allowed at all. For instance, if a locality's action is not yet a final action at the time a Rule 15(d) motion is filed, the motion can easily be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beezley v. Fremont Indem. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1662678\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/804/530/#p530\">\n    804 F.2d 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (9th Cir. 1986) (supplemental pleading denied when it still failed to cure defective original pleading).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   When all is said and done here, we conclude that, to effectuate the liberal purpose of Rule 15 and to avoid the endless feedback loop that the City's legal argument would create, Rule 15 allows an untimely supplemental complaint to relate back and cure an unripe initial complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the District Court's grant of the City's motion for summary judgment, vacate the District Court's denial of T Mobile's motion for summary judgment, and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    \"Shot clock\" is a term borrowed from basketball.

That, however, is precisely what Congress envisioned by providing separate remedies for a failure to \"act\" within a reasonable time period and for an improper denial.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n     47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(7)(B)(iii).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    T Mobile attempts to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Preferred Sites\n    </em>\n    by stating that, unlike here, the case did \"not address a city that does not issue a written decision close in time to when it makes the decision to deny.\" (Opening Br. at 37.) But that argument is irrelevant to whether the statutory text requires a writing for an agency decision to be final. T Mobile also cites to\n    <em>\n     Preferred Sites\n    </em>\n    to argue that it should not matter if there is a writing requirement since the oral denial could be seen as akin to a court announcing a decision. It explains that \"when an appeal is filed after the court announces a decision, but before the entry of the judgment, it is treated as being filed on the date of entry.\" (Opening Br. at 28-29 (citing\n    <em>\n     Preferred Sites\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9406832\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/1210/#p1217\">\n     296 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1217 n.7 ).) That analogy did appear in\n    <em>\n     Preferred Sites\n    </em>\n    , but it was only contained in a footnote.

In\n    <em>\n     City of Roswell\n    </em>\n    , for example, the Supreme Court indicated that minutes of an oral meeting could be sufficient. 135 S.Ct. at 816.

Otherwise, if a locality were able to withhold its reasoning for its decision, those aggrieved by the locality's actions would \"be left to guess at what the locality's written reasons will be, write a complaint that contains those hypotheses, and risk being sandbagged by the written reasons that the locality subsequently provides in litigation after the challenging entity has shown its cards.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 816 n.3. If an applicant cannot file suit, however, because the locality's \"final action\" has not yet occurred, those concerns vanish.
