Bennett appeals from the district court's award of summary judgment in favor of his former employer, Virtus Consulting, LLC (Virtus), and its owner, James Garner (collectively, the defendants), in Bennett's action seeking to collect on a state court judgment entered against the defendants. The district court held that Bennett's claims were precluded under Virginia's doctrine of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon our review, we conclude that Bennett's claims are not precluded, because Bennett could not have brought those claims at the time of his earlier litigation. Accordingly, we vacate the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We present the facts in the light most favorable to Bennett, the nonmoving party, and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.\n   <em>\n    Rosetta Stone Ltd. v.

Virtus is a Virginia limited liability company that provides consulting services to various financial institutions. Garner is the owner and sole member of Virtus. Bennett was employed by Virtus and worked as the principal contact for one of Virtus' largest clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, Garner began negotiations to sell Virtus' assets to the Solomon Edwards Group (SEG). Around the same time, the defendants and Bennett signed an agreement, in which Bennett agreed to assist in the sale in exchange for \"sharing [in the] proceeds\" from the sale (the Bennett Agreement). Under the Bennett Agreement, once the sale to SEG successfully closed, Bennett would receive a fixed cash payment made in quarterly installments. The parties also agreed that Bennett potentially\n   could receive two annual \"earn out\" payments, depending on whether SEG and Garner achieved certain revenue targets in the two years following the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The sale of Virtus' assets to SEG successfully closed around the end of September 2012. In accordance with the Bennett Agreement, Garner made the first two quarterly installment payments to Bennett. But, in April 2013, the defendants ceased making any further payments, claiming that Bennett had breached his obligations under the agreement. Bennett, however, maintained that he was entitled to the remaining installment payments and the \"earn out\" payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties submitted their dispute to an arbitrator as required by the arbitration clause in the Bennett Agreement. During the arbitration proceedings, the defendants provided Bennett documents describing the structure of the SEG sale but did not produce any of Virtus' financial records or bank statements. In response to a request seeking those financial records, the defendants stipulated that the Bennett Agreement was properly executed and that the performance metrics triggering the \"earn out\" payments had been \"met in full.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September 2014, the arbitrator ordered Virtus to pay Bennett $387,500. Under the terms of the Bennett Agreement, the arbitrator held Garner jointly and severally liable for $125,000 of that award. The award was confirmed by a Virginia circuit court and reduced to a judgment. Although Garner paid the portion of the award for which he personally was liable, Virtus failed to pay the remaining $262,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the arbitration award was confirmed, Bennett obtained Virtus' bank statements. These statements showed that shortly before the SEG sale closed, Garner had transferred substantially all of Virtus' cash reserves to himself. Further, Bennett learned that the SEG sale had been structured to divert all cash and other consideration from the sale to Garner personally. For instance, equity stock in SEG that was supposed to transfer to Virtus as part of the sale was instead listed in Garner's name and reported as part of Garner's personal tax returns. Thus, Virtus lacked sufficient assets to satisfy Bennett's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2017, Bennett initiated the present action in the district court seeking to collect on his judgment. He asserted four claims against the defendants: (1) fraudulent conveyance, in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 55-80 ; (2) voluntary transfer, in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 55-81 (together, the fraudulent transfer claims); (3) a claim seeking to \"pierce the corporate veil\" and recover the judgment amount directly from Garner (the alter-ego claim); and (4) fraud in the inducement. The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, concluding that Bennett's fraudulent transfer claims and alter-ego claim were precluded under Virginia's doctrine of res judicata.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review de novo the district court's award of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Rosetta Stone Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757645\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/144/#p150\">\n    676 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before addressing the parties' arguments, we begin by reviewing the applicable\n   principles of res judicata.

The defendants argue, as they did in the district court, that because Bennett had knowledge of the structure of the SEG sale at the time of the arbitration, Bennett\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have raised both his fraudulent transfer and alter-ego claims during those proceedings.

That is, instead of seeking to \"relitigate\" the defendants' liability under the Bennett Agreement, Bennett argues that his fraudulent transfer claims were an attempt to collect on the judgment he is owed and could not have been brought before the judgment was entered. With respect to his alter-ego claim, Bennett similarly argues that he could not have maintained that claim before obtaining the judgment against Virtus.

Nor does he seek damages beyond the outstanding $262,500 judgment, the precise amount awarded in arbitration. Although the alleged wrongful transfers took place around the same time as the SEG sale, those transfers were immaterial to the question whether either Bennett or the defendants had breached the Bennett Agreement. Thus, Bennett is not seeking a \"second bite of the apple\" with respect to the amount he is owed.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647161\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/795/887/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, he seeks only to unwind the allegedly improper transfers from Virtus to Garner so that Virtus can satisfy the existing judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Furthermore, we observe that had Bennett claimed that the defendants were attempting to defraud him by transferring assets, before he proved that he was entitled to payments under the Bennett Agreement, those fraudulent transfer claims would have been premature. At the time of the arbitration proceedings, Bennett did not have sufficient information about Virtus' financial condition to allege a fraudulent conveyance or voluntary transfer. Neither defendant disclosed any financial records or bank statements to Bennett during the arbitration. Indeed, as noted above, rather than produce such documents, the defendants stipulated that the financial benchmarks in the Bennett Agreement had been \"met in full.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It was not until Virtus failed to satisfy the judgment rendered against it, and Bennett received Virtus' relevant financial records, that he learned that Virtus had no remaining assets from which it could pay the judgment. These financial documents also disclosed the recipient of Virtus' transferred assets and the nature of such transfers, allowing Bennett to properly plead his fraudulent transfer claims. Thus, it was only after the state court judgment was entered that Bennett would have had \"actual notice\" of any potential fraudulent transfer claims.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Luria v.

To conclude otherwise essentially would have required Bennett to be clairvoyant. Under the defendants' logic, a plaintiff in Bennett's position would have had to amend his original complaint, adding claims of fraudulent conveyance whenever he suspected that the defendant was moving money to avoid paying a potential judgment. Otherwise, the plaintiff would risk having those claims barred in a later action to collect on that judgment. In other\n   words, Bennett would have had to try to enforce his judgment before the judgment was awarded.

When an individual uses a corporate form to \"disguise wrongs, obscure fraud, or conceal crime,\" Virginia law permits a plaintiff to pierce the corporate veil and to impose liability directly on the individual as the \"alter ego\" of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    Cheatle v. Rudd's Swimming Pool Supply Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2098081\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/234/207/\">\n    234 Va. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20S.E.2d%20828\">\n    360 S.E.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831 (1987). However, before bringing an action to pierce the corporate veil, the plaintiff must \"first obtain[ ] a judgment against the corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    Dana v. 313 Freemason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"622330\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/266/491/\">\n    266 Va. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20S.E.2d%20548\">\n    587 S.E.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553 (2003). Because Bennett was required to obtain a judgment against Virtus before bringing his alter-ego claim, this claim had not yet accrued at the time of the arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, we hold that Bennett's alter-ego claim also is not precluded under Virginia's doctrine of res judicata.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Ambrosio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12649646\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/809/625/#p628\">\n    809 S.E.2d at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, we hold that Bennett's fraudulent transfer claims and his alter-ego claim are not precluded under Virginia law by res judicata.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we vacate the district court's award of summary judgment in favor of the defendants and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The district court also awarded the defendants summary judgment on Bennett's fraud in the inducement claim, concluding that it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations governing fraud claims, Va.
