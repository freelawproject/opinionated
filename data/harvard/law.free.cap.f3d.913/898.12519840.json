Robles alleged that Defendant Domino's Pizza, LLC, (Domino's) failed to design, construct, maintain, and operate its website and mobile application (app) to be fully accessible to him. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Robles accesses the internet using screen-reading software, which vocalizes visual information on websites. Domino's operates a website and app that allows customers to order pizzas and other products for at-home delivery or in-store pickup, and receive exclusive discounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On at least two occasions, Robles unsuccessfully attempted to order online a customized pizza from a nearby Domino's. Robles contends that he could not order the pizza because Domino's failed to design its website and app so his software could read them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In September 2016, Robles filed this suit seeking damages and injunctive relief based on Domino's failure to \"design, construct, maintain, and operate its [website and app] to be fully accessible to and independently usable by Mr. Robles and other blind or visually-impaired people,\" in violation of the ADA and UCRA. Robles sought a \"permanent injunction requiring Defendant to ... comply with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0] for its website and Mobile App.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Domino's\n   moved for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) the ADA did not cover Domino's online offerings; and (2) applying the ADA to the website or app violated Domino's due process rights. Domino's alternatively invoked the primary jurisdiction doctrine, which permits a court to dismiss a complaint pending the resolution of an issue before an administrative agency with special competence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Time Warner Cable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784475\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/1110/#p1114\">\n    523 F.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1114 (9th Cir. 2008) (defining primary jurisdiction doctrine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court first held that Title III of the ADA applied to Domino's website and app. The court highlighted the ADA's \"auxiliary aids and services\" section,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(iii), which requires that covered entities provide auxiliary aids and services to ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from accessing the services of a \"place of public accommodation\"-in this case, from using the website or app to order goods from Domino's physical restaurants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court then addressed Domino's argument that applying the ADA to its website and app violated its due process rights because the Department of Justice (DOJ) had failed to provide helpful guidance, despite announcing its intention to do so in 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2043460\">\n    75 Fed.

AMC Entertainment, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733906\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/760/\">\n    549 F.3d 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2008), concluded that imposing the WCAG 2.0 standards on Domino's \"without specifying a particular level of success criteria and without the DOJ offering meaningful guidance on this topic ... fl[ew] in the face of due process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court held that DOJ \"regulations and technical assistance are necessary for the Court to determine what obligations a regulated individual or institution must abide by in order to comply with Title III.\" In the district court's view, therefore, only the long-awaited regulations from DOJ could cure the due process concerns, so it had no choice but to invoke\n   the primary jurisdiction doctrine. The district court granted Domino's motion to dismiss without prejudice, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We review de novo the district court's interpretation and construction of a federal statute-here, the court's application of the ADA to websites and apps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ASARCO, LLC v. Celanese Chem. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275388,5914469\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1203/\">\n    792 F.3d 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1208 (9th Cir. 2015). As the constitutionality of a statute or regulation is a question of law, we also review de novo the district court's holding that applying the ADA to websites and apps would violate due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Az. Libertarian Party v. Reagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333156\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/723/#p728\">\n    798 F.3d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (9th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    Preminger v.

Finally, we review de novo the court's invocation of the primary jurisdiction doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid v. Johnson &amp; Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072448\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/952/#p958\">\n    780 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 958 (9th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This appeal presents three questions. First, whether the ADA applies to Domino's website and app. Second, if so, whether that holding raises due process concerns. Third, whether a federal court should invoke the primary jurisdiction doctrine because DOJ has failed to provide meaningful guidance on how to make websites and apps comply with the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The ADA's Application to Domino's Website and App\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The ADA \"as a whole is intended 'to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Olmstead v.

Title III of the ADA advances that goal by providing that \"[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). We agree with the district court that the ADA applies to Domino's website and app.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ADA expressly provides that a place of public accommodation, like Domino's, engages in unlawful discrimination if it fails to \"take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). DOJ regulations require that a public accommodation \"furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure\n   <em>\n    effective communication\n   </em>\n   with individuals with disabilities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bragdon\n   </em>\n   , 524 U.S. at 646,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182853\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/624/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that DOJ's administrative guidance on ADA compliance is entitled to deference). And DOJ defines \"auxiliary aids and services\" to include \"accessible electronic and information technology\" or \"other effective methods of making visually delivered materials available\n   to individuals who are blind or have low vision.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Therefore, the ADA mandates that places of public accommodation, like Domino's, provide auxiliary aids and services to make visual materials available to individuals who are blind.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36.303. This requirement applies to Domino's website and app, even though customers predominantly access them away from the physical restaurant: \"The statute applies to the services\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   a place of public accommodation, not services\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   a place of public accommodation. To limit the ADA to discrimination in the provision of services occurring on the premises of a public accommodation would contradict the plain language of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind v.

Cal. 2006) (emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The alleged inaccessibility of Domino's website and app impedes access to the goods and services of its physical pizza franchises-which are places of public accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012181\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7)(B) (listing a restaurant as a covered \"public accommodation\"). Customers use the website and app to locate a nearby Domino's restaurant and order pizzas for at-home delivery or in-store pickup. This nexus between Domino's website and app and physical restaurants-which Domino's does not contest-is critical to our analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.\n   </em>\n   , our court examined whether an insurance company that administered an allegedly discriminatory employer-provided insurance policy was a covered \"place of public accommodation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654297\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1104/#p1113\">\n    198 F.3d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1113-14 (9th Cir. 2000). We concluded that it was not. Because the ADA only covers \"actual, physical places where goods or services are open to the public, and places where the public gets those goods or services,\" there had to be \"some connection between the good or service complained of and an actual physical place.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654297\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1104/#p1113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654297\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1104/#p1113\">\n    at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the insurance company had a physical office, the insurance policy at issue did not concern accessibility, or \"such matters as ramps and elevators so that disabled people can get to the office.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654297\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1104/#p1113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And although it was administered by the insurance company, the employer-provided policy was not a good offered by the insurance company's physical office.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654297\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1104/#p1113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654297\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1104/#p1113\">\n    at 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Unlike the insurance policy in\n   <em>\n    Weyer\n   </em>\n   , Domino's website and app facilitate access to the goods and services of a place of public accommodation-Domino's physical restaurants. They are two of the primary (and heavily advertised) means of ordering Domino's products to be picked up at or delivered from Domino's restaurants. We agree with the district court in this case-and the many other district courts that have confronted this issue in similar contexts\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   -that the ADA applies to Domino's website and app, which connect customers\n   to the goods and services of Domino's physical restaurants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The second question we address is whether applying the ADA to Domino's website and app raises due process concerns. Despite concluding that the ADA covered Domino's website and app, the district court held that imposing liability on Domino's here would violate its Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we hold that Domino's has received fair notice that its website and app must comply with the ADA.

Here, Robles does not seek to impose liability based on Domino's failure to comply with WCAG 2.0. Rather, Robles merely argues-and we agree-that the district court can order compliance with WCAG 2.0 as an equitable remedy if, after discovery, the website and app fail to satisfy the ADA. At this stage, Robles only seeks to impose liability on Domino's for failing to comply with \u00a7 12182 of the ADA, not for the failure to comply with a regulation or guideline of which Domino's has not received fair notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204457508\">\n    2017 WL 4457508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"[A]t this point in the litigation ...

By contrast, the statutory provisions of \u00a7 12182 at issue here-requiring \"auxiliary aids and services\" and \"full and equal enjoyment\"-are flexible, but not ambiguous, and have been interpreted many times by federal courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, in\n   <em>\n    AMC\n   </em>\n   , our court limited its due process holding to the district court's remedy without disturbing liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733906\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/760/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733906\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/760/\">\n    at 768-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
