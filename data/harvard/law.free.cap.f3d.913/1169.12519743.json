FCRA requires employers who obtain a consumer report on a job applicant to provide the applicant with a \"clear and conspicuous disclosure\" that they may obtain such a report (the \"clear and conspicuous requirement\") \"in a document that consists solely of the disclosure\" (the \"standalone document requirement\") before procuring the report. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(b)(2)(A)(i). This appeal requires us to decide two questions: (1) whether a prospective employer may satisfy FCRA's standalone document requirement by providing job applicants with a disclosure containing extraneous information in the form of various state disclosure requirements, and (2) whether the specific disclosure provided by the employer in this case satisfied the clear and conspicuous requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We held in\n   <em>\n    Syed v.

Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   , we now hold that a prospective employer violates FCRA's standalone document requirement by including extraneous information relating to various state disclosure requirements in that disclosure. We also hold that the disclosure at issue here is conspicuous but not clear. Accordingly, we affirm in part, vacate in part and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

We disagree. Gilberg does not offer any judicial authority, legislative history or dictionary definition to support her argument that the word \"document,\" as used in FCRA, encompasses the universe of employment application materials furnished by an employer to a prospective employee. She relies instead on California contract law, under which \"[s]everal contracts relating to the same matters, between the same parties, and made as parts of substantially one transaction, are to be taken together.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201642\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Gilberg, however provides no persuasive reason to extend this contract law principle to FCRA's definition of a document, and we decline to do so. Moreover, under Gilberg's proposed interpretation, it is difficult to see how an employer could ever provide an applicant written application materials without violating FCRA's standalone document requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Gilberg's three-page employment packet was distinct from the one-page disclosure document. The relevant form for our analysis, therefore, is the disclosure form alone, not the entire four pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    CheckSmart's disclosure form violates FCRA's standalone document requirement.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Gilberg contends CheckSmart's disclosure form violates FCRA's standalone document requirement.

As\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   explained, congressional intent \"has been expressed in reasonably plain terms\" and \"that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 500 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p570\">\n    458 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p570\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The ordinary meaning of \"solely\" is \"[a]lone; singly\" or \"[e]ntirely; exclusively.\" The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1666 (5th ed. 2011). Because CheckSmart's disclosure form does not consist solely of the FCRA disclosure, it does not satisfy FCRA's standalone document requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CheckSmart, moreover, fails to explain how the surplus language in its disclosure form comports with FCRA's purpose. Its disclosure refers not only to rights under FCRA and under ICRAA applicable to Gilberg, but also to rights under state laws inapplicable to Gilberg and to extraneous documents that are not part of the FCRA-mandated disclosure - e.g., a \"Notice Regarding Background Investigation\" and a \"Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair\n   Credit Reporting Act.\" Because the presence of this extraneous information is as likely to confuse as it is to inform, it does not further FCRA's purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   CheckSmart urges us to follow the district court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Noori v.

App'x 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2018), which reasoned that the inclusion of information \"closely related\" to FCRA's disclosure requirements does not violate the standalone document requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Our subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   , however, forecloses that approach.\n   <em>\n    Noori\n   </em>\n   , moreover, did not explain how to determine what information would be \"closely related\" to FCRA's disclosure requirements. Indeed, even \"related\" information may distract or confuse the reader.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   holds that the standalone requirement forecloses implicit exceptions. The statute's one express exception does not apply here, and CheckSmart's disclosure contains extraneous and irrelevant information beyond what FCRA itself requires. The disclosure therefore violates FCRA's standalone document requirement. Even if congressional purpose were relevant, much of the surplusage in CheckSmart's disclosure form does not effectuate the purposes of FCRA. The district court therefore erred in concluding that CheckSmart's disclosure form satisfies FCRA's standalone document requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    CheckSmart's disclosure form also violates ICRAA's standalone document requirement.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As the parties appear to agree, the standalone document requirements under FCRA and ICRAA are identical.

In the TILA context, we have said that clarity and conspicuousness are questions of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rubio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702978\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1195/\">\n    613 F.3d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because neither party suggests we should treat FCRA differently, we assume for the purposes of our analysis, without deciding, that clarity and conspicuousness under FCRA present questions of law rather than fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    CheckSmart's disclosure form was not clear.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   CheckSmart's disclosure form is not reasonably understandable for two distinct reasons. First, the disclosure form contains language that a reasonable person would not understand. It says:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The scope of this notice and authorization is all-encompassing; however, allowing CheckSmart Financial, LLC to obtain from any outside organization all manner of consumer reports and investigative consumer reports now and, if you are hired, throughout the course of your employment to the extent permitted by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The beginning of this sentence does not explain how the authorization is all-encompassing and how that would affect an applicant's rights. The second half of the sentence, following the semicolon, lacks a subject and is incomplete. It suggests that there may be some limits on the all-encompassing nature of the authorization, but it does not identify what those limits might be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, the disclosure would confuse a reasonable reader because it combines federal and state disclosures. The disclosure, for example, states: \"New York and Maine applicants or employees only: You have the right to inspect and receive a copy of any investigative consumer report requested by CheckSmart Financial, LLC by contacting the consumer reporting agency identified above directly.\" A reasonable reader might think that only New York and Maine applicants could contact the consumer reporting agency to get a copy of the report. Such an understanding would be contrary to both FCRA and ICRAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(3)-(4) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201786.22\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1786.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We hold, therefore, that the district court erred by deeming CheckSmart's disclosure form clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    CheckSmart's disclosure form was conspicuous.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The district court properly concluded, however, that CheckSmart's disclosure form is conspicuous. As noted, conspicuous means \"readily noticeable to the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    Rubio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702978\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1195/\">\n    613 F.3d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CheckSmart capitalized, bolded and underlined the headings for each section of the disclosure and labeled the form so an applicant could see what she was signing. Although the font is small and cramped (we think inadvisably so), it is legible. All relevant information appears on the front of the page and the headings help applicants understand the purpose of the form. The disclosure, therefore, is conspicuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Nevertheless, because CheckSmart's disclosure form was not both clear\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   conspicuous, the district erred in granting CheckSmart's motion for summary judgment with regard to the FCRA and ICRAA \"clear and conspicuous\" requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We hold that the district court erred by concluding that the standalone document requirements of FCRA and ICRAA were satisfied here. We further hold that CheckSmart's disclosure satisfies the FCRA and ICRAA requirements for conspicuousness but not for clarity. For these reasons, and the reasons stated in our contemporaneously filed memorandum disposition, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the district court, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with these dispositions. Each party shall bear its own costs of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    Appendix A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    We address Gilberg's remaining contentions in a concurrently filed memorandum disposition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    FCRA's one express exception to the standalone document requirement, specified in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(b)(2)(A)(ii), allows the applicant to \"authorize in writing\" the procurement of a consumer report on the same document as the disclosure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
