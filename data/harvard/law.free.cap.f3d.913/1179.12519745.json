SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In the wake of 9/11, law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, and local levels found that they were unable to communicate effectively about potential threats to our national security. In response, the federal government sought to standardize the sharing of terrorism-related information through the adoption of a \"Functional Standard.\" Aaron Conklin, Wiley Gill, Khaled Ibrahim, James Prigoff, and Tariq Razak (collectively, Plaintiffs) challenged the Functional Standard under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the federal defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We affirm. Although the Functional Standard constitutes final agency action, it was not required to undergo the APA notice and comment procedure, nor was it arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2007, President George W. Bush issued a National Strategy for Information Sharing concerning terrorism-related information. The Strategy created fusion centers that would ensure Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) were \"disseminated to and evaluated by appropriate government authorities,\" and identify requirements to support a \"unified process for reporting, tracking, and accessing\" SARs. The nationwide effort to standardize this information sharing was called the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative (NSI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To \"govern[ ] how terrorism information is acquired, accessed, shared, and used,\" the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) has issued three Functional Standards since the inception\n   of the NSI, each superseding the previous one: Functional Standard 1.0 (issued January 2008), Functional Standard 1.5 (issued May 2009), and Functional Standard 1.5.5 (issued February 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The current Functional Standard 1.5.5 focuses \"exclusively on terrorism-related information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Functional Standard defines suspicious activity as \"[o]bserved behavior reasonably indicative of pre-operational planning associated with terrorism or other criminal activity.\" After receiving a report of suspicious activity, an officer creates a SAR. The SAR then undergoes a two-part evaluation process. An analyst determines whether the SAR meets certain behavioral criteria and has a potential nexus to terrorism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the analyst concludes that it does, the SAR becomes an ISE-SAR, and is uploaded to the eGuardian repository, where it is available to all NSI participants. The ISE-SAR is also input into the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) classified system and sent to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence Analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs are United States citizens who are the subjects of a SAR or ISE-SAR, none of whom has been charged with a crime. The ISE-SAR on Gill notes his potential access to a \"flight simulator type of game,\" his conversion to Islam, and his \"pious demeanor.\" The FBI visited Gill's sister and questioned her about Gill's religious beliefs. Another SAR describes Razak as a male of believed Middle Eastern descent who \"meticulously stud[ied] the entry/exit points\" of a train station. After the SAR was uploaded to eGuardian, the FBI questioned Razak. The SAR concerning Ibrahim notes his attempt to purchase \"a large amount of computers.\" Two reports concerning Ibrahim were uploaded to eGuardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Private guards prevented Prigoff, a professional photographer, from taking photographs of a work of public art near Boston, an incident resulting in the creation of multiple SARs. The FBI then visited Prigoff's home and questioned a neighbor about him. In northern California, private security stopped Conklin, an amateur photographer, from photographing oil refineries, and during the subsequent questioning, the sheriff's deputies told him he would be placed on an \"NSA watch list.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2014, Plaintiffs sued the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the ISE Program Manager (collectively, the Department). The complaint asserted two APA challenges to the Functional\n   Standard, contending that: (1) the promulgation of the Functional Standard without notice and comment was unlawful; and (2) the Standard was arbitrary and capricious because it did not comply with the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard in 28 C.F.R. Part 23 for the dissemination of criminal intelligence information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Department moved to dismiss, arguing that Plaintiffs lacked standing, and that the Functional Standard did not constitute final agency action pursuant to the APA. The district court denied the Department's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties later cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment for the Department, finding that: (1) the Functional Standard is a policy guidance statement exempt from the notice and comment requirement; and (2) the Functional Standard is not arbitrary and capricious because it addresses data issues outside the scope of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Plaintiffs timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, it concentrates on the second\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   prong, contending the Functional Standard \"merely provides procedural guidelines for [agencies'] voluntary participation\" and does not impose binding obligations. Plaintiffs counter that the Functional Standard has legal force because the Department can revoke an agency's\n   eGuardian membership for violating the terms of the eGuardian User Agreement, which requires compliance with the Standard. Plaintiffs also assert that compliance with the Functional Standard is a practical requirement of the NSI, and that this \"condition on participation\" renders the Functional Standard final. We agree; the Functional Standard constitutes final agency action because it has legal and practical effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Functional Standard imposes \"direct and appreciable legal consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    520 U.S. at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To be sure, participation in the NSI remains within the agencies' discretion. And, absent that participation, the Functional Standard does not obligate analysts or agencies to send SAR information or penalize them for sending non-compliant SARs. But, as the Department conceded below, once an agency decides to participate, the eGuardian User Agreement permits the Department to revoke agency membership for violating various policies, including the Functional Standard. Like the suspension of permits in\n   <em>\n    Oregon Natural Desert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3264038\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/977/#p982\">\n    465 F.3d at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , eGuardian membership revocation is a legal consequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Functional Standard is also final agency action because of its practical effects. In\n   <em>\n    Havasupai\n   </em>\n   , we held a Forest Service Mineral Report was a \"practical requirement to the continued operation\" of a mine-and therefore final agency action-because the parties \"understood that mine operations would not resume until\" the Mineral Report's determination of valid existing rights \"was completed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518851\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/1155/#p1161\">\n    906 F.3d at 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, an FBI or fusion center analyst \"reviews\" the SAR information against the sixteen pre-operational behaviors identified in the Functional Standard, \"keeping in mind ... the importance of context, facts, and circumstances.\" If the SAR information reflects one or more of the pre-operational behaviors, then, based on the \"context, facts, and circumstances,\" the analyst uses \"professional judgment\" to determine whether the information has a potential nexus to terrorism. Only if-in the analyst's judgment-a potential nexus to terrorism exists is the SAR disseminated as an ISE-SAR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While the Functional Standard employs a combination of mandatory and discretionary language, it does not compel analysts or agencies to disseminate SAR information, nor does it require analysts to create an ISE-SAR when the information reflects a certain number of behavioral categories. Rather, if the SAR contains at least one of the categorized activities, the analyst must still ascertain whether it has a potential nexus to terrorism.

But, Functional Standard 1.5.5, promulgated in February 2015, superseded version 1.5. The Executive Summary for version 1.5.5 provided a detailed explanation for why SAR information need not comply with Part 23 and the reasonable suspicion standard. Thus, Plaintiffs' argument concerning the Department's 2010 explanation for Functional Standard 1.5 is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that the ISE's 2015 explanation is inconsistent with Functional Standard 1.5.5. The 2015 explanation states that SAR information \"represents information about suspicious behavior\" and \"has a potential criminal nexus.\" In contrast, it asserts that criminal intelligence \"focuses on the investigative stage once a tip or lead has been received and on identifying the specific criminal subject(s), the criminal activity in which they are engaged, and the evaluation of facts to determine that the reasonable suspicion standard has been met.\" Succinctly, according to the 2015 explanation, criminal intelligence is \"a product of investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Department asserts that its interpretation of Part 23 is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, which requires an agency's interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation to control unless \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Turtle Island Restoration Network v.

The Department identifies no ambiguity in Part 23, and we find none. Thus, we independently determine whether the ISE's decision to exclude the Functional Standard from Part 23's scope is consistent with the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs focus on the one sentence in the Department's explanation of Functional Standard 1.5.5, which states that Part 23 \"[c]riminal intelligence information is a product of investigation.\" They argue that SARs are also criminal intelligence subject to the reasonable suspicion standard of Part 23 because an official conducts \"initial investigation or fact gathering\" before creating a SAR. That narrow focus distorts the ISE's explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As originally conceived in October 2007, SARs involved \"tips and leads\" information, that is, an \"uncorroborated report or information that alleges or indicates some form of possible criminal activity.\" Tips and leads required only \"mere suspicion,\" a lower standard than the reasonable suspicion required for criminal intelligence data. In response to concerns regarding Functional Standard 1.0, version 1.5 implemented a somewhat stricter standard-\"reasonably indicative\"-albeit one still less demanding than the reasonable suspicion standard. Given the lower reasonably indicative standard utilized by the Functional Standard, some SARs do not rise to the level of criminal intelligence. This lower threshold underscores the purpose of ISE-SARs disseminated in accordance with Functional Standard 1.5.5: to determine whether to engage in \"follow-up information gathering\" about potential terrorist activity, not necessarily to determine whether a crime has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The distinction between criminal intelligence and SAR information is admittedly not always precise. The ISE Program Manager early on recognized the potential for SARs to contain criminal intelligence subject to Part 23. Thus, the ISE's Initial Privacy and Civil Liberties Analysis of September 2008 stated, \"agencies should clearly articulate when 28 C.F.R. Part 23 should be applied .... ISE-SAR information ... may be subject to the requirements of 28 C.F.R. Part 23.\" Further, an investigating officer \"gathers additional facts through personal observations, interviews, and other investigative activities before creating a SAR, suggesting that the \"product of investigation\" phrase is not dispositive of whether SAR information comes within the ambit of Part 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"We will ... uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency's path may reasonably be discerned.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From the outset, the ISE has consistently pronounced that an ISE-SAR need not meet the reasonable suspicion standard in order to expand the base of information gathered. The 2015 explanation, published with Functional Standard 1.5.5, also makes clear that the government intentionally seeks\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than reports showing a reasonable suspicion that terrorism-related crimes have occurred. Considering the entirety of the 2015 rationale and the historical explanations before us, we find the Department's decision to exclude SARs from Part 23 is not contrary to the record, and is consistent with the stated objectives of the NSI. Accordingly, we hold that the Functional Standard was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Functional Standard endeavors to standardize terrorism-related information sharing nationwide. Although the Functional Standard constituted final agency action, it was not a legislative rule because it requires significant analyst discretion. It therefore was exempt from the notice and comment requirement. And, the Standard was not arbitrary and capricious because the ISE's 2015 explanation distinguishing Part 23 information and SARs is consistent with the ISE's objectives.

The ACLU noted its concerns with the overbroad behavioral categories and the Standard's definition of a suspicious activity, suggesting a \"reasonably indicative\" standard. The ACLU also recommended that certain information should not be reported absent reasonable suspicion of criminality.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    After the ISE issued Functional Standard 1.5, the Program Manager re-engaged with the ACLU to obtain their feedback on a draft privacy and civil liberties report. The ACLU again recommended that information meet the reasonably indicative standard before dissemination.
