Earlier, after the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan had been successfully completed, the General Counsel of the CIA stated in prepared remarks at Harvard Law School that \"[b]y the time the force was launched, the U.S. Government had determined with confidence that ... the operation would be conducted in complete accordance with applicable U.S. and international legal restrictions and principles.\" Stephen W. Preston, Remarks at Harvard Law School (Apr. 10, 2012), https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2012-speeches-testimony/cia-general-counsel-harvard.html (Apr. 20, 2012) (quoted in Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner, Info. Rev. Off'r for the Litig'n. Info. Rev. Off., CIA (\"Shiner Decl.\") \u00b6 7 (Aug. 16, 2016) ). Ultimately, Judicial Watch refined its requests to five memoranda:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 A memorandum written by Pentagon General Counsel Jeh C. Johnson concerning any violation of Pakistani sovereignty in seeking, capturing, and/or killing Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 A memorandum written by CIA General Counsel Stephen W. Preston regarding when the administration must alert congressional leaders about the raid, capture, and/or killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 A memorandum written by National Security Council Legal Adviser Mary B. DeRosa concerning a Navy SEAL team going into a raid with the intention of killing as a default option during the search, raid, capture and/or killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 A memorandum written by National Security Council Legal Adviser Mary B.

Crawford III regarding options and/or plans for Osama bin Laden's burial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Judicial Watch filed suit in February 2016, the agencies moved for summary judgment, arguing the five memoranda were protected in full under the presidential communications privilege in Exemption 5 because they contained confidential analyses and recommendations that were solicited by, and communicated to, the President and his closest national security advisers. Further, because the memoranda related to certain courses of action being contemplated by the President, they argued the memoranda were also protected by the deliberative process and the attorney-client privileges in Exemption 5. And because the memoranda contained classified information and information protected by the National Security Act, the agencies argued that their disclosure could reasonably be expected to harm national security and therefore were protected under Exemptions 1 and 3. The agencies stated that\n   a line-by-line review of the memoranda indicated no reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions could be publicly released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sworn declarations accompanying the summary judgment motion explained that \"[b]ecause the risks and the potential consequences associated with conducting a raid ... were substantial, the President and his national security team considered a number of variables and carefully weighed different options for the operation.\" Shiner Decl. \u00b6 7. \"Top national security lawyers from the CIA, Department of Defense, and the National Security Council formed an integral part of that decision-making process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330437\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/146/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Their advice \"served as one consideration, among others, weighed by the President and his national security advis[e]rs in advance of the President's decision to authorize the raid on bin Laden's compound.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.

Instead Judicial Watch points out that it neither asked the government to disclose whether the memoranda or their contents were communicated to the President or his senior advisers, nor for any presidential deliberations or deliberative materials, and \"asked only that the memoranda be produced.\" Appellant's Br. 8. Further, Judicial Watch observes, the government makes no claim that the authors of the memoranda briefed the President or his senior advisers directly, or even that they were the intended recipients of the memoranda or reviewed the memoranda. Judicial Watch understands the government only to claim that the memoranda \"memorialize\" the analysis and advice briefed, thereby implying they were prepared after the briefing. This is significant, Judicial Watch maintains, because of lingering \"unanswered questions,\" Appellant's Br. 10. The district court's response to the government's notice of clarification left unknown when the briefing took place in relation to preparation of the memoranda, who gave the briefing, and how the briefers obtained the analysis and the advice they conveyed to the President and his senior advisers. As a result, Judicial Watch concludes, the district court failed to construe the presidential privilege narrowly. \"[A]llow[ing] the President and Executive Branch to justify its actions without public oversight ... would allow [them] to engage in governance by 'secret law.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180181\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/425/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Judicial Watch makes no effort to reconcile its position that the timing of the preparation of the memoranda defeats application of the presidential communications privilege with this court's precedent.

In\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   , the court held that notes of meetings among White House advisers and drafts of press briefings were protected from disclosure by the privilege, even though it was undisputed that the President never saw these documents,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    at 746-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the court's analysis implied that additional information would be required about who took the notes or how the discussions at the meetings were ultimately communicated to the President. Similarly, here, to determine the applicability of the presidential communications privilege, the government's declarations did not need to be more specific about who gave the briefings or how those conducting the briefings obtained the analysis and advice they conveyed, or the relationship of the briefer to the authors, the President, and the President's senior advisers, or whether and how the results of the briefings were later conveyed to the authors of the memoranda. Even assuming such information would not be privileged, Judicial Watch fails to show why it would be needed to determine the applicability of the presidential communications privilege. It sufficed that the President and his top national security advisers \"solicited and received,\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5660852,9257614\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/1108/\">\n    365 F.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the legal advice memorialized in the five memoranda sought by Judicial Watch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Judicial Watch contends that application of the presidential communications privilege \"would allow the President and Executive Branch to engage in governance by 'secret law.' \" Appellant's Br. 10 (citation omitted).

Rather, the materials document advice given up the chain to someone (the President) who then made a decision. The government's declaration explains that the advice contained in the memoranda was not an \"authorization to conduct a given activity, but, rather, one step in the Executive branch deliberations.\" Shiner Decl. \u00b6 9.
