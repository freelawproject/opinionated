First, it deleted the express exclusion of injuries arising from TCPA violations. Second, it limited the scope of coverage to \"personal injury,\" which it defined as injury arising out of any of five offenses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a.

All five lawsuits alleged that Yahoo! violated the TCPA by transmitting unsolicited text message advertisements to putative class members. The California lawsuits alleged that Yahoo! \"invad[ed] [the plaintiffs'] privacy\" by negligently or willfully sending them unsolicited text messages in violation of the TCPA. In addition, one of the Illinois lawsuits asserted that the TCPA claim was \"an effort to enforce [the plaintiffs'] fundamental federal right to privacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When National Union refused to tender a defense in the underlying TCPA litigation, Yahoo! commenced this action for breach of contract.

However, the other three \"personal injury\" offenses covered in the policy here-\"[f]alse arrest, detention, or imprisonment,\" \"malicious prosecution,\" and \"wrongful ... invasion of the right of private occupancy\"-are different and do not involve injury caused by information in an advertisement. Moreover, the two \"personal injury\" offenses covered here that are similar to \"advertising injury\" offenses covered in the\n   <em>\n    JT's Frames\n   </em>\n   policy also have analogues in the \"advertising injury\" offenses here that are excluded from coverage. The difference between the parallel provisions in the policy here is that in the \"advertising injury\" offenses, the word \"material\" is immediately followed by \"in your 'advertisement' \" whereas the \"personal injury\" offenses lack this modification.
