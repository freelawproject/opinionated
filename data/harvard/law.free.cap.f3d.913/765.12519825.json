Congress has severely limited successive \u00a7 2255 motions for post-conviction relief. We may not authorize such a motion unless it is based on \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\" \u00a7 2255(h)(2). Here, Winarske's application properly relied on\n   <em>\n    Johnsonv.

But simply citing a new rule is not enough. \"The new rule must have a nexus to the right asserted in the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Donnell v.

Thus, even if authorization was properly granted, \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) requires dismissal of Winarske's successive motion, unless the claim in fact relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

The residual clause was not an issue when Winarske was sentenced as an armed career criminal, or when he challenged that determination in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. Rather, the question was whether his class C North Dakota burglary convictions were for generic burglary and therefore fell within the ACCA's enumerated-offenses clause. In arguing his second \u00a7 2255 motion to the district court, Winarske again argued that his burglary convictions no longer qualify as violent felonies because they do not fall within the enumerated offenses clause, relying now on\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

The district court again rejected this argument on the merits and granted a certificate of appealability.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Winarske\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:11-cr-86-1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201743550\">\n    2017 WL 1743550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.D. May 4, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, Winarske argues that\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   established that the phrase \"building or occupied structure\" in North Dakota's burglary statute sets forth alternative means of committing the offense, not alternative elements of different offenses. Therefore, the North Dakota statute is overbroad because \"occupied structure\" is defined to include vehicles \"where any person lives or carries on business or other calling,\" and generic burglary does not include burglary of any vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We decline to consider the merits of this enumerated-offenses-clause issue for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, the new rule in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   has no nexus to this claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Today's decision does not call into question application of the Act to the four enumerated offenses ....\");\n   <em>\n    Stanley v.

Second, neither\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   announced \"a new rule of law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,\" as \u00a7 2255(h)(2) and \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) require. Rather, \"these decisions are simply the Supreme Court's latest interpretations of the categorical approach the Court has long applied in deciding whether a prior conviction is an ACCA violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.
