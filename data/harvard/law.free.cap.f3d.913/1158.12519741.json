This question is governed by federal immigration regulations, which provide that jurisdiction vests in the Immigration Court when a charging document, such as a notice to appear, is filed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003.14(a).

Because the charging document in this case satisfied the regulatory requirements, we conclude the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") had jurisdiction over the removal proceedings. This reading is consistent with the recent interpretation of these regulations by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\" or the \"Board\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bermudez-Cota\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20441\">\n    27 I. &amp; N.

Unlike the stop-time rule, the Immigration Court's jurisdiction does not hinge on \u00a7 1229(a), so\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's narrow ruling does not control our analysis. We conclude that the IJ had jurisdiction over Karingithi's removal proceedings and that the Board properly denied her petition. We address the merits of Karingithi's petition for review in a separate memorandum disposition filed contemporaneously with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Karingithi, a native of Kenya, entered the United States on July 7, 2006 on a tourist visa. She violated her visa's terms by remaining in the United States past its six-month limit. On April 3, 2009, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings by filing a notice to appear with the Immigration Court, charging Karingithi with removability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). The notice to appear specified the location of the removal hearing. The date and time were \"To Be Set.\" The same day, Karingithi was issued a notice of hearing, which provided the date and time of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Karingithi conceded removability, but filed with the Immigration Court an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. In the alternative, she requested voluntary departure. After multiple continuances spanning five years, as well as numerous hearing notices providing the date and time of proceedings, the IJ rejected all four grounds for relief, and ordered Karingithi removed. The BIA affirmed. Karingithi now challenges the IJ's jurisdiction over her removal proceedings and the BIA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Attorney General has promulgated regulations governing removal proceedings, including when jurisdiction vests with the IJ. The relevant regulation, entitled \"Jurisdiction and commencement of proceedings,\" dictates that \"[j]urisdiction vests, and proceedings before an Immigration Judge commence, when a charging document is filed with the Immigration Court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). A charging document is \"the written instrument which initiates a proceeding before an Immigration Judge,\" and one of the enumerated\n   examples is a notice to appear.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because both the regulation and a statutory provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), list requirements for the contents of a notice to appear, we consider whether their requirements differ, and if so, which authority governs the Immigration Court's jurisdiction. According to the regulation, a notice to appear must include specified information, such as \"[t]he nature of the proceedings,\" \"[t]he acts or conduct alleged to be in violation of law,\" and \"[n]otice that the alien may be represented, at no cost to the government, by counsel or other representative.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Importantly, the regulation does not require that the time and date of proceedings appear in the initial notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, the regulation compels inclusion of such information \"\n   <em>\n    where practicable\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.18\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added).

The flaw in this logic is that the regulations, not \u00a7 1229(a), define when jurisdiction vests. Section 1229 says nothing about the Immigration Court's jurisdiction. And for their part, the regulations make no reference to \u00a7 1229(a) 's definition of a \"notice to appear.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1003.14.

But the plain, exhaustive list of requirements in the jurisdictional regulations renders that presumption inapplicable here. Not only does that list not include the time of the hearing, reading such a requirement into the regulations would render meaningless their command that such information need only be included \"where practicable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.18\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The regulatory definition, not the one set forth in \u00a7 1229(a), governs the Immigration Court's jurisdiction. A notice to appear need not include time and date information to satisfy this standard. Karingithi's notice to appear met the regulatory requirements and therefore vested jurisdiction in the IJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   does not point to a different conclusion. To begin,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   dealt with an issue distinct from the jurisdictional question\n   confronting us in this case. At issue was the Attorney General's statutory authority to cancel removal of \"an alien who ... has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of\" her application for relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A). Under the statute's \"stop-time rule,\" the \"period of ... continuous physical presence\" is \"deemed to end ... when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a).\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1). In\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the Court acknowledged that it decided only a single, \"narrow question\": \"If the Government serves a noncitizen with a document that is labeled 'notice to appear,' but the document fails to specify either the time or place of the removal proceedings, does it trigger the stop-time rule?\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The BIA placed significant weight on the fact that, in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , \"the Court did not purport to invalidate the alien's underlying removal proceedings or suggest that proceedings should be terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.18\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Recognizing the weakness of her jurisdictional argument, Karingithi urges, in the alternative, that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   renders her eligible for cancellation of removal. However, cancellation is a new claim that is not part of this petition for review. Karingithi has raised her cancellation claim in a motion to reconsider to the BIA, and she must await its determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaza-Ramirez v.

And, as in\n   <em>\n    Bermudez-Cota\n   </em>\n   , the hearing notices Karingithi received specified the time and date of her removal proceedings. Thus, we do not decide whether jurisdiction would have vested if she had not received this information in a timely fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    PETITION DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    appears to discount the relevance of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.18\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    in the distinct context of eligibility for cancellation of removal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 2111\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
