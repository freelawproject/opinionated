Due to a series of disturbances by inmates and lockdowns throughout the Los Angeles County jail system, Olivier was not transferred to permanent housing until the afternoon of July 16, 2006. Olivier brought an action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Defendant-Appellee Sheriff Leroy Baca (\"Baca\") in Baca's official and individual capacities, alleging that Baca violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to provide him with a bed during his three-and-a-half day stay at the IRC. The district court granted summary judgment in Baca's favor, holding that Olivier had not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether disturbances by inmates and lockdowns constituted exigent circumstances justifying the floor sleeping. Olivier appeals. We affirm and hold that the exigent circumstance of inmate disturbances and lockdowns justified denying Olivier a bed for his three-and-a-half day stay at the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 25, 2006, Olivier was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department for burglary. He was processed into permanent housing at Los Angeles Men's Central Jail (\"MCJ\") but erroneously released on July 7, 2006. On July 12, 2006, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (\"LASD\") located and again arrested Olivier. At 9:56 p.m., he arrived at the IRC for processing into the county jail system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon Olivier's arrival at the IRC, he was determined to have health issues. Consequently, Olivier was sent to the medical screening area of the IRC where he waited on a bench for an examination, along with around 100 other people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   LASD officials determined that Olivier could be properly housed only at MCJ in light of his medical needs, his classification as a non-high risk inmate without mental illness, and the proximity of MCJ to the venue of his underlying criminal case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While Olivier was being processed at the IRC for transfer to MCJ, inmates at jail facilities across Los Angeles County repeatedly divided themselves along racial lines and fought. This string of inmate disturbances persisted for approximately three days and necessitated lockdowns at multiple facilities, which, in turn, delayed processing at the IRC. LASD logs and declarations from LASD personnel provide accounts of the disturbances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Olivier remained at the IRC for the duration of the inmate disturbances, lockdowns, and post-lockdown procedures before being transferred to MCJ on July 16. In total, Olivier was held at the IRC for approximately three-and-a-half days. Olivier testified that although there were benches in the cell where he was held, there was inadequate space to accommodate the number of detainees at the IRC. Olivier testified that no one slept on the benches because trying to do so would have led to a fight. As a result, Olivier slept on the floor during his time at the IRC. Olivier testified that he never asked for \"a mattress, blankets, or any other sort of padding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the lockdowns began on July 13, the first time inmates were picked up from the IRC custody line was on July 16 around 2:00 a.m. Olivier was transferred to the MCJ at 1:14 p.m. on July 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 30, 2008, Olivier filed a complaint in district court alleging civil rights violations related to both his extended stay at the IRC and events that occurred after he was transferred to MCJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district\n   court dismissed certain aspects of Olivier's original claims, and Olivier amended his complaint several times. By the time the case reached the summary judgment stage, the only remaining claim relevant to this appeal was a Fourteenth Amendment claim against Baca in his official and individual capacities regarding Olivier's being forced to sleep on the floor at the medical intake area of the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Baca filed a motion for summary judgment. After the magistrate judge recommended denying the motion for lack of evidence that exigent circumstances existed, the district court gave Baca an opportunity to supplement the record. Baca then submitted additional declarations by LASD officials. In 2013, the Operations Deputy at the IRC explained that in response to such disturbances a large proportion of jail staff must work to restore order. Jail personnel who do not respond to the disturbances and remain in other areas of the facility are, therefore, likely to be significantly outnumbered by inmates. Consequently, normal operations must be suspended and the entire facility placed on lockdown until order is restored and the staff-to-inmate ratio returns to normal in all areas of the jail. As part of a lockdown, no inmates are permitted to move in or out of the facility. This means inmate transfers to permanent housing are cancelled by the IRC for the duration of a lockdown. A lockdown at a facility in Los Angeles County may thus prolong processing times at the IRC. The Operations Deputy further explained that a lockdown in any one of the booking front, class rear, or custody line stages necessarily results in a lockdown in the other areas because each stage operates in connection with the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   An LASD sergeant assigned to the MCJ during the time of the disturbances explained that after a lockdown is lifted, inmate movement cannot immediately resume. Following a lockdown caused by inmate disturbances, detention facility personnel must conduct thorough security checks, survey property damage, and address medical needs. These post-lockdown procedures naturally lead to delays in inmate processing in excess of the length of the lockdowns themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The magistrate judge concluded that the newly supplemented record conclusively demonstrated that the Los Angeles County jail system experienced exigent circumstances due to the disturbances and lockdowns. The magistrate judge recommended granting Baca's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. On July 19, 2013, the district court accepted the magistrate judge's recommendations, granted summary judgment in favor of Baca, and dismissed the case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The issue presented in this case-floor sleeping due to exigent circumstances-was not addressed in any of the cases cited by Olivier, and the district court in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   specifically recognized an exigent circumstances exception to its holding that floor sleeping is unconstitutional.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872701\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/514/1201/#p1225\">\n    514 F.Supp.2d at 1218-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, collateral estoppel does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, Olivier has not shown that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Baca was entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Olivier also argues that the district court abused its discretion by: (1) declining to transfer the case to another courtroom as a related case; (2) failing to authorize punitive damages against Baca; (3) failing to take judicial notice of his opposition motion; and (4) admitting declarations from LASD officials. None of these arguments is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to transfer the case because the record does not indicate that Olivier filed a Notice of Related Civil Cases, as he was required to do for the district court to consider transferring the case. C.D. Cal. R. 83-1.3.1. Second, punitive damages are not available against Baca in his official capacity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Third, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to take judicial notice of Olivier's opposition motion because \"[l]egal memoranda ... are not evidence, and do not create issues of fact capable of defeating an otherwise valid motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Flaherty v.

Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting declarations from LASD officials because the officials had personal knowledge of both the events and the LASD procedures at issue.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Olivier has not presented a basis for disturbing the district court's judgment. The evidence is uncontroverted and summary judgment was proper as a matter of law. In addition, even if a Fourteenth Amendment violation did occur, the district court correctly held that Baca is entitled to qualified immunity because the right asserted by Olivier-not being forced\n   to sleep on the floor during a jail lockdown-was not clearly established at the time of the events. Finally, Olivier has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting his various ancillary claims.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The IRC serves as a hub for processing incoming and outgoing inmates in the jail system. The process occurs in three stages: (1) \"booking front,\" which involves an initial interview, screening, and photograph; (2) \"class rear,\" which involves medical screening, fingerprinting and housing classification; and (3) \"custody line,\" where inmates are fed, provided medication if applicable, and picked up by personnel from the housing facility to which they are assigned. On average, more than 300 inmates are processed daily at the IRC.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In 2006, the LASD operated three housing facilities for male inmates within the Los Angeles County jail system: MCJ, Twin Towers Correctional Facility, and Pitchess Detention Center. Twin Towers housed exclusively inmates with high security risk classifications, inmates suffering from severe mental illness, and sexually violent inmates. Pitchess did not have medical services that would have accommodated Olivier's claimed medical condition. Additionally, Pitchess is located more than forty-five miles by road from the venue where Olivier's criminal case was scheduled. MCJ was thus the only suitable permanent housing for Olivier.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    On July 13, 2006, at 8:30 a.m., the IRC class rear was closed due to inmate fighting, causing inmate processing at the IRC to stop. On July 13 at 4:30 p.m., approximately 100 IRC custody line inmates could not be transferred due to inmate disturbances at Pitchess Detention Center. On July 13, Twin Towers was placed on full lockdown. From 11:15 p.m. on July 13 until 1:20 a.m. on July 14, inmate rioting occurred at the MCJ. On July 14, the MCJ remained on full lockdown from 2:05 p.m. to 8:09 p.m. From July 14 at 10:45 p.m. into the following days, the IRC's class rear and custody line were placed on lockdown. On July 15 at 9:30 a.m., and again at 6:00 p.m., the IRC booking front was on lockdown. On July 15, MCJ was on lockdown until late in the day. On July 16, Twin Towers was on lockdown from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Olivier's claims relating to his experiences at MCJ were dismissed, aside from a Fourteenth Amendment claim regarding exposure to lice in his jail cell. The complaint also named a number of defendants in addition to Baca. On July 10, 2010, the district court dismissed all defendants except Baca.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Olivier also argues that an inference is proper that the disturbances and lockdowns that led to his holdover at the IRC were natural consequences of prison overcrowding. He contends that if such disturbances are common they should not excuse constitutional violations. Olivier, however, has not presented any admissible evidence to demonstrate, as he claims, that riots were the natural and foreseeable consequences of overcrowding in Los Angeles County jails. Olivier cites in his brief two internet articles-published over ten years after the events at issue-reporting generally on overcrowding in Los Angeles jails. However, as these articles were not in the record before the district court, they do not undermine the district court's decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     U.S. v. W.R. Grace\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2951486\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/745/#p766\">\n     504 F.3d 745\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 766 (9th Cir. 2007). Accordingly, we reject this argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Baca also argues that Olivier failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Because we hold that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment, we do not reach this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
