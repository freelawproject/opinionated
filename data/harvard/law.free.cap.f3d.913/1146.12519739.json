We remand Curtis's remaining claims to the district court to address in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Curtis is a former employee of Irwin, a company that conducts operations on oil platforms located off the coast of California, on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While working for Irwin, Curtis was regularly scheduled to work seven 12-hour shifts in a seven-day period, with twelve hours on duty, followed by twelve hours off duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a member of United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, Local 1945 (Union), Curtis was subject to two collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) between the Union and Irwin: the National Master Agreement by and between Irwin's Operations Group and the Union, and the National Master Agreement by and between Irwin's Maintenance and Construction Group and the Union. Both agreements include detailed provisions regarding wages, overtime, and hours, as well as provisions requiring employees to grieve and arbitrate disputes concerning the application and terms of the CBAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Without using the dispute-resolution provisions of the CBAs, Curtis filed a putative class action complaint against Irwin in California state court. The complaint was based on Curtis's theory that his 12 off-duty hours counted as \"hours worked\" for purposes of California labor laws,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20510\">\n    Cal.

Extending\n   <em>\n    Mendiola\n   </em>\n   's reasoning from on-call hours to off-duty hours, Curtis argues that Irwin violated various California wage and hour laws by failing to recognize his 12 hours of off-duty time as \"hours worked.\" Specifically, the complaint alleges that Irwin denied him overtime pay for the 12 hours he was off duty,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20510\">\n    Cal.

The complaint also raised four claims that are derivative of his overtime, meal and rest period, and minimum wage claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Irwin removed the action to district court, relying on \u00a7 301 of the LMRA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1356b, as the basis for federal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once in federal court, Irwin filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Curtis's claims are preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA. In his opposition, Curtis raised a number of arguments, including his contentions that the CBAs did not apply at all because their scope does not extend to work conducted on the Outer Continental Shelf; California's minimum wage and hour standards are not preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA under binding state and federal precedents; Curtis's overtime and meal break claims were not precluded by section 514 of the California Labor Code ; and California law applied to the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court granted Irwin's motion to dismiss. The court based this conclusion solely on the ground that there was a need to interpret the CBAs in order to resolve the parties' dispute regarding their applicability, and therefore the state law claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA. Additionally, the district court ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration under the terms of the applicable CBAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Curtis filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that his claims were founded on non-negotiable state-law rights that are independent of the CBAs. In his reply to Irwin's opposition, Curtis stated, for the first time: \"Plaintiffs are willing to concede that the CBAs\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   generally applicable to Plaintiffs because such a concession has zero effect on their ultimate rights to pursue their statutorily-guaranteed rights in court-a right that exists independently of these CBAs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Given the timing and minimal nature of this concession, it is not surprising that the district court missed it. Accordingly, the district court affirmed its dismissal of Curtis's claims as preempted under \u00a7 301 on the ground that Curtis disputed the applicability of the CBAs, and it would be necessary to give the CBAs \"more than merely a cursory reading to determine whether they actually apply to [Curtis's] claims.\" The court did not address any other basis for preemption. However, the district court retracted the order to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Curtis timely appealed.

Although \u00a7 301 contains no express language of preemption, the Supreme Court has long interpreted the LMRA as authorizing federal courts to create a uniform body of federal common law to adjudicate disputes that arise out of labor contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allis-Chalmers Corp. v.

Further, Curtis argues that this section gives him a nonnegotiable state right to such overtime pay for his 12 off-duty hours, independent of any interpretation of the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Curtis's argument fails, however, in light of section 510(a)(2), which provides that the \"requirements of this section do not apply to the payment of overtime compensation to an employee working pursuant to ... [a]n alternative workweek schedule adopted pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement pursuant to Section 514.\" Section 514 in turn states that \" Sections 510 and 511 do not apply to an employee covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement if the agreement expressly provides for the wages, hours of work, and working conditions of the employees, and if the agreement provides premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked and a regular hourly rate of pay for those employees of not less than 30 percent more than the state minimum wage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20514\">\n    Cal.

By its terms, therefore, the default definition of overtime and overtime rates\n   in section 510 does not apply to an employee who is subject to a qualifying CBA.

Rather, he argues that the CBAs do not meet the requirements of section 514 because the CBAs's definition of overtime (and overtime rates) is not the same as section 510 's definition of overtime (and overtime rates).

Curtis argues that Irwin improperly denied him rest and meal periods during the 12 hours he was off duty, in violation of sections 226.7 and 512(a) of the California Labor Code. He also claims that Irwin violated sections 1194 and 1197 of the California Labor Code, which establish a right to receive the \"legal minimum wage\" during this 12-hour off-duty period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Irwin, in turn, argues that Curtis's rights to rest and meal periods and to a minimum wage substantially depend on an analysis of the CBAs, and therefore are preempted under \u00a7 301. According to Irwin, California's Industrial Welfare Commission has issued an order that exempts an employer from providing the statutory meal and rest breaks where a qualifying CBA is in place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wage Order 16-2001,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%208%2C%20%C2%A7%2011160\">\n    Cal.

Further, Irwin argues that resolving Curtis's minimum wage claims requires an analysis of the CBAs to determine the degree of Irwin's control over Curtis's off-duty activities, which\n   <em>\n    Mendiola\n   </em>\n   deemed to be the central inquiry for overtime claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition to these preemption issues, there remains a dispute as to whether Curtis's meal and rest period, final pay, and pay stub claims are preempted by OCSLA.
