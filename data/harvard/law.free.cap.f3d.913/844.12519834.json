So, a structure/function claim made under \u00a7 343(r)(6) is a \"claim of the type described in section 343(r)(1).\" Also, the FDCA classifies dietary supplements as food; indeed, \u00a7 343-1 (\"National uniform nutrition labeling\") and \u00a7 343 (\"Misbranded food\") fall under the FDCA's \"Food\" subchapter. Thus, a structure/function claim also constitutes a claim \"made in the label or labeling of food.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20343-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 343-1(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 343-1(a)(5) preempts state-law requirements for claims about dietary supplements that differ from the FDCA's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As applied here, \u00a7 343-1(a)(5) preempts most of Plaintiff's claims. We first address Defendants' structure/function claims that their supplements promote and support cardiovascular, circulatory, and heart health. Plaintiff argues that those claims are false because the supplements do not prevent cardiovascular disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff's expert witness, Edgar Miller, Ph.D., M.D., offered ample evidence that vitamin E supplements, taken in the doses that Defendants sell, fail to prevent cardiovascular disease. In Dr. Miller's view, no metric\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   the absence or presence of cardiovascular disease can measure heart health (and, accordingly, no other metric can demonstrate whether a supplement promotes or supports heart health). In essence, Dr. Miller rejects the discrete categories of claims that the FDCA establishes; by definition, structure/function claims\n   <em>\n    do not\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    may not\n   </em>\n   claim to treat or prevent disease.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20343-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 343(r)(6) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.93\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). And Defendants' labels do not claim that their vitamin E supplements treat or prevent cardiovascular disease. Yet Plaintiff seeks to impose a requirement under California law that structure/function claims-at least those related to cardiovascular, circulatory, and heart health-made on a supplement's label require proof that the supplement treats or prevents cardiovascular disease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That requirement \"is not identical to the requirement of section 343(r).\" 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 343-1(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Plaintiff argues that it does not matter whether he categorizes Defendants' claims as structure/function claims or as disease claims, because he addressed the falsity of the labels' text. To the contrary, it matters very much. Plaintiff's argument would vitiate the FDCA's distinction between disease claims and structure/function claims. The FDA allows manufacturers of supplements to make general claims-such as \"promotes heart health\"-and to substantiate them with evidence that a supplement has some structural or functional effect on a given part of the human body.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%201000\">\n    65 Fed. Reg. at 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Manufacturers need not also have evidence that those structural or functional effects reduce the risk of developing a certain disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaufman v.

Plaintiff disagrees with the federal statutory scheme for dietary supplements, but we cannot accept his invitation to upend it. We hold that \u00a7 343-1(a)(5) preempts Plaintiff's claims to the extent that he argues that Defendants' structure/function claims are false or misleading because their supplements do not prevent cardiovascular disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As for Defendants' structure/function claim that their supplements promote immune health, Plaintiff argues that the claim is false and misleading, either because\n   the supplements fail to reduce all-cause mortality or because the supplements increase the risk of all-cause mortality. The FDCA does not require that manufacturers substantiate structure/function claims about immune health with proof that their supplements reduce the risk of all-cause mortality.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20343\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(6). (Nor do Defendants claim that their supplements reduce that risk.) Because any such requirement under California law would differ from the FDCA's labeling requirements, the FDCA preempts Plaintiff's claim to the extent that he argues that Defendants make a false structure/function claim because their supplements fail to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   But the FDCA does not preempt Plaintiff's claim that Defendants' structure/function claim about immune health is misleading because their supplements\n   <em>\n    increase\n   </em>\n   the risk of all-cause mortality. FDCA regulations state that a food label \"shall be deemed to be misleading if it fails to reveal facts\" that are \"[m]aterial with respect to consequences which may result from use of the article\" under normal conditions of use or the conditions of use that the label prescribes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.21\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). In other words, if a supplement's label recommends taking one capsule per day, and that dose actually causes an increased risk of death-a material fact \"with respect to consequences which may result from use of the article\"-the FDCA would deem it misleading not to reveal that fact on the label.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.21\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaufman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354916\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/88/#p95\">\n    836 F.3d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a structure/function claim would be misleading if it \"fail[ed] to disclose the harmful aspects of the nutrient's structure/function\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Likewise, a label that omitted that fact would be misleading under California law.

Because the FDCA and California law have the same labeling requirement with respect to failing to disclose an increased risk of death, \u00a7 343-1(a)(5) does not preempt this particular aspect of Plaintiff's case.

And, as the term \"all-cause mortality\" suggests, the record contains no evidence about the actual cause of death for any of those included in the studies. Those causes could include many things unrelated to vitamin E supplements or immune function, such as suicide or a car accident.
