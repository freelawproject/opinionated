Parties who sell fuel in California are assessed for the carbon intensity of those fuels, and parties who fall below the carbon intensity standard gain tradeable credits that can be used by parties who are above the carbon intensity standard to meet their regulatory obligations. CARB assigns carbon intensity differently for different kinds of fuels, and the 2012 amendments to the LCFS, while retaining this basic structure, changed the precise procedure for assigning carbon intensity values to crude oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2013, after our decision in\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain I\n   </em>\n   , a decision in California state court based on the state's administrative law required CARB to reconsider the LCFS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    POET, LLC v.

This led to the currently-effective LCFS (the \"2015 LCFS\") that repealed the 2011 LCFS and, of course, the 2012 amendments. The method and structure of the 2015 LCFS is identical to the 2011 LCFS, and it still contains the central carbon intensity and lifecycle analysis elements. The changes that are material for this appeal are limited\n   to the process for assigning carbon intensity values to non-crude oil fuels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The 2011 LCFS gave two different pathways for regulated parties to have the carbon intensity of their fuels assessed.

This change means that no part of the LCFS now refers to particular regions of origin, as the 2011 LCFS had.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703672\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1070/\">\n    730 F.3d at 1081-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first version of this case began in 2009 and 2010, when Plaintiffs-Appellants Rocky Mountain Farmers' Union et al. (\"Rocky Mountain\") and American Fuels &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers Association et al.

Rocky Mountain argued that the 2011 LCFS was preempted by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), regulated commerce extraterritorially, unduly burdened interstate commerce, and discriminated against out-of-state fuel interests.

Dec. 11, 2014) (hereinafter\n   <em>\n    Goldstene\n   </em>\n   ) (summarizing the questions the district court received on remand).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On remand, Plaintiffs' claims went through a series of amendments and decisions to reach their current form. In December of 2014, the district court granted in part a motion to amend American Fuels's complaint. This amendment resulted in a complaint that also challenged the 2012 amendments to the LCFS's crude oil provisions, added a \"horizontal federalism\" aspect to its extraterritoriality claim, and eliminated American Fuels's\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   and federal preemption claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldstene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207004725\">\n    2014 WL 7004725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court then further clarified its position by granting summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiffs' extraterritoriality claim against the original LCFS, granting a motion to dismiss on Plaintiffs' extraterritoriality claim against the 2012 version of the LCFS, granting summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiffs' facial discrimination claims against the original LCFS with respect to ethanol, granting summary judgment for Defendants on all of Plaintiffs' discrimination claims against the original LCFS and the 2012 version with respect to crude oil, and denying a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim that the original ethanol provisions discriminate in purpose and effect.\n   <em>\n    Am. Fuels &amp; Petrochemical Mfrs. Ass'n v.

The amended complaints alleged that all three versions of the LCFS are preempted by federal law, that all three versions are impermissible extraterritorial regulations, and that all three versions violate the Commerce Clause facially, in purpose and effect, and under the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing test, which remained in issue under the claims of Rocky Mountain despite prior dismissal in the American Fuels case. The district court held that Plaintiffs' claims against the repealed versions of the LCFS were not moot. Nevertheless, it granted Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) motions for judgment on the claims precluded by\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain I\n   </em>\n   and granted 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss on most of the other claims. The court denied the motions to dismiss on Plaintiffs' claims that the ethanol provisions of the 2011 and 2015 versions of the LCFS discriminate in practical effect and that they violate\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   . Rather than contest these remaining claims, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed them, and the district court entered a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs now appeal the district court's decision on claims challenging the 2015 version of the LCFS, as well as previous orders deciding the prior motions to dismiss. Appellants claim that all three versions\n   of the LCFS violate the following constitutional protections:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) the Commerce Clause and \"the federal structure of the Constitution\" by regulating extraterritorially.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (2) the Commerce Clause by facially discriminating against interstate and foreign commerce in their treatment of crude oil and ethanol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (3) the Commerce Clause by purposefully discriminating against interstate and foreign commerce in their treatment of crude oil and ethanol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We review legal conclusions concerning mootness\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and factual findings concerning mootness for clear error.\n   <em>\n    In re Thorpe Insulation Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731128,3871661\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/869/\">\n    677 F.3d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 879 (9th Cir. 2012).

The laws challenged are no longer in effect, Plaintiffs' obligations under them have been discharged, and it is not possible for the Court to grant any effectual relief, as the 2011 and 2012 versions of the LCFS have been repealed. As such, Plaintiffs are in the same boat as the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Log Cabin Republicans\n   </em>\n   , in which we said that \"[i]f Log Cabin filed\n   suit today seeking a declaration that section 654 is unconstitutional or an injunction against its application (or both), there would be no Article III controversy because there is no section 654.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836149\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1162/#p1166\">\n    658 F.3d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain I\n   </em>\n   did not hold otherwise when it briefly considered whether the 2012 amendments had made the Plaintiffs' 2013 challenge to the crude oil provisions of the 2011 LCFS moot. The court held that the amendments had not mooted Plaintiffs' claims, because \"[c]redits awarded based on [carbon intensity values calculated under the challenged 2011 Provisions] will carry forward to subsequent years and may be used by a regulated party\" and \"[t]he propriety of the scheme under which those credits were distributed remains a live controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703672\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1070/\">\n    730 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1097 n.12. This statement reflected the fact that, as we were deciding this issue, the 2011 LCFS, as partially amended in 2012, was good law and could have been subject to any number of declaratory or injunctive remedies. Although it is true that credits awarded under prior versions of the LCFS could have future effects, it is no longer true that the scheme under which those credits were distributed remains a live controversy and challenges to it can no longer be brought, as the 2011 and 2012 versions have been repealed. If the present LCFS inherited any constitutional infirmities from its predecessor, these must be part of Plaintiffs' challenge to the law as it currently stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs argued to the district court that they could seek \"the adjustment of the carry-forward credits calculated under the prior version of the LCFS\" as a remedy to save these challenges from mootness. For good reason, Plaintiffs have since abandoned this claim. As the district court correctly held, any such remedy would be barred for Plaintiff associations by a lack of associational standing, and barred for all Plaintiffs by the Eleventh Amendment. In order to try to compensate parties for unconstitutionally low credits or unconstitutionally high deficits awarded under prior versions of the LCFS, the court would have to determine how each party changed its behavior in response and how much those changes cost each party, determinations that would be impossible without \"the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v.

California did not enact the LCFS because it thinks that it is the state that knows how best to protect Iowa's farms, Maine's fisheries, or Michigan's lakes. California's interest in the lifecycle of the fuels used by its consumers arises from a concern for the effects of the production and use of these fuels on California's own air quality, snowpack, and coastline. Here, the regulated parties, the regulated transactions, and the harms California intended to prevent are all within the state's borders, making the LCFS a classic exercise of police power.

This burden is all that much higher to meet in the face of our holding that the structure of the LCFS does not show evidence of discrimination. Under the LCFS, the relative fate of in-state and out-of-state entities depends entirely on the environmental properties of different fuel production and transport processes. If the Midwest were to undergo a green revolution in its energy production, the LCFS would act as a competitive drag on California energy producers. In fact,\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain I\n   </em>\n   recognized that it had already done so with respect to portions of the market.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703672\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1070/\">\n    730 F.3d at 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The individualized\n   pathway with the lowest carbon intensity was achieved by a Midwest producer ...[and] [t]he default pathway with the lowest carbon intensity is ... for Brazilian sugarcane ethanol ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In light of these facts about the LCFS's design, Plaintiffs do not meet their burden of showing a discriminatory purpose. Plaintiffs do not advance any evidence concerning the purpose of the new regulation, the only law now subject to challenge. Plaintiffs' arguments rely primarily on California's motivations for passing the different versions of the LCFS that were applicable in 2009 and 2010. This is fatal to their case. In both its design and its legislative justifications, the LCFS is a regulation aimed at salient environmental differences between different types of fuels, differences which genuinely reflect legitimate state interests. We reject the bald suggestion that the California LCFS is disguised economic protectionism. Instead, we reaffirm the conclusions that were set forth in part VI of\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain I\n   </em>\n   because those conclusions remain pertinent to the claims now presented:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The California legislature has determined that the state faces tremendous risks from climate change. With its long coastlines vulnerable to rising waters, large population that needs food and water, sizable deserts that can expand with sustained increased heat, and vast forests that may become tinderboxes with too little rain, California is uniquely vulnerable to the perils of global warming. The California legislature determined that GHG emissions from the production and distribution of transportation fuels contribute to this risk, and that those emissions are caused by the in-state consumption of fuels. Whether or not one agrees with the science underlying those views, those determinations are permissible ones for the legislature to make, and the Supreme Court has recognized that these risks constitute local threats.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553859\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/497/#p522\">\n    549 U.S. at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553859\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/497/#p522\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   To combat these risks, the California legislature and its regulatory arm CARB chose to institute a market-based solution that recognizes the costs of harmful carbon emissions.

Second, the compliance costs of entering the market must not be so great as to prevent participation.

Bentham's work on constitutional codes similarly defined the police power as \"a system of precaution, either for the prevention of crimes or of calamities.\" 3 Jeremy Bentham,\n    <em>\n     The Works of Jeremy Bentham *\n    </em>\n    169 (John Bowring ed., 1843) (later cited by\n    <em>\n     Tennessee v.
