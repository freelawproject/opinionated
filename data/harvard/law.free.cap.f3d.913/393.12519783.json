Code Ann. \u00a7 24.2-509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B), violates the First Amendment of the Constitution. The district court agreed and enjoined \u00a7 24.2-509(B) in its entirety. For the reasons that follow, we now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Virginia law generally allows the Commonwealth's political parties considerable discretion in deciding how to nominate their candidates for office. Section 24.2-509(A) empowers the \"duly constituted authorities\" of the state and local parties \"to determine the method by which a party nomination ... shall be made.\" The parties make use of this latitude. For example, the Republican Party of Virginia, with whom the appellee here is affiliated, allows for four different methods of nomination: a primary, a party canvass, a convention, and a mass meeting.\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald v. Alcorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522977\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/922/#p927\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 927 (W.D. Va. 2018). Under the Party's Plan of Organization, committees established in every locality, state legislative district, and congressional district are empowered to choose among these methods to nominate candidates for their political subdivision. J.A. 37, 38, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The differences between these methods are substantial. Each one \" 'create[s] a different distribution of potential voters (or decision makers) in the nomination process.' For example, primaries involve the largest pool of potential voters, whereas conventions and mass meetings 'lend themselves more toward committed partisans.' \"\n   <em>\n    Alcorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522977\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/922/#p927\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J.A. 884-85, 885-86). The choice of method, therefore, could have a significant influence on the choice of nominee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsection 24.2-509(B), often called the Incumbent Protection Act, however, limits the broad authority recognized by subsection A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second and third sentences\n   apply to those subdivisions of the state party that select nominees for candidates to the General Assembly. Those sentences allow incumbent members of the General Assembly who are running for reelection, where there is only one incumbent, to \"designate[ ]\" the method of nomination they prefer. Under this statute, the wishes of the party are immaterial; no matter where the party's plan of organization may vest the power to choose nomination methods, the law trumps, granting the power to the incumbent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The fourth sentence of the Act applies to those components of political parties that make the nominations for \"particular office[s]\" other than for the General Assembly, including nominations for the U.S. House of Representatives. In these races, the incumbent officeholder may insist that his or her party use a primary as its nomination method as long as (1) the incumbent was selected by primary in the previous election cycle and (2) the incumbent is running for reelection. Again, the statute trumps the party's plan of organization, which, in this case allows the committees responsible for congressional nominations to choose between the approved methods (excluding mass meetings) without interference by the incumbent, J.A. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Virginia Department of Elections, however, has not always respected the distinction made between the second and third sentences on the one hand, and the fourth sentence on the other. In the 2016 and 2017 election cycles, for example, the Department promulgated forms that allowed non-General Assembly incumbents to \"designate\" their preferred method of nomination as if their elections were governed by the second and third sentences. After the commencement of this litigation, and only after the appellees pointed out the mistake, the Department issued new forms that applied the fourth sentences to these races.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Virginia has not identified a single other state that has a statute like the Incumbent Protection Act, and this is not the first case to consider a constitutional challenge to it.

After the notice of appeal had been filed, the district court stayed its permanent injunction order on February 5, 2018, to avoid interfering with the ongoing nomination cycle. J.A. 1481.

During the course of this appeal, the Department filed a motion to vacate the injunction on the basis of mootness.

In 1831, when Alexis de Tocqueville arrived in the United States, he was shocked to discover that our nation was the only \"country on the face of the earth where the citizens enjoy unlimited freedom of association for political purposes.\" Alexis de Tocqueville, 2\n   <em>\n    Democracy in America\n   </em>\n   123 (Henry Reeves trans., 1863). In America, \"the most democratic country on the face of the earth,\" the \"art\" of forming political associations had been \"carried to the highest perfection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115. Because of this, \"Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions, constantly form associations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   De Tocqueville identified this propensity to associate as one of the sources of the astonishing political dynamism of the young Republic, writing that American political associations are \"the mother of action,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 125, and that they \"stimulate competition, and ... discover those arguments which are most fitted to act upon the majority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 210. The right to associate for political purposes, de Tocqueville proclaimed, is \"[t]he most natural privilege of man, next to the right of acting for himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 209. Accordingly, \"the right of association is almost as inalienable as the right of personal liberty. No legislator can attack it without impairing the very foundations of society.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The multiplicity of political associations lauded by de Tocqueville was the result of the Founders' decision to enshrine the \"freedom to join together in furtherance of common political beliefs\" in the First Amendment of the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p214\">\n    479 U.S. 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214-15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p214\">\n    107 S.Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p214\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). That Amendment promises Americans the right not just to proclaim a political vision but to join with their compatriots and actually advance that vision. Because, while an individual may be, in de Tocqueville's words, \"feeble and consequently more incapable of preserving his freedom,\" de Tocqueville,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 123, when individuals combine in association they \"acquire facility in prosecuting great undertakings in common,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 114. Some of the \"great undertakings\" accomplished by political associations protected by the First Amendment include the Abolitionist Movement, the Women's Suffrage Movement, the Labor Movement, and the Civil Rights Movement-the fruits of which continue to shape our politics and society for the better to this day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Of all political associations protected by the First Amendment, political parties themselves merit special attention. Like other political participants, parties advance a particular vision. Unlike others, however, political parties must also nominate candidates for office, compete in elections, and, if successful, help to translate campaign appeals into programmatic action. In so doing, political parties provide a vehicle for voters to advance their own political views. Without groups like modern political parties, \"[r]epresentative democracy in any populous unit of governance\" would be \"unimaginable.\"\n   <em>\n    Cal. Democratic Party v.

But it is not: The statute does not by itself require any organ of a Virginia political party to use a primary as a method of nomination.

Under the terms of the statute, the interest in democratic resolution of intraparty disputes will only be vindicated when and where an incumbent office holder decides that it is in his interest to do so. It is implausible that the General Assembly would seek to vindicate this interest in such an odd, uneven, and underinclusive fashion. Instead, the text and structure of the law gives rise to the strong suggestion that the Incumbent Protection Act serves a different interest: the interest, unsurprisingly, in incumbent protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To be sure, incumbent protection is not per se an unconstitutional interest.

Incumbent protection is simply not a strong enough interest here to justify the severe burden on the appellee's associational rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Incumbents, after all, are already blessed with myriad de facto advantages in the electoral arena. Appellee's expert, Professor Jeffrey A. Jenkins, testified that incumbents generally have better name recognition than challengers because of their time in the public eye. J.A. 884. Incumbents also have the opportunity to win votes by enacting popular laws and servicing their constituents, and they have easier access to donors, as they are proven winners.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   All this contributes to the \"scare-off\" effect: potential challengers,\n   faced with the seemingly insurmountable hurdles, will decide not to run.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The other reason for incumbency advantage is more salutary. Voters may recognize that incumbents provide our government with institutional memory and the wisdom that can only be won through experience. In the legislative branch, which could find itself at a disadvantage when dealing with career officials and agency specialists of the executive, the cumulative knowledge and experience brought by incumbents to the negotiating table is particularly valuable. In this sense, incumbency evens the interbranch playing field. Without it, novice legislators would find it more difficult to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Thus, domination of the political parties by their incumbent office holders is, perhaps, a natural consequence of political reality. But to the already winning de facto hand dealt incumbents, \u00a7 24.2-509(B) adds a de jure ace: In the circumstances governed by the fourth sentence, challengers would have to compete with already advantaged incumbents in a selection process chosen by the incumbent himself. This goes too far. It narrows the possibility of legislative renewal and refreshment through the infusion of new blood. It risks making the electoral process sclerotic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nothing in the foregoing analysis compromises the \"major role\" played by states in structuring their elections.\n   <em>\n    Cal.

These facts are as follows: The Department issues a series of forms for incumbents and party committees to notify the Commonwealth which nomination method they plan to use, as they are required to do by law. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024.2-516\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 24.2-516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These forms reflect the Department's understanding of how to apply the Incumbent Protection Act. And yet, throughout the 2016 election cycle and through the filing of this lawsuit, these forms applied the Act's second and third sentences, which should only apply to incumbent members of the General Assembly, to the 6th Congressional Committee as well. Incumbent members of Congress were given the same plenary power to designate\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   method of nomination no matter the circumstance, as if they were incumbent members of the General Assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The forms themselves best tell the story:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    DESIGNATION OF METHOD OF NOMINATION\n   </strong>\n   for\n   <strong>\n    SENATE OF VIRGINIA\n   </strong>\n   2015\n   <strong>\n    * * *\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I, the undersigned incumbent of the Senate of Virginia district indicated above,\n   <strong>\n    am seeking re-election\n   </strong>\n   and designate the following method of nomination to be used in determining the party's candidate for this office subject to the forthcoming November general election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   J.A. 892.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   2016\n   <strong>\n    DESIGNATION OF METHOD OF NOMINATION\n   </strong>\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   I, the undersigned incumbent of the district indicated above,\n   <strong>\n    am seeking re-election\n   </strong>\n   and designate the following method of nomination to be used in determining the party's candidate for this office subject to the coming November general election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   J.A. 873. The form used by incumbent General Assembly members in the 2015 election cycle and by incumbent Members of Congress in the 2016 election cycle are in all material respects the same.

Because of the forms, any candidate that the 6th Congressional Committee wished to recruit, or anyone contemplating an electoral challenge to the incumbent, faced the prospect of having to compete in a nomination process selected by that incumbent. Plainly, this prospect would \"dramatically change[ ] the plaintiffs' decisions about campaign financing, messages to stress, and candidates to recruit.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464863\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/312/\">\n    462 F.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The remaining standing analysis is straightforward: The injury was caused by promulgation of the forms based on the Act's second and third sentences, and therefore will be redressed if we find those sentences to be inconsistent with the First Amendment.

It has a history of frequently revising the relevant election forms. The forms used for congressional nominations in 2014, for example, reflected the fourth sentence of the Incumbent Protection Act and not the second and third. Yet the congressional nomination forms were inexplicably changed for the 2016 congressional elections to reflect the Act's more fulsome General Assembly protections instead. The Department has offered no explanation for why the forms were changed to the benefit of incumbents between the 2014 and 2016 congressional elections. Even though the forms apparently have been edited once again, we have little confidence that the forms will not revert back if we hold that this lawsuit is moot. Indeed, that danger is particularly acute when, as here, a change in the forms would confer benefits upon\n   political incumbents. The Incumbent Protection Act transparently advances the interests of those who control the apparatus of government; it is hardly beyond the realm of plausibility that it would be administered with that same purpose in mind. The Department's May 23, 2018 Suggestion of Mootness is accordingly denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We may thus properly consider the 6th Congressional Committee's facial and as applied First Amendment challenges to the Incumbent Protection Act's protection of incumbent members of the General Assembly. A facial challenge to a law will succeed after a showing \"that no set of circumstances exist under which the law would be valid, or that the law lacks any plainly legitimate sweep.\"\n   <em>\n    Greater Balt. Center for Pregnancy Concerns, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755850\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/264/#p282\">\n    721 F.3d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282 (4th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). In the First Amendment context, a facial challenge may also succeed under overbreadth doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755850\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/264/#p282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But there is no need to employ overbreadth doctrine in this case, for the Act's second and third sentences cannot be applied in a manner consistent with the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Department fails to identify a single circumstance where the Act's second and third sentences could be lawfully applied. And we find none. The second and third sentences not only share the constitutional infirmities of the fourth sentence but exhibit those infirmities to an even greater degree. The fourth sentence allows some incumbents to force a primary under certain designated circumstances. The second sentence goes further by empowering incumbents to impose their choice of any method of nomination no matter what the party prefers under almost any circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These advantages, when given to state or federal incumbents, run afoul of the First Amendment for all the reasons discussed in detail in Part II,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Department raises yet one more challenge, arguing that the district court was wrong to enjoin the Incumbent Protection Act in its entirety. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024.2-509\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 24.2-509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B).

The Act comprises six sentences. We have now found that each of its operative provisions-namely the second, third, and fourth sentences-is unconstitutional. The remaining sentences merely explain how to apply them. The district court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the Incumbent Protection Act in toto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Our decision is a narrow one. It is directed at a discrete constitutional imbalance created by permitting single office holders to negate the associational rights of political parties in an area central to the party's very reason for being.

It notes that because the current 6th District incumbent was selected by convention, the plaintiff will not be forced to accede to a primary until 2022 at the earliest.

The injuries inflicted by laws that distort the primary process, like the Incumbent Protection Act, are not confined to the short duration of any particular primary, but instead reflect the reality that \"campaign planning decisions have to be made months, or even years, in advance of the election to be effective.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464863\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/312/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464863\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/312/\">\n     at 317-18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
