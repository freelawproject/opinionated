WILLETT, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the surface, this workplace-discrimination appeal augurs a clash between our rule of orderliness and rules of res judicata. Specifically, are we bound by a 1981 panel decision (that would allow the suit)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or by other preclusion precedent (that would bar it)?\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   There is no clash. Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Henson v. Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   (letting a plaintiff litigate in federal court a claim previously dismissed in state court) is not binding-not now and not the day it issued-as it contravened preexisting full faith and credit precedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rule of orderliness may be \"binding as the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the United States Supreme Court, being supreme, makes all things mutable, even \"our Holy Rule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Orderliness as a judicial goal commands adherence to Supreme Court precedent-particularly precedent about orderliness-not to circuit decisions disregarding that precedent.\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   was a one-off that was swiftly cast off. Indeed, the High Court months later reaffirmed its binding res judicata rule, one we have followed consistently ever since, paying\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   no mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Admittedly, identifying when a panel decision has morphed from nominally narrowed to no-doubt-about-it negated can be vexing at times. But not this time.\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   was never good law, and no precedent, neither the Supreme Court's nor ours, has ever treated it as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All to say, on-point res judicata precedent bars this suit. We AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thompson, formerly a lawyer in the Dallas City Attorney's Office, claims she suffered workplace harassment, retaliation, and discrimination because of her race, color, sex, or age. She sued in both state court (raising only state claims) and federal court (raising only federal claims). Both suits arose from the same operative facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While her federal suit was pending, the state court ruled that her state suit was time-barred. So the City argued that this limitations dismissal in state court was res judicata in federal court. The district court agreed and dismissed, ruling that Texas preclusion law barred Thompson's federal suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, Thompson presents two arguments-both unavailing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. The district court incorrectly gave res judicata effect to the state-court judgment because it was not a judgment on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. The district court denied her due process because the City did not assert res judicata in its original motion to dismiss. (The res judicata argument appeared for the first time in the City's reply brief.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We first dispose of Thompson's res judicata argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thompson argues that because the state court's summary judgment was based on limitations, it was not a final judgment on the merits. Citing our 1981\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   decision, Thompson says the state-court dismissal lacks preclusive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   considered whether a federal district court was correct that res judicata barred the plaintiff's claims after a Georgia state court determined that related\n   claims were time-barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The panel held that \"a state-court dismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations bars only the state-court remedy and is not an adjudication on the merits,\" adding, \"res judicata does not operate as a bar to [plaintiff's] litigation of the claim in federal court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put simply,\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   declined to give a Georgia state court decision the res judicata effect that Georgia courts would give it. Indeed, the panel did not discuss Georgia res judicata law at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   is factually analogous but legally anomalous. From the get-go,\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   was at odds with pre-\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   Supreme Court precedent; it is at odds with post-\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   Supreme Court precedent; and it is at odds with nearly four decades of Fifth Circuit precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Let's start with why\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   was misguided from the outset. According to the Full Faith and Credit Act, one of Congress's first acts, \"judicial proceedings ... shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its Territories and Possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State, Territory or Possession from which they are taken.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court put it plainly in\n   <em>\n    Allen v. McCurry\n   </em>\n   , which predates\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [T]hough the federal courts may look to the common law or to the policies supporting res judicata and collateral estoppel in assessing the preclusive effect of decisions of other federal courts, Congress has specifically required all federal courts to give preclusive effect to state-court judgments whenever the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged would do so....\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   resolved an unsettled question in this circuit: Does the preclusive effect of state-court judgments hinge on federal law or state law?\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Answer: state law. Federal courts must step into the shoes of state courts and afford preclusive effect where state courts would do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Oddly,\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   never discusses\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   More oddly,\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   never even acknowledges\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   . It would be one thing had\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   attempted to explain (however implausibly) why\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   was inapt. But instead of distinguishing\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   , the panel disregarded it, declining to give preclusive effect to the Georgia state court's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under our rule of orderliness, we may not overrule a prior panel decision absent an intervening change in the law, such as a statutory amendment or a decision from either the Supreme Court or our en banc court. And generally, we think of this Supreme Court or en banc authority as coming\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the questionable panel decision. But this is not necessarily so. We have previously declined to follow a panel\n   decision that couldn't be squared with prior Supreme Court precedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   As\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   turns a blind eye to\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   's holding is irreconcilable, and thus inoperative, and has been since it was decided. We are bound to apply\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   and our cases that abide\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even assuming\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   retained marginal viability when it issued in 1981, any lingering force was quickly, and unquestionably, sapped. Just ten months after\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp.\n   </em>\n   reaffirmed\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   's res judicata rule: \"It has long been established that [the Full Faith and Credit Act] does not allow federal courts to employ their own rules of res judicata in determining the effect of state judgments. Rather, it ... commands a federal court to accept the rules chosen by the State from which the judgment is taken.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   are irreconcilable. The latter spurned the former, and the estrangement is not mere tension, but rejection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, our circuit has not treated\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   as good res judicata law for a generation. In the 38 years since\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , we have repeatedly considered the res judicata effect due state court decisions. In each case, we followed the Full Faith and Credit Act, giving preclusive effect to state court decisions when that state would do so. In fact, just one year after\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , we decided two preclusion cases-\n   <em>\n    Rollins v. Dwyer\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (issued one month before\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   ) and\n   <em>\n    E. D. Systems Corp. v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (issued three months after\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   )-that both employed the Supreme Court's Full Faith and Credit approach, not\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   's out-of-step approach. Thompson urges us to heed our precedent, but our precedent pays no heed to\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Tellingly, not one of our post-\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   decisions on the res judicata effect of state-court judgments follows\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   . A \"Citing References\" check on Westlaw brings up only four Fifth Circuit cases that postdate\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   . One of them,\n   <em>\n    Dorsey Trailers\n   </em>\n   , dealt with the preclusive effect one federal court ought to afford\n   <em>\n    another federal court's\n   </em>\n   grant of summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second,\n   <em>\n    Manges\n   </em>\n   , discusses\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   's attorney-fee issue, not res judicata.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another,\n   <em>\n    Riviere\n   </em>\n   , cites\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   once, and not for anything preclusion-related but for a Truth in Lending Act issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Transource International\n   </em>\n   only mentions\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   offhandedly in the final footnote, explaining that a state-law claim's time-barred status is a factor to be weighed when determining whether to exercise pendent jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   This exhausts\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   's post-\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   \"Citing References\" and reveals no decisions that follow\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   's one-off preclusion rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nearly a dozen cases spanning a dozen years confirm that\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   's reasoning and result have been discarded, not just discounted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not one of them so much as mentions\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   vis-\u00e0-vis preclusion because\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   was a nonprecedential outlier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We disagree with Thompson that our rule of orderliness obliges us to esteem\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   over contrary Supreme Court precedent such as\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   (not to mention our post-\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   cases that dutifully track binding precedent). Orderliness, rightly understood, compels deference, not defiance. And disregarding on-point precedent in favor of an aberrational decision flouting that precedent is the antithesis of orderliness. Such a higgledy-piggledy approach undermines, rather than underscores, the Rule of Law's foremost virtues: clarity, certainty, and consistency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Texas res judicata doctrine requires three things: (1) that the prior final judgment is on the merits; (2) that the parties in the two actions are the same; and (3) that the second action is based on claims that were raised-or could have been raised-in the first action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only the first element is seriously disputed here: whether the state court's dismissal on limitations grounds was, under Texas law, a prior final decision on the merits. It was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We held unequivocally in\n   <em>\n    Hogue v. Royse City\n   </em>\n   that a Texas state court's grant of summary judgment counts as a \"final judgment\" and carries the same preclusive effect in federal court that Texas state courts would afford it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relatedly, we held in\n   <em>\n    Hansler\n   </em>\n   that \"a take-nothing judgment based on limitations is a final judgment on the merits under Texas law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   That remains black-letter law in the Lone Star State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, res judicata bars Thompson's federal claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"For most Americans, Lady Justice lives in the halls of state courts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Day by day, American justice is dispensed-overwhelmingly-in state, not federal, judiciaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Justice Scalia remarked, state\n   law (and state courts) matter far more to citizens' everyday lives: \"If you ask which court is of the greatest importance to an American citizen, it is not my court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Justice Brandeis memorably depicted states as laboratories of democracy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   he was speaking of policymaking (and in dissent). But it's an apt metaphor for judging too. Our Nation boasts not one Constitution but 51, meaning American constitutionalism concerns far more than what began in Philadelphia 232 years ago.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause zealously guards states' sovereignty, guaranteeing that \"[f]ull faith and credit shall be given\" to the \"judicial proceedings of every ... state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   So too Congress's Full Faith and Credit Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   which\n   <em>\n    implements\n   </em>\n   the Clause. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   was unsubtle: \"Congress has specifically required all federal courts to give preclusive effect to state-court judgments whenever the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged would do so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   flouted\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   the instant it issued 38 years ago. And\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   was thwacked by\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   in the Supreme Court's very next term. In the 37 years since, our unbroken post-\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   precedent rightly pays\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   no heed. Instead, our res judicata cases follow-unswervingly-\n   <em>\n    Kremer\n   </em>\n   's \u00a7 1738-honoring rule, giving \"the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given\" in that state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   We do so again today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This leaves Thompson's due process argument-that the City raised its res judicata argument too late, in its reply brief rather than in its original motion to dismiss. We disagree. The City raised it then because the state-court judgment was handed down after the City had filed its motion to dismiss. Not only that, Thompson responded to the City's res judicata argument in her motion for leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The district court did not violate Thompson's due process rights. Our precedent on this point is as clear as our precedent on res judicata: A district court does not abuse its discretion when it considers an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief so long as it gives the \"non-movant an adequate opportunity to respond prior to a ruling.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the district court gave Thompson ample opportunity\n   to respond-and she availed herself of that opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The district court was right to dismiss Thompson's suit on res judicata grounds. And doing so did not violate her due process rights, our rule of orderliness, or anything else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <em>\n     Henson v.

First, and notably, the\n    <em>\n     Henson\n    </em>\n    court did not analyze whether Georgia state law would give preclusive effect to the state-court judgment. Second, unlike the situation mentioned in the Restatement comment, today's case is not about duplicative actions in state courts of different states. It's about the preclusive effect of a state-court judgment in\n    <em>\n     federal\n    </em>\n    court. Third, the relied-on comment from the 1942 Restatement was revised in the Second Restatement published in 1982, one year after\n    <em>\n     Henson\n    </em>\n    .
