The trouble with this approach is that the Tribe's anticipatory defense to a state court lawsuit does not net federal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2005, the Tribe's Environmental Manager signed an agreement with Washington concerning construction of a revetment to protect salmon populations in the Stillaguamish River. The details of the agreement are unimportant here, except for an indemnification provision, which obligated the Tribe to \"indemnify, defend and hold harmless [Washington] from and against all claims ... arising out of or incident to the [Tribe's] ... performance.\" After a tragic landslide near the Stillaguamish River, Washington became embroiled in litigation. Victims of the slide alleged the revetment had contributed to their injuries. Washington indicated repeatedly that it would seek indemnification from the Tribe, both while the litigation was ongoing and after the resulting settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In response, the Tribe sued Washington\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in federal district court, seeking to establish that the Tribe's sovereign immunity would bar a suit for indemnification. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We do not reach the merits of the Tribe's sovereign immunity defense because we conclude, on de novo review, that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Kingman Reef Atoll Invs., LLC v.

In\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court reiterated that \"[a] plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation, on the ground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute ... presents a federal question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191473\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191473\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/85/\">\n    at 96, n.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191473\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/85/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tribe is asserting a defense to a threatened lawsuit, not contending that federal law preempts state law. The rule from\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. Holding otherwise would permit any potential defendant faced with a state common law action brought by a state official to evade the well-pleaded complaint rule by seeking a declaratory judgment based on a federal defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12133835\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/688/#p697\">\n    842 F.3d at 697-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The other cases cited by the Tribe are similarly distinguishable, because they involved either claims based on federal law or challenges to ongoing state action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bishop Paiute Tribe v.
