Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs-Appellants Leopoldo Pena Mendoza, Elviz Sanchez, and Jose Armando Cortes (Plaintiffs) are operating engineers and members of Operating Engineers Local No. 3. They worked on grinding crews, using milling equipment to break up and crush asphalt roadbeds so that new roads could be constructed. At times, their work duties included what they referred to as \"mobilization\" work, which\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   entailed loading milling machines, which w[ere] stored at [a] permanent yard or in offsite storage locations, onto a lowbed trailer; tying down or otherwise securing the heavy equipment onto the lowbed trailer; performing a light, brake, and fluid level check of a semi-truck used to transport the heavy equipment; driving a transport truck transporting the milling machine to a construction jobsite; and driving the transport truck transporting the milling machine back to [the] permanent yard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of this mobilization process, Plaintiffs reported to a designated yard where the equipment was housed, and then performed the maintenance and transportation work. Neither the permanent yard nor the offsite storage locations depended on any public works project for their existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant-Appellee Fonseca McElroy Grinding Co. Inc. (FMG), a roadwork construction company, was acquired by Defendant-Appellee Granite Rock Company (Granite Rock, and together with FMG, Defendants) in 2014. FMG and Granite Rock were both signatory parties to the Operating Engineers Local No. 3 Master Agreement for Northern California (Master Agreement). In 2010, FMG entered into an additional Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Local No. 3, which provided for a \"Lowbed Transport\" wage rate for mobilization work; this rate for offsite work was lower than the Master Agreement rates for onsite construction. Granite Rock was also a signatory to the MOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs worked for FMG and then Granite Rock, including on public works construction projects, and received compensation based on the Master Agreement and MOA. Accordingly, although they received a prevailing wage for onsite construction on public works projects, they were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   paid a prevailing wage for offsite mobilization work. Plaintiffs estimate that \"[t]he ballpark difference between the two overtime rates in August [ ] 2012 was $67.72 (prevailing wage) and $23.89 (lowbed transportation) for an underpayment of $38.38 in the base pay.\" Defendants note that \"[t]he public works contracts under which Plaintiffs worked did not specify the daily schedule for Granite Rock's workers,\" and \"[t]hus Granite Rock determined whether [they] would report directly to the construction jobsite or its yard\" and \"what tasks, if any, [they] would perform after completing their jobsite work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 9, 2015, Mendoza brought claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act and California labor laws for nonpayment of wages. Three months later, he, along with Sanchez and Cortes, filed an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties addressed the dispute that forms the basis of this appeal through cross-motions for partial summary judgment, which the district court heard on October 26, 2016. On November 28, 2016, the court entered an order in which it concluded that the offsite mobilization of equipment was not \"in the execution\" of a public works contract.\n   <em>\n    Mendoza v.

To begin, the distinctions between\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Sheet Metal Workers\n    </em>\n    and this case are significant. Unlike the workers in those cases, Plaintiffs performed work on the public works site that indisputably qualified for the prevailing wage, leaving us to determine whether work they performed offsite in connection with those efforts should be similarly compensated. Whether wage rates for workers employed on a public works project should vary based on the task performed is a different inquiry from whether a class of employees is sufficiently involved in a public works project to be considered employed in the execution of a public works contract, and\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Sheet Metal Workers\n    </em>\n    only addressed the latter issue. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal's geographic concern in\n    <em>\n     Sheet Metal Workers\n    </em>\n    -specifically, that the manufacturing work at issue there could conceivably have been undertaken anywhere, and thus did not necessarily implicate the policy concern underlying the prevailing wage law-is not present here. Plaintiffs' mobilization and transportation work was geographically confined to areas in reasonable proximity to the public works site. Lastly, whereas\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    involved a worker with \"the status of a bona fide materials supplier,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n     67 Cal.Rptr.3d at 613-14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , Plaintiffs directly worked for a public works contractor, not a materials supplier. These notable distinctions suggest that\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Sheet Metal Workers\n    </em>\n    might be of limited use in answering the question that forms the basis of this appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Additionally, Plaintiffs rely on the DIR's interpretations of its Public Works Manual and prevailing wage determinations, which, they contend, \"show that mobilization is part and parcel of a contractor's prevailing wage obligations.\" They acknowledge that \"a published determination is not a legal opinion or a position statement\"-a position echoed by the Public Works Manual, which asserts that it \"is not intended as a comprehensive summary of existing law or duly promulgated regulations\" and \"should not be relied upon\" to \"establish rules of general application.\" However, \"[a]lthough the [DIR] has determined that its coverage determinations do not have precedential value, the determinations nonetheless constitute administrative interpretations entitled to considerable\n    deference.\"\n    <em>\n     Sheet Metal Workers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=176%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20634\">\n     176 Cal.Rptr.3d at 647\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The relevant provision of the Public Works Manual reads as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    Travel time related to a public works project constitutes \"hours worked\" on the project, which is payable at not less than the prevailing rate based on the worker's classification, unless the Director's wage determination for that classification specifically includes a lesser travel time rate.

We note that the various possible outcomes to this question could yield wide-ranging results. For example, a broader application of\n    <em>\n     Kern Asphalt\n    </em>\n    might result in an extension of prevailing wages to a range of public works-adjacent activities, including mobilization and travel. Alternatively, endorsement of the district court's analysis might limit prevailing wages only to work that satisfies the factors set forth by the Court of Appeal in\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    , and thus limit wages for workers employed on public works projects when they perform offsite tasks, even when that work is closely related to their onsite employment. Resolution of this issue might also implicate, as the district court noted, workers who haul other equipment to public works sites, from generators and scaffolding to water and portable toilets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Given the potential scope of this decision, its impact on California workers, and the absence of guiding precedent, we conclude that certification to the California Supreme Court of the question presented in Part I is appropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
