Appellants Henry Alfano (private citizen) and William Hird (Traffic Court administrator) subsequently pleaded guilty to all counts against them. But now they appeal the District Court's decision on this motion, questioning whether the indictment properly alleged offenses of mail fraud and wire fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellants Michael Lowry, Robert Mulgrew, and Thomasine Tynes (Traffic Court judges) proceeded to a joint trial and were acquitted on the fraud and conspiracy counts, but they were convicted of perjury for statements they made before the Grand Jury. Lowry, Mulgrew, and Tynes dispute the sufficiency of the evidence on which they were convicted by arguing that the prosecutor's questions were vague, and that their answers were literally true. Lowry and Mulgrew contend alternatively that the jury was prejudiced by evidence presented at trial on the fraud and conspiracy counts. Mulgrew also complains that the District Court erred by ruling that certain evidence was inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the same trial, the jury convicted Willie Singletary (Traffic Court judge) of making false statements during the investigation. He claims the District Court made errors when it sentenced him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government concurs with Singletary's challenge to his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We have consolidated these appeals for efficiency and have grouped the arguments-to the extent that it is possible-by common issues. We agree with Singletary and the Government that he should be resentenced. We will reverse the judgment and remand his cause to the District Court for this purpose. We are not persuaded by the rest of Appellants' arguments and will affirm their judgments of conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellants Alfano\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Hird\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin with a brief look at the indictment's description of the Traffic Court and\n   its operations to contextualize the arguments made by Alfano and Hird. The Philadelphia Traffic Court was part of the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. App. 186 (Indictment \u00b6 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It adjudicated violations of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code occurring in the City of Philadelphia, no matter whether the Philadelphia Police or the Pennsylvania State Police issued the tickets. App. 187 (Indictment \u00b6 5). When a person was cited for a violation he or she was required-within ten days-to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If the person failed to plead, the Traffic Court issued a notice that his or her license was being suspended. App. 189 (Indictment \u00b6 12). A person who pleaded not guilty proceeded to a hearing with a Traffic Court judge presiding. App. 187 (Indictment \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A guilty plea, or a determination of guilt by a Traffic Court judge after a hearing, resulted in a judgment ordering payment of statutory fines and court costs. App. 188 (Indictment \u00b6 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Traffic Court was responsible for collecting these fines (sending them to the City and Commonwealth) and costs (which it distributed to several pre-designated funds). App. 188-89 (Indictment \u00b6 9). Finally, it reported the disposition of each adjudication to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). App. 189 (Indictment \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The indictment charged that, at the behest of Alfano (App. 193 (Indictment \u00b6 25) ) and others, the Traffic Court administrator and judges operated an \"extra-judicial system, not sanctioned by the Pennsylvania court system\" that ignored court procedure and gave preferential treatment (\"consideration\") to select individuals with connections to the court who had been cited for motor vehicle violations. App. 196 (Indictment \u00b6 31). The special treatment included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) dismissing tickets outright; (2) finding the ticketholder not guilty after a \"show\" hearing; (3) adjudicating the ticket in a manner to reduce fines and avoid assignment of points to a driver's record; and (4) obtaining continuances of trial dates to \"judge-shop,\" that is find a Traffic Court judge who would accede to a request for preferential treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   App. 195-196 (Indictment \u00b6 30). All of this was \"not available to the rest of the citizenry.\" App. 196 (Indictment \u00b6 32). It also alleged that Appellants cooperated with each other to fulfill requests they and their staffs received. App. 194-95 (Indictment \u00b6 27). Finally, it charged that \"[i]n acceding to requests for 'consideration,' defendants were depriving the City of Philadelphia and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of money which would have been properly due as fines and costs.\" App. 197 (Indictment \u00b6 38).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After extending consideration to favored individuals, Traffic Court judges would report the final adjudication to \"various authorities, including PennDOT, as if there had been a fair and open review of the circumstances.\" App. 197 (Indictment \u00b6 34). Appellant Hird provided a printout to Appellant Alfano showing citations that had been \"dismissed or otherwise disposed of.\" App. 198-99 (Indictment \u00b6 42). Such \"receipts\" were not routinely issued in cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Hird and Alfano pleaded guilty to all the charges against them in the indictment. But, in their plea agreement they reserved the right to appeal \"whether the Indictment sufficiently alleged that the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia of money in costs and fees.\" App. 355 (Plea Agreement \u00b6 9(b)(4) ). So they now appeal the District Court's order denying the motion to dismiss, asserting that the indictment failed to allege violations of mail fraud and wire fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"To be sufficient, an indictment must allege that the defendant performed acts which, if proven, constitute a violation of the law that he is charged with violating.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But Alfano and Hird argue that the mere mention of money in an indictment is not enough.

Moreover, issuing traffic tickets is a crucial element in the enforcement of the Motor Vehicle Code: it is a quintessential exercise of state police power. Alfano and Hird conclude, much like\n   <em>\n    Cleveland\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   that no property interest could arise from revenue generated from the state's exercise of its police power in the form of a traffic-ticket fine. They see nothing but a regulatory program here. But this ignores crucial aspects of the case before us that make it different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Simply stated, fees charged to obtain a license cannot be equated with fines and costs that result from a traffic ticket. The license fee was imposed, adjusted, and collected solely by the state's exercise of its regulatory authority. In contrast, here the state's police power is exercised when a citation is issued, but this ticket merely establishes the summary violation with which the person is charged. Once a person has been charged, it is judicial power (not the state's police power) that is exercised to determine whether the person is guilty and, if guilty, to impose the fine and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   These fines and costs, although specified by the Motor Vehicle Code, cannot be cabined as a product of the state's regulatory authority. They are part and parcel of the judgment of the court. With this in mind, it is significant that the indictment does not focus on how the citations were issued (which would implicate police power), but rather alleges that the judicial process was rigged to produce only judgments that imposed lower fines-or most often-no fines and costs at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   But this raises a further question: can a criminal judgment held by the government ever be \"property?\" The Court in\n   <em>\n    Cleveland\n   </em>\n   offered a critique in its analysis of a different issue (whether licenses were analogous to patents) that is apropos to answering this question.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [W]hile a patent holder may sell her patent, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20261\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ... \"patents shall have the attributes of personal property\" ... the State may not sell its licensing authority. Instead of a patent holder's interest in an unlicensed patent, the better analogy is to the Federal Government's interest in an unissued patent.

Judgments ordering traffic fines and costs cannot be sold and, in the logic of\n   <em>\n    Cleveland\n   </em>\n   , would seem then to have no intrinsic\n   <em>\n    economic\n   </em>\n   value.

The\n   <em>\n    Cleveland\n   </em>\n   Court regarded the licensing fees as integral to the regulatory effort and collateral to the matter at hand.

In\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   , we examined convictions for wire fraud arising from a competitive bidding process among banks to receive deposits of a public agency's bridge tolls.\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

A fraud claim cannot rest on the bidders being cheated out of an\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   to receive the deposits. For these reasons, we concluded that the indictment did not allege a scheme to obtain fraudulently someone's \"property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Here, the Government alleged that the defendants \"were depriving ... Philadelphia and ... Pennsylvania of money which would have been properly due as fines and costs\" by making it possible for certain well-connected individuals to avoid a judgment of guilt that imposed an obligation to pay appropriate statutory fines. App. 197 (Indictment \u00b6 38). But Appellants stress that, like the deposits in\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   , the indictment here alleged an entitlement that does not yet exist because a person must be adjudicated (or plead) guilty before they must pay any fines or costs. None of the cases directly associated with Alfano and Hird resulted in a guilty judgment. As a result, they argue, the Government cannot claim here that it was cheated of an entitlement, because they were only fines and costs that the people\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have owed\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   they had been found guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The District Court said it well. Accepting this argument \"would permit the alleged conspirators\" to take advantage of their \"unique position\" in this case \"to enter into a scheme to commit fraud and then hide behind the argument that the success of their fraud precludes prosecution under the 'money or property interest' requirement of the mail and wire fraud statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203305217\">\n    2013 WL 3305217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Appellants cannot rest on the very object of their scheme (to work on behalf of favored individuals to obviate judgments of guilt and the imposition of fines and costs) as the basis to claim that there is no fraud.

The indictment generally alleges not just that Appellants operated a system that operated outside the bounds of Traffic Court procedures, but that it did so for the purpose of obviating judgments of guilt imposing fines and costs in those selected cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 8. Moreover, we note that in one case not directly involving either Alfano or Hird, the indictment alleged that fines and costs were not just obviated, but were actually erased by an alleged co-conspirator traffic court judge who ignored the conviction, backdated a continuance, and \"adjudicated\" the person not-guilty. App. 228-29 (Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 108-113). This episode serves to highlight that the entire scheme was centered on keeping (or taking) judgments out of the hands of the Government to prevent the imposition of fines and costs. As a result, Appellants' reliance on our justice system's presumption of innocence as a basis to argue against the existence of a governmental property interest is a red herring that is properly disregarded here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the indictment's allegation that the scheme had an objective of depriving \"Philadelphia and ... Pennsylvania of money which\n   <em>\n    would have been properly due\n   </em>\n   as fines and costs\" is not undermined by the lack of guilty verdicts.

Of course, perjury arises only from making knowingly false material declarations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201623\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, a witness who answers an ambiguous question with a non-responsive answer that the witness believes is true-even if the answer is misleading-does not commit perjury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bronston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175655\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/352/#p362\">\n    409 U.S. at 361-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175655\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/352/#p362\">\n    93 S.Ct. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Her response of \"no\" (grounding Count 71) is literally true-she says-because there is no evidence that she accepted any bribes in return for giving preferential outcomes in the adjudication of some individuals who were cited for breaking the law. Under this theory, the same argument can also negate the charges at Count 72 since she says she did not accept any \"requests\" (bribes) in exchange for preferential treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Although the jury is permitted reasonable inferences drawn from the record about the witness' understanding of the truth or falsity of the answer, it is not (as we noted above) permitted to reach conclusions based merely on speculation or conjecture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bronston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175655\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/352/#p362\">\n    409 U.S. at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175655\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/352/#p362\">\n    93 S.Ct. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Tynes' assertion of literal truth is undermined because the trial record supports no reasonable inference that the Government was asking her about matters outside of the alleged bribes, nor does it provide any reason why Tynes would interpret the question in this way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, Tynes contends that the evidence was not sufficient to support her conviction. However, the jury heard Tynes' personal assistant, Medaglia \"Dolly\" Warren, testify that she received from personal assistants of other judges three to four cards per week requesting consideration. Each card had the name of a person who was appearing before Tynes on that day. She passed these to Tynes' court officer,\n   who was present during the proceedings. App. 4593-95. Tynes also instructed Warren to give similar cards to the staff of other judges. App. 4598. Warren knew to act discreetly when she was transferring the cards. App. 4599. The jury also heard testimony from those who actually received consideration from Tynes. For example, Timothy Blong was cited for reckless driving and driving without a license. He admitted in testimony that he did not have a license when he was cited. App. 3150. He also testified that he requested consideration through a Traffic Court employee (Danielle Czerniakowski, who worked as a personal assistant to a Traffic Court judge) with whom he was acquainted. When he appeared in court, he was simply told that his case was dismissed. He did not have to say anything, App. 3159-60. Blong testified he was told his case was dismissed because the police officer did not appear (App. 3160-61), but the government produced evidence that an officer was present. App. 3193-96. The Government also showed that Tynes was the presiding judge in Blong's case. App. 3193. Richard Carrigan-who admitted in testimony that he drove through a red light-described a similar experience in which, after requesting favorable treatment through Judge Lowry's personal assistant, Kevin O'Donnell, his case was dismissed by Judge Tynes without ever having to say a word. App. 3178-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Tynes does not challenge any of this in her appeal. Instead she focuses on the weight of other evidence and perceived gaps in testimony. We conclude that all of this provides more than a sufficient basis to support a reasonable jury's conclusion that Tynes did \"give favorable treatment on a case,\" and did \"take[ ] action on a request.\" App. 528-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For all of these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction on perjury as to Appellant Tynes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Appellant Lowry\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Like Tynes, Appellant Lowry advances arguments of fundamental ambiguity and literal truth. His perjury conviction centered on one question and answer.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Q. So if I understand your testimony, you're saying you don't give out special favors; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A. No, I treat everybody in that courtroom the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   App. 489. Lowry attacks the Government's use of the term \"special favors\" as one with many potential meanings. However, as we noted above in our reference to\n   <em>\n    Serafini\n   </em>\n   , we reject arguments that lift individual questions or answers-or individual phrases embedded in either-from the context of surrounding questions that help fix their meaning.\n   <em>\n    Serafini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11597764\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/167/812/#p823\">\n    167 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The larger context for the question asked of Lowry is as follows.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Q. So if I understand your testimony, you're saying you don't give out special favors; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   A. Well, I know it appears that way; and it's hard for me to prove to you ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Q. I'm just asking, your testimony is you don't give out special favors, is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   A. No, I treat everybody in that courtroom the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Q. You treat everybody fairly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   A. I'm a lenient judge. I will admit to that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Q. You treat everybody fairly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   A. Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Q. And these notices that you get from your personal or from other people, they don't affect you in any way; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   A. Virtually no effect at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   App. 489-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Lowry's assertion that the phrase \"special favors\" is subject to many interpretations is unconvincing. We note two things. First, the line of questioning reasonably supports a conclusion that this inquiry referenced conduct associated with allegations of ticket fixing. Second, Lowry answered as if his understanding of the question was consistent with this interpretation. He said that he was aware it may \"appear\" that he gave special favors. He also defended himself by saying that such requests did not affect his conduct in the courtroom at all. If-as he says-he understood \"special favors\" to mean fair treatment, his answer makes no sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Lowry next claims that, since the question was structured to elicit a negative response, his answer cannot be used as the basis of a perjury charge. Relatedly, he contends that the question was merely a summation of an answer that he gave just before this question. In essence he argues that this was a leading question. We have concluded, in the context of a trial, that the propriety of leading questions in direct examinations is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1081704\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/126/151/#p153\">\n    126 F.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153 (3d Cir. 1942). We extend the same deference here to the District Court's decision to admit this portion of the Grand Jury transcript. We do not regard the question as fundamentally unfair or unclear, or something outside the norm of questions typically employed on direct examination. For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Alternatively, Lowry argues that-if the term is understood to reference fixing tickets-there is no evidence to contradict his response that requests for special favors did not impact any of his adjudications. We do not agree. The record contains the following testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Kevin O'Donnell, who was Lowry's personal assistant, testified about Lowry's involvement with requesting and giving consideration. He said that Lowry made four to five requests each month for consideration and that O'Donnell transmitted them to the personal assistants of other Traffic Court judges. App. 1854. Likewise, he said other judges transmitted requests for consideration to Lowry through their personal assistants. App. 1812-13. Appellant Hird and various politicians also made requests of Lowry for consideration. App. 1827-28, 1832-33. O'Donnell said he would give the requests to Lowry on the day scheduled for hearing on the citation. App. 1818-19. The requests were for preferential treatment in the adjudication of particular citations: typically the requests were for \"removing points\" and obtaining a \"not guilty\" judgment. App. 1819\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   O'Donnell said he sometimes had to signal Lowry in the courtroom to remind him that a particular case was supposed to receive consideration. App. 1822-23. He testified from his own observation that Lowry typically honored requests for consideration. App. 1829. He also declared if Lowry claimed he never gave consideration or asked it of others, this would not be truthful. App. 1813. The same assistant testified that if Lowry testified that he ignored requests for consideration, or that he never honored requests for consideration, that testimony would not be true. App. 1855. The Government also asked: \"If [Lowry] claimed that ... consideration requests had no impact when he disposed of cases, would that be true?\" The assistant responded, \"probably not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1081704\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/126/151/#p153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Another witness, Walt Smaczylo, employed as a court officer in the Traffic Court, provided an example of how \"consideration\" worked in the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   When someone comes in, for example, for a reckless driving ticket and that judge normally comes down pretty hard and finds that defendant guilty and then the same type cases come in and you see a defendant walk out either not guilty or a significantly reduced charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   App. 1912. The Government asked Smaczylo if he saw Lowry preside over such instances, and he answered: \"That's correct, yes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1081704\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/126/151/#p153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Smaczylo testified that requests for consideration were written on small note cards or \"sticky\" notes and that he saw Lowry in possession of these cards and notes. App. 1914. He also provided a generalized example of consideration, based on his observation and understanding, in which a reckless driving citation would be reduced to careless driving. In such instances, he indicated that a $300 to $400 fine would be cut in half. He said: \"So, that money was not collected, obviously, by the state. If that ticket was fixed then I saw it as stealing.\" App. 1919. Smaczylo was asked: \"[I]f Judge Lowry testified at the [G]rand [J]ury he didn't give consideration would that be a truth or would that be a lie?\" He responded: \"That would not be the truth.\" App. 1921.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   All of this testimony provides more than a sufficient basis to support a reasonable jury's conclusion that Lowry was not truthful when he responded to the Government's question about special favors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Finally, Lowry argues that the Government's question sought a dispositive response from him on the charges of conspiracy and fraud. He says an affirmative answer to whether he gave \"special favors\" to certain individuals would have been enough to convict him of conspiracy and fraud. Thus, he maintains that his acquittal on charges of mail fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy is res judicata as to the perjury charges that are based on his answer. He said he did not commit fraud and the jury agreed with him. Therefore, he says, he did not perjure himself. However, even if we accepted Lowry's characterization of the question, we reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   First, a jury's determination that Lowry's ticket-fixing conduct did not constitute wire fraud, mail fraud, and conspiracy does not preclude its determination that he lied about this conduct before the Grand Jury. Moreover, as the Supreme Court has articulated, a verdict on one count that seems to be at odds with another \"shows that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but that does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant's guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It is impossible to know in such cases whether the verdicts were an exercise of lenity by the jury or outright error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Nonetheless, as the\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   Court noted, any assessment of the jury's rationale for its verdicts \"would be based either on pure speculation or would require inquiries into\n   the jury's deliberations that courts generally will not undertake.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958569\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/57/#p63\">\n    105 S.Ct. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, even if Lowry was correct that the acquittal is relevant to his response to the question grounding his perjury conviction, we are not convinced that his perjury conviction is unfounded. Given the substantial body of evidence presented to the jury, nothing here demands that we abandon the deference we traditionally give to the collective judgment of the jury. For all these reasons, we will affirm the jury's verdict as to Lowry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Appellant Mulgrew\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Mulgrew does not argue that the question asked at the Grand Jury was ambiguous, he simply maintains that his statement was truthful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The questions and answers grounding his perjury conviction are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   Q. How about your personal, has your personal received any calls like that from other judges, other ward leaders that she's conveyed to you, saying so-and-so has called about this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   A. If she did, she didn't convey them to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   App. 432-33 (emphasis added). Shortly after this, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Q. Let me make sure as well that if I got your testimony correct [sic]. You're saying that if other people, whether they be political leaders, friends and family, anybody is approaching your personal and asking her specifically to look out for a case, see what she can do in a case, give preferential treatment, however you want to phrase it, that she is not relaying any of that information on to you; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   A. No, she isn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   App. 438. As to the first exchange, Mulgrew claims that the Government's use of the word \"call\" referred exclusively to telephone calls. This mattered to him, he says, because others had testified that personal assistants of other Traffic Court judges would give index cards to his personal assistant in his chambers or robing room containing names of some individuals whose tickets were listed for hearing. Mulgrew claims that there is no evidence that he ever received any phone calls asking that he act extrajudicially to give well-connected individuals preferential treatment. The implication is that, had the Government asked him about receiving index cards with such requests, his answer would have been completely different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   As with Tynes and Lowry, our review of claims of literal truth drives us to examine the context of the question.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Q. How about other judges, have other judges ever approached you or called to you or get a message to you either themselves or through their personals saying that someone is going to be on your list next week or next Monday and can you could some special way towards the case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   A. No, they haven't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Q. Never?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   Q.

If she did, she didn't convey them to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Q. And your personal is who?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   A. Gloria McNasby.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   Q. Have you ever seen on traffic court files --You actually get a file when someone's case is called?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   A. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Q. So the case is called and you get a file presented to you; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   A. uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Q. Have you ever seen any index cards or notations on the file indicating that a person\n   <em>\n    has called\n   </em>\n   or taken some special interest in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   A. Nope.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   App. 432-33 (emphasis added). The transcript makes it obvious that Mulgrew's singular reliance on the reference to a \"call\" ignores the thrust of the Government's line of questions. The questions focus on the substance of the communications between Mulgrew's personal assistant and himself, rather than the mode of those communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Mulgrew also claims that he responded truthfully to the second question.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Q. Let me make sure as well that if I got your testimony correct [sic]. You're saying that if other people whether they be political leaders, friends and family, anybody is approaching your personal and asking her specifically to look out for a case\n   <em>\n    , see what she can do\n   </em>\n   in a case, give preferential treatment, however you want to phrase it, that she is not relaying any of that information on to you; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   A. No, she isn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   Q. Wouldn't you want to know it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   A. No, I don't want to know. Then I never have to worry about what I do in the courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   App. 437-38 (emphasis added). Apparently focusing on the words \"see what she can do,\" he says that he answered truthfully by responding that his personal assistant did not tell him that people were approaching her and asking\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   to give them preferential treatment. But, as with the first question, Mulgrew cherry-picks a small part of the question out of context, distorting it. The full text and follow up question show that the thrust of the inquiry was whether Mulgrew's personal assistant was informing him of the names of those requesting preferential treatment from him. And Mulgrew's response to the follow-up question-saying that he did not want to know so that he did not have to worry about what he did in the courtroom-is consistent with one who understood this. App. 438.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   We conclude that, ultimately, the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude Mulgrew understood that both of these questions were focused on whether his personal assistant informed him of requests for him to give preferential treatment, and that he answered in the negative to both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Mulgrew alternatively asserts that the District Court erred by refusing to admit additional testimony from the Grand Jury that he claims is relevant to his perjury conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the Government introduced Mulgrew's Grand Jury testimony, Mulgrew sought the admission of other portions of his testimony. But the District Court sustained the Government's hearsay objection. The portion of the transcript supporting the perjury conviction is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   Q. [W]hether you have ever been asked to provide, what I'll call, favorable treatment for people in traffic court or however you define that, whether it would be special handling, keep an eye out for a ticket, do me a favor. Have you ever been asked to provide any type of treatment like that for people in traffic court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   A. People have asked me for consideration, but I give consideration to everybody that comes in my courtroom[,] so it doesn't make a difference to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   App. 422-23. The basis for the Government's hearsay objection to this portion of the testimony was that it raised an out-of-court statement not offered by a party opponent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Mulgrew first contends that the District Court erred by ruling that this was hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. He says that the testimony was instead offered to show his state of mind later in his testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hoffecker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054134\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/137/#p191\">\n    530 F.3d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191-92 (3d Cir. 2008). However, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to sustain the Government's hearsay objection.

The District Court's ruling on Tynes' motion to dismiss relates only to the arguments she made separately in her brief.

To the extent that he joins the argument of prejudice resulting from the trial on the fraud and conspiracy charges, we already have determined that the indictment was proper and no prejudice resulted from bringing these charges to trial. As for the challenges to perjury in Counts 72 and 74, we note that Singletary was charged with a different crime: false statements in a federal investigation pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
