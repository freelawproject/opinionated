We conclude that they may not do so. As a result, we reverse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Early in the morning of February 9, 2016, police officer Clinton Baker pulled over a car driving 11 miles over the speed limit. The stop occurred on a road near the Pascua Yaqui Indian reservation. Alfredo Landeros sat in the front passenger seat next to the driver. Two young women were in the back seat. The driver apologized to Officer Baker for speeding and provided identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Baker wrote in his incident report and testified that he smelled alcohol in the car. The two women in the backseat appeared to him to be minors, and therefore subject to both the underage drinking laws and the 10:00 p.m. Pascua Yaqui curfew.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the two women's testimony, Officer Baker requested their identification and explained that he was asking because they looked younger than 18 years old \"and it was past a curfew.\" The two women-who were 21 and 19 years old-complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As he stated at the suppression hearing, Officer Baker did not believe that Landeros was underage, and he was not. Nonetheless, Officer Baker, in his own words, \"commanded\" Landeros to provide identification. Later, Officer Baker explained it was \"standard for [law enforcement] to identify everybody in the vehicle.\" Landeros refused to identify himself, and informed Officer Baker-correctly, as we shall explain-that he was not required to do so. Officer Baker then repeated his \"demand[ ] to see [Landeros's] ID.\" Landeros again refused. As a result, Officer Baker called for back-up, prolonging the stop. Officer Frank Romero then arrived, and he too asked for Landeros's identification. The two officers also repeatedly \"commanded\" Landeros to exit the car because he was not being \"compliant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Landeros eventually did leave the car. At least several minutes passed between Officer Baker's initial request for Landeros's identification and his exit from the car, although the record does not reflect the exact length of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Baker testified that, as Landeros exited the car, he saw for the first time pocketknives, a machete, and two open beer bottles on the floorboards by the front passenger seat.

Consistent with Officer Baker's testimony, the government represented in its district court briefing that Landeros was arrested both for possessing an open container\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for \"failure to provide his true full name and refusal to comply with directions of police officers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2013-2412\">\n    Ariz.

Officer Romero asked Landeros if he had any weapons; Landeros confirmed that he had a knife in a pocket. Officer Romero requested consent to search Landeros's pockets, and Landeros agreed. During that search, Officer Romero found a smoking pipe and six bullets in Landeros's pockets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two and a half months later, Landeros was indicted for possession of ammunition by a convicted felon,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), 924(a)(2). He moved to suppress the evidence based on the circumstances of the stop, and also to dismiss the indictment based on alleged abuse by the police officers after the search. The magistrate judge recommended the district court deny both motions, and it did so in a single sentence order. Landeros then entered into a plea agreement that preserved his right to appeal the denials of the two motions. The district court accepted the agreement and sentenced Landeros to 405 days in prison and three years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This case implicates two doctrines, one concerning the circumstances under which\n   law enforcement can prolong a stop, and the other governing when law enforcement can require a person to identify himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

The government argues that Officer Baker had reasonable suspicion of \"underage drinking and curfew violations\" based on \"the smell of alcohol and belief that the back seat passengers were younger than eighteen.\" An extension of the traffic stop was necessary, the government contends, because Landeros's \"own conduct prevented the officers from being able to determine whether he had committed the offenses of underage drinking or curfew violation.\" But, on cross-examination, Officer Baker stated that Landeros did not look \"underage\" to him at the time of the stop. Further, Officer Baker's testimony and reports indicate he asked Landeros for identification because it was \"standard\" procedure, not because he was concerned about Landeros's age. Indeed, the reports specifically mention that Officer Baker believed the two women were underage, but make no mention of Landeros's age. As a result, the record does not demonstrate that Officer Baker had a reasonable suspicion that Landeros was out past his curfew or drinking underage. Any extension of the traffic stop to investigate those matters was an unlawful seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The government also contends that Landeros's refusal to identify himself \"provided reasonable suspicion of the additional offenses of failure to provide identification and failure to comply with law enforcement orders.\" Arizona law provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   It is unlawful for a person, after being advised that the person's refusal to answer is unlawful, to fail or refuse to state the person's true full name on request of a peace officer who has lawfully detained the person based on reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2013-2412\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A). By the plain text of the statute, Landeros could not have violated Section 13-2412 because, as already explained, the officers lacked reasonable suspicion, at the time they initially insisted he identify himself, that Landeros had committed, was committing, or was about to commit any crimes, including violating curfew or drinking underage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, Arizona Law provides that \"[a] person shall not willfully fail or refuse to comply with any lawful order or direction of a police officer invested by law with authority to direct, control or regulate traffic.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-622\">\n    Ariz.
