SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We are confronted with an appeal of a procedurally curious nature. Plaintiff-Appellant Applied Underwriters, Inc. (Plaintiff) appealed the district court's dismissal of its claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition, on the apparent belief that the court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). When we asked the district court to clarify its grounds for dismissal, however, it explained that it actually dismissed Plaintiff's complaint as a sanction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Although we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it sanctioned Plaintiff and dismissed the case pursuant to Rule 41(b) absent an order requiring Plaintiff to file an amended complaint, we nevertheless affirm the district court's earlier Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal because the use of Plaintiff's trademarks by Defendants-Appellees Larry J. Lichtenegger, J. Dale Debber, and Providence Publications, LLC (Defendants) constituted nominative fair use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is \"a financial services company that provides payroll processing services and, through affiliated insurance companies, offers programs through which workers' compensation insurance is offered and provided to employers throughout the United States.\" It began to use the \"Applied Underwriters\" mark in October 2001,\n   and has continuously used the mark since. Beginning in October 2002, it also began to use the \"EquityComp\" mark in connection with its workers' compensation insurance services. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued Plaintiff five relevant trademark registrations: for the \"Applied Underwriters\" mark, the \"EquityComp\" mark, and three stylized versions of these marks, two of which appear to depict a St. Bernard:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its complaint, Plaintiff asserted that these registrations are currently in force and uncontestable, and that it \"aggressively advertises and promotes its marks and its services,\" having \"spent millions of dollars advertising\" them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Providence Publications, LLC publishes various online news\n   sources, including \"Workers' Comp Executive\" (WCE). WCE features news reports and offers online seminars, some of which feature Defendants Lichtenegger and Debber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleged that, beginning in November 2015, Defendants began offering a seminar (both online and on DVD) that \"uses the APPLIED UNDERWRITERS and EQUITYCOMP marks in the title of the webcast.\" The marks were also featured in various promotional materials, including a widely distributed email advertisement. Defendants used these marks \"without Applied Underwriters' authority or permission and in reckless disregard of [its] federal trademark registrations and its rights.\" Plaintiff also claimed that Defendants \"specifically and intentionally target[ed] their marketing and advertising ... to independent brokers and the business organizations that they serve who use Plaintiff's services.\" In its complaint, Plaintiff averred that \"[a]s a result of the likelihood of confusion caused by Defendants' unauthorized use of\" the marks, \"Defendants are able to attract customers who mistakenly believe that they will attend a program sponsored or affiliated with Applied Underwriters,\" leading to dilution of the marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint asserting causes of action for federal trademark infringement and dilution, false designation of origin under the Lanham Act, and federal and state unfair competition. The next day, Plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, which the district court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that their use of Plaintiff's marks was protected under the First Amendment, constituted nominal fair use, and satisfied the statutory defenses to trademark dilution. Defendants also filed a request for judicial notice that the district court granted in part and denied in part, taking judicial notice only of the DVD of the seminar. Plaintiff in turn filed an opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss, accompanied by a declaration and additional evidence not included in its complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 6, 2017, the district court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that \"Defendants' use of the Trademarks is nominative fair use.\" At Plaintiff's request, the court granted leave to amend the complaint within 30 days. The district court docket confirms that Plaintiff neither filed an amended complaint (timely or otherwise) nor announced an intent not to do so. Consequently, on August 10, 2017, the district court issued a minute order that read: \"In light of Plaintiff's failure to file an Amended Complaint pursuant to the Court's Order (ECF No. [31] ), this case is hereby DISMISSED. CASE CLOSED.\" The clerk of court subsequently entered judgment \"in accordance with the Court's Order filed on 8/10/2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This appeal followed. In their briefs, Plaintiff and Defendants disputed whether the district court dismissed Plaintiff's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), in which case we would review the sufficiency of the complaint de novo,\n   <em>\n    Starr v. Baca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759026\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1202/#p1205\">\n    652 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1205 (9th Cir. 2011), or as a sanction under Rule 41(b), which we would review for abuse of discretion,\n   <em>\n    Yourish v.

To remedy this confusion, we remanded\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   this case for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to clarify whether the complaint was dismissed as a sanction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41 or for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), and, if the final dismissal was intended as a sanction under Rule 41(b), to state the reasoning\n   behind the selection of that sanction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before oral argument in this appeal, the district court responded with a clarification order, in which it explained that it dismissed Plaintiff's complaint as a sanction pursuant to Rule 41(b), and analyzed the five pertinent factors as enumerated in\n   <em>\n    Yourish\n   </em>\n   . It concluded that \"[t]hree of the five factors strongly favored dismissal, and this Court dismissed the case under Rule 41(b) as a sanction for failure to comply with the Court's order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW AND JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint under [ Rule] 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim,\"\n   <em>\n    Starr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759026\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1202/#p1205\">\n    652 F.3d at 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"[w]e review the district court's dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion,\"\n   <em>\n    Yourish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11579674\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/983/#p986\">\n    191 F.3d at 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We have noted that \"[w]hen a district court dismisses an action because the plaintiff has not filed an amended complaint after being given leave to do so and has not notified the court of his intention not to file an amended complaint, we may deem the dismissal to be for failure to comply with a court order based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Decades ago, the Fifth Circuit considered a similar factual scenario and concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [h]ad the District Judge intended what he wrote literally-that the action was being dismissed because the March order had been \"disobeyed\"-he would have been guilty of an abuse\n   of his Rule 41(b) discretion to dismiss. Dismissal of a case for disobedience of a court order is an exceedingly harsh sanction which should be imposed only in extreme cases, and then only after exploration of lesser sanctions. Failure to amend a complaint after it has been dismissed with leave to amend is not such an extreme case of disobedience, if it is disobedience at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Mann v.

More recently, dissenting in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , as in this case,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   the district court\n   <em>\n    did not require\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff to file an amended complaint, nor did the court require in the alternative that Plaintiff file an amended complaint\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   some other specified document. The court's order denying Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration merely granted leave to amend, with permissive text allowing Plaintiff to amend or not .... Given the court's failure to cite Rule 41(b), the permissive wording of its orders, and Plaintiff's desire to obtain appellate review of the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal as discussed in the motion for reconsideration, he understandably hoped for a dismissal, which he reasonably thought would be under Rule 12(b)(6). After all, the district court never ordered Plaintiff to file an amended complaint, as the courts had in\n   <em>\n    Yourish\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Ferdik\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Leave to amend\n   </em>\n   was granted; failure to amend did not constitute noncompliance with a court order. Simply put, there was no \"ultimatum\" within the meaning of our precedents, and so the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Plaintiff's federal claims under Rule 41(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175585\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1146/#p1150\">\n    840 F.3d at 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Graber, J., dissenting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We agree with Judge Graber's reasoning. By its plain text, a Rule 41(b) dismissal under these circumstances requires \"a court order\" with which an offending plaintiff failed to comply. Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, there was no such order-the district court did not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff file an amended complaint following the initial Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. Instead, the court's order concluded as follows: \"Plaintiff is GRANTED leave to amend within thirty (30) days of this Order.\" The district\n   court did not mandate the filing of an amended complaint, and it did not indicate that failure to do so would result in dismissal of the complaint pursuant to Rule 41(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oliva v.

A grant of leave to amend is not an order to amend. Therefore, Rule 41(b) did not apply here, and the district court's dismissal on this ground constituted an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. How to Proceed?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Having concluded that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed Plaintiff's complaint as a sanction pursuant to Rule 41(b), we must now determine the proper course of action moving forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   One option is to remand. Upon remand, the district court would presumably either again dismiss Plaintiff's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), based on reasoning articulated in its prior order, or again grant Plaintiff leave to amend-an opportunity of which Plaintiff would not avail itself, given its stated desire to appeal the district court's original Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. Remand would therefore require the parties to engage in additional and redundant briefing, and would add years to their litigation. Nothing substantive would be gained, and \"remand ... would be an unnecessary waste of judicial and litigant resources.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Reilly v.

The seminar did not discuss workers' compensation programs generally, but rather Plaintiff's specific offering.

Plaintiff suggests that \"[t]he addition of the 'Applied Underwriters' mark does nothing to identify the content of the seminar but instead serves solely to create the impression that Applied Underwriters is sponsoring or endorsing a seminar about its own EquityComp\u00ae product.\" It relies on\n   <em>\n    Playboy Enterprises\n   </em>\n   , in which we determined that while use of the trademarked phrase \"Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981\" was permissible because it was needed for identification purposes, use of another potentially protected phrase-\"PMOY '81\"-was not.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9397651\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/796/#p802\">\n    279 F.3d at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reasoned that \"[t]he repeated depiction of 'PMOY '81' is not necessary to describe Welles. 'Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981' is quite adequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Here, similarly, Plaintiff suggests that the \"EquityComp\" mark identified the service that Defendants analyzed in their seminar, and thus the \"Applied Underwriters\" mark did not serve that function. But this argument falls short. Defendants' use of the \"Applied Underwriters\" mark was not necessarily redundant because it was used to identify the company that offered EquityComp-a company that was itself critiqued in the seminar. We therefore find this case distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Playboy Enterprises\n   </em>\n   , where use of the \"PMOY '81\" mark served no additional identification purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Accordingly, because both marks were needed to identify the service (and company) that Defendants analyzed in their seminar, the district court correctly determined that the first\n   <em>\n    New Kids\n   </em>\n   factor was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

That argument relies on a misunderstanding of this factor. The second\n   <em>\n    New Kids\n   </em>\n   factor does not implicate the\n   <em>\n    number\n   </em>\n   of uses of a mark, but rather the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the uses.

It did not even employ the distinctive small-caps rendering of the \" APPLIED UNDERWRITERS \" and \" EQUITYCOMP \" marks.

Instead, the complaint stated only that \"Defendants' improper use of the APPLIED UNDERWRITERS IP has caused, and will continue to cause, damaging and actual confusion among the public.\" That conclusory statement constituted the only evidence of confusion contained in the complaint, and at no other point did Plaintiff plead facts suggesting that use of its marks led consumers to assume that it sponsored or endorsed Defendants' seminar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff also notes that Defendants employed the \u00ae registration symbol in conjunction with their uses of the \"Applied Underwriters\" and \"EquityComp\" marks, which it claims \"makes the use of the trademark look more official or authorized, because one would expect that the trademark owner or its authorized users would use the registration symbol \u00ae, not unauthorized users.\" This is not a particularly compelling argument. Although Defendants did use the \u00ae symbol, the email attached to the complaint clarified that \"EquityComp is the registered trademark of Applied Underwriters, Inc.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, in the body of the email (and on the DVD cover), the title of the seminar-which did feature both the \"Applied Underwriters\" and \"EquityComp\" marks-was in regular font beneath a stylized logo for WCE:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This further suggested that it was WCE-\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff-that sponsored the seminar, which discounts the possibility of any confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Furthermore, Defendants correctly argue that any likelihood of confusion is implausible due to the content of the email and the seminar itself. The text of the email referred to EquityComp as a \"sophisticated yet controversial program,\" and Lichtenegger was billed as a lawyer who \"for 15 years has specialized in Investment and Commercial Fraud recovery\" and \"represents a panoply of employers vs Applied and is well versed in their math and how their program works.\" Debber, for his part, was credited as the person \"who broke the recent spate of stories about Applied Underwriters' EquityComp Program.

The complaint contained only scant, conclusory allegations of consumer confusion, which, even when considered in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, were belied by the allegedly infringing email attached to the complaint, which demonstrated nominative fair use.
