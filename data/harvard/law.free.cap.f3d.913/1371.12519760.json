This uniform international law was the backdrop against which Congress adopted the Agent Orange Act.

We conclude at\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step one that the intent of Congress is clear from the text of \u00a7 1116 : Mr. Procopio, who served in the territorial sea of the \"Republic of Vietnam,\" is entitled to \u00a7 1116 's presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We find no merit in the government's arguments to the contrary.

According to the government, Regulation 311 imposed the foot-on-land requirement, but Regulation 313 did not. The government contends that \u00a7 1116 codified\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   regulations and that, accordingly, it is ambiguous whether Congress intended to impose the foot-on-land requirement. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Regulation 311 created a presumption of service connection for chloracne and later soft-tissue sarcomas for veterans who served in \"the Republic of Vietnam.\" It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Service in the Republic of Vietnam\" includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations, if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Regulation 313 created a presumption of service connection for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for veterans who served in \"Vietnam.\" It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Service in Vietnam\" includes service in the waters offshore, or service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in Vietnam.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The government asks us to infer that Regulation 311 imposed the foot-on-land requirement, and that Regulation 313 did not. This distinction is essential to its argument that \u00a7 1116, which codified both, is ambiguous. We do not agree. We do not read Regulation 311, Regulation 313, or even later-adopted Regulation 307 as articulating the government's current foot-on-land requirement. And there is no indication anyone, including the government, did before \u00a7 1116 was adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Regulation 311 grants a presumption of service connection for \"service in the waters offshore\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   service in other\n   <em>\n    locations, if\n   </em>\n   the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.\" Regulation 313 grants the presumption for \"service in the waters offshore\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   service in other locations\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in Vietnam.\" We do not read these minor grammatical differences to compel the distinction the government urges. At best, the addition of a comma in Regulation 311 permits the clause \"if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam\" to modify both \"service in the waters offshore\" and \"service in other locations.\" But even if Regulation 311 is so read, it still does not impose the foot-on-land requirement: it covers everyone whose service included duty or visitation \"in the Republic of Vietnam,\" which, under background law, embraces the territorial sea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   That is the straightforward meaning of the regulation even after taking full account of the comma. As the government concedes, the \"waters offshore\" are broader than the territorial sea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument at 55:08-55:19 (government's counsel acknowledging offshore waters \"can also include beyond the territorial seas\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    at 55:40-56:10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (government's counsel confirming offshore waters extend beyond the territorial sea);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    at 2:00-2:16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mr. Procopio's counsel stating \"[t]he offshore water is broader than the territorial sea ... and it's an important difference because a nation is sovereign only in its territorial sea.\"). Regulation 311's requirement of \"duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam\" brings within coverage only a subset of all those who served \"offshore,\" namely, those whose service included presence on land, in the inland waterways, or in the territorial sea, consistent with international law. That is, veterans who served in the waters offshore or in other locations would be eligible for the presumption if during such service they visited the Republic of Vietnam (which is defined as the landmass and territorial sea by international law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Given the undisputed distinction between offshore waters and territorial seas, we see no basis for incorporating a foot-on-land requirement into Regulation 311. The only discussion of this provision appears in the proposed rulemaking where the government explains that, \"[b]ecause some military personnel stationed elsewhere may have been present in the Republic of Vietnam, 'service in the Republic of Vietnam' will encompass\n   <em>\n    services elsewhere if\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the person concerned actually was in the Republic of Vietnam\n   </em>\n   , however briefly.\" 50 Fed. Reg. at 15,848, 15,849 (Apr. 22, 1985). We see no evidence that the government understood Regulation 311 to include the foot-on-land requirement until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Agent Orange Act was passed. The government first articulated this position in 1997, six years after the Act. Gen. Counsel Prec. 27-97 (July 23, 1997). We cannot read into \u00a7 1116 an ambiguity that relies on a distinction made only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1116 was adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It is undisputed that Regulation 313 covering Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma does not include the foot-on-land requirement, meaning the presumption of service connection for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma would have applied to veterans who served on the landmass or in the territorial sea. The government asserts that Regulation 311 presumed service connection for diseases-chloracne and soft-tissue sarcomas-linked to herbicide exposure, while Regulation 313 presumed service connection for a disease-Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma-\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   linked to herbicide exposure. But that asserted distinction does not indicate ambiguity in \u00a7 1116. Indeed, when Congress enacted \u00a7 1116 it expressly extended the presumption to Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as chloracne and soft-tissue sarcomas. And the government argues that \u00a7 1116 intended to codify Regulation 311 and Regulation 313. No fair reading of \u00a7 1116 can exclude the very veterans suffering from Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that were entitled to Regulation 313's presumption, yet the government's (and the dissent's) reading does just that: According to the government, a veteran with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who served in the Republic of Vietnam's territorial sea would have been entitled to service connection under Regulation 313, but this same veteran would not be entitled to service connection under \u00a7 1116. This cannot be right. We decline to read \u00a7 1116, as the dissent urges, to both codify Regulation 313 and erode that regulation's coverage. We see no basis to conclude that Congress chose to reduce the scope of service connection for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In short, we do not understand Regulation 311 or Regulation 313 to articulate a foot-on-land requirement. We find no merit to the government's argument that \u00a7 1116 is ambiguous because \"Congress's codification of the existing regulatory presumptions ... tells, at best, a conflicting story.\" Appellee's Br. 39-40. In 1991, Congress legislated against the backdrop of international law that had defined the \"Republic of Vietnam\" as including its territorial sea for decades. The government's foot-on-land requirement, first articulated in 1997, does not provide a basis to find ambiguity in the language Congress chose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The government also argues the \"Republic of Vietnam\" in \u00a7 1116 does not include its territorial sea because when Congress intends to bring a territorial sea within the ambit of a statute, it says so expressly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the examples the government points to address\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a nation's territorial sea, but only \"waters adjacent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203756\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6258, 8756 (extending the Korea Defense Service Medal to those who \"served in the Republic of Korea or the waters adjacent thereto\"); Veterans' Rehabilitation and Education Amendments of 1980, Pub.

Therefore, while I agree with the majority's decision, I write separately to lament the court's failure-yet again-to address and resolve the tension between the pro-veteran canon and agency deference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Chen, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom Circuit Judge Dyk joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Mr. Procopio suffers from prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes.

No prior case has announced a principle that a statute's reference to a country name should be treated as a term of art that encompasses both the country's landmass and territorial waters. Such a rule is particularly anomalous in the context of a statute governing veterans' disability benefits, which in no way implicates a foreign country's sovereignty over territorial waters. Further, I see nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 1116 suggesting that Blue Water Navy veterans would be covered by the presumption of service connection. Because herbicides were sprayed throughout the landmass of the Republic of Vietnam, it is at least a reasonable understanding of the statute that Congress at the time of the Agent Orange Act directed its statutory presumption of service connection towards those service members who had actually served within the country's land borders. I would therefore find, as we did in\n   <em>\n    Haas\n   </em>\n   , that \u00a7 1116 is ambiguous under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step one.

Regulation 3.311a was promulgated in 1985 to implement the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act, Public Law 98-542,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%202725\">\n    98 Stat. 2725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2725-34 (1984) (\"1984 Dioxin Act\"). Section 5 of the 1984 Dioxin Act directed the VA to establish guidelines grounded in \"sound scientific and medical evidence\" that require the veterans' death or disability be based on actual exposure to herbicides containing dioxin.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%202725\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%202725\">\n    at 2727-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The 1984 Dioxin Act noted that there was evidence that specific diseases-chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, and soft tissue sarcoma-were linked to exposure to dioxin-containing herbicides.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%202725\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%202725\">\n    at 2725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thereafter, the VA promulgated \u00a7 3.311a. The \u00a7 3.311a rulemaking notice noted that herbicides \"were used during the Vietnam conflict to defoliate trees, remove ground cover, and destroy crops,\" and that many veterans \"were deployed in or near locations where Agent Orange was sprayed.\" Adjudication of Claims Based on Exposure to Dioxin or Ionizing Radiation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015848\">\n    50 Fed. Reg. 15848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15849 (Apr. 22, 1985). Because the regulation required exposure to dioxin-containing herbicides and herbicides had been sprayed on Vietnam's landmass, the VA imposed a foot-on-land requirement for veterans that served offshore or in locations other than Vietnam:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \"Service in the Republic of Vietnam\" includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations, if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .311a(b) (1986). The natural reading of the regulation's use of the conjunctive \"and\" confirms that the prepositional phrase applied both to offshore veterans and those stationed outside of Vietnam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The VA promulgated \u00a7 3.313 for an entirely different purpose. Contrary to \u00a7 3.311a, \u00a7 3.313 was not linked to herbicide exposure, but rather was based on a 1990 CDC study that determined that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Vietnam veterans-including those that served on the landmass as well as those who served offshore-had a higher incidence rate of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma than non-Vietnam veterans.

The 1990 study further concluded that no correlation existed between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and exposure to Agent Orange.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Fed.%20Reg.%2043123\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The VA therefore worded \u00a7 3.313 specifically to apply to all offshore veterans, without a foot-on-land requirement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Service in Vietnam includes service in the waters offshore, or service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in Vietnam.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203.313\">\n    38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1990). The natural reading of the regulation's use of the disjunctive \"or\" and movement of the comma to offset \"offshore\" from the rest of the sentence confirms that the offshore veterans were not subject to a foot-on-land requirement. While the grammatical differences\n   between the two regulations may appear to be small, they set forth critical distinctions driven by the different purposes between the regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   When the VA promulgated these two regulations, their meanings were not ambiguous. The ambiguity arose when Congress appeared to codify both VA regulations in the Agent Orange Act, one regulation with a foot-on-land requirement and one without. 137 Cong. Rec. H719-01 (1991) (\"[T]he bill would ... codify decisions the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has announced to grant presumptions of service connection for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma in veterans who served in Vietnam ....\").

A congressional choice to codify the foot-on-land requirement from \u00a7 3.311a would have been a reasonable one, since both \u00a7 3.311a and the Agent Orange Act-unlike \u00a7 3.313-required that the service connection be based on actual exposure to herbicides during the war. Moreover, \"Congress included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [from \u00a7 3.313(a) ] on the list of diseases specifically identified in the Agent Orange Act based on evidence that, contrary to the conclusion of the 1990 CDC study, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was in fact associated with exposure to Agent Orange.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582409,5636655\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/1168/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1179 n.1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on the Association Between Adverse Health Effects and Exposure to Agent Orange, reprinted in Links Between Agent Orange, Herbicides, and Rare Diseases: Hearing before the Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations Subcomm. of the Comm. on Gov't Relations\n   </em>\n   , 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 22, 41 (1990) ). Against this regulatory backdrop prior to the codification of service connection presumption for certain diseases through the Agent Orange Act, it is far from clear that Congress intended \u00a7 1116 to encompass veterans who served in offshore waters up to 12 nautical miles away from Vietnam. During that lead-up to the Agent Orange Act, the majority cites no evidence that Blue Water Navy veterans had been receiving service connection presumptions for any of these diseases listed in \u00a7 3.311a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The majority's conclusion that \"Republic of Vietnam\" in \u00a7 3.311a\"covers everyone whose service included duty or visitation 'in the Republic of Vietnam,' which, under background law, embraces the territorial sea\" (Majority Op. at 1377) is incorrect, because it assumes that the VA also bought into the majority's newly announced principle that reciting a sovereign's formal name in a statute or-for purposes of \u00a7 3.311a-a regulation, necessarily includes the country's territorial seas. The majority cites no case law or other support for this assumption. Nor does the majority cite support for its subsequent conclusion that \u00a7 3.311a encompasses \"only a subset\" of offshore veterans-those that served on land, within the internal waterways, or within the territorial seas of Vietnam.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582409,5636655\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/1168/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no evidence in the regulation or its history that the VA intended this interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   I also disagree with the majority's conclusion that \u00a7 1116 's language specifying that the presumption is applicable to veterans regardless of what military branch they served in (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam\") has any bearing on whether offshore veterans are subject to a foot-on-land requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. at 1376. A veteran who served in the Navy but spent time on the landmass of Vietnam is no less likely to have a service connection due to exposure to Agent Orange than a veteran who served on the land in Vietnam in the Army. Moreover, this statutory phrase is commonly used in other sections of Title 38, suggesting that Congress did not have something particular in mind as to how it repeated this phrase in \u00a7 1116.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201110\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (entitling certain veterans to compensation for disability, injury, or disease contracted or aggravated \"in the active military, naval, or air service, during a period of war\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201110\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1112(b) (establishing presumption of service connection for prisoners of war where condition became manifest \"after active military, naval, or air service\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   After reviewing the applicable provisions, it is not clear to me that Congress unambiguously intended \"served in the Republic of Vietnam\" to include Blue Water veterans. Although international law establishes that sovereign nations have dominion and control over their territorial seas, a U.S. veterans' benefits statute has nothing to do with regulating interactions with a foreign sovereign. And the Agent Orange Act's legislative history provides no support for the majority's conclusion. I therefore believe, as this court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Haas\n   </em>\n   , that the statutory phrase \"Republic of Vietnam\" is ambiguous when applied to service in the waters adjoining the landmass of Vietnam.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582409,5636655\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/1168/\">\n    525 F.3d at 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As for the liberal construction principle known as the pro-veteran canon, neither the Supreme Court nor this court has applied it at step one of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   as a means for deeming Congress's intent clear for an otherwise unclear statute. But even if it were relevant to the step one inquiry, I do not view this canon, given its indeterminate nature, as compelling the conversion of this ambiguous statute into an unambiguous one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The significance of the policy choice and budget impact that the court makes today further underscores why more compelling indicia are required before concluding that Congress clearly intended the majority's statutory interpretation. Congress recently estimated that it would need to allocate an additional $1.8 billion during fiscal year 2019, and $5.7 billion over 10 years, to fund the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2018, a bill that would have explicitly expanded the presumption of Agent Orange exposure to Blue Water Navy veterans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2018: Hearing on H.R. 299 Before the S. Comm. on Veterans' Affairs, 115th Cong. 1, 4 (2018) (statement of Dr. Paul R. Lawrence, Under Secretary, Benefits Department, Veterans' Affairs). The bill passed the House unanimously in 2018 but failed to pass the Senate before the end of the 2018 session, due, in part, to concerns over the cost of expanding the presumption of service connection. It is not for the Judiciary to step in and redirect such a significant budget item-rather, that policy choice should be left to Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   I do not reach the question of whether\n   <em>\n    Haas\n   </em>\n   should be reaffirmed insofar as it held that at step two of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , deference was owed to the interpretation of the statute by the VA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1184, 1192-93.
