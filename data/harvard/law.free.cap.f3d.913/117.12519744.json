In this lawsuit, they assert that the claims-processing framework itself discriminatorily excluded them. In short, they raise a discrimination claim about the handling of discrimination claims. They therefore identify two distinct discrimination claims, one nested within the other: the underlying credit discrimination claims, and the current challenge to the framework. Plaintiffs argue that the district court failed to assume the merits of their claim when it held they lacked standing to bring the current challenge. That is incorrect. Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the framework because they have no live underlying credit discrimination claims to present there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs sued the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\" or \"the Department\") and Epiq Class Action &amp; Claims Solutions, Inc. (\"Epiq\"), the firm USDA hired to administer the framework, contending they unlawfully discriminated\n   by affording women and Hispanic claimants exclusive access to a remedial claims framework, the very raison d'\u00eatre of which was to redress USDA's sex and ethnicity discrimination against female and Hispanic farmers. Plaintiffs allege that the farmers whose estates they represent experienced discrimination in USDA agricultural credit and benefit programs-based not on sex or Hispanic ethnicity, but on their black racial identity. That claim is certainly plausible. It is well established that, during the 1980s and 1990s, USDA engaged in systemic discrimination on multiple grounds against many of the farmers its programs were supposed to serve. In fact, it was a class action lawsuit by black farmers (the \"Black Farmers\" suit) that first illuminated USDA's rampant credit discrimination and inspired parallel lawsuits by Native American, female, and Hispanic farmers. And USDA modeled the framework at issue here on the claims-processing system it set up in settlement of the Black Farmers' class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case never submitted claims in the Black Farmers remedial process. When they instead sought to present their claims in the parallel framework for claims of discrimination against women and/or Hispanic farmers, the claims processor turned them away. Plaintiffs contend that USDA and Epiq thereby invidiously discriminated against them based on their sex and race. They claim that USDA violated the constitutional equal protection guarantee and that Epiq violated the federal statutory prohibition against discrimination by a program or activity that receives federal financial assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In assessing standing, we assume that plaintiffs could prevail on those claims. Plaintiffs' standing nevertheless fails for want of redressability. The claims-processing framework for women and Hispanic farmers, like the parallel one for black farmers, can only make good on live claims. Thus, even assuming plaintiffs succeeded in invalidating the framework's challenged sex and ethnicity limitations, they could not benefit unless they had unexpired claims of credit discrimination to process there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because plaintiffs fail to allege that they have any live claims to process in the framework they challenge, the harm they assert from being excluded is not redressable. Plaintiffs' nested claims target discrimination by USDA during the 1980s in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), which prohibits discrimination in credit transactions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201691\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . ECOA's five-year statute of limitations has long since run on most claims of that vintage. Congress in 1998 legislated an important but limited exception to ECOA's time bar for farmers who had complained of discrimination to USDA between 1981 and July 1997-a period when, Congress found, the Department's internal system for addressing discrimination claims was dysfunctional. Plaintiffs do not allege they sought to press their claims to USDA before July 1997, so they are ineligible to benefit from Congress's tolling of the limitations period for farmers who did. Their decades-old claims are time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Even if we assumed that plaintiffs in fact took steps before 1997 to preserve their claims and merely neglected to so specify in their complaint, they would still be out of luck. Together with everything else they allege, that would mean-as the district court assumed-that they were members of the plaintiff class in the Black Farmers' lawsuit. Any credit discrimination claim a member of the Black Farmers plaintiff class may have had during the relevant period, whether or not actually pursued in the remedial process established under the Black Farmers' consent\n   decree, is now precluded by that decree, or, for any member who opted out, time barred. Thus, even if the challenged framework were not limited to women and Hispanic farmers, it could do nothing to redress plaintiffs' precluded claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Over the past two decades, USDA has resolved discrimination lawsuits with several different groups of farmers.

The Appropriations Act tolled the statute of limitations for two years after its passage-from October 1998 to October 2000-for people who (1) alleged non-employment-related discrimination by USDA occurring between January 1, 1981, and December 31, 1996, and (2) had filed a complaint with USDA before July 1, 1997. A farmer who complained to USDA in 1983, when OCREA broke down, could have had valid claims based on discrimination as far back as 1981, which presumably accounts for Congress's choice of that year as the beginning of the statutory date range. By confining the Act's beneficiaries to people who had sought to complain to USDA during a period when the Department systematically failed to process farmers' discrimination claims, Congress limited its legislative fix to claimants blocked by OCREA's dysfunction.

That holding is wholly consistent with\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ALDF\n   </em>\n   . The bar plaintiffs face is no knock against their equal protection and Title VI claims against USDA and Epiq. The problem, rather, is that plaintiffs have not alleged that they have any live credit discrimination claims to press in the Framework. Plaintiffs did not make a discrimination complaint before July 1997, and are thus barred by ECOA's statute of limitations. The district courts here and in\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   nevertheless treated the plaintiffs as\n   <em>\n    Pigford I\n   </em>\n   class members, who by definition did make a discrimination complaint by that deadline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Boyland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267519\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/24/\">\n    242 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   31 ;\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   , 304 F.R.D. at 81 ;\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   , 304 F.R.D. at 88. Even if plaintiffs did make such a complaint, however, they are barred by the\n   <em>\n    Pigford I\n   </em>\n   consent decree. Plaintiffs have articulated a theory for opening the Framework, but they have no theory for resurrecting the underlying claims they wish to process there. What follows is a detailed explanation of why that is so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs do not allege that they complained to USDA before July 1997, and, accepting that they did not do so, two obstacles prevent them from participating in the\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /Love\n   </em>\n   Framework, over and above USDA and Epiq's alleged discrimination. One is statutory: Congress only revived ECOA claims for those farmers who made a prior discrimination complaint by July 1, 1997. Because the plaintiffs' claims were never revived, they are subject to ECOA's ordinary statute of limitations (which is now five years). That means that their credit discrimination claims, which allege discrimination in the 1980s, are time barred. The second obstacle is that the plaintiffs fail to meet the basic criteria for participation in the\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /Love\n   </em>\n   Framework, race and sex aside, because the Framework requires claimants to have complained of discrimination by July 1997.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Status Report Ex. 20-21,\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:00-cv-02502 (D.D.C.

Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /Love\n   </em>\n   Framework includes this requirement because it was a key parameter in Congress's resurrection of ECOA claims. Whatever form the obstacle takes, it prevents the plaintiffs from processing their claims through the Framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   If plaintiffs did complain of discrimination by July 1997, claim preclusion or the statute of limitations would bar their claims now. As for preclusion, if plaintiffs had made a pre-July 1997 race-based ECOA claim to USDA, they would have qualified as\n   <em>\n    Pigford I\n   </em>\n   class members; the\n   <em>\n    Pigford I\n   </em>\n   complaint alleged precisely the same kind of racial discrimination as these plaintiffs' nested claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Seventh Am.

Plaintiffs do not allege that they opted out of\n   <em>\n    Pigford I\n   </em>\n   .

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4443 (2d ed. 2002) (\"The basically contractual nature of consent judgments has led to general agreement that preclusive effects should be measured by the intent of the parties.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs do not allege that they opted out of\n   <em>\n    Pigford\n   </em>\n   and timely filed their own suit, thereby avoiding\n   <em>\n    Pigford\n   </em>\n   's preclusive effect, but if they in fact did, they still fail because they map no route past ECOA's time bar. Even claims that were revived by Congress's tolling are by now time barred by the revived claims' statute of limitations (which expired on October 21, 2000). Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 105-277, \u00a7 741,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%202681\">\n    112 Stat. 2681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202279\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   notes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In any of the scenarios in which the plaintiffs initially sought to complain to\n   USDA of discrimination by July 1997, their claims have been extinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To be clear, only the claims plaintiffs wish to present in the\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /Love\n   </em>\n   Framework (the underlying claims of credit discrimination by USDA in the 1980s) are precluded or time barred. The claims they bring today under the Fifth Amendment and Title VI do not suffer those procedural defects. But the plaintiffs cannot end-run the procedural bars on their underlying credit discrimination claims by nesting them in new framework-discrimination claims not subject to those bars. Those bars operate independently from any potential discrimination by USDA and Epiq, and prevent us from redressing the plaintiffs' injury by offering them an \"opportunity ... to present a meritorious claim for discrimination against\" USDA. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74, 83, 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Recognizing those barriers as a standing defect does not collapse all procedural bars into standing issues. If the plaintiffs here sidestepped all the frameworks and sued USDA directly for violating ECOA in the 1980s, the court would dismiss the case on grounds of claim preclusion or untimeliness, rather than standing. The plaintiffs have avoided that fate by nesting procedurally barred claims in non-procedurally barred claims, such that the claims they bring today cannot be dismissed for those reasons. Yet, because their underlying ECOA claims are procedurally barred, we cannot avoid the reality that, even if plaintiffs won an opportunity to present those claims in the Framework, they would be ineligible for redress and thereby lack standing to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs never explained why the consent decree or statute of limitations would not bar their claims. They simply describe the \"legal theory of their case\" as being \"that the USDA's administrative claims process whereby Epiq, at the direction of and on behalf of the USDA, expressly excludes African-American males from participating based solely on their race and gender violates the Fifth Amendment, notwithstanding the\n   <em>\n    Pigford\n   </em>\n   consent decrees.\" Appellants' Br. 23. Even accepting that theory as true does not overcome the independent hurdles of the\n   <em>\n    Pigford\n   </em>\n   consent decree and ECOA's statute of limitations. Taking all the complaint's allegations as true, one of those hurdles necessarily blocks the way. The plaintiffs therefore lack standing because their injury is not redressable-even if they satisfy the other prongs of the standing test, and even if they are right on the merits that the\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /Love\n   </em>\n   Framework violates the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because the standing defect is dispositive, we need not consider the district court's holding that issue preclusion prevents BFAA (alone or in addition to the individual plaintiffs) from relitigating its standing. We affirm the district court's decision dismissing the case in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Subsequent litigation in the case, not relevant here, became known as\n    <em>\n     Pigford II\n    </em>\n    .

They allege that \"any socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher who had not filed a meritorious claim for relief against USDA\" is still entitled to do so \"under \u00a7 14011\" of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. J.A. 19. But section 14011 by its terms establishes no such right. That provision says that \"[i]t is the sense of Congress that all pending claims and class actions brought against the Department of Agriculture by socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers ... including Native American, Hispanic, and female farmers or ranchers, based on racial, ethnic, or gender discrimination in farm program participation should be resolved in an expeditious and just manner.\" Pub.
