A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">On July 22, 1977 plaintiff filed suit for personal injuries arising from a March 31, 1975 automobile accident. Defendant pleaded the two-year statute of limitations in bar. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2. Plaintiff rejoined, claiming that defendant was equitably estopped to plead the bar of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Upon defendant\u2019s request a nonjury evidentiary hearing was held before trial by Judge McGann limited to the propriety of defendant\u2019s plea of the statute of limitations as a valid defense to the action. We conclude that this was a proper approach to the essentially equitable statute of limitations issue. <em>See Lopez v. Swyer, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>267 (1973); <em>see, also, Fitzgerald v. Wright, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">After hearing the evidence Judge McGann concluded that equitable considerations did not obviate the defense plea that the statute had run and he dismissed the action. He concluded that defendant\u2019s agent did not intentionally lull plaintiff into sleeping on his rights. Plaintiff appeals, contending, in essence, that no reasonable view of the evidence supports the result reached. We disagree and affirm , for the reasons expressed in Judge McGann\u2019s factual analysis of the proofs presented to him. While these proofs were susceptible of conflicting interpretation, his view of the facts after seeing and hearing the witnesses finds support in the record. We therefore must affirm. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-484 (1974). Unless we have \u201ca definite conviction that the judge went so wide of the mark, a mistake must have been made,\u201d we are duty bound to accept his factual findings. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The trial judge found plaintiff to be \u201can intelligent individual, well-oriented, self-possessed, able to do things well... There is no sense at all of incompetency involved in the case.\u201d The judge found as a fact that Lang, the independent adjuster for defendant\u2019s automobile liability carrier, who exclusively dealt with plaintiff and his mother, \u201cnever in any way told the Tantums to sue, never said don\u2019t sue, wait, wait, don\u2019t do anything, hold off. There was nothing like that.\u201d Indeed, the statute of limitations was not discussed at all by the parties. The judge further found that \u201cin no way did Mr. Lang ever try to discourage Mr. Tantum from going to a lawyer.\u201d The judge accepted Lang\u2019s credibility when he concluded: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201c[W]hen he says I [Lang] in no way mentioned settlement, I find that the probability is that this is so, that he did not mention settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The carrier and Lang, Judge McGann found, consistently viewed this as a no liability case. \u201cI think he is entitled to that view.\u201d The judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">That was a realistic view because as I read the statements, the case happened in a very simple way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">Mr. Binz was a friend of Mr. Tantum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">They got in Mr. Binz\u2019 car after having a meal at Mrs. Tantum\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">They started down the road and had gone but a short distance and there was a curve and both agree that when Mr. Binz went around the curve he was doing 20 to 25 miles per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">Mr. Tantum was a passenger and as they went around the curve for some reason or other the door on his side opened up and he fell out of the car and was hurt, seriously hurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">But, if you came to a trial of that and somebody said Mr. Binz is negligent, I think everyone would be left scratching their heads and say, well, what did he do wrong? He didn\u2019t close the door for Mr. Tantum when Mr. Tantum got in the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">Mr. Tantum got in the car and apparently no one suggests that it was a door that had always fallen open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-14\">It simply was an accident that happened and the word accident, I think, by derivation means nobody\u2019s fault, a happening that no one is responsible for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">This liability picture supported the judge\u2019s conclusion that there never were any negotiations that could have lulled plaintiff into an assurance of payment at the end of the trail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Again, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>judge specifically found that \u201cno one ever told them not to go to a lawyer or not to seek legal advice. They ultimately did so, but they did so a little too late. That\u2019s what the statute of limitations is all about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In several letters to his principal, Banner Casualty Insurance Company, Lang made reference to maintaining \u201ccontrol over the claimant.\u201d From our analysis of the judge\u2019s opinion and the complete record, we conclude that the judge found nothing invidious about this asserted \u201ccontrol.\u201d In the letter of February 11, 1977 Lang reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">If we stay in frequent contact with the claimant we should be able to perceive when the claimant\u2019s patience is exhausted and he will seek the services of an Attorney. If this comes to pass, it is my opinion that we should consider tendering a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d settlement offer of $4,000.00 to $4,500.00. It is my opinion that this offer should only be tendered if it becomes apparent that an Attorney will become involved otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">This effort at \u201ccontrol\u201d was not to keep plaintiff away from an attorney but to preserve the opportunity to negotiate a settlement, if the company ever extended any authority, before an attorney was actually engaged. We cannot say that this was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>unreasonable interpretation of the evidence on this record where the judge found that Lang \u201cwas not bugging, so to speak, the Tantums\u201d and the \u201ccontacts between the parties were initiated principally by Mrs. Tantum calling Mr. bang.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Accepting the factual findings made by Judge McGann, the legal authorities in which plaintiff seeks solace are not persuasive in his favor. In <em>Friedman v. Friendly Ice Cream Co., </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333 (App.Div.1975), this court held only that plaintiff was entitled to a factual hearing on whether equitable considerations barred the defense of limitation of action. There plaintiff-appellant had shown by affidavit in unsuccessfully resisting summary judgment that a factfinder could find that (a) he had a valid claim, (b) defendants had, in effect, admitted liability, (c) offers had been made, (d) negotiations were intentionally protracted by defendants \u201cso as to have the statute of limitations run against plaintiff\u2019s claim\u201d and (e) defendants were guilty of unconscionable conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In the present case the factfinder has already heard the evidence and found against plaintiff. <em>Cf. Peloso v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>514 (1970) (fire policy), and <em>Bowler v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y., </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>313 (1969) (accident policy), where the Supreme Court held that equitable considerations entitled first-party claimants to escape the bar where their own carriers acted unconscionably in handling their claims, contrary to \u201cthe highest burden of good faith\u201d the carriers owed to their insured defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Here, plaintiff had a factual hearing and the findings went against him. In the adversarial context presented by a third-party auto claim, the judge found factually that plaintiff was not misled into a tardy assertion of his claim. Rather, the judge found that plaintiff slept on his right to file suit on a very doubtful claim which had never been accepted for payment by the alleged tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. The evidence supports the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-16\"> In his signed statement plaintiff described the accident as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-17\">On March 31, 1975 Charles Binz had dinner at my house and after-wards we were going back to his apartment so he could get a change of clothes and then we were going out. This is when the accident occurred when we were going to Charles\u2019 apartment. We were traveling towards Route 526 on Yellow Meeting House Road, Charles was driving, and I was sitting in the front passenger seat. When I got into the car I pulled the door shut and assumed it had latched properly; I\u2019ve ridden in his car a number of times and never had a problem with this door. Charley slowed down as we approached the curve in the road, I\u2019d say he was going approximately 25 m.p.h. as we entered the curve. Also, there are no seat belts in his car. It all happened so fast, he no sooner entered the curve and my door flew open; I tried to grab onto the seat to hold myself from falling out of the car but the force was too much. I fell out of the car and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>onto the road, point of impact was the road and my right hip, I hit the road and came to rest right where I hit, I did not roll over. Charley pulled the car over and then backed the car up to me and he helped me get into the car, I could not walk without help. We drove back to my parents house and my mother called the Allentown First Aid Squad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In his signed statement defendant described the accident as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKx\">The weather at the time was clear, roads were dry, visibility was good. It was just getting dark at this time. In my car besides me driving was one passenger sitting in the front passenger seat, his name is Wilfred Tantum, Jr. of R.D. # 2, Cream Ridge, New Jersey. We had just finished having dinner at his parents house, where he lives; he is separated from his wife but not divorced yet. We left his parents house and were driving over to my apartment when the accident occurred. Yellow Meeting House Road is a two lane country road, very narrow. I was heading towards Route 526 when I approached a curve in the road, the road curved to the left. I slowed down to approximately 20 m.p.h. as I entered the curve; I had no sooner entered the curve when the passenger door flew open and my passenger fell out of the car and onto the roadway. As soon as this happened I pulled the car over to the side and got out to go see if he was injured.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>BOTTER, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A-N\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">It is undisputed that the insurance adjuster, David Lang, succeeded in the task assigned to him by Banner Casualty Company in the directive of May 12, 1975 to \u201ccontrol\u201d the claimant \u201cif possible.\u201d Lang at first said that \u201cto control the claimant\u201d meant \u201ctrying to control the medical expenses,\u201d but he later admitted that it also meant trying \u201cto keep him out of the hands of an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The accident occurred on March 31, 1975. In conversations with plaintiff or his mother Lang \u201calways asked . .. for medical information.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lang attempted \u201cto control\u201d the claimant \u201cby showing my concern for his well being, and that I wasn\u2019t the enemy .... \u201d Prior to plaintiff\u2019s back operation in October 1976, Lang indicated that he couldn\u2019t do anything about settling the claim until plaintiff completed his medical treatment. Then plaintiff was scheduled to be examined by Dr. Moore on January 5, 1977. Plaintiff was threatening to go to an attorney if his claim was not met after the physical examination took place. In reporting this communication Lang wrote to the carrier, \u201cPlease note that the Statute of Limitations expires on March 31st, 1977. \u201d On February 11, 1977 Lang reported further contact with plaintiff\u2019s mother, who stated that plaintiff was still seeing a doctor for checkups. The report of the physical examination had not been received as yet. Lang stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">We intend to remain in frequent contact with the claimant in order to ascertain his condition and attitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">In my opinion, we have a good chance to see this claim die a natural death after the Statute of Limitations expires. The claimant has indicated previously that he intends to seek the services of an Attorney if he becomes unsatisfied with our claim handling after his physical examination has taken place. <em>I have informed Mrs. Tantum that we have not yet received the Report and therefore we cannot act on it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>If we stay in frequent contact with the claimant we should be able to perceive when the claimant\u2019s patience is exhausted and he will seek the services of an Attorney.. . [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Dr. Moore\u2019s report was forwarded to the carrier in Lang\u2019s letter of February 28, 1977. Dr. Moore reported a permanent injury to plaintiff\u2019s back. Medical expenses exceeded $10,000. On March 21, 1977 Lang reported that the statute of limitations would expire in ten days and he was, therefore, \u201cnot contacting the claimant. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">It is clear that plaintiff had not become so \u201cunsatisfied\u201d with Lang\u2019s \u201chandling\u201d of \u201cthe claim\u201d to make good the threat to go to an attorney. While no promise of a settlement may have been made, as the trial judge found, Lang\u2019s conduct led plaintiff to assume that the claim would be evaluated in good faith toward the possibility of a settlement after the report of his medical examination was sent to the carrier. Instead, Lang was simply using his \u201cfrequent contact\u201d with plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s mother to lull them into the belief that serious negotiations were intended. The process worked. It is inconceivable that plaintiff would not go to a lawyer, as he eventually did, except for the impression created by Lang that real negotiations would commence as soon as his medical status was evaluated. Plaintiff testified that he was told, \u201cI would have to wait until my treatments was through\u201d before there would be settlement negotiations. Lang testified that Mrs. Tantum said they were \u201cin dire financial straits and needed some money.\u201d He said \u201cthey were desperate for money.\u201d Obviously, plaintiff and his mother did not seek the aid of an attorney while they believed negotiations with Lang would be fruitful. But after the statute of limitations had run, Lang no longer had any need to mislead plaintiff. It was then that, according to her testimony, plaintiff\u2019s mother was told \u201cto sue the doctors,\u201d and that the case would not be settled because the statute of limitations had run out. Although he could not clearly recall what he said after the statute had run, Lang \u201cbelieved he talked to her [plaintiff\u2019s mother] about it.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s complaint was filed on July 22, 1977, nearly four months after the statute had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Plaintiff is in his forties and lives with his mother. He is described as having a borderline mentally retarded level of intelligence; he left school in the 6th grade at age 16 because he was \u201cnervous.\u201d He was hospitalized for six weeks after the accident and did not return to work thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In my view, Lang\u2019s conduct should bar defendant from pleading the statute of limitations. Plaintiff\u2019s mother testified that Lang promised to \u201cdo a settlement\u201d after medical treatments were ended. This is consistent with their conduct. Even if Lang did not actually promise a settlement, he surely led plaintiff and his mother to believe that the evaluation of the claim was merely awaiting further medical information. Actually, it was not the medical information that would determine whether an offer of settlement would be made. The likelihood of plaintiff going to an attorney or the likelihood of the statute expiring were key factors. If the lack of liability was the determining factor, the claim could have been rejected long before the period to sue had expired. Instead, Lang reassured plaintiff and his mother that he was interested in plaintiff\u2019s well-being and needed more medical information. This interest abruptly ended when the statute ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The equitable right to relief from the statutory bar should not turn on a technical evaluation of the exact words used by Lang. This was the trial judge\u2019s approach to the case. Rather, I find in the uncontroverted evidence clear proof of unconscionable conduct sufficient to preclude the use of the statute of limitations as a bar to plaintiff\u2019s claim. Lang clearly misled plaintiff as to his intentions, knowing plaintiff was ignorant of the statute of limitations. Having engendered the confidence and trust placed in him by plaintiff and his mother, I have no difficulty in finding that Lang\u2019s failure to warn plaintiff of the consequences of their prolonged negotiations was unconscionable conduct. <em>Howard v. West Jersey and Seashore R.R. Co., </em>102 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>517, 522 (Ch.1928), aff\u2019d 104 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>201 (E. &amp; A.1929); <em>see Bowler v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y., </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>313, 328 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Bowler </em>involved an insurance company\u2019s dealing with its own insured, where the court said the insurer must act with \u201cthe highest burden of good faith,\u201d and had \u201cthe duty to speak and disclose\u201d its liability. 53 <em>N.J. </em>at 327, 328. I would not go so far in this case, where Banner Casualty Company was not dealing with its own insured. But I would not allow Banner to benefit from conduct which lulled plaintiff into inaction. In <em>Howard v. West Jersey and Seashore R.R. Co., supra, </em>the court estopped defendants from interposing the statute of limitations as a defense because plaintiffs\u2019 failure to start suit in time was induced by defendants\u2019 conduct. Therefore, Dr. Howard did not know of the two-year limitation and awaited defendants\u2019 reply to his settlement demand while defendants collected information on Mrs. Howard\u2019s medical condition. All along defendants\u2019 investigator had expressed \u201csympathetic concern\u201d for Mrs. Howard\u2019s injuries, but plaintiffs were under the impression that a settlement could not be reached until the permanency of the injuries was ascertained. Finally, one or two days before the limitation period expired defendants\u2019 claims agent offered $2,500 against a $10,000 demand. After the statute ran plaintiffs were told it was too late to accept the $2,500 offer. In an opinion adopted by the Court of Errors and Appeals, the vice-chancellor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">Also, it should be noted that while the doctrine of <em>estoppel in pais </em>rests upon the ground of fraud, it is not essential that the representations or conduct giving rise to its application should be fraudulent in the strictly legal significance of that term, or with intent to mislead or deceive; the test appears to be whether in all the circumstances of the case conscience and duty of honest dealing should deny one the right to repudiate the consequences of his representations or conduct; whether the author of a proximate cause may justly repudiate its natural and reasonably anticipated effect; fraud, in the sense of a court of equity, properly including all acts, omissions and concealments which involve a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust or confidence, justly reposed, and are injurious to another, or by which an undue and unconscientious advantage is taken of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">If, in these circumstances, the telephone conversation of February 9th or 10th was, as narrated by Dr. Howard, to the effect that Dr. Howard was to submit the offer of Mr. Turnbull to his wife and subsequently apprise Mr. Turnbull of his determination\u2014Mr. Turnbull admittedly knowing that the statutory bar would arise February 11th, and either knowing or having what appears to have been good reason to believe that Dr. Howard was probably ignorant of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>fact\u2014it seems impossible to escape the conclusion that in the circumstances Mr. Turnbull owed to Dr. Howard a duty in connection with that offer to apprise him of the fact that the offer could only be considered open at most two days because of the existence of the statute, since a reply from Dr. Howard within the two days could not have been reasonably anticipated by Mr. Turnbull without some suggestion of that nature; the natural and reasonably anticipated effect of such an offer at that late time, without the suggestion of limitation of time for the proposed reply, was to cause Dr. Howard to subject his claim to the bar of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">But even assuming the telephone conversation to have been as narrated by Mr. Turnbull, I am impressed that in the circumstances already narrated it was unreasonable, unjust, unfair and unconscientious for Mr. Turnbull to delay his promised report from the preceding October until at most two days before the expiration of the statutory period, knowing that Dr. Howard had been awaiting a reply from him during all that time, and then precipitously declare his offer an ultimatum, without at least apprising Dr. Howard of the fact, then admittedly in Mr. Turnbull\u2019s mind, that only two days remained for suit. The effect of his conduct was to subject complainants\u2019 claim to the bar of the statute, and that effect, in the circumstances stated, appears to have been the natural and probable effect reasonably within the contemplation of Mr. Turnbull.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">While it cannot be said to be ordinarily any part of duty to apprise an adversary of his rights, it must be recognized that one cannot justly or equitably lull his adversary into a false sense of security and thereby cause his adversary to subject his claim to the bar of the statute and then be permitted to plead the very delay caused by his course of conduct as a defense to the action when brought. [102 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 521-523; citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We ought not allow the \u201csporting contest\u201d view of the adversary process to reward practices designed to mislead members of the public into withholding legal action until it is too late to do so. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2, which provides that the use of any \u201cdeception\u201d or the \u201cconcealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission\u201d in connection with the sale of any merchandise is an \u201cunlawful practice.\u201d I would apply a similar standard in judging the conduct of an insurance adjuster for the purpose of determining an equitable bar to the plea of the statute of limitations. <em>See Tevis </em>v. <em>Tevis, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>422, 433 (1979), where the court found no reliance upon \u201cany misleading or deceitful misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The evidence in <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Friendly Ice Cream Co., </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333 (App.Div.1975), may have presented a stronger case than the case at hand. But the <em>Friedman </em>case does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>establish the only basis for equitable estoppel. Although to some extent I differ with the trial court\u2019s evaluation of the evidence in this case, I base my conclusion on what I perceive to be essentially uncontroverted evidence, accepting the trial judge\u2019s finding on the one serious factual dispute as to whether Lang ever promised the Tantums a settlement. In my view such a promise would strengthen plaintiff\u2019s case, but it is not a <em>sine qua non </em>to equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment below and reinstate plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\"> Lang testified that in response to Mrs. Tantum\u2019s requests for \u201cadvance payments\u201d he replied that there were \u201cno advance payments to be made,\u201d that \u201cwe did not admit liability,\u201d that \u201cI never <em>actually </em>mentioned settlement with her,\" and that, \u201cOh, yes, I <em>always </em>asked her for medical information.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
