Gennaro, </em>Deputy Attorney General, argued the cause for the respondent <em>(Irwin I.

The jury acquitted him of murder but convicted him of unlawful possession of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">On March 30, 1980 defendant, the victim and others were in an apartment building in Paterson. After someone suggested they cook potatoes, an argument occurred during which witnesses heard a click and saw a knife in defendant\u2019s hands. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>victim obtained a stick and engaged in a fight with defendant; the victim was stabbed 11 times by defendant, causing the victim\u2019s death. The knife was never clearly described by witnesses and it was not introduced into evidence at trial. There was some testimony that the knife used by defendant may have been on his person so that he could use it to peel potatoes for \u201cthe wine and potato party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Defendant argues the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, contending that by its verdict the jury found him not guilty of murder because he acted in self-defense; that a weapon used in self-defense is lawfully used and if lawfully used it was lawfully possessed, and since the knife had uses other than illegal ones, he could not be convicted of a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(d) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">d. Other weapons. Any person who knowingly has in his possession any other weapon under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as it may have is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The contention is without merit. A lawful use of a weapon does not necessarily legitimate its prior possession. The statute\u2019s proscription is against possession, not use. The issue is not whether a weapon could be lawfully used, but whether the circumstances surrounding the possession were manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The knife was not described or produced, but from the testimony of a \u201cclick\u201d the jury could have inferred the knife was of the switchblade type and not likely to be possessed to be used to peel potatoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The jury\u2019s verdict was well supported by the evidence and the trial judge\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the contention the verdict was against the weight of the evidence was not error. <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 591 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Defendant next attacks <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(d) as \u201cunconstitutional because it shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.\u201d Defendant argues the statute \u201cpermits the State to rely on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>conclusive presumption of implied use as a weapon merely by proving possession was under inappropriate circumstances.\u201d We disagree. The language of presumption is not contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(d) nor does \u201cimplied use\u201d have anything to do with the statute. The burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the circumstances in which defendant possessed the weapon were not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as the weapon might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Defendant was neither charged, tried nor convicted of a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-3(e) which makes possession of a switchblade knife \u201cwithout any explainable lawful purpose\u201d a crime. Whatever presumption may flow from that statute, <em>State v. Dunlap, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>71 (Law Div. 1981), is not contained within the statute presently under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Finally, defendant contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(d) is \u201cunconstitutionally vague and/or overbroad.\u201d The jury could find from the evidence that defendant possessed a switchblade knife. The defendant could not have been misled by any expression of law that the possession of a switchblade knife generally could be lawful. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-3(e) makes possession of a switchblade knife \u201cwithout any explainable lawful purpose\u201d a crime. See, also, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-l(r) which defines \u201cweapon\u201d to include a switchblade knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Statutes are not examined in the abstract without reference to conduct in assessing their constitutionality. <em>State v. Norflett, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>268, 284-285 (1975). We hold this statute is not unconstitutionally vague. It gives sufficient notice that the conduct charged is criminal. <em>State in the Interest of T.E.T., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 330 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Nor can the argument directed at over breath aid defendant. He claims the statute is overbroad because many items may have lawful as well as unlawful uses. As a possessor of a switchblade knife defendant cannot be said to have standing to challenge the statute because it may adversely affect other persons whose possession of weapons may be lawful. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>Moretti, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>182, 192 (1968), <em>cert. </em>den. 393 <em>U.S. </em>952, 8 <em>S.Ct. </em>376, 21 L.Ed.2d 363 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In any event, we are of the view that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(d) is not overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
