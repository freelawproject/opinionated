In lieu of granting plaintiff leave to appeal, the Supreme Court vacated part n of our prior opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and directed us to consider \u201cwhether the trial court erred in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion in limine on the ground that defendant was permitted to present evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of a \"Type B\u2019 cleanup despite the [Michigan Department of Natural Resources\u2019] \u2018approval\u2019 of the \u2018Type A\u2019 cleanup.\u201d 463 Mich 893 (2000). We conclude that had the dnr approved the Type A cleanup of the site, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion in limine would not have been in error. Further, because the issue whether the dnr had approved the Type A cleanup was contested below, we conclude that the trial court did not err in permitting evidence of the disputed cost-effectiveness of the cleanup to be considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The underlying facts of this case were set forth in our prior opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">In 1968, defendant Roger W. Blanchard and others purchased some vacant property located in Roseville, Michigan. Facilities constructed on the property by a predecessor company to defendant ACR Industries, Inc., (hereinafter ACR) were used by ACR and its predecessor from 1968 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>until 1988. Both ACR and its predecessor manufactured aerospace equipment at these facilities. In 1968, ACR\u2019s predecessor placed a three thousand-gallon underground storage tank on the property. Petroleum products used by ACR during the manufacturing process were routinely dumped into the tank. ACR continued to use the tank until ACR moved from the property in 1988.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">In 1987, Paul Carollo, a founder of plaintiff corporation, purchased the property from defendants Robert and Mary Kazmarek, and Blanchard. The property was then leased to plaintiff. In 1991, plaintiff began the process of removing the storage tank. In July of that year, plaintiff confirmed that there had been a release of hazardous substances from the tank. At the time, administrative rules promulatged by the [dnr] under the then-current version of the Michigan Environmental Response Act (MERA), MCL 299.601 <em>et </em>seq.; MSA 13.32(1) <em>et seq., </em>identified three distinct types of cleanup that could be done on a site contaminated by the discharge of hazardous substances. These cleanup types were labeled \u201cType A,\u201d \u201cType B,\u201d and \u201cType C.\u201d. . . Plaintiff chose to remediate the site using a Tfype A cleanup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">In January 1993, plaintiff brought suit against defendants under the mera. Plaintiff alleged that ACR was liable for approximately $1.5 million in response activity costs incurred in cleaning up contamination of the property caused by the leaking of hazardous substances from the storage tank. ... At trial, the parties hotly contested whether a Type A or Type B cleanup should have been used to remediate the site and whether the issue of cost should enter into any examination of the appropriate type of cleanup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">A jury found that although defendants were liable, plaintiff failed to establish that any response activity costs in excess of $990,000 were necessary. Given that plaintiff had already been reimbursed $990,000 by the state pursuant to the then-current version of the Michigan Underground Storage Tank Financial Assurance Act (mustfa), MCL 299.801 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 13.29(201) <em>et seq., </em>plaintiff took nothing on its claim.!<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The mera was repealed by the Legislature effective March 30, 1995. 1994 PA 451. The mera\u2019s provisions were recodified as Part 201 (Environmental Response), MCL 324.20101 <em>et seq., </em>of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (nrepa), MCL 324.101 <em>et seq. </em>Pursuant to MCL 324.102, repeal of the MERA \u201cdoes not relinquish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability, whether criminal or civil in nature, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force as necessary for the purpose of instituting or sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture, or liability.\u201d Further, while Part 201 of the nrepa was amended twice in 1995, 1995 PA 71 and 1995 PA 117, those amendments do not apply to the case at hand, given that it was initiated before May 1, 1995. MCL 324.20102a(1)(a). Accordingly, all statutory references in this opinion will be to the prior provisions and compiled law numbers in effect during the relevant portions of the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Plaintiffs motion in limine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> asked the trial court to strike defendants\u2019 first and second defenses and to foreclose defendants from presenting any evidence on their claim that the Type A cleanup was excessive. Defendants\u2019 first affirmative defense stated that \u201c[plaintiffs claims are barred for the reason that its costs associated with its alleged corrective response and/or remediation activities incurred are excessive, unnecessary and were not reasonable when paid.\u201d Defendants\u2019 second affirmative defense stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>[p]laintiff\u2019s claims for reimbursement for costs associated with its alleged corrective, response and/or remediation activity incurred were not necessary response costs as any cleanup activity was not consistent with or required by or, alternatively, went beyond what was required by the state or federal statutes, regulations and guidelines regulating the section and/or implementation of response and/or remediation activity[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">The trial court denied plaintiffs motion. Citing the legislative history of the 1990 amendment of the mera,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court drew the following conclusions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">Considering the purpose of the statute and rule, it would be consistent to require a private party to consider the relative criteria applicable to the dnr when selecting remedial alternatives. To allow a private party to select a type of remedy which does not offer any greater protection for the environment but is much more costly than other altema-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tives is not consistent with the intent of the legislature to control the cost of cleanup to encourage development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The criteria found in rule 603(1)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] should apply when a private party selects the type of cleanup. The rules require consideration of the cost of cleanup when choosing among alternatives which adequately protect the environment. 1990 AACS 299.5601(3).[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] Since the DNR has determined that type A and Type B remedies equally protect the environment, the rule should be construed to require consideration of cost. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Directly addressing the issue of possible approval of plaintiffs plan by the dnr, the trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">The DNR\u2019s approval of the type A plan does not preclude subsequent challenges of the selection. Plaintiff has failed to cite any authority to support a claim that potentially responsible parties (prps) can not challenge the agency\u2019s decisions. Defendants were not parties to the decision making process at the agency level. There is evidence the dnr questioned whether this cleanup was excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We do not read the first line of the immediately preceding passage as rendering a judicial finding that the DNR had approved the Type A cleanup of the site. Instead, we read the court as having responded to\u2014 without endorsing \u2014 the possibility that the DNR had approved the remedial action. In other words, we read the court as saying that <em>even if </em>the dnr had approved the Type A cleanup, defendants would not be precluded from making the disputed arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Plaintiff argued in support of its motion in limine that the dnr had \u201cexpressly approved\u201d the Type A cleanup. Defendants disputed this assertion, arguing in their brief in opposition to the motion that they believed \u201cthat the trial testimony will show that the only reason Plaintiffs [sic] sought a \u2018Type A\u2019 clean-up was because Plaintiff assumed, erroneously, that the Michigan Department of Natural Resources . . . would insist on a \u2018Type A.\u2019 \u201d In support of its assertion, plaintiff cited a November 15, 1994, letter sent to it by the dnr, in which the dnr concurred in the conclusion \u201cthat the response activities undertaken at this facility have reduced contamination to concentrations below acceptable type A cleanup levels.\u201d We do not read this conclusion as necessarily implying dnr approval of the Type A cleanup. Rather, it can reasonably be read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>as assuming the existence of the Type A action and simply stating that the contamination levels specified for such a level of cleanup have been met. Thus, it does not necessarily imply either a pre- or post-cleanup approval of plaintiff\u2019s choice of remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\">Further, we note that the factual question whether the dnr had approved plaintiff\u2019s remedial action was contested during the presentation of proofs. See discussion in part m, <em>infra. </em>It would make no sense for the trial court to make a specific finding regarding the question and then proceed to allow the parties to present proofs with regard to the matter if the trial court had resolved this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">As this Court observed in <em>Flanders Industries, Inc v Michigan, </em>203 Mich App 15, 22; 512 NW2d 328 (1993), the mera, as amended,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cmust be interpreted to minimize delay in removing environmental contamination.\u201d This point was echoed in <em>Port Huron v Amoco Oil Co, Inc, </em>229 Mich App 616; 583 NW2d 215 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">[T]he legislative history indicates that the mera was amended, in part, \u201cto expedite cleanup of sites of contamination by providing the DNR with enforcement tools necessary to compel compliance with the act and by providing for penalties and positive incentives to encourage polluters to pay for, and promptly implement, cleanup.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 632.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">See also 1990 AACS, R 299.5501(1) (\u201cThe principal objective of all response activities is to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>prompt and adequate response to known sites of environmental contamination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The goal of facilitating and expediting cleanup of contaminated sites is farthered by the mera\u2019s limitation of preenforcement judicial review. See <em>Pitsch v ESE Michigan, Inc, </em>233 Mich App 578, 590; 593 NW2d 565 (1999). MCL 299.616(4) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">A state court shall not have jurisdiction to review challenges to a response activity selected or approved by the department under this act, or to review an administrative order issued under this act in any action except an action that is 1 of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">(a) An action to recover response costs, damages, or for contribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">(b) An action by the state to enforce an administrative order under this act or by any other person under section 15(l)(b) to enforce an administrative order or to recover a fine for violation of an order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">(c) An action pursuant to section 10f(5) for review of a decision by the department denying or limiting reimbursement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">(d) An action pursuant to section 15 challenging a response activity selected or approved by the department, if such action is filed after the completion of the response activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">(e) An action by the state pursuant to section 12(6) to compel response activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">While this statute limits the available avenues for challenging response activity, it plainly states that a challenge can be made to response activity that has been approved by the dnr as long as it is raised in the context of the identified actions. Defendants\u2019 challenge to the response activity employed, which came after and in response to plaintiff\u2019s complaint seeking contribution for costs incurred, falls within these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>parameters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> MCL 299.616(4)(a). Further, we believe that implicit in the statute is the understanding that remedial action would not be delayed if a challenge is raised in a contribution action, where the question of liability is the central issue. Delaying remedial action until the liability question was settled would effectively undermine the goal of facilitating and expediting cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Given the conclusion that challenges can be raised in court to a remedial action \u201capproved\u201d by the dnr, the question then becomes whether the challenges a party may bring against an approved remedial action include a challenge to its cost-effectiveness. We believe that the issue of cost-effectiveness is properly raised in an action such as the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u201c[T]o recover its cleanup costs from a party responsible for the pollution, a private party must show that its \u2018response activity\u2019 costs were (1) \u2018necessary\u2019 and were incurred (2) \u2018consistent with [the mdnr rules].\u2019 \u201d <em>Port Huron, supra </em>at 625. The <em>Port Huron </em>Court \u201cconstraefd] the phrase \u2018necessary costs of response activity\u2019 to mean those response activity costs that are \u2018required\u2019 in remediating a contaminated site to protect the public health, safety, or welfare, or the environment, or the natural resources.\u201d <em>Port Huron, supra </em>at 629. Necessary or required costs include remedial action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">However, while remedial action is required, the rules do not require that every contaminated site be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>cleaned to the high degree that a Type A cleanup requires. When this remediation was undertaken, the rules identified three types of cleanup: Type A, Type B, and Type C. 1990 AACS, R 299.5703.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The rules clearly stated that all three degrees of cleanup were considered viable options. See, e.g., 1990 AACS, R 299.5705(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In fact, the rules even stated that a \u201ccombination of types may be used at a single site to develop an acceptable remedial action.\u201d 1990 AACS, R 299.5705(3). Rosemary Ayers, the dnr staff member first assigned to evaluate plaintiff\u2019s plans to remediate the site, specifically testified that despite her personal predilections, a Type A cleanup \u201cwasn\u2019t necessary\u201d for plaintiffs site. If she had been asked by plaintiff, Ayers stated she would have permitted a Type B cleanup of the site. This conclusion was supported by the testimony of Steven Kitler, the dnr employee who assumed Ayers duties vis-a-vis plaintiff in early 1992. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Kitler testified that, given the conditions that existed, a T^ype B cleanup would have been available for the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The issue of consistency with the rules is also a proper area of inquiry in a cost recovery action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The rules clearly indicate that the cost of a remedial action must be considered. In 1990 AACS, R 299.5601(3), using language that does not specify an actor and thus is applicable to any party selecting a remedial action, the rules state that the \u201ccost of a remedial action shall be a factor only in choosing among alternatives which adequately protect the public health, safety, welfare and the environment and natural resources, consistent with part 7 of these rules.\u201d This passage carefully balances the goal of adequately remediating a contaminated site with the goal of minimizing the cost of remediation. The rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>indicates that whatever remedial action is chosen, it must \u201cprotect the public health, safety, welfare and the natural environment and natural resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">This directive, however, is tempered by the adverb \u201cadequately\u201d and the citation of \u201cpart 7 of these rules.\u201d Part 7 of the rules, entitled \u201cCleanup Criteria,\u201d sets forth both the three degrees of cleanup acceptable and the concentration criteria that satisfy the different degrees of cleanup in the various environmental media identified. This scheme recognizes that under appropriate conditions, each degree of cleanup is protective of the public health, safety, welfare, and the natural environment and natural resources. If there were only one level of cleanup, one level of concentration criteria that protected the public health, safety, welfare, and the natural environment and natural resources, then the modifier \u201cadequately\u201d would be superfluous. However, the rules do not establish such a singular universe of protection. Instead, the universe of protection includes various degrees of cleanup, each of which is subdivided according to various spans of acceptable concentrations in differing environmental media. Thus, as used here, the term \u201cadequate\u201d means reaching sufficient levels of concentration within a sufficient degree of cleanup under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Balanced against this aim to remediate adequately is the goal of keeping an eye on the cost of remediation. The first half of the rule plainly mandates that the \u201ccost of a remedial action <em>shall </em>be a factor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term \u201conly\u201d does not diminish the concern over minimizing cost. Rather, it indicates that the concern over cost should not overwhelm the goal of adequately remediating the contaminated site. In other words, if two alternative actions are pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>posed, one of which does adequately protect the public health, safety, welfare, and the natural environment and natural resources and one of which does not, the party choosing the action to implement cannot argue that the latter should be chosen because it costs less. However, if both alternatives adequately protect the public health, safety, welfare, and the natural environment and natural resources, then the party choosing must consider the cost of the alternatives when selecting a remedial action. For example, if in given circumstances, both a Type A and a Type B cleanup would be adequate from a remediation perspective, then the party choosing the degree of cleanup must consider the cost of remedial action when making the selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Contrary to the position taken by plaintiff throughout the course of the litigation, the instruction that the \u201cremedial action type proposed shall be at the option of the person proposing the remedial action,\u201d 1990 AACS, R 299.5705(4) does not give the proposing party a free hand in choosing a remedial action. The recognition that the party proposing the type of remedial action has the option or the authority to choose the type to be proposed does not release that party from the directive to consider cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The rules also specify a number of factors the dnr must consider when \u201cassessing remedial action alternatives.\u201d 1990 AACS, R 299.5603(1). We believe the use of the term \u201cassessing\u201d means that this directive applies when the dnr is selecting or approving a remedial action. If the drafters of the rules had meant that the listed factors should be considered only when the dnr was in one, but not the other, of these two postures, then it could have simply stated so by using \u201cselecting\u201d or \u201capproving\u201d in place of \u201cassess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ing.\u201d We interpret the decision not to use these words as purposeful. The act of assessing or evaluating remedial action alternatives is undertaken by the dnr in both situations and should accordingly include evaluation of the factors listed. Among these factors are the \u201c[c]osts of remedial action, including long-term maintenance costs . . . .\u201d 1990 AACS, R 299.5603(1)(f). The caveat in Rule 299.5603(l)(f) \u201cthat costs shall only be considered as specified in R 299.5601(3)\u201d is simply a reaffirmation of the principle expressed in Rule 299.5601(3) that the alternatives involved must \u201cadequately protect the public health, safety, welfare and the environment and natural resources . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">1990 AACS, R 299.5705(4) does remove the dnr\u2019s discretion regarding approval, but only under the limited circumstance where the proposed \u201cremedial action plan . . . provides for a remedy which meets <em>the applicable criteria set forth in this part and parts 5 and 6 of these rules. </em>Approval shall be granted for type A, type B, or type C plans, or for plans which involve a combination of types, <em>if all applicable requirements are </em>satisfied.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Included among these \u201ccriteria\u201d and \u201crequirements\u201d is consideration of the cost of the proposed remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Accordingly, if the dnr had approved plaintiffs selection of the Type A cleanup, then the trial court would not have been in error to allow evidence regarding the issue of the cost-effectiveness of that choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In this case, however, the issue whether the dnr had actually approved the Type A cleanup before its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>was undertaken by plaintiff was contested at trial. In its application for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court, plaintiff states flatly that \u201cthe [DNR] directed RCO to perform a Type A closure.\u201d A review of the record shows that the matter is not as indisputable as plaintiff\u2019s assertion indicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Rosemary Ayers was the DNR staff member first assigned to evaluate plaintiff\u2019s plans to remediate the site. When asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel who made the decisions in 1991 concerning whether to pursue a Type A or Type B cleanup, Ayers responded, \u201cGenerally I \u2014 I emphasize generally, I would look for Type A. The only times when you look for a Type B is when you could not, through some reason get to a Type A clean up.\u201d Ayers also indicated that in making these decisions, she was carrying out department policy. Ayers noted that in 1991 her office was overseeing Type B cleanups, as well. Unable to recall specifically the circumstances involved in these Type B cleanups, Ayers stated that generally they occurred in an industrial area where, for example, the site\u2019s \u201cneighbors are also suffering from an underground storage tank contamination, a leak, and where it really cannot be determined the extent of contamination at that point, nor where it begins or ends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">As for the site involved in the case at hand, Ayers stated she had only a \u201cvague recollection\u201d of it. Ayers testified that she could not \u201crecall any specific conversation regarding\u201d discussions with plaintiff concerning whether to pursue a Type A or Type B cleanup. When asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel what, if any, general recollection she had on the matter, Ayers answered, \u201cAs to that topic and generally I would have sites go to Type A, go to clean.\u201d When asked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>explain why she did this, Ayers responded, \u201cBecause of the time involved for the review for Type B closures. As I mentioned before, . . . you have to document why you believe it should go to Type B. It then has to be reviewed by superiors and geologists . . . .\u201d However, when asked by defense counsel if she would have refused to allow plaintiff to pursue a Type B cleanup if plaintiff had approached her saying that it could save $500,000 in so doing, Ayers stated that she would not have refused the request, even though she personally preferred Type A cleanups.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Elmer Drew, a coiporate engineer working for plaintiff at the time of the cleanup, testified that he was the \u201ccontact person\u201d between plaintiff and the dnr. According to Drew, while there were some discussions with the dnr about different types of cleanups, the DNR was pushing the Type A cleanup. Specifically, Drew testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">there was some discussion, A and B, but that\u2019s all it was. Does A, B, and C exist? You could get people to say it was, but if you talked to the dnr, the only thing they\u2019d talk to you about is Type A \u2014 and I think that dnr rep said that when she was here \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what we got.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Later on, when plaintiff was nearing the end of the cleanup, Drew stated the dnr\u2019s advocacy of a Type A cleanup began to change:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">When we were near the end of the cleanup, we were chasing high metals in two areas .... And at that time I talked to Ms. Ayers [sic] because it looked like it was going to violate tire foundation of the ACR building ... in which case I would be very concerned to start excavating up in that area. And at that one point she told me to go as far as I could and if it didn\u2019t clean up, to talk with her because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>were beginning to change their views on such things. It did clean up, so I never had a subsequent conversation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">However, when directly asked by plaintiffs counsel if Ayers ever told him that plaintiff \u201chad to do a Type A,\u201d Drew did not say that she had done so. Instead, Drew answered the question this way: \u201cThat was all that was discussed. That was the only discussion, as far as she was concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Kitler testified he first became aware of the site when he was asked to review the project by Consolidated Risk Management, the mustfa administrator at the time. Kitler testified that his review of plaintiffs file showed that none of the work done on the site had been approved by the DNR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\"><em>Defense Counsel: </em>Was there any indication in the file that either Rosemary Ayers or anyone on behalf of the dnr approved the initial excavation activities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\"><em>Witness: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\"><em>Defense Counsel: </em>Was there any indication in the file that the dnr, Rosemary Ayers, or anyone on behalf of the dnr approved the corrective action work plan or any of the subsequent excavation that was done at the site?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\"><em>Witness: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Kitler documented his concerns with the site remediation in a letter dated January 29, 1993,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which was addressed to Drew:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">The following is a list of departmental comments concerning corrective actions that have occurred at this facility:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>1.

Excavation was conducted at this facility without full knowledge of the nature and extent of contamination. This resulted in repeated contaminant migration back into the excavation. Much of this recontaminated material . . . required hazardous waste disposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">4. Areas with no prior indication of contamination and areas with contaminant concentrations well below Type B levels were excavated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">Ms * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">6. Contaminant free areas in the excavation were repeatedly excavated and re-sampled when a portion of the excavation was enlarged or rainwater was removed. This has resulted in some apparently clean areas being excavated and sampled two or three times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The January 29 letter also criticized the lack of a feasibility study and what Kitler characterized as excessive verification sampling.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Kitler testified that the lack of knowledge identified in item no. 3 could have led to increased costs. As for item no. 4, Kitler testified that he was expressing his concern that there were areas in the site \u201cthat . . . didn\u2019t appear to be contaminated above Type B levels, that were excavated; or, in fact, there were areas that I didn\u2019t believe were contaminated, with available information, that were excavated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Kitler also wrote in the January 29 letter about areas of concern with the investigation work plan noted by Ayers in a letter dated November 18, 1991.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201cThe site investigation work plan prepared for this facility was denied by our department November 18, 1991. Deficiencies listed in the letter were never addressed and activities were initiated without the approval of our department,\u201d Kitler wrote. Kitler did, however, acknowledge that the word \u201cdenied\u201d does not appear in the November 18 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Kitler further testified that in his opinion, plaintiff did not need to pursue a Type A cleanup of the site. Kitler stated that Type B cleanups were being allowed by his office at that time, and it was his belief that plaintiff would have been allowed to pursue a Type B cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">This evidence shows that the issue whether the Type A cleanup had been officially approved by the dnr was hotly contested by the parties at trial. Under these circumstances, we do not believe that the trial court erred in allowing evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of the cleanup.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\"> <em>RCO Engineering, Inc v ACR Industries, Inc, </em>235 Mich App 48; 597 NW2d 534 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> <em>RCO, supra </em>at 51-53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> Plaintiff\u2019s motion in limine was first presented as motion for partial summary disposition.

See, e.g., MCL 299.616(4) (\u201cA state court shall not have jurisdiction to review challenges to response activity <em>selected or approved </em>by the department under this act ... in any action except an action that is 1 of the following . . . .\u201d). (Emphasis added.) The act of selection involves the choice of alternatives, and thus implies a degree of action and involvement beyond that of mere approval or confirmation of a choice made by another. In other words, the party proposing a single remedial action alternative is the party who has selected the action, while the party approving the action is only ratifying a selection previously made by another. While plaintiff argues that Ayers was practically insistent that plaintiff clean the site to the fype A level, plaintiff nonetheless consistently argues that the dnr approved the remedial action. This posture is reflected in the question our Supreme Court has directed us to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In terms of judicial review, this distinction affects the scope of judicial review. For example, MCL 299.616(5) states: \u201cIn considering objections raised in a judicial action under this act, the court shall uphold <em>the state\u2019s decision in selecting </em>a response activity unless the objecting party can demonstrate based on the administrative record that the decision was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This standard of review applies when the action challenged is the state\u2019s selection of a remedial action, but would not apply to the state\u2019s approval of a remedial action proposed by another party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b578-13\"> Although the January 29 letter was signed by someone other than Kitler, Kitler testified that he indeed had written the document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b579-12\"> As with the January 29 letter, the November 18 letter was signed by someone other than Ayers, who had actually composed the document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> Further, we believe that the jury\u2019s verdict can be reasonably read as having rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument that the Type A cleanup had been approved. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel vigorously argued in his closing statement that the evidence established that the Type A cleanup had been approved. Several times during his closing, counsel stated that Ayers had approved the Type A cleanup. Indeed, counsel even stated that Ayers had actually told plaintiff to do a Type A cleanup. Defense counsel argued in his closing that no such approval or command had been issued. Given the jury\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff had not incurred costs in excess of $990,000 that were both necessary and consistent with the rules, one reasonable conclusion that could be drawn is that the jury rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that it had proved that the type A cleanup was approved. Of course, it is also reasonable to conclude that the jury could have found that the Type A cleanup had been approved, but that plaintiff had not shown that all the costs associated with achieving this level of clean were necessary and consistent. Given the verdict form, however, this is a question we cannot, should not, and need not attempt to resolve.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
