CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Plaintiff-appellant Josif Kovaco (\u201cKova-co\u201d) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Warren W. Eginton, Judge) in part granting summary judgment to his former employer, defendant-appellee Rockbestos-Surprenant Corporation (\u201cRockbestos\u201d), on his claims of hostile work environment and discriminatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In his amended complaint, Kovaco alleged that he had been harassed at work and that his employment was terminated by Rockbestos based on his disability, Romanian national origin, and age, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>(the \u201cADA\u201d), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>(the \u201cADEA\u201d), and the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46a-60 (\u201cCFE-PA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">On September 25, 2013, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Rockbestos.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court held that Kovaco could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge under the ADA, Title VII, the ADEA, and CFEPA, because he was estopped from asserting that he was qualified for his position as a maintenance mechanic at the time his employment was terminated, due to certain factual representations he had made to the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) in successfully obtaining Social Security Disability Insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) benefits. The District Court did not address Kovaco\u2019s purported hostile-work-environment claims, which on appeal Rock-bestos contends Kovaco never pleaded, and the District Court denied summary judgment with respect to Kovaco\u2019s remaining claims, which were later unsuccessfully tried to a jury. Following the trial, Kovaco filed the instant appeal, challenging the District Court\u2019s September 2013 decision granting partial summary judgment to Rockbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">On appeal, Kovaco argues that the District Court erred when it (1) misapplied controlling case law in holding that, due to his representations to the SSA and the SSA\u2019s disability determination, he could not prove he was qualified for his position as of March 29, 2010, the date when his employment was terminated; and (2) overlooked Kovaco\u2019s hostile-work-environment claims in its decision granting partial summary judgment to Rockbestos, claims that do not turn on Kovaco\u2019s qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">As a threshold matter, we hold that we lack appellate jurisdiction to review so much of the District Court\u2019s judgment as involves Kovaco\u2019s CFEPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">With respect to Kovaco\u2019s discriminatory-discharge claims brought under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA, we conclude that, although the District Court\u2019s explanation of why Kovaco was judicially estopped from asserting that he was qualified for his position was erroneous, the decision was nevertheless correct because Kovaco failed to proffer a sufficient explanation in light of the record why his assertion that he was qualified for his position was consistent with his earlier sworn statement to the SSA that he was \u201cunable to work.\u201d As a result, we agree with the District Court that Kovaco failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge on summary judgment under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">Finally, we hold that to the extent Kova-co pleaded hostile-work-environment claims in his amended complaint, he subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>quently abandoned those claims in opposing Rockbestos\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the District Court by failing to address them in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court in its entirety, except that we DISMISS for want of appellate jurisdiction plaintiffs appeal of so much of the judgment as related to his .CFEPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Rockbestos hired Kovaco in April 2005 to work as a maintenance mechanic at its East Granby, Connecticut, manufacturing facility. As a maintenance mechanic, Kova-co was responsible for maintenance and repair of Rockbestos\u2019s machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Kovaco contends that, beginning in 2008, he was subjected to discrimination at Rockbestos on the basis of his Romanian national origin. Sometime in or around the summer of 2008, Kovaco was transferred to a new shift. Shortly after he switched shifts, several of his new coworkers began making derogatory comments about his having been born in Romania. For instance, several coworkers called him names, such as \u201cRomanian Gypsy\u201d or \u201cthird-world countryman,\u201d and made remarks like \u201cgo back to Romania.\u201d One coworker also drew derogatory pictures of Kovaco with exaggerated features, one of which was labeled \u201cold shit man.\u201d Kovaco testified that he complained to management, but to no avail. Rockbestos declined to investigate his complaints and refused to discipline the accused employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In early December 2009, Kovaco sought treatment for a deteriorating medical condition in his legs and feet and provided his supervisor, Greg Miller, with a note from his doctor recommending certain light-duty restrictions. Later the same day, Ko-vaco met with Miller and human resources as well as his shift supervisor to discuss a potential accommodation consistent with the recommendations of Kovaco\u2019s doctor. Kovaco suggested during the meeting that he would be able to perform his job functions if he had access to an electric cart as needed. Even before Kovaco notified Rock-bestos of his-medical condition, Rockbestos had provided Kovaco and members of the Maintenance Department with five electric carts and a forklift, along' with keys to each, to facilitate their navigation of the 500,000 square feet' of workspace that comprised the four-building plant. Miller and the others confirmed that Kovaco would have access to one of the electric carts as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Kovaco continued to experience medical problems and took leave in January 2010 under the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). Upon his return the next month, he provided a new doctor\u2019s note to Miller that again recommended light-duty restrictions. Kovaco testified that Miller threw the note on the ground and stated, \u201cI don\u2019t need one other handicap in my shop.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kovaco remained on light duty and continued to use an.electric cart as necessary until his termination in March 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">During the night shift on March 19 and 20, 2010, Kovaco had trouble locating an electric cart to use. Earlier in the day, Miller had been advised that one of the carts had a defective battery that was unable to hold a charge, and he therefore directed a member of his maintenance staff to place an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) \u201clock out\u201d tag on the cart and move it to the boiler room. When Kovaco learned that a cart was in the boiler room, he entered the locked boiler room, examined the cart, and decided that the cart was functional. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>then removed the OSHA \u201clock out\u201d tag so that he could use the cart for the remainder of his shift. The cart\u2019s battery subsequently died, and Kovaco abandoned the cart before concluding his shift. When Miller questioned Kovaco on the morning of March 20, Kovaco denied having taken the cart. On March 23, 2010, Kovaco confessed that he had taken the cart, and Rockbestos suspended him pending further investigation, until March 29, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On March 25, 2010, while he was serving his suspension, Kovaco filed an application with SSA for SSDI benefits. In his SSA application, Kovaco indicated that he had rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative arthritis, and bone spurs in both feet; soft tissue in both ankles; and severe gout. He represented that each day at Rockbestos he had spent 7.5 hours per day walking, .5 hours per day sitting, and 1 hour per day climbing; and that he had to lift and carry tools weighing about 40 pounds and as heavy as 120 pounds. He indicated that he had \u201cstopped working\u201d on March 24, 2010 \u201c[bjecause of [his] conditions\u201d and that he \u201cbecame unable to work.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also stated that he felt that he \u201cwas discriminated against because [he] couldn\u2019t do [his] job well.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">On March 29, 2010, Rockbestos management met with Kovaco and a union representative to discuss the incident involving the cart, after which Rockbestos informed Kovaco that his employment would be terminated due to his violation of company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In June 2010, SSA determined that Ko-vaco had been \u201cdisabled\u201d under the Social Security Act beginning March 24, 2010, five days before his employment was terminated by Rockbestos. In its \u201cDisability Determination Explanation,\u201d the SSA discussed Kovaco\u2019s medical conditions and stated, among other findings and conclusions, that \u201c[p]hysical limitations prevent [Kovaco] from performing his past relevant work,\u201d including that he \u201chas a severe impairment[ ] that limits him[ ] to no more than sedentary work,\u201d and that he can \u201coccasionally\u201d lift or carry no more than twenty pounds of weight at a time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Kovaco filed the instant action against Rockbestos in March 2011 and filed a nine-count amended complaint in June 2011, setting forth several claims ranging from federal employment discrimination to state-law conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The District Court granted partial summary judgment to Rockbestos on September 25, 2013. Specifically, the District Court granted summary judgment to Rockbestos on Kovaco\u2019s discriminatory-discharge claims, brought under the ADA, Title VII, the ADEA, and CFEPA; FMLA claims; and a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The District Court denied summary judgment on the retaliation claims, brought under the ADA, Title VII, the ADEA, and CFEPA; the failure-to-accommodate claims, brought under the ADA and CFEPA; and the theft claims. Rockbestos ultimately prevailed on these remaining claims at trial. Following the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment for Rockbestos on May 29, 2015, Kovaco filed the instant appeal, challenging the District Court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to Rockbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">I. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">As a threshold matter, we must consider whether we have appellate juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>diction to review certain of the challenges set forth in Kovaco\u2019s appellate brief. Rock-bestos contends that Kovaco failed to include his hostile-work-environment claims and his CFEPA claim in the notice of appeal, and that we consequently lack appellate jurisdiction to review his challenges regarding these claims. In sum, we hold that we have appellate jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s decision with respect to the hostile-work-environment claims, but not the CFEPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Under Rule 3(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which is \u201cjurisdictional in nature,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> an appellant\u2019s \u201cnotice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This standard is not exacting. Notices of appeal are to be \u201cconstrue[d] ... liberally, taking the parties\u2019 intentions into account.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201cour appellate jurisdiction \u2018depends on whether the intent to appeal from a decision is clear on the face of, or can be inferred from, the notice[ ] of appeal.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Kovaco\u2019s notice of appeal read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">Kovaco ... hereby appeals ... from an Order granting Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs claims of discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act[,] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[,] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act[,] 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621-634, as well as his claims for back pay and front pay,.... [which] was entered in this action on the 25th day of September, 2013. Judgment became final on May 29, 2015.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">We conclude that Kovaco\u2019s notice of appeal sufficiently manifested his intent to seek review of so much of the judgment as involved his hostile-work-environment claims brought under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The notice aptly described the claims as \u201cdiscrimination\u201d claims, listed the statutes under which Ko-vaco brought the claims, noted the, specific disposition of the claims by the District Court, and identified by date the order in which the District Court announced the disposition. We can infer from .this description \u2014 and the absence of any exclusionary or restrictive language therein \u2014 that Ko-vaco had intended to appeal the grant of summary judgment to Rockbestos with re spect to <em>all </em>of his discrimination-based claims brought under the named statutes, including the hostile-work-environment claims. Accordingly, these claims are properly before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">Kovaco\u2019s notice of appeal did <em>not </em>manifest his intent, however, to seek review of so much of the judgment as involved his CFEPA claim. The notice failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>to identify or describe the CFEPA claim in any way. Although the notice identified by date the order in which the District Court disposed of the CFEPA claim, it did so only in reference to the claims brought under federal discrimination statutes. Further, the notice included no language evincing Kovaco\u2019s intent to appeal from the <em>entire </em>order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, even construing the notice of appeal liberally, we cannot infer from the notice that Kovaco had intended to seek review of the grant of summary judgment to Rockbestos with respect to his CFEPA claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, although \u201cwe may construe the rules [of appellate procedure] liberally, we do not have the authority to waive the jurisdictional requirements of [Rule 3(c)(1)(B) ],\u201d and \u201cour jurisdiction is limited by the wording of the notice.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Accordingly, because we lack jurisdiction over the CFEPA claim, Kovaco\u2019s appeal of so much of the judgment as involved his CFEPA claim must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">II. Discriminatory-Discharge Claims</p>\n<p id=\"AS8\">We turn now to Kovaco\u2019s principal argument on appeal, which is that the District Court misapplied controlling case law in holding that, due to his representations to the SSA and the SSA\u2019s disability determination, he could not prove he was qualified for his position as of March 29, 2010, the date when his employment was terminated by Rockbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that, although the District Court\u2019s explanation of why Kovaco was judicially estopped from asserting that he was qualified for his position was erroneous, the decision was nevertheless correct. Specifically, Kovaco was judicially es-topped because he failed to proffer a sufficient explanation of why his assertion that he was qualified for his position was consistent with his earlier sworn statement to the SSA that he was \u201cunable to work.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>As a result, we agree with the District Court that Kovaeo failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge on summary judgment under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">A. Overview of the Qualification Element under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We analyze employment-discrimination claims under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA using the now-familiar burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under that framework, a plaintiff must first establish a <em>pri-ma facie </em>case of discrimination, which causes the burden of production to shift to the defendant to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationale for its actions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cIf the defendant satisfies its burden of production, then the presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted and drops from the case,\u201d such that \u201c[a]t the final stage, the plaintiff then has the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA, a plaintiff must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was qualified for the position he held at the time of termination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In opposing a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \u201ca plaintiff may satisfy this burden by showing that she possesses the basic skills necessary for performance of the job.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201cespecially where discharge is at issue and the employer has already hired the employee, the inference of minimal qualification is not difficult to draw.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Notably, the qualification prong under the ADA differs from the qualification prong under Title VII and the ADEA, in that the plaintiff must show under the ADA that he is \u201cqualified to perform the essential functions of his job, <em>with or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">Unlike typical discriminatory-discharge cases in which a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is before the court for consideration, however, this case presents the question not of whether a plaintiff established that there was at least a genu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ine dispute of fact as to his qualification for purposes of establishing his <em>prima facie </em>case, but rather whether he was judicially estopped from asserting that he was qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">B. The District Court\u2019s Judicial Estoppel Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The District Court appears to have held that Kovaco was judicially estopped from asserting that he was qualified for his position as of March 29, 2010 due to factual representations in his SSA application and factual findings and conclusions by the SSA in determining that he was disabled as of March 24, 2010. The District Court did not use the term \u201cjudicial estoppel,\u201d but both cases relied upon by the District Court turn on judicial estoppel, and the District Court\u2019s singular focus on the SSA proceeding to the exclusion of other evidence bolsters this conclusion.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We therefore consider whether the District Court properly applied controlling case law in reasoning that Kovaco was judicially es-topped from asserting that he was qualified for his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u201cJudicial estoppel applies to sworn statements made to administrative agencies such as the Social Security Administration as well as to courts.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We explained in <em>Robinson v. Concentra Health Services, Inc., </em>a case that similarly involved a successful SSA disability applicant who later pursued an employment-discrimination claim against his employer, that \u201c[jjudicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a factual position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken by that party in a prior legal proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> To establish judicial estoppel, a party \u201cmust show that (1) the party against whom the estoppel is asserted took an inconsistent position in a prior proceeding and (2) that position was adopted by the first tribunal in some manner, such as by rendering a favorable judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">In <em>Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., </em>the Supreme Court defined the contours of judicial estoppel in a case where, as here, the plaintiff had stated in her SSA application that she was totally disabled, and also brought claims against her former employer under the ADA asserting that she had been qualified for her position.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Rejecting the argument that these claims were inherently inconsistent, the Court explained that \u201cthere are ... many situations in which an SSDI claim and an ADA claim can comfortably exist side by side.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For example, the Court explained that a \u201cqualified individual\u201d under the ADA includes, a person who can perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation, whereas disability under the Social Security Act does not take into account the possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As a result, \u201can ADA suit claiming that the plaintiff can perform her job <em>with </em>reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an SSDI claim that the plaintiff could not perform her own job (or other jobs) <em>without </em>it.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">But the Supreme Court also recognized that \u201cin some eases an earlier SSDI claim may turn out genuinely to conflict with an ADA claim,\u201d observing that \u201ca plaintiffs sworn assertion in an application for disability benefits that she is, for example, \u2018unable to work\u2019 will appear to negate an essential element of her ADA case \u2014 at least if she does not offer a sufficient explanation.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Court therefore held that \u201can ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier SSDI total disability claim. Rather, she must proffer a sufficient explanation.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Court concluded: \u201cTo defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror\u2019s concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiffs good-faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless \u2018perform the essential functions\u2019 of her job, with or without \u2018reasonable accommodation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Here, Kovaco proffered an explanation on summary judgment as to how his sworn statement in his SSA application that he was \u201cunable to work\u201d as of March 24, 2010 did not \u201cnegate [the] essential element of [his] ADA case\u201d that he was qualified for his position on March 29, 2010.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Like the plaintiff in <em>Cleveland, </em>Kovaco explained that he was disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act on March 24, 2010, but that he nevertheless was qualified under the ADA on March 29, 2010, because he would have been able to perform his essential job functions on that date if he had reasonable accommodation in the form of an electric cart.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The necessary implication of this explanation is that Kovaco was \u201cunable to work\u201d beginning March 24, 2010 only because he did <em>not </em>have access to an electric cart. The District Court rejected this explanation, however, concluding that \u201c[a]n electric cart would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>not remedy the majority of [his] job-related deficiencies.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Court cited the factual representations in Kovaco\u2019s SSA application regarding the physical demands of his job, as well as the SSA\u2019s factual findings and conclusions that Kovaco was \u201cfit only for sedentary work and [was] limited to occasionally lifting up to twenty pounds.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> On this basis, the District Court held that Kovaco could not establish that he was qualified for his position with reasonable accommodation, under the ADA, nor under Title VII and the ADEA, \u201cas reasonable accommodation is not implicated\u201d by these statutes.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We conclude that the District Court erred in holding that the SSA\u2019s factual findings and conclusions that Kovaco was \u201cfit only for sedentary work and [was] limited to occasionally lifting up to twenty pounds,\u201d in conjunction with Kovaco\u2019s factual statements to the SSA about the more onerous physical demands of his job, judicially estopped him from asserting that he would have been qualified to perform his essential job functions if he had reasonable . accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">First, the SSA\u2019s specific factual findings and conclusions have no estoppel effect insofar as they appear to be untethered to any specific position taken by Kovaco before the SSA. In his SSA application, Ko-vaco described his medical conditions and diagnoses, as well as the physical demands of his position, and concluded that he was \u201cunable to work\u201d and that he had stopped working on March 24, 2010 \u201c[b]ecause of [his] conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> But he did not assert or otherwise suggest that he could lift only twenty pounds of weight or that he was unable to walk or stand and was capable of only sedentary work. This is not to say that the SSA\u2019s ultimate determination was irrelevant. Indeed, for Kovaco to have been judicially estopped, his earlier position before the SSA must have been \u201cadopted by the [SSA] in some manner, such as by rendering a favorable judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> But this does not mean that Kova-co is estopped from taking a position inconsistent with the SSA\u2019s position where Kovaco had not taken the position himself.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Judicial estoppel does not reach so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">Second, even if Kovaco were estopped from taking a position clearly inconsistent with the SSA\u2019s position that he was \u201cfit only for sedentary work and is limited to occasionally lifting up to. twenty pounds,\u201d this would not preclude Kovaco from taking the <em>different </em>position that he could perform his essential job functions with reasonable accommodation. \u201cWe have cautioned ... that before applying judicial estoppel to factual claims in ADA cases, a court must carefully consider the contexts in which apparently contradictory statements are made to determine if there is, in fact, direct and irreconcilable contradiction.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> If Kovaco could perform only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>sedentary work and lift only up to twenty pounds of weight, this is not \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with the possibility that Kovaco could meet the more onerous physical demands of his job with reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> For example, with reasonable accommodation, he would not necessarily need to walk several hours a day \u2014 a demand of the job for those without reasonable accommodation- \u2014 -because he could use an electric cart to traverse the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In sum, the District Court erred in reasoning that Kovaco was judicially estopped based on factual findings and conclusions by the SSA that do not appear to represent Kovaco\u2019s position before the SSA, and that in any event were not clearly inconsistent with his later assertion that he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with reasonable accommodation. As we discuss below, however, Kovaco is nevertheless judicially estopped for independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">C. Why Kovaco Is Judicially Estopped from Establishing That He Was Qualified For His Position</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Although the District Court\u2019s explanation was erroneous, its decision that Kovaco was estopped from asserting that he was qualified was nevertheless correct. As noted above, the explanation proffered by Kovaco was that he was unable to work for purposes of the Social Security Act, but that he was nonetheless qualified to work if he had reasonable accommodation in the form of an electric cart, implying that he lacked an electric cart when he stated he was \u201cunable to work.\u201d The evidence adduced on summary judgment, however, conclusively establishes that Kovaco had an electric cart during his shifts when he stated to the SSA that he was \u201cunable to work,\u201d belying his explanation that he was only \u201cunable to work\u201d because he lacked reasonable accommodation. In other words, although an explanation like Kova-co\u2019s might be sufficient to defeat summary judgment in other circumstances \u2014 such as those presented in <em>Cleveland</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 it fails to defeat Rockbestos\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the record before us, which makes clear that Kovaco\u2019s later assertion is inconsistent with his sworn statement to the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The record shows that Kovaco indisputably was able to use an electric cart as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>necessary during his shifts leading up to his suspension on March 23, 2010, notwithstanding his subsequent statement to the SSA during his suspension that he was \u201cunable to work.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The jury verdict in favor of Rockbestos on Kovaco\u2019s failure-to-accommodate claims confirmed this fact. The District Court instructed the jury that it \u201cmust determine whether defendant accommodated plaintiff by taking reasonable steps to ensure that an electric cart was available for his use as needed.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In its special verdict form, the jury indicated that Kovaco had <em>not </em>proved that Rockbes-tos \u201cfailed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for his medical restrictions with respect to climbing and walking,\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> a finding that Kovaco does not challenge on appeal. Finally, perhaps in light of the weight of evidence and the subsequent jury verdict, Kovaco has conceded on appeal that he \u201cagrees that he was able to successfully perform his job duties with the use of a cart from December 2009 through March 19, 2010.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Based on the foregoing, Kovaco\u2019s explanation of the apparent contradiction between his sworn statement to the SSA that he was \u201cunable to work\u201d beginning March 24, 2010, and his assertion in support of his discriminatory-discharge claims that he was nonetheless qualified to perform his essential job functions when his employment was terminated on March 29, 2010, is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. A reasonable juror who assumes the truth of Kovaco\u2019s sworn statement that he was \u201cunable to work\u201d beginning March 24, 2010, despite conclusive evidence that Ko-vaco was able to use an electric cart as necessary, cannot also believe Kovaco\u2019s explanation that five days later, on March 29, 2010, he could nonetheless perform the essential functions of his job if only he had access to a cart. In light of the evidence on the record before us, -the explanation proffered by Kovaco does <em>not </em>reconcile the apparent contradiction between his statement to the SSA and his current litigation position, and we conclude that the two positions are clearly inconsistent.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>We also reject Kovaco\u2019s explanation on appeal that \u201cnotwithstanding the Plaintiffs representation to the SSA, he continued to perform his job duties without issue through the date of the termination of his employment.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This assertion may be true \u2014 especially in light of the evidence discussed above \u2014 but this position is clearly inconsistent with Kovaco\u2019s statement in his SSA application that he was \u201cunable to work\u201d during that same time period. If anything, this explanation, like the one advanced by the plaintiff in <em>Robinson, </em>\u201cdemonstrates only that [Kovaco\u2019s] statements to the SSA ... may have been false, but does not sufficiently explain the contradiction between the statements [to the SSA] and [this new] litigation position.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In sum, Kovaco has failed to proffer a sufficient explanation of how his assertion in support of his ADA, Title VII, and ADEA claims that he was qualified for his position on March 29, 2010 is not \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with his earlier sworn statement, adopted by the SSA, that he was \u201cunable to work\u201d beginning March 24, 2010, a period during which he was provided with reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> As a result, we hold that Kovaco is judicially estopped from asserting that he could perform his essential job functions \u2014 with or without reasonable accommodation \u2014 at the time that his employment was terminated by Rockbestos. Accordingly, we also hold that he has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA, and we uphold the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Rockbestos on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">III. Hostile-Work-Environment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"A4y\">We next consider Kovaco\u2019s contention that the District Court erroneously granted summary judgment to Rockbestos on his hostile-work-environment claims, brought under the ADA, Title VII, and the ADEA. We reject this contention as merit-less because we conclude that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Kovaco pleaded such claims, he abandoned them at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>As an initial matter, the parties dispute whether Kovaco pleaded hostile-work-environment claims in his amended complaint.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Although we harbor doubt as to whether Kovaco adequately pleaded hostile-work-environment claims, we need not resolve this issue. Even if we assume that Kovaco pleaded hostile-work-environment claims, he abandoned them in the District Court by failing to argue that they should survive Rockbestos\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In <em>Jackson v. Federal Express, </em>we held that when a counseled party moves for summary judgment, \u201ca partial response [by the non-movant] arguing that summary judgment should be denied as to some claims while not mentioning others may be deemed an. abandonment of the unmentioned claims.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We explained that \u201c[plleadings often are designed to include all possible claims or defenses, and parties are always free to abandon some of them.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> And insofar as summary judgment \u201cis known as a highly useful method of narrowing the issues for trial,\u201d it follows that \u201cpreparation of a response to a motion for summary judgment is a particularly appropriate time for a non-movant party to decide whether to pursue or abandon some claims or defenses.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201c[generally, but perhaps not always, a partial response reflects a decision by a party\u2019s attorney to pursue some claims or defenses and to abandon others,\u201d and \u201ca court may, when appropriate, infer from a party\u2019s partial opposition that relevant claims or defenses that are not defended have been abandoned.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> If a district court so holds, it \u201cshould ... include a finding of abandonment of undefended claims or defenses.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Here, Rockbestos moved in November 2012 for summary judgment on all claims in the amended complaint. Kovaco protests that \u201cit is clear that [Rockbestos] was. seeking summary judgment only as it related to [his] claim of discriminatory discharge, and it was not seeking summary judgment as to [his] national origin, age, and disability hostile[-]work[-]environment claims.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> But the plain language of Rock-bestos\u2019s motion for summary judgment\u2014 which at the outset argues that Rockbestos is entitled to summary judgment on \u201ceach of plaintiffs claims\u201d \u2014 belies this conclusion.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> We thus treat Rockbestos\u2019s motion as one that requested summary judgment on <em>all </em>of the claims in Kovaco\u2019s amended complaint, including the purported hostile-work-environment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">In response to Rockbestos\u2019s global motion for summary judgment, Kovaco filed a brief in opposition, but the brief failed to support or even address the purported hostile-work-environment claims. In fact, the argument section of the brief specifically enumerates Kovaco\u2019s claims and argues extensively why each should.survive summary judgment, but the brief is bereft of any <em>mention </em>of the purported hostile-work-environment claims, let alone argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ment why these claims should survive summary judgment.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Kovaco\u2019s motion for reconsideration similarly failed to mention the purported hostile-work-environment claims.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Kovaco did not raise the hostile-work-environment claims until four months after filing his motion for reconsideration and almost a year after filing his initial brief in opposition of summary judgment, when he finally filed a \u201csupplemental memorandum\u201d in support of reconsideration in which he argued that the District Court overlooked the claims.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Applying <em>Jackson, </em>we hold that Kovaco abandoned in opposing summary judgment any hostile-work-environment claims he may have pleaded in his amended complaint. As discussed above, Rockbestos moved for summary judgment on all claims, and Kovaco opposed the motion with respect to all but the purported hostile-work-environment claims. In these circumstances, we infer from Kovaco\u2019s failure to mention the claims that he had abandoned them.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">We have reviewed all of plaintiffs arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. We thus AFFIRM the May 29, 2015 judgment of the District Court in its entirety, except that we DISMISS plaintiffs appeal of so much of the judgment as involved his CFEPA claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">. <em>See Kovaco </em>v. <em>Rockbestos-Surprenant Cable Corp., </em>979 F.Supp.2d 252 (D.

Kovaco testified during his deposition, however, that he was able to use a cart without exception in the weeks leading up to the March 29 termination of his employment, <em>see ante, </em>which is consistent with the jury verdict on his failure-to-accommodate claims.

I write separately to reinforce an important point made by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its amicus brief: A disabled plaintiff can demonstrate that he was qualified for the position under Title VII or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (the \u201cADEA\u201d) by showing that he could perform the job with or without a reasonable accommodation. In other words, he \u201cmust show only that he possesse[d] the basic skills necessary for performance of [the] job.\u201d Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 91-92 (2d Cir. 2001) (quotation marks omitted). If this were not the rule, a disabled worker who performed his job with a reasonable accommodation would be unable to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge under Title VII or the ADEA even if he were discharged based on his race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age. As the majority opinion implicitly recognizes, Title VII, the ADEA, and the Americans with Disabilities Act together work to foreclose that possibility.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
