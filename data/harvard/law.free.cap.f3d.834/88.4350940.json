CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The principal question presented by this appeal is whether the fulfillment by the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) of its obligation under Section 29 of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations (the \u201cCPIUN\u201d), Apr. 29, 1970, 21 U.S.T. 1418, to \u201cmake provisions for appropriate modes of settlement of\u2019 certain disputes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a condition precedent to its immunity under Section 2 of the CPIUN, which provides that the UN \u201cshall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except insofar as in any particular case it has expressly waived its immunity,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> such that the UN\u2019s alleged disregard of its Section 29 obligation \u201ccompel[s] the conclusion that the UN\u2019s immunity does not exist.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">We hold that the UN\u2019s fulfillment of its Section 29 obligation is not a condition precedent to its Section 2 immunity. For this reason \u2014 and because we find plaintiffs\u2019 other arguments unpersuasive \u2014 we AFFIRM the January 15, 2015 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (J. Paul Oetken, <em>Judge) </em>dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 action against defendants the UN, the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (\u201cMINUSTAH\u201d), UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (\u201cBan\u201d), and former MINUSTAH UnderSecretary-General Edmond Mulet (\u201cMu-let\u201d) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b116-19\">Plaintiffs are citizens of the United States or Haiti who claim that they \u201chave been or will be sickened, or have family members who have died or will die, as a direct result of the cholera\u201d epidemic that has ravaged the Republic of Haiti since October 2010.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this putative class action, plaintiffs seek to hold defendants responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ble for their injuries, and to that end, assert various causes of action sounding in tort and contract against them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Specifically, plaintiffs allege that, in October 2010, \u201c[defendants knowingly disregarded the high risk of transmitting cholera to Haiti when ... they deployed personnel from Nepal to Haiti, knowing that Nepal was a country in which cholera is endemic and where a surge in infections had just been reported.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, defendants not only failed to test or screen these Nepalese personnel prior to their deployment, allowing them to carry into Haiti the strain of cholera that is the epidemic\u2019s source; they also stationed them at a base on the banks of the Meille Tributary, which flows into the Artibonite River, the primary water source for \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Haitians.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From this base, defendants allegedly \u201cdischarged raw sewage\u201d and \u201cdisposed of untreated human waste,\u201d which \u201ccreated a high risk of contamination.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Eventually, plaintiffs contend, \u201chuman waste from the base seeped into and contaminated the Meille Tributary\u201d and, ultimately, the Artibonite River, \u201cresulting in explosive and massive outbreaks of cholera ... throughout the entire country.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Defendants did not enter an appearance before the District Court. But on March 7, 2014, the executive branch of the United States government (the \u201cExecutive Branch\u201d) submitted a statement of interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517, in which it took the position that defendants are \u201cimmune from legal process and suit\u201d pursuant to the UN Charter, June 26, 1945, 59 Stat. 1031; the CPIUN; and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (the \u201cVCDR\u201d), Apr. 18, 1961, 23 U.S.T. 3227.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">The District Court agreed with the Executive Branch. Accordingly, on January 9, 2015, it dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With respect to the UN and MINUSTAH, the District Court relied on Section 2 of the CPIUN. To reiterate, Section 2 provides that the UN \u201cshall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except insofar as in any particular case it has expressly waived its immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The District Court reasoned that, because \u201cno party contended] that the UN ha[d] expressly waived its immunity,\u201d the UN was \u201cimmune from [p]laintiffs\u2019 suit.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> With respect to Ban and Mulet, the District Court relied on Article 31 of the VCDR, which provides that \u201c[a] diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity ... from [a receiving State\u2019s] civil and administrative jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tion,\u201d except in circumstances undisputedly not presented here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The District Court concluded that, because Ban and Mulet both held diplomatic positions at the time plaintiffs filed their action, they were immune as well.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Plaintiffs timely appealed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Defendants did not enter an appearance before this Court either, but the Executive Branch \u201csubmitted an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517 ..., in [their] support.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Under principles of long standing, \u201c[w]hen this Court reviews the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>accepting all material facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">On appeal, plaintiffs raise three principal arguments. First, they argue that the District Court erred in holding that the UN and MINUSTAH are immune because the UN\u2019s fulfilment of its obligation under Section 29 of the CPIUN to provide for appropriate dispute-resolution mechanisms is a condition precedent to its Section 2 immunity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Second, they argue that the District Court\u2019s holding was in error because the UN materially breached the CPIUN by failing to fulfill its Section 29 obligation, such that it is no longer entitled to the benefit of immunity under Section 2. Third, they argue that the District Court\u2019s application of the CPIUN to dismiss their action violated their constitutional right of access to the federal courts. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">I. Condition Precedent</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first argument requires us to interpret the CPIUN, so we begin by describing the framework that governs any such inquiry. \u201cThe interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and \u201c[wjhere the language of ... [a] treaty is plain, a court must refrain from amending it because to do so would be to make, not construe, a treaty.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Additionally, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201c[a]s a general matter, a treaty is a contract ... between nations,\u201d it is \u201cto be interpreted upon the principles which govern the interpretation of contracts in writing between individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Further, \u201cwhile the interpretation of a treaty is a question of law for the courts, given the nature of the document and the unique relationships it implicates, the Executive Branch\u2019s interpretation of a treaty is entitled to great weight.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Here, application of two particular \u201cprinciples which govern the interpretation of contracts\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> demonstrates why plaintiffs\u2019 first argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The first such principle is <em>expressio uni-us est exclusio alterius </em>\u2014 \u201cexpress mention of one thing excludes all others\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u2014 which is also known as the negative-implication canon.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> 'This principle has guided federal courts\u2019 interpretations of treaties for over a century.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">As noted above, Section <em>2 </em>of the CPIUN provides that the UN \u201cshall enjoy immuni- \u2022 ty from every form of legal process except insofar as in any particular case it has expressly waived its immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Especially when coupled with the compulsory \u201cshall\u201d' \u2014 \u2022 which \u201cis universally understood to indicate an imperative or mandate\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>\u2014 Section 2\u2019s \u201cexpress mention of\u2019 the UN\u2019s express waiver as a circumstance in which the UN \u201cshall [not] enjoy immunity\u201d nega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tively implies that \u201call other[]\u201d circumstances, including the UN\u2019s failure to fulfill its Section 29 obligation, are \u201cexcluded.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It necessarily follows that the UN\u2019s fulfillment of its Section 29 obligation is. not a condition precedent to its Section 2 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">This conclusion is buttressed by the second principle of contract interpretation relevant to our analysis \u2014 that \u201cconditions precedent to most contractual obligations ... are not favored and must be expressed in plain, unambiguous language.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> To manifest their intent to create a condition precedent, \u201c[p]arties often us\u00e9 language such as \u2018if,\u2019 \u2018on condition that,\u2019 \u2018provided that,\u2019 \u2018in the event that,\u2019 and \u2018subject to.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> No such language links Sections 2 and 29 in the CPIUN. Of course, \u201cspecific talismanic words are not required.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But \u201cthere is [also] no ... [other] language [in the CPIUN] which, even straining, we could read as imposing\u201d the UN\u2019s fulfillment of its Section 29 obligation as a condition precedent to its Section 2 immunity.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">It is also significant that the Executive Branch\u2019s interpretation of the CPIUN \u2014 an interpretation \u201centitled to great weight\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u2014accords with our own. The Executive Branch sees \u201c[n]othing in Section 29 ... [that] states, either explicitly or implicitly, that compliance with its terms is a precondition to the UN\u2019s immunity under Section 2.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. For example, plaintiffs argue that \u201c[t]he UN\u2019s post-ratification ... practice pursuant to ... Section 29 ... demonstrates that entitlement to immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>is premised on the provision of alternative dispute settlement.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 chief example of this supposed practice is the UN\u2019s statement before the International Court of Justice that the UN\u2019s immunity <em>\u201cdoes not leave a plaintiff without remedy </em>[because] ... in the event that immunity is asserted, a claimant seeking redress against the Organization <em>shall </em>be afforded an appropriate means of settlement [under Section 29].\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> This statement, however, suggests at most that the UN views Section 29 as \u201cmore than merely aspirational\u201d \u2014 as \u201cobligatory and perhaps enforceable.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> It does not in any way suggest that the UN views Section 29 as a condition precedent to Section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that \u201cforeign signatories to the CPIUN have repeatedly held that the availability of alternative dispute settlement is a material condition to international organizations\u2019 entitlement to immunity,\u201d and that \u201cthese foreign courts\u2019 views provide persuasive authority for this case, per the direction of the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This argument is misleading. The Supreme Court has indeed held that, \u201c[i]n interpreting any treaty, the opinions of our sister signatories are entitled to considerable weight.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> But in so holding, the Court was obviously referring to the opinions of states that are parties to the treaty that is being interpreted <em>regarding that same treaty, </em>not the opinions of states that happen to have ratified the treaty at issue <em>regarding another treaty entirely. </em>Most of plaintiffs\u2019 examples fall into the 'latter category \u2014 -they are cases from the courts of states that have ratified the CPI-UN, but they pertain to unrelated agreements, including the agreement between France and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and the agreement between Italy and the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute regarding its headquarters in Rome.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> An<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>other of the plaintiffs\u2019 examples appears to have involved the CPIUN, but the portion of the holding relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is based on an interpretation of the state\u2019s constitution rather than the CPIUN itself.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">As we have seen, whether a term constitutes a condition precedent depends on the particular language of the instrument that is being evaluated.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> For the most part, plaintiffs have not suggested that the aforementioned agreements contain language that is even comparable\u2014 much less identical \u2014 to that found in Sections 2 and 29 of the CPIUN. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on cases interpreting those agreements is misplaced.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Plaintiffs do argue that the agreement between France and UNESCO, at issue in <em>UNESCO v. Boulois, </em>Cour d\u2019Appel [CA] [Court of Appeal] Paris (Fr.), June 19, 1998, is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the CPI-UN.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Notwithstanding textual similarities between the two treaties, we do not find the French court\u2019s interpretation relevant to this case. The France-UNESCO agreement arose in a materially different context than the CPIUN; it is a bilateral agreement between France and UNESCO whereas the CPIUN is a multilateral trea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>ty signed by a number of countries. That a French court interpreting an agreement between France and a UN agency found that the agreement required the establishment of an alternative forum for dispute resolution has little bearing on the interpretation of the CPIUN in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the UN\u2019s fulfillment of its Section 29 obligation is not a condition precedent to its Section 2 immunity.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">II. Material Breach</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Plaintiffs next argue that \u201c[t]he District Court\u2019s finding of immunity was erroneous ... because Section 29 is a material term to the CPIUN as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, the UN\u2019s material breach of its Section 29 obligation means that it \u201cis no longer entitled to the performance of duties owed to it under\u201d the CPIUN, including its Section 2 immunity.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> We need not reach the merits of this argument, however, because plaintiffs lack standing to raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"AAt\">As we have recently reiterated, \u201cabsent protest or objection by the offended sovereign, [an individual] has no standing to raise the violation of international law as an issue.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have not identified any sovereign that has objected to the UN\u2019s alleged material breach. To the contrary, the United States has asked us to affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment, and no other country has expressed an interest in this litigation.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">It is true that there is an exception to this rule where a treaty contains \u201cexpress language\u201d \u201ccreat[ing] privately enforceable rights ..., or some other indication that the intent of the treaty drafters was to confer rights that could be vindicated in the manner sought by ... affected individuals,\u201d such as plaintiffs in this case.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> \u201c[B]ut [plaintiffs have] not identified, nor can we locate,\u201d any such indication in the CPIUN, and \u201c[sjtanding is therefore lacking.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">It is plaintiffs\u2019 position that the case law described above is \u201cinapposite.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> They contend that, \u201c[rjegardless of whether a treaty provides an enforceable private right of action, individuals may invoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>breach in a responsive posture.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In support of this position, plaintiffs cite a law review article stating that \u201ccase law is consistent with [the] understanding that a treaty may be enforced defensively even when there is no private right of action.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> But the same article makes clear what it means by \u201cdefensive enforcement,\u201d which it contends \u201ccan be found in two types of cases\u201d: those in which a private party uses a treaty (1) \u201cto defend against a claim by the United States government\u201d or (2) \u201cto defend against a claim by another private party under state or federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Neither of these situations is presented here. No claim has been asserted against plaintiffs; rather, it is plaintiffs who have asserted the claims underlying this action. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 argument fails even on its own terms.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">III. Right of Access to Federal Courts</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Lastly, plaintiffs argue that the District Court erred \u201cbecause it violated the U.S. citizen Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights to access the federal courts by applying immunity in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> This argument fails to convince.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As we stated in <em>Brzak v. United Nations, </em>in which we rejected a virtually indistinguishable challenge to an application of Section 2 of the CPIUN, plaintiffs\u2019 argument does little more \u201cthan question why immunities in general should exist.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> But \u201clegislatively and judicially crafted immunities of one sort or another have existed since well before the framing of the Constitution, have been extended and modified over time, and are firmly embedded in American law.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, if correct, would seem to defeat not only the UN\u2019s immunity, but also \u201cjudicial immunity, prosecutorial immunity, and legislative immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Plaintiffs do not persuasively differentiate the quotidian and constitutionally permissible application of these doctrines from application of Section 2 of the CPIUN here.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">We have considered all of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s January 15, 2015 judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the CPIUN.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-12\">.Section 29 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">The [UN] shall make provisions for appropriate modes of settlement of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-14\">(a) disputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of a private law character to which the [UN] is a party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-15\">(b) disputes involving any official of the [UN] who by reason of his official position enjoys immunity, if immunity has not been waived by the Secretary-General.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-22\">CPIUN art.
