After decades of litigation and having exhausted his opportunities for relief on direct and collateral review in the Georgia courts, Tharpe now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Our review is limited to the following two issues: First, whether Tharpe\u2019s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Second, whether Tharpe is intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002). With the benefit of thorough briefing and oral argument, we conclude that Tharpe has failed to make either showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-9\">Twenty-six years ago, Tharpe murdered Jaquelin Freeman, his sister-in-law, by shooting her multiple times with a shotgun. The Georgia Supreme Court recounts the circumstances of the killing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWqU\">Tharpe\u2019s wife left him on August 28, 1990 and moved in with her mother. Following various threats of violence made by the defendant to and about his wife and her family, a peace warrant was taken out against him, and the defendant was ordered not to have any contact with his wife or her family. Notwithstanding this order, Tharpe called his wife on September 24, 1990 and argued with her, saying if she wanted to \u201cplay dirty,\u201d he would show her \u201cwhat dirty was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-12\">On the morning of the 25th, his wife and her sister-in-law met Tharpe as they drove to work. He used his vehicle to block theirs and force them to stop. He got out of his vehicle, armed with a shotgun and apparently under the influence of drugs, and ordered them out of their vehicle. After telling the sister-in-law he was going to \u201cf\u2014 you up,\u201d he took her to the rear of his vehicle, where he shot her. He rolled her into a ditch, reloaded, and shot her again, killing her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-13\">Tharpe then drove away with his wife. After unsuccessfully trying to rent a motel room, Tharpe parked by the side of the road and raped his wife. Afterward, he drove to Macon, where his wife was to obtain money from her credit union. Instead she called the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\"><em>Tharpe v. State, </em>262 Ga. 110, 416 S.E.2d 78, 79-80 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-15\">Following a nine-day trial in Jones County, Georgia, lasting from January 2 to January 10, 1991, Tharpe was found guilty of malice murder and two counts of kidnapping with bodily injury. At sentencing, as during the guilt-innocence stage of the trial, counsel presented to the jury an image of Tharpe as a good person who had been temporarily overcome with the emotional distress of being left by his wife. Thirteen witnesses including Tharpe; his mother, Naomi Tharpe; his sister, Audrey Pope; his cousin, L\u00e1veme Shermer; his wife, Migrisus; two of his daughters; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>some of his friends testified on Tharpe\u2019s behalf. These witnesses portrayed Tharpe as a good son, a good husband, a good father, a good student, and a good friend, and asked the jury to spare Tharpe\u2019s life. Although the State introduced some evidence of Tharpe\u2019s criminal history, the jury did not learn about other aspects of Tharpe\u2019s troubled past, including his difficult and abusive upbringing, his history of substance abuse, and his low intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">The jury voted unanimously to impose the death penalty. The jury found three statutory aggravating factors pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 IT \u2014 10\u201430(b)(2) and (b)(7): the murder was committed while Tharpe was engaged in the commission of another capital felony, the kidnapping with bodily injury of the victim, Jaquelin Freeman; the murder was committed while Tharpe was engaged in the commission of another capital felony, the kidnapping with bodily injury of Tharpe\u2019s wife, Migrisus Tharpe; and the murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman because it involved an aggravated battery to the victim. Tharpe moved for a new trial on January 19, 1991. The trial court denied his motion on August 15, 1991. On direct appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed Tharpe\u2019s conviction and death sentence on March 17, 1992. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari on October 19, 1992. <em>Tharpe v. Georgia, </em>506 U.S. 942, 113 S.Ct. 383, 121 L.Ed.2d 292 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">On March 17, 1993, Tharpe filed his first petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia. Tharpe amended his habeas petition twice, first on December 31, 1997, and then again on January 21, 1998. The Superior Court held evidentiary hearings on May 28, 1998; August 24, 1998; October 1-2, 1998; December 11, 1998; December 23, 1998; and July 30, 2007. The Superior Court ultimately issued a 105-page order denying relief on December 1, 2008. The Georgia Supreme Court denied Tharpe\u2019s application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal the Superior Court\u2019s denial of habe-as corpus on April 19, 2010. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari on November 29, 2010. <em>Tharpe v. Upton, </em>562 U.S. 1069, 131 S.Ct. 655, 178 L.Ed.2d 491 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">On November 8, 2010, Tharpe filed his second petition for writ of habeas corpus, this time pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. After granting Tharpe\u2019s motions to appoint counsel and to proceed in forma pauperis, the District Court denied Tharpe\u2019s motions to conduct discovery and hold an evidentiary hearing. The Court then denied Tharpe\u2019s habeas petition on March 6, 2014, and Tharpe\u2019s motion to alter and amend judgment on May 8, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">In its order of March 6, 2014, the District Court issued a Certificate of Appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">Whether the state habeas court\u2019s determination that Tharpe\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective in the investigation and presentation of mitigation evidence was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts, or was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">Tharpe subsequently moved this Court to expand the COA to encompass two other issues. We granted both requested extensions, the first on July 30, 2014, and the second on December 30, 2014:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-10\">(1) Whether the Georgia court\u2019s decision that appellant is not exempt from execution under <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) is contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>... resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-5\">(2) Whether defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to present an intellectual disability defense at the guilt-innocence phase of his trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">Taking the issues before us on appeal together, Tharpe is requesting relief on a Sixth Amendment ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel theory under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and an Eighth Amendment intellectual-disability theory<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">Having laid out in broad strokes the procedural history of Tharpe\u2019s case, we turn now to the state collateral proceedings in more detail. Judge Richard T. Win-egarden of the Superior Court of Butts County issued his order denying Tharpe\u2019s requested relief more than a decade after Tharpe filed his state habeas petition, during which time six separate evidentiary hearings were held. Judge Winegarden rejected most of the forty-one claims Tharpe raised in his second amended petition as barred by res judicata, procedurally defaulted, non-cognizable, or moot. Of Tharpe\u2019s remaining claims that reached merits determinations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we will discuss only the relevant <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Atkins </em>findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">As to Tharpe\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Judge Wine-garden concluded that Tharpe had \u201cfailed to carry his heavy burden\u201d because Tharpe could show neither the inadequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance nor the attendant prejudice that <em>Strickland </em>requires. After laying out <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>familiar two-prong test, Judge Winegarden began by assessing whether Tharpe\u2019s trial counsel performed as \u201csome reasonable lawyer at the trial could have acted, in the circumstances,\u201d without violating the minimum guarantees of the Sixth Amendment. The following facts, drawn from the trial record and post-trial evidentiary hearings, informed that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-13\">At trial and on direct appeal, Tharpe had been represented by two veteran lawyers, Charles Newberry and Shane Geeter. At the time of Tharpe\u2019s trial, Newberry had previously served four years at the Ocmulgee District Attorney\u2019s Office, including three as Chief Assistant District Attorney; had tried between fifty and one hundred cases involving murder, robbery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>rape, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and aggravated battery, theft, and forgery; and, following Ms time in the District Attorney\u2019s Office had been lead defense counsel in three capital trials, none of which led to the death penalty being imposed. Geeter had also worked in the District Attorney\u2019s Office, during which time he tried between seven and twelve criminal cases before a jury as well as more than one hundred fifty civil bench trials. In private practice, Geeter\u2019s caseload was 60 to 70 percent criminal work, which included murder cases. Both New-berry and Geeter had spent a majority of their professional lives worMng in the Oc-mulgee Judicial Circuit, which was where Tharpe was tried. Both Newberry and Geeter had worked under District Attorney Joe Briley, who prosecuted Tharpe\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">The trial judge appointed Newberry and Geeter as co-counsel to represent Tharpe in the fall of 1990. In preparation for trial, Newberry and Geeter consulted with other attorneys, including defense attorneys in the Ocmulgee Judicial Circuit who had experience with death-penalty cases, and reviewed several practitioner resources for trying a capital case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although \u201cthere was no official division of duties\u201d assigned between co-counsel, Newberry and Geeter unofficially divvied up the responsibilities for investigating witnesses and filing motions. Both Newberry and Geeter, either together or individually, spoke with each witness at some point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">At the beginning of their investigation, Newberry and Geeter met with District Attorney Briley, who discussed the State\u2019s trial strategy and allowed them to review and copy his case file under Briley\u2019s \u201copen file policy\u201d for death-penalty cases. New-berry and Geeter also received a copy of the State\u2019s witness list and were referred to investigators in the Sheriffs Office and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation familiar with the murder of Jaquelin Freeman. Newberry and Geeter interviewed each of those investigators and everyone on the State\u2019s witness list. They also visited the crime scene twice and reviewed investigative and autopsy reports, photos, and physical evidence held by the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. As a result of their investigative efforts, Newberry and Geeter were able to challenge other lesser charges that the State was pursuing against Tharpe on the theory that Tharpe had been \u201cover-indicted\u201d under a \u201c \u2018shot gun approach.\u2019 \u201d These efforts led to the State ultimately withdrawing an armed-robbery charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">In advance of trial, Newberry and Geeter attempted to reach a plea bargain with District Attorney Briley and moved the trial court to bar the State from seeking the death penalty. Newberry and Geeter met with Tharpe \u201cnumerous times\u201d throughout their investigation, conferring with him about \u201cevery detail of the case.\u201d According to testimony elicited during one of the five evidentiary hearings, Newberry and Geeter had found Tharpe to be sufficiently capable to participate in his defense, including in making strategic decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-10\">In part because Tharpe\u2019s account of the murder closely paralleled that of his wife, Migrisus Tharpe, the only living witness,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>Newberry and Geeter decided that it would be best to have Tharpe remain silent during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial and testify only at the sentencing phase. This decision was the result of a strategy focused on portraying Tharpe as a man overcome by emotion and passion, based on the rationale that the jury might thus be inclined to find Tharpe guilty of voluntary manslaughter instead of malice murder. In line with this mitigation strategy, Newberry and Geeter decided to present Tharpe as a generally respectable and sympathetic figure who nevertheless made a mistake as a result of an emotionally charged domestic situation. They concluded that their chosen approach to seek the jury\u2019s mercy was the best, perhaps only, tack available under the circumstances known to them at the time \u2014 a conclusion that Newberry and Geeter also defended with the benefit of hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Anticipating that the State would challenge this image of Tharpe\u2019s character, Newberry and Geeter conducted an investigation to assess the strength of various mitigation theories. Meeting with family and friends whom Tharpe had referred them to, Newberry and Geeter were told that Tharpe was a \u201csmart\u201d and friendly man who had been well-behaved during his childhood, a high-school graduate who had earned \u201cgood grades\u201d and ran track, a good worker who would pick up available work jobs, and a husband who had maintained a marriage for eleven years. New-berry and Geeter also discovered that Tharpe had a criminal history including a conviction as a \u201chabitual violator\u201d for various traffic offenses that included driving under the influence, a history of substance abuse, and an unstable work history. Many of the potential witnesses Tharpe had identified were hesitant to testify on his behalf, with the exceptions of his mother and his aunt. Newberry and Geeter feared that if they did not proceed to trial quickly, the nature of Tharpe\u2019s crime would further diminish the potential witnesses\u2019 willingness to provide mitigating testimony; most notable in this regard was Migrisus Tharpe\u2019s willingness to testify. Neither Tharpe himself nor the witnesses he identified suggested to Newberry and Geeter during their investigation either that Tharpe had been abused or neglected in the past or that Tharpe\u2019s upbringing had been anything but positive. Based on their experience and judgment, Newberry and Geeter concluded that offering evidence of Tharpe\u2019s alcohol abuse and unstable work history would do more harm than good with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">Newberry and Geeter also explored the possibility that Tharpe may have had a viable mental-health defense by investigating whether Tharpe had suffered from various mental-health disorders or sustained a serious head injury. To that end, they had Tharpe evaluated by Dr. Archer Moore, a psychologist whom Newberry had previously retained as an expert witness in another murder trial. Dr. Moore evaluated Tharpe based on an interview and a battery of tests that were designed to identify Tharpe\u2019s general intellectual functioning and the possible existenc\u00e9 of organic brain damage. Those tests included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised test (\u201cthe WAIS-R test\u201d), the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, the Rorshach test, and the House-Tree-Person test. Dr. Moore described Tharpe\u2019s score of 73<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the WAIS-R as indicating that Tharpe had \u201cborderline intellectual functioning\u201d but was \u201cnot mentally retarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>The State had its own psychologist, Dr. Robert Storms, evaluate Tharpe. Dr. Storms likewise concluded that Tharpe \u201cexhibited no signs of mental retardation\u201d based on that evaluation, though Dr. Storms concluded that the results from the test he administered were invalid because they indicated Tharpe was malingering. Both Dr. Moore and Dr. Storms described Tharpe as \u201cmean,\u201d with Dr. Moore going so far as to call Tharpe a \u201cmean son of a bitch.\u201d Based on Dr. Moore\u2019s and Dr. Storms\u2019s conclusions and impressions concerning Tharpe, which may have proven aggravating rather than mitigating had they been presented to the jury, Newberry and Geeter decided to forgo a mental-health defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">Considering Newberry and Geeter\u2019s investigation and mitigation efforts under the circumstances known to them at the time and in line with the great deference due trial counsel\u2019s informed strategic decisions under <em>Strickland, </em>Judge Winegarden concluded that Tharpe had failed to prove either ineffective performance or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">As to Tharpe\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>intellectual-disability claim, Judge Winegarden concluded that Tharpe had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Tharpe was intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for the death penalty as a matter of Georgia law. Judge Winegarden began by citing Georgia\u2019s three-part test for establishing intellectual disability. That test, which was borrowed from the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\u201cthe DSM III\u201d) put out by the American Psychiatric Association, defines intellectual disability<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as the status of someone having (1) \u201csignificantly subav-erage general intellectual function ... [, which] is generally defined as an IQ of 70 or below,\u201d (2) that \u201cresultfs] in or [is] associated with impairments in adaptive behavior\u201d and (3) \u201cmanifestation of this impairment during the developmental period.\u201d <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17~7-131(a)(3). What follows are Judge Winegarden\u2019s relevant factual findings and legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">As discussed above, both Tharpe\u2019s own psychological expert and the State\u2019s, Dr. Moore and Dr. Storms, concluded before trial that Tharpe had borderline intellectual functioning but was not intellectually disabled. During the habeas proceedings, three other mental-health experts evaluated Tharpe: Dr. Marc Zimmerman and Dr. Barry Crown,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Tharpe\u2019s experts, and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>Glen King, the State\u2019s expert. Dr. Zimmerman in 1998 and Dr. King in 2007 each administered to Tharpe a WAIS-III test that yielded a score below 70 (a score of 66 and 67 respectively). Given the conflicting scores of the pre- and post-trial testing and because a sub-70 score on an I.Q. test does not alone entail a finding of intellectual disability under Georgia law, Judge Winegarden moved on to the other two requirements for establishing intellectual disability: impairment in adaptive behavior and the time at which any such impairment manifested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">Turning to Tharpe\u2019s adaptive behavior\u2014 how well Tharpe was able to meet common demands of daily life and how well Tharpe was able to meet the expectations of personal independence for a person in like circumstances \u2014 Judge Winegarden looked to the following categories of adaptive behavior identified by- the American Association on Intellectual and Development Disabilities <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>: (1) communication, (2) self-care, (3) home living, (4) social skills, (5) community use, (6) self-direction, (7) health and safety, (8) functional academics, (9) leisure, and (10) work. Dr. Zimmerman, Tharpe\u2019s expert, found significant deficiencies in five categories, home living, social skills, functional academics, self-direction, and work, and therefore concluded that Tharpe was intellectually disabled; Dr. King, the State\u2019s expert, found that Tharpe did not have significant deficiencies in any category, and thus concluded that Tharpe was not intellectually disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-8\">Tharpe challenged Dr. King\u2019s conclusion that Tharpe is not intellectually disabled on several grounds. Judge Winegarden considered and rejected the argument that the test on which Dr. King was relying, the ABAS-II, is inappropriate for evaluating subjects who are incarcerated because, in ,the ABAS-II manual, there is explicit recognition that the test is appropriate for use in prisons. Judge Winegarden also considered and rejected arguments that Dr. King\u2019s assessment was unreliable because Tharpe may have been lying in his responses to \u201clook good\u201d by adopting a \u201ccloak of competence\u201d and that Dr. King\u2019s assessment was unreasonable because it relied solely on the ABAS-II. Dr. King testified that during the interview portion of the ABAS-II Tharpe admitted on numerous occasions that he was unable or unlikely to engage in certain behavior and that Tharpe appeared responsive and varied his answers throughout. In addition to the ABAS-II, Judge Winegarden found that Dr. King had arrived at his conclusion by reviewing other aspects of Tharpe\u2019s historical data, including his medical ree-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>ords, school records, police records, and information contained in affidavits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">Judge Winegarden identified several inconsistencies in Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusions about the deficiencies in Tharpe\u2019s adaptive behavior. As to home living, Judge Winegarden found that \u2014 contrary to Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusion that Tharpe could act only \u201cupon direction\u201d\u2014 testimony from Tharpe and his friends and family established that Tharpe was, at least at times, independently able to cook, clean, operate small appliances, perform assorted household chores, take care of his children, make minor automotive repairs, write checks, deliver payments, shop for groceries, pass a driver\u2019s test, follow directions, and obey the rules and standards required of prisoners in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">As to social skills, Judge Winegarden rejected as unsupported Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusion that Tharpe\u2019s \u201clargely incoherent\u201d comments in conferences with the trial court demonstrated a significant deficiency in communication because Dr. Zimmerman admitted that he had not been present at those conferences, that he had not spoken to trial counsel about those conferences, and that the trial judge would likely have noticed if Tharpe\u2019s comments were incoherent (while there is no indication in the record that the judge noticed anything off about Tharpe\u2019s comments). Moreover, Judge Winegarden found that Tharpe reported being able to negotiate television-viewing schedules with his fellow inmates, maintaining a stable group of friends, consciously refraining from saying things that might hurt or embarrass others, and apologizing to others when he hurts their feelings. Family and friends testified that Tharpe has a \u201cgood heart\u201d and was a \u201cgood friend\u201d; he would help people if he saw their cars broken down on the side of the road; he would make friends with whom to fish and play cards; on occasion, he would bring fish he caught to an elderly friend; he remained married for eleven years; he would clean the house for his wife or take her out to dinners, movies, and parties; and he would buy his family Christmas presents and reward his children for good behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-8\">As to functional academics, Dr. Zimmerman concluded that Tharpe\u2019s low I.Q. scores, low grades, and four instances of being \u201csocially promoted\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> from one grade level to another demonstrate a significant deficiency of adaptive behavior. Judge Winegarden observed that the measure of an individual\u2019s competency in functional academics, which refer to the basic reading and mathematics skills needed for everyday life, cannot be captured by school records alone. Judge Winegarden further indicated that Tharpe\u2019s school records and the testimony about Tharpe\u2019s formal academic performance were too vague and imprecise to be of much use. Tharpe\u2019s school records are silent, for example, about why he had been \u201csocially promoted,\u201d and Tharpe offered only the affidavit of a former teacher who wrote that it was meant to \u201ckeep him with kids his own age.\u201d Tharpe\u2019s presence in classes labelled \u201cfundamental,\u201d which may or may not have designated the lowest track offered, and affidavits from family and friends describing Tharpe as \u201cslow\u201d were similarly unilluminating. In light of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>trary evidence showing that Tharpe was able to stick with his education for twelve years and graduate from high school, even if he struggled to do so, and that he can perform everyday skills like writing letters to his children and pen pals, reading time on a clock, correctly calculating the amount of money needed to make a purchase, and accurately keeping score when playing games, Judge Winegarden concluded that Tharpe displayed adequate adaptive behavior in functional academics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">As to self-direction, Dr. Zimmerman concluded that Tharpe displayed a significant deficiency in this adaptive behavior largely because Tharpe exhibited behavior after he shot and killed Jaquelin Freeman suggestive of an excessive reliance on his wife. Specifically, according to Dr. Zimmerman, Tharpe relied on Migrisus Tharpe for driving directions and advice in dealing with the police after the killing. Judge Winegarden, in contrast, concluded that these aspects of Tharpe\u2019s behavior after the killing were taken \u201cout of context\u201d and, when the surrounding events are taken together, Tharpe\u2019s actions actually demonstrate a great deal of self-direction: Tharpe relayed his plans to see his wife and made arrangements to borrow the truck used in the commission of his crimes on the night before; Tharpe brought a loaded rifle and arrived at the specific point on his wife\u2019s route to work at the specific time she would be there; and, when trying to secure a motel room in which to sexually assault his wife, Tharpe had the foresight to advise Migrisus that they would need to keep two dollars as gas money for their return trip. Judge Wine-garden noted that Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s analysis of Tharpe\u2019s purportedly excessive reliance on his wife failed to fully account for Tharpe\u2019s substance abuse and further found that other shortcomings, like Tharpe\u2019s general lack of budgeting habits and unwillingness to pay bills unless prompted, were not because Tharpe \u201ccould not do things without direction, but that he sometimes acted selfishly when it came to money and looking] out for his own desires.\u201d Combined with evidence of his ability to function independently recounted above (including his ability to cook, clean, travel, shop for groceries, care for his children, and engage in simple commercial transactions), Tharpe\u2019s ability to secure his own employment on multiple occasions precluded a showing of a significant deficiency in self-direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">Finally, as to work, Judge Winegarden rejected Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusion that Tharpe\u2019s checkered history of low-skilled and short-term employment demonstrated significant deficiency.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Judge Winegarden explained that Dr. Zimmerman had once again overlooked Tharpe\u2019s substance abuse as a potential cause for Tharpe\u2019s inconsistent work history, as well as other possible explanations such as Tharpe\u2019s low intellectual abilities, his correspondingly limited set of marketable skills, and the inherently unstable schedule of working in construction and similar fields based <em>on </em>availability. Judge Winegarden found no evidence in Tharpe\u2019s employment history that Tharpe had ever been fired for his inability to perform the work required of him.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>Accordingly, because there was not sufficient evidence of significant deficiencies in Tharpe\u2019s adaptive behavior and because there was no evidence in the record suggesting significantly sub-average intellectual functioning prior to age 18, Judge Winegarden concluded that Tharpe had failed to carry his burden to show that he is intellectually disabled even though \u201cintellectual testing, alone, places [Tharpe] in the sub-average range of intellectual functioning as required for a finding of\u2019 intellectual disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">After the Supreme Court of Georgia denied Tharpe a certificate of probable cause<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to grant certiorari, Tharpe next petitioned the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, which he later amended. The District Court denied Tharpe\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The District Court began its order denying relief by recounting the factual underpinnings of Tharpe\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Atkins </em>claims<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and laying out the deferential standard of review owed by federal courts to the decisions of state courts on collateral review. The District Court then rejected Tharpe\u2019s claims as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">The District Court held that Judge Winegarden\u2019s order denying Tharpe\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and did not involve an unreasonable determination of the facts. The District Court rejected, as foreclosed by precedent, Tharpe\u2019s preliminary argument that Judge Winegarden had almost verbatim, and thus improperly, relied on the State\u2019s proposed order in issuing his own order. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 572, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1510-11, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cWe, too, have criticized courts for their verbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties, \u2014 .... Nonetheless, our previous discussions of the subject suggest that even when the trial judge adopts proposed findings verbatim, the findings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.\u201d); <em>Rhode v. Hall, </em>582 F.3d 1273, 1281-82 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (rejecting the argument that a state court\u2019s habeas order adopting the State\u2019s proposed order \u201cverbatim\u201d in a capital ease is not entitled to deference under \u00a7 2254). Likewise, the District Court rejected Tharpe\u2019s argument that Judge Winegar-den\u2019s order was unreasonable because it failed to cite any post <em>-Strickland </em>precedent from the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 390-91, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1511-12, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (noting that \u201c[i]t is past question\u201d that <em>Strickland </em>itself, rather than subsequent applications of <em>Strickland, </em>provide the governing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>Turning to the heart of Tharpe\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>claim, the District Court held that it was not unreasonable or contrary to clearly established federal law for Judge Wine-garden to afford a greater, though not absolute, presumption of effective assistance because Newberry and Geeter were experienced counsel and their strategic decisions are accordingly due greater weight. <em>See Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1316 (11th- Cir. 2000) (en banc) (\u201cWhen courts are examining the performance of an experienced trial counsel, the presumption that his conduct was reasonable is even stronger.\u201d). The District Court also rejected Tharpe\u2019s argument that it was unreasonable for Judge Winegarden to conclude that Newberry and Geeter had conducted a reasonable investigation when Tharpe\u2019s mental health had not been evaluated by Dr. Moore prior to jury selection. The District Court held that Judge Wine-garden\u2019s conclusion was not unreasonable because Newberry and Geeter had begun other aspects of their mitigation investigation prior to jury selection, had received Dr. Storms\u2019s evaluation that Tharpe was not intellectually disabled and had been malingering prior to trial, and had decided to proceed to trial quickly to ensure that Migrisus Tharpe and other witnesses would still be willing to testify on Tharpe\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">The District Court also considered and rejected a host of cases that, according to Tharpe, dictate the outcome of the required <em>Strickland </em>analysis into Newberry and Geeter\u2019s mitigation efforts during their investigation and at trial: <em>Sears v. Upton, </em>561 U.S. 945, 130 S.Ct. 3259, 177 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2010) (per curiam), <em>Porter v. McCollum, </em>558 U.S. 30, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009) (per curiam), <em>Rompilla v. Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005), <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003), <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), <em>Ferrell v. Hall, </em>640 F.3d 1199 (11th Cir. 2011), <em>Lawhorn v. Allen, </em>519 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir. 2008), and <em>Fleming v. Zant, </em>259 Ga. 687, 386 S.E.2d 339 (1989). The District Court found each of these cases to be factually and legally distinguishable from Tharpe\u2019s, if not completely irrelevant. Unlike the cases listed above, in which counsel performed an unreasonably limited investigation by ignoring certain \u201cred flags\u201d about a habeas petitioner\u2019s upbringing or mental-health status, the District Court observed that the record before it showed that Newberry and Geeter undertook a meaningful investigation and thereafter developed a mitigation strategy in line with what they discovered; neither Tharpe nor the friends and family to whom New-berry and Geeter were referred by Tharpe suggested that Tharpe had had a troubled or deprived background, and the evidence that was later elicited to this end during evidentiary hearings on state collateral review consisted largely of testimony from witnesses that contradicted those same witnesses\u2019 testimony at sentencing. The District Court also held that the record showed, contrary to Tharpe\u2019s position, that Newberry and Geeter engaged in a \u201ccost benefit analysis\u201d of all the evidence available to them at the time before deciding to portray Tharpe as an otherwise good man who succumbed to his emotions in shooting Jaquelin Freeman \u2014 a strategic choice whose force may have been undercut had Newberry and Geeter simultaneously tried to diminish Tharpe\u2019s culpability by introducing his substance abuse, his low intellectual functioning, and his unstable work history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">As a result, the District Court concluded that Judge Winegarden\u2019s denial of Tharpe\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">The District Court likewise held that Judge Winegarden\u2019s order denying Tharpe\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>intellectual-disability claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and did not involve an unreasonable determination of the facts. The District Court, noting Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s and Dr. King\u2019s dueling conclusions about Tharpe\u2019s adaptive behavior, held that Judge Winegarden\u2019s factual determinations concerning Tharpe\u2019s adaptive behavior were not unreasonable in light of the record.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Significant to the District Court\u2019s analysis, Georgia\u2019s standard for establishing intellectual disability in the death-penalty context required Tharpe to prove that he was intellectually disabled, including that he suffered significant deficiencies in adaptive behavior, beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-7-131(c)(3). Although Tharpe contended that Georgia\u2019s intellectual-disability standard is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, contrary precedent from the Georgia Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit bound the District Court. <em>See Hill v. Humphrey, </em>662 F.3d 1335, 1360-61 (11th Cir. 2011) (en banc); <em>Stripling v. State, </em>289 Ga. 370, 711 S.E.2d 665, 668 (2011) (citing <em>Head v. Hill, </em>277 Ga. 255, 587 S.E.2d 613 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">The District Court thus denied Tharpe\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim as well. At the end of its order denying Tharpe\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, the District Court issued a COA capturing part of Tharpe\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. As mentioned above, this Court later granted Tharpe\u2019s request to amend the COA to expand the scope of Tharpe\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>claim and include his <em>Atkins </em>intellectual-disability claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-11\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> federal courts reviewing habeas petitions from persons in state custody pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 can grant relief only if the state court\u2019s adjudication on the merits<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>able application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> With this standard in mind, we review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of relief of a \u00a7 2254 petition, as we do a district court\u2019s legal conclusions and resolutions of mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Jones v. GDCP Warden, </em>753 F.8d 1171, 1181 (11th Cir. 2014). We review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings of facts. <em>Holsey v. Warden, Ga. Diagnostic Prison, </em>694 F.3d 1230, 1256 (11th Cir. 2012). In circumstances like those we face here \u2014 that is, when reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition that did not involve any factual findings beyond those of the relevant state court\u2014 a federal court of appeals is in the same position of reviewing the contested state-court adjudication as was the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Under \u00a7 2254(d), AEDPA provides for limited federal review of state courts\u2019 decisions in two respects.. First, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) provides for federal review for claims of state courts\u2019 erroneous legal conclusions. As explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), \u00a7 2254(d)(1) consists of two distinct clauses: a \u201ccontrary to\u201d clause and an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause. The \u201ccontrary to\u201d clause allows for relief only \u201cif the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 120 S.Ct. at 1523 (plurality opinion). The \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause allows for relief only \u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-9\">Second, \u00a7 2254(d)(2) provides for federal review for claims of state courts\u2019 erroneous factual determinations. Section 2254(d)(2) allows federal courts to grant relief only if the state court\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s claim \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). The Supreme Court has not yet defined \u00a7 2254(d)(2)s \u201cprecise relationship\u201d to \u00a7 2254(e)(1), which imposes a burden on the petitioner to rebut the state court\u2019s factual findings \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>See Burt v. Titlow, </em>571 U.S. -, \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 10, 15, 187 L.Ed.2d 348 (2013); <em>accord Brumfield v. Cain, </em>576 U.S.-,-, 135 S.Ct. 2269, 2282, 192 L.Ed.2d 356 (2015). Whatever that \u201cprecise relationship\u201d may be, \u201c \u2018a state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Titlow, </em>571 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 15 (quoting <em>Wood v. Allen, </em>558 U.S. 290, 301, 130 S.Ct. 841, 849, 175 L.Ed.2d 738 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>The significant deference under \u00a7 2254(d) owed by the federal courts to state courts\u2019 decisions is rooted in AEDPA\u2019s commitment to comity, federalism, and the finality of judgments. Because \u201cstate courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s standard of review \u201cstops short of imposing a complete bar on federal-court relitigation of claims already rejected in state proceedings.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 102-03, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Federal courts may grant habeas relief only when a state court blundered in a manner so \u201cwell understood and comprehended in existing law\u201d and \u201cwas so lacking in justification\u201d that \u201cthere is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102-03, 131 S.Ct. at 786-87. A petitioner must show that the state court\u2019s decision was \u201c \u2018objectively unreasonable,\u2019 not merely wrong; even \u2018clear error\u2019 will not suffice.\u201d <em>White v. Woodall, </em>572 U.S. -, -, 134 S.Ct. 1697, 1702, 188 L.Ed.2d 698 (2014) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIf this standard is difficult to meet, that is because it was meant to be.\u201d <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">Tharpe\u2019s first theory of relief is that trial counsel deprived him of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that Judge Wine-garden\u2019s legal conclusions and factual determinations to the contrary warrant reversal even when viewed through \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s deferential lens. Under <em>Strickland\u2019s, </em>familiar two-part test, Tharpe must show that counsel\u2019s performance (1) \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and (2) \u201cprejudiced the defense.\u201d 466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Considering \u201cthe variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel\u201d and \u201cthe range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant,\u201d review of counsel\u2019s effectiveness is \u201chighly deferential\u201d to respect \u201cthe wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. \u201c[A]ll the circumstances\u201d must be viewed \u201cfrom counsel\u2019s perspective at the time\u201d because it is \u201call too easy\u201d for a court \u201cto second-guess\u201d counsel\u2019s decisions after an outcome unfavorable to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. In order to establish prejudice casting doubt on the reliability of the result and thus the constitutionally assured fairness of the trial, the defendant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d requires that \u201c[t]he likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\u201d <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S. at 112, 131 S.Ct. at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-11\">When a habeas petitioner in state custody raises a <em>Strickland </em>claim in federal court, the commands of <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) operate in tandem so that our review is \u201cdoubly deferential.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 6, 124 S.Ct. 1, 4, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003) (per curiam). In these cases, a federal court may grant relief only if counsel\u2019s representation fell below <em>Strickland! </em>s highly deferential standard of objectively reasonable performance <em>and </em>the state court\u2019s contrary decision would be untenable to any fairminded jurist under \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s similarly difficult-to-meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>standard. Overcoming this double deference is therefore possible only in the rare instance when it is overwhelmingly certain that both counsel and the state court failed to carry out their respective roles with the requisite degree of competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">Tharpe identifies two aspects of trial counsel\u2019s performance that he believes warrant relief. First, Tharpe faults his trial counsel for fading to conduct an adequate investigation into his mental-health status, his history of substance abuse, and the circumstances of his upbringing. Second, Tharpe argues that his trial counsel were ineffective because, whether or not counsel\u2019s investigation was adequate, counsel\u2019s presentation of the available mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of Tharpe\u2019s trial was deficient. Because we conclude that Tharpe has failed to show that Judge Winegarden\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel\u2019s performance constituted anything but effective assistance under <em>Strickland </em>was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established law and because that conclusion was not based upon unreasonable factual determinations, we do not reach whether, had counsel been ineffective, Tharpe would be able to make the additional required showing of prejudice.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">Tharpe first challenges Judge Winegar-den\u2019s legal conclusions and factual determinations regarding the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s investigation into his mental-health status, substance abuse, and upbringing. Specifically, Tharpe contests the conclusion that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not objectively unreasonable because they made only a \u201ccursory and superficial background investigation,\u201d relied on their \u201cignorance of the law\u201d in their search for mitigating evidence, and ignored \u201ccritical \u2018red flags\u2019 pointing to life-long mental impairments and other problems.\u201d Based on the available evidence, the court erred by finding that Tharpe\u2019s \u201cintellectual functioning was never in doubt\u201d and he \u201cwas a well-adjusted member of society portraying no symptoms of intellectual disability or other mental problems.\u201d Had trial counsel conducted a meaningful investigation, Tharpe maintains, they would have discovered that Tharpe had been \u201craised in a \u2018shot house\u2019 among alcoholics by his violently abusive mother\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>; that Tharpe \u201csuffers from significant cognitive and intellectual deficits as well as organic brain damage,\u201d which \u201clikely resulted from Mr. Tharpe\u2019s exposure to brain damaging intoxicants <em>in \u00fatero\u201d; </em>that Tharpe began drinking at an early age, getting drunk to the point of passing out by the time he was ten years old; and that Tharpe performed poorly academically and socially as a result. Trial counsel\u2019s allegedly inadequate investigation thus fell below the Sixth Amendment\u2019s performance standard under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">We disagree. Based on the factual record \u2014 which we see no reason, and certainly no reason sufficient under \u00a7 2254\u2019s deferential lens, to upset \u2014 a fairminded jurist could easily have concluded that Newberry and Geeter\u2019s investigation into Tharpe\u2019s background constituted reasonable assistance of counsel under the eir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>cumstances known to Newberry and Geeter at the time. Newberry and Geeter each met with prosecutors, law-enforcement officials, former employers, and friends and family who knew Tharpe, as well as meeting multiple times with Tharpe himself. Through these interviews, Newberry and Geeter were made aware of aspects of Tharpe\u2019s history of substance abuse, which included a conviction for violating Georgia\u2019s habitual traffic violator law, and his unstable work history. As Judge Winegar-den found, which was not an unreasonable factual determination, Newberry and Geeter had not been made aware of, nor had they been given any reason to suspect, the troubling account of Tharpe\u2019s childhood now presented as justifying relief \u2014 despite their having interviewed many of the witnesses, including Tharpe and those close to him, who provided testimony at sentencing that is now contradicted by those same witnesses\u2019 testimony on state collateral review. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Head, </em>185 F.3d 1223, 1237 (11th Cir. 1999) (\u201cAn attorney does not render ineffective assistance by failing to discover and develop evidence of childhood abuse that his client does not mention to him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Moreover, Tharpe was evaluated by two mental-health experts during the investigation: Dr. Storms, the State\u2019s expert, and Dr. Moore, the expert retained by New-berry and Geeter. Neither Dr. Storms nor Dr. Moore concluded that Tharpe was intellectually disabled, only that Tharpe had borderline intellectual functioning. They also referred to Tharpe variously as \u201cmean\u201d and \u201ca mean son of a bitch.\u201d It is true that Dr. Moore made his evaluation of Tharpe only after jury selection had begun. But having Dr. Moore\u2019s evaluation take place relatively late in the investigation was itself a function of Newberry and Geeter\u2019s strategic choice to proceed to trial in an expedited fashion to avoid the loss of mitigation witnesses\u2019 testimony, most notably that of Migrisus Tharpe, the only other witness to the murder of Jaquelin Freeman and herself a victim of Tharpe\u2019s crimes. And it is these sort of in-the-trenches strategic decisions that are precisely \u201cthe sort of calculated risk that lies at the heart of an advocate\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Gentry, </em>540 U.S. at 9, 124 S.Ct. at 6. Taking all this together, Judge Winegar-den did not unreasonably conclude that Newberry and Geeter\u2019s investigation satisfied the standard of adequate counsel in line with <em>Strickland </em>demanded by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">None of the eases cited by Tharpe in his briefing to this court,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> which are specific applications of <em>Strickland </em>to materially different factual circumstances, are to the contrary. Tharpe cites <em>Rompilla v. Beard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>545 U.S. 374, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005), and <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003), for the proposition that Newberry and Geeter, by failing to uncover the full circumstances of Tharpe\u2019s upbringing later adduced on state collateral review, had ignored certain \u201cred flags\u201d in their investigation. Neither <em>Rompilla </em>nor <em>Wiggins, </em>however, support Tharpe\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">As Justice Souter reminds us in the beginning of his decision for the court in <em>Rompilla, </em>the reasonableness standard of Strickland\u2019s performance prong is analyzed \u201cas if one stood in counsel\u2019s shoes\u201d and accordingly \u201cspawns few hard-edged rules.\u201d 545 U.S. at 381, 125 S.Ct. at 2462. Depending on the circumstances, counsel may fail to make an adequate mitigation investigation either by conducting no meaningful investigation at all or by unreasonably failing to follow up on certain leads despite conducting an otherwise-reasonable investigation. Thus, counsel in <em>Rompilla </em>were held to have conducted an inadequate investigation despite having interviewed the defendant, five members of the defendant\u2019s family, and three mental-health experts because counsel failed to examine the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for rape and assault, a \u201creadily available\u201d public document located \u201cat the very courthouse where\u201d the defendant\u2019s trial would be held. <em>See id. </em>at 381-84, 125 S.Ct. at 2462-64. Counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was unreasonable because that conviction could serve as an \u201caggravator\u201d under Pennsylvania\u2019s death-penalty law <em>and </em>counsel knew, as evidenced in a \u201cplea letter\u201d written by counsel, that prosecutors planned to seek the death penalty on the basis of that conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 383-84, 125 S.Ct. at 2464; <em>see also id. </em>at 390, 125 S.Ct. at 2467 (\u201cOther situations, where a defense lawyer is not charged with knowledge that the prosecutor intends to use a prior conviction in this way, might well warrant a different assessment.\u201d). Notably, the <em>Rompilla </em>Court did not address whether other asserted failings of counsel \u2014 the failure to investigate the defendant\u2019s school records, criminal history as a juvenile, and history of substance abuse when the testimony of the witnesses\u2019 interviewed by counsel may have required further investigation \u2014 except to say \u201cthat there is room for debate about trial counsel\u2019s obligation to follow at least some of those potential lines of enqui-ry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 125 S.Ct. at 2463; <em>see also id. </em>at 395, 125 S.Ct. at 2470 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (highlighting that counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the defendant\u2019s prior conviction \u201cwas not the result of an informed tactical decision about how the lawyers\u2019 time would best be spent\u201d). Given the obvious and material differences between the dispositive facts of <em>Rompilla </em>and those present here, <em>Rompilla </em>is not controlling of Tharpe\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">Tharpe\u2019s reliance on <em>Wiggins </em>is similarly misplaced. In <em>Wiggins, </em>the Supreme Court held that defense counsel\u2019s investigation into the violent and sexual abuse inflicted upon the defendant during childhood fell below the objective standard of reasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. Counsel\u2019s investigation \u201cdrew from three sources\u201d: the report of a psychologist who conducted a battery of tests on the defendant, the defendant\u2019s presentence investigation report, and the defendant\u2019s foster-care records from the Baltimore City Department of Social Services. <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 523, 123 S.Ct. at 2536. Despite evidence in those records showing the defendant\u2019s deprived and troubled upbringing (though not the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse), counsel did not retain a forensic social worker to create a social-history report, which was standard among capital practitioners in Maryland at the time, despite having funds available to do so, and conducted no further investigation. <em>See id. </em>at 523-25, 123 S.Ct. at 2536-37. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>revealed that counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to investigate thoroughly resulted from inattention, not reasoned strategic judgment\u201d because, \u201cuntil the day before sentencing,\u201d counsel maintained that they would be putting on a mitigation defense if the trial court granted counsel\u2019s motion to bifurcate the penalty phase.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 526, 123 S.Ct. at 2537-38. Because \u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation,\u201d counsel\u2019s failure to fully apprise themselves of potentially mitigating aspects of the defendant\u2019s life history was unreasonable in the face of such obvious indications. <em>Id. </em>at 527-28, 123 S.Ct. at 2538-39 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066). The <em>Wiggins </em>Court ended its analysis of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>performance prong by \u201cemphasizing] that <em>Strickland </em>does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 123 S.Ct. at 2541. As with <em>Rompil-la, </em>the obvious and material differences between <em>Wiggins </em>and Tharpe\u2019s case preclude <em>Wiggins </em>from being controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Nor does the rationale underlying <em>Rom-pilla </em>and <em>Wiggins </em>support Tharpe\u2019s argument; indeed, the core of <em>Strickland, </em>and thus of <em>Rompilla </em>and <em>Wiggins </em>as well\u2014 ensuring counsel\u2019s broad discretion in making strategic decisions about representation within the range of reasonable professional conduct under the unique circumstances and challenges presented by the case under review \u2014 directly undermines that argument. Tharpe has failed to identify, either in briefing or when pressed at oral argument, what \u201cred flags\u201d requiring further investigation concerning Tharpe\u2019s background should have been seen by Newberry and Geeter under the circumstances as they knew or reasonably should have known them to be at the time of their investigation. Instead, Tharpe merely conflates the existence of a contrary picture of Tharpe\u2019s upbringing developed ex post on collateral review with Newberry and Geeter\u2019s therefore-inadequate ex ante actions. Though Newberry and Geeter surely could have investigated Tharpe\u2019s background even further than they did, as will always be true for any lawyer not blessed with unlimited time and resources, the record shows that both the scope and content of their investigation were the result of informed strategic decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">A fairminded jurist could, as Judge Win-egarden did, reasonably conclude that their investigation was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">Tharpe next challenges trial counsel\u2019s mitigation strategy at the penalty phase, regardless of the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s investigation. Tharpe points us again to his \u201ctraumatic and deprived upbringing,\u201d his \u201cearly introduction to alcohol,\u201d and his \u201cfamily[\u2019s] history of intoxicant abuse and addiction.\u201d Had these aspects of his identity and life experience been shared with the jury, they could have garnered sympathy and diminished Tharpe\u2019s perceived culpability. Because it was unreasonable for trial counsel to forgo this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>route of mitigation under the circumstances confronting counsel, Tharpe argues, Judge Winegarden unreasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>when he concluded that trial counsel\u2019s performance had been constitutionally adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">We decline Tharpe\u2019s invitation to second-guess Newberry and Geeter\u2019s decision of how to proceed with the mitigation presentation to the jury at sentencing. That decision, which we concluded above was informed by a reasonable investigation, is \u201cvirtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066 (\u201c[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d). Newberry and Geeter sought to portray Tharpe as a good guy who made a mistake at an emotionally fraught time but who nonetheless deserved the jury\u2019s mercy. The efficacy of that approach may well have been diminished had Newberry and Geeter simultaneously presented testimony portraying Tharpe as an alcoholic with low intellectual functioning and a troubled past. Instead of crediting Tharpe\u2019s unfortunate circumstances as making him less culpable in the murder of Jaquelin Freeman, the jury could have concluded instead that Tharpe was not willing to accept responsibility for his actions, thus sinking Tharpe\u2019s credibility and undermining both the good-character defense and the diminished-capacity defense. <em>Cf. Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. 170, 197, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1407-08, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (\u201cThe current infatuation with \u2018humanizing\u2019 the defendant as the be-all and end-all of mitigation disregards the possibility that this may be the wrong tactic in some cases because experienced lawyers conclude that the jury simply won\u2019t buy it.\u201d (quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Pinholster v. Ayers, </em>590 F.3d 651, 692 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>563 U.S. 170, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (Kozinski, C.J., dissenting))). The uncertainty about these sorts of tradeoffs is especially salient because presenting the evidence that Tharpe now contends New-berry and Geeter unconstitutionally failed to present may have also exposed the jury to Tharpe\u2019s history of substance abuse, his unstable work history, and Dr. Storms\u2019s and Dr. Moore\u2019s impressions of Tharpe as \u201cmean\u201d and a \u201cmean son of a bitch\u201d\u2014 exposure that, on balance, may have done more harm to the image of Tharpe as a person of good character than would be outweighed by any corresponding dimin-ishment of his culpability. <em>Cf.

Though it is true that Newberry and Geeter\u2019s chosen mitigation strategy did not achieve the desired result, we cannot say that it was unreasonable solely for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Sears v. Upton, </em>561 U.S. 945, 130 S.Ct. 3259, 177 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2010) (per curiam), <em>Porter v. McCollum, </em>558 U.S. 30, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009) (per curiam), and <em>Williams v. Taylor </em>are not to the contrary.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In <em>Sears, </em>which the Court reviewed directly after the State\u2019s collateral proceedings and thus did not invoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>\u00a7 2254\u2019s deferential lens, the Court held there was a constitutionally inadequate investigation that \u201cshould have, at the very least, called into question the reasonableness of [counsel\u2019s mitigation] theory\u201d and remanded to the state court for a determination under \u201cthe proper prejudice inquiry,\u201d which is not categorically limited to instances when counsel presents \u201conly \u2018little or no mitigation evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>561 U.S. at 953-54, 130 S.Ct. 3259-66.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In <em>Porter, </em>the Court concluded that counsel had failed to present an adequate case for mitigation when counsel unreasonably \u201cfailed to uncover and present any evidence of Porter\u2019s mental health or mental impairment, his family background, or his military service,\u201d which would have been substantial mitigation evidence. <em>See </em>558 U.S. at 40-44, 130 S.Ct. at 453-56. And in <em>Williams, </em>the Court held counsel\u2019s mitigation strategy unreasonable when counsel \u201cdid not fulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background\u201d and thus failed to uncover the defendant\u2019s \u201cnightmarish childhood,\u201d leading counsel to ignore available evidence of the defendant\u2019s mitigating life circumstances. <em>See </em>529 U.S. at 395-96, 120 S.Ct. at 1514-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">In <em>Sears, Porter, </em>and <em>Williams, </em>then, counsel\u2019s mitigation theory was unreasonably chosen (or, in the case of <em>Sears, </em>potentially unreasonably chosen) precisely because counsel had failed to conduct a constitutionally adequate investigation, which precluded counsel from conscientiously selecting among the available mitigation theories. Among other relevant differences between those cases and Tharpe\u2019s, it is of critical import here that Newberry and Geeter first conducted a reasonable investigation before finally settling on a mitigation strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">A fairminded jurist could, as Judge Win-egarden did, reasonably conclude that Newberry and Geeter\u2019s mitigation strategy was reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, we conclude that Tharpe has failed to show that he is entitled to relief on his <em>Strickland </em>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-9\">Tharpe\u2019s second theory of relief is that he is intellectually disabled for purposes of the Eighth Amendment and thus ineligible for the death penalty under <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and that \u00a7 2254(d) does not require us to defer to Judge Winegarden\u2019s contrary legal conclusions and factual determinations. Tharpe begins this part of his argument by pointing us to the standardized testing suggesting that his I.Q. score falls somewhere between a 73 and a 66 and to testimony elicited on state collateral review suggesting that Tharpe\u2019s impairments in adaptive functioning manifested prior to age 18. As mentioned above, Georgia\u2019s death-penalty law requires that Tharpe also show beyond a reasonable doubt impairments in his adaptive behavior to prove that he is intellectually disabled. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-7-131(a)(3). And this panel, no less than the District Court, is bound by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s en banc ruling upholding the constitutionality of that aspect of Georgia\u2019s death-penalty law, at least for purposes of AEDPA review. <em>See Hill v. Humphrey, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>662 F.3d 1335, 1360-61 (11th Cir. 2011) (en banc). Accordingly, we will limit our review to the heart of the matter: whether Judge Winegarden unreasonably concluded that Tharpe had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Tharpe suffers from significant deficiencies in his adaptive behavior.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">Regarding his adaptive behavior, Tharpe now argues that \u201cthe evidence before the state court overwhelmingly supported a finding of significant adaptive deficits in at least two of the ten enumerated areas\u201d: functional academics and work.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As to functional academics, Tharpe points to evidence introduced on state collateral review allegedly showing that, \u201c[ajlthough [he] completed the twelfth grade,\u201d he struggled throughout his school career; that some of his teachers labelled him \u201cslow\u201d and testified that he had been repeatedly \u201csocially promoted\u201d from one grade to the next; that Tharpe was enrolled in \u201cslow-tracked\u201d vocational programs in high school; and that Tharpe \u201cfunctions at approximately a 6th grade level.\u201d As to work, Tharpe claims that his employment had generally been of short duration and low skill, and that he \u201cnever' progressed beyond rudimentary employment skills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">Tharpe also argues that Judge Winegar-den unreasonably credited the findings and conclusions of the State\u2019s mental-health expert while failing to sufficiently credit the findings and conclusions of Tharpe\u2019s experts. Tharpe argues that Judge Winegarden\u2019s credibility determinations were unreasonable because Dr. King, the State\u2019s mental-health expert who examined Tharpe on state collateral review, based his report on his own and other mental-health experts\u2019 findings but failed to \u201clist any source, apart from Mr. Tharpe himself, which would shed light upon Mr. Tharpe\u2019s day-to-day adaptive functioning skills.\u201d In contrast, Dr. Zimmerman relied on affidavits of Tharpe\u2019s friends and family; Tharpe\u2019s school, work, and medical records; other mental-health experts\u2019 findings; and excerpts of Tharpe\u2019s testimony before the trial court. Tharpe also maintains that Dr. King improperly relied on the ABAS-II test as part of his evaluation of Tharpe. In making this argument, Tharpe directs our attention to the testimony of Dr. Thomas Oakland, a co-author of the ABAS-II, providing that the test may fail to capture accurate results for purposes of establishing a person\u2019s level of adaptive behavior if administered on patients in prison or those who display evidence of intellectual disability or low intellectual functioning.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Tharpe argues that Judge Winegarden\u2019s reliance on Dr. King despite Dr. Oakland\u2019s testimony about the ABAS-II, testimony which Judge Wine-garden did not explicitly address in his order denying Tharpe habeas relief, taken together with the other evidence elicited from the evidentiary hearings on state collateral review, could reasonably support only the conclusion that Tharpe had prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>en that he suffers from significant impairments in his adaptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">Whether Tharpe merely has borderline intellectual functioning or whether Tharpe is fully intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for the death penalty for purposes of <em>Atkins </em>ultimately boils down to a question of degree as to the extent of the deficiencies in Tharpe\u2019s adaptive behavior. And the mental-health experts who have examined Tharpe have been divided in their conclusions. Dr. Moore and Dr. Storms, who examined Tharpe before trial, both concluded that Tharpe was not intellectually disabled. So did Dr. King, who examined Tharpe on state collateral review. In contrast, Dr. Crown and Dr. Zimmerman, who also examined Tharpe on state collateral review, concluded that Tharpe was intellectually disabled. Of course, the mere existence of a division in expert opinion does not necessarily preclude Tharpe from having established that he is intellectually disabled beyond a reasonable doubt, as Tharpe rightly contends. To make that determination, we must assess the content and basis of these experts\u2019 opinion in light of the evidence in the record. And there is insufficient evidence presented here to establish that Judge Winegarden\u2019s conclusion that Tharpe did not suffer from significant deficiencies in adaptive behavior was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">Limiting our review of Tharpe\u2019s adaptive behavior to the categories of functional academics and work, as Tharpe now suggests we should, there is sufficient evidence in the record for a fairminded jurist to conclude that Tharpe did not suffer significant deficiencies. As to functional ac.ademics, we note that there is evidence showing, among other things, that Tharpe was able to graduate high school and that he can read, write, and perform the basic mathematical tasks required of daily life such as engaging in routine commercial transactions and taking measurements without the assistance of others. As to work, there is evidence showing that Tharpe was repeatedly able to independently find, secure, and ably perform work in a number of positions throughout his life. Notably, there is no evidence in the record showing that Tharpe was ever terminated from a position for an inability to perform the work required of him, while there is evidence suggesting that his admittedly unstable work history resulted, at least in part, from Tharpe\u2019s substance abuse and issues with rage. And this evidence of Tharpe\u2019s adaptive abilities does not depend on either the extent of Judge Winegarden\u2019s reliance on the portion of Dr. King\u2019s testimony drawn from the ABAS-II test or whether Dr. King\u2019s use of the ABAS-II test was appropriately administered under the circumstances, issues which we need not decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">Moreover, while Tharpe spends much of his argument targeting the allegedly insufficient basis for Dr. King\u2019s conclusions, he largely neglects to mention the shortcomings identified by Judge Wine-garden in the dueling testimony of Tharpe\u2019s preferred expert, Dr. Zimmerman. Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusion that Tharpe is intellectually disabled stems largely from witnesses\u2019 testimony in affidavits generated for evidentiary hearings on state collateral review, much of which may be deemed of dubious value as significant portions of the testimony directly contradict those witnesses\u2019 statements at sentencing. Judge Winegarden found similarly dubious many of Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusions about Tharpe\u2019s adaptive behavior, including Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusions about Tharpe\u2019s abilities in functional academics and work. For example, Judge Winegarden faulted Dr. Zimmerman for relying too heavily on considerations such as grades, I.Q. scores, and vague statements largely devoid of context such as those from non-experts de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>scribing Tharpe as \u201cslow,\u201d as having been \u201csocially promoted,\u201d and as having been enrolled in \u201cfundamental\u201d classes, while at the same time ignoring evidence of Tharpe\u2019s ability to function independently outside a formal academic context. Judge Winegarden also faulted Dr. Zimmerman for overweighting the short-term and low-skilled nature of Tharpe\u2019s employment history because Dr. Zimmerman failed to address other potentially causal explanations for Tharpe\u2019s employment history such as Tharpe\u2019s history of substance abuse, his generally low level of intellectual functioning, and his limited qualifications. Given all this, we agree that the record shows that Tharpe suffered some degree of impairment in his adaptive behavior due to his low intellectual functioning and history of substance abuse. We do not agree, however, that Tharpe has shown, as he must to overcome the deference demanded by \u00a7 2254, that these deficiencies are so significant that no fair-minded jurist could reasonably conclude that Tharpe had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his impaired behavior qualified him as intellectually disabled for purposes of Georgia\u2019s death-penalty law.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">Accordingly, we reject Tharpe\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>intellectual-disability claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-10\">For the foregoing reasons, Tharpe has failed to show that he is entitled to the relief he seeks under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.

Dr. Crown\u2019s work in capital cases is not unfamiliar to this Court. Perhaps in part because of this familiarity, Tharpe relies more heavily on the testimony of Dr. Zimmerman than that of Dr. Crown. <em>See, e.g., Reaves v. Sec\u2019y, Fla.

In contrast to the range of materials relied on by Dr. Ring, Judge Winegarden found that Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusion relied in large part on information relayed in affidavits from Tharpe\u2019s friends and family, which contradicted many of the affiants earlier statements at sentencing and were found to be of dubious value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">.

Judge Winegarden did find, however, that Tharpe had been fired from various positions for'non-performance-related reasons including Tharpe\u2019s termination from a truck center after he was picked up by the police and failed to either contact the truck center or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>ever return to work. Moreover, as trial counsel\u2019s notes reveal, one of Tharpe\u2019s former supervisors had reported that Tharpe displayed issues with rage and had brought firearms to the workplace.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">. The Georgia Supreme Court denied Tharpe a certificate of probable cause over the dissent of then-Chief Justice Hunstein. Justice Thompson took no part in that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1322-11\">. Although Tharpe purported to claim in his briefing before the District Court that he was not abandoning various other claims for relief, the District Court summarily denied relief on all other grounds because Tharpe had failed to address those claims in detail and, in any event, had failed to carry his burden of showing that the state courts' adjudications on those claims warrant reversal under the deference required by \u00a7 2254.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">. The District Court, giving his order the \"benefit of the doubt\u201d required by \u00a7 2254's deferential standard, concluded that Judge Winegarden had not, as Tharpe contended, understood Georgia's law governing intellectual disability to require a diagnosis before age 18. Rather, the District Court read the order as stating only that the lack of such a diagnosis was \"compelling evidence\u201d that Tharpe had not shown impairment manifested during the developmental period. In any event, the \"real dispute among the experts\u201d was whether Tharpe could demonstrate significant deficiencies in adaptive behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">. AEDPA governs review for habeas petitions seeking relief in federal court that are filed after April 24, 1996.

As we have recently held, the adjudication on the merits we are reviewing in cases like Tharpe\u2019s is the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s denial of a certificate of probable cause. <em>See Wilson v. Warden, </em>834 F.3d 1336, 2016 WL 4440381 (11th Cir. Aug. 23, 2016). Our analysis does not change whether we analyze the decision of the Superior Court of Butts County or that of the Georgia Supreme Court because we must affirm if there is any reasonable basis for doing so and Judge Winegarden provided such a reasonable basis. <em>See Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 98, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (\"Where a state court\u2019s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner's burden [under \u00a7 2254(d) ] still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.\u201d). For simplicity and clarity we will therefore discuss only the reasoning given by Judge Winegarden, even though we are actually reviewing the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1325-6\"><em>. </em>In its entirety, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-7\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-16\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArLA\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">. The Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel in capital cases has been incorporated against the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for nearly a century. <em>See Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 71, 53 S.Ct. 55, 65, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">. Because we hold that Tharpe has failed to carry his burden as to Strickland\u2019s performance prong, we need not reach Tharpe's argument that Judge Winegarden misstated or misapplied <em>Strickland's </em>prejudice prong in the sentencing context. <em>Cf. Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 537, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 2543, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (\"Had the jury been able to place petitioner\u2019s excruciating life history on the mitigating side of the scale, there is reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1327-12\">. \"Shot house\u201d is a slang term for an illicit bar where liquor is sold at low prices, often by the shot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">. Nor do the cases supplied by Tharpe as supplemental authority show that Judge Win-egarden's conclusions were unreasonable. In <em>Hardwick v. Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, </em>we held that there had been a showing of ineffective assistance under <em>Strickland </em>regarding counsel\u2019s investigation in a capital case when counsel \"was aware of a number of red flags\u201d concerning his client's ' life circumstances yet \"did not conduct a life-history investigation or follow up on any leads\u201d or attempt to undertake \"even a rudimentary mitigation investigation.\u201d 803 F.3d 541, 552-54 (11th Cir. 2015). Similarly, in <em>Cooper v. Secretary, Department of Corrections, </em>we held counsel\u2019s investigation to be ineffective under <em>Strickland </em>in a capital case when counsel \"unreasonably decided to end the background investigation after only talking to\u201d the defendant, the defendant's mother, and one mental-health expert, and when counsel was aware that the defendant had been violently abused by his father yet counsel failed to contact the defendant\u2019s siblings or otherwise engage in further investigative efforts. 646 F.3d 1328, 1351-52 (11th Cir. 2011). Because Newberry and Geeter\u2019s investigative efforts were far more capable than, and materially different from, those of counsel in <em>Hardwick </em>and <em>Cooper, </em>those cases are relevant here only so far as they help frame the <em>Strickland </em>inquiry generally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">. Wiggins elected to be tried by a judge during the guilt-innocence phase of his trial. <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 514-15, 123 S.Ct. at 2532. Counsel\u2019s main trial strategy in <em>Wiggins </em>at the penalty phase, which was conducted before a jury, was to argue to the jury that someone other than the defendant was principally responsible for the crime that the judge had found the defendant guilty of committing; after the trial court denied the motion to bifurcate proceedings, counsel declined to present a serious case for mitigation. <em>See Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 515-16, 526, 123 S.Ct. at 2532, 2538 (observing that \"counsel put on a halfhearted mitigation case, taking ... [a] 'shotgun' approach\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">. To the extent Tharpe is also citing <em>Sears, Porter, </em>and <em>Williams </em>for the proposition that his counsel's mitigation investigation was unreasonable, we reject Tharpe\u2019s reliance on those cases for the same reason we rejected his reliance on <em>Rompilla </em>and <em>Wiggins'. </em>Tharpe has simply failed to show, under the factual circumstances presented here, \"red flags\u201d Newberiy and Geeter unreasonably failed to glimpse during their investigation or what more they reasonably should have done.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">. On remand, the Georgia Supreme Court unanimously held that the petitioner in <em>Sears </em>failed to demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland. Sears v.

By narrowing his focus to these two enumerated categories of adaptive behavior, functional academics and work, Tharpe is implicitly abandoning Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s conclusions that he also suffered from significant decencies in home living, social skills, and self-direction. Because we agree that Tharpe has correctly recognized that these grounds would not be availing if pressed, we need not address them further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">.Tharpe also points, on appeal, to a book Dr. Oakland co-authored, arguing that the ABAS-II may be useful for purposes other than establishing the level of a person's adaptive behavior if administered to persons who are incarcerated or to those who display signs of intellectual disability or low intellectual function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">. The relevant supplemental authority provided by Tharpe, <em>Brumfield v. Cain, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2269, 192 L.Ed.2d 356 (2015), is not to the contrary. In <em>Brumfield, </em>a five-member majority of the Supreme Court held that it was unreasonable for purposes of \u00a7 2254 for a state trial court to have concluded that a <em>post-Atkins </em>petitioner had not shown the \"reasonable doubt\" required by Louisiana law to merit an evidentiary hearing as to the petitioner\u2019s possible intellectual disability when the record showed that the petitioner had a \"low birth weight,\u201d had been \"placed in special education classes at an early age\u201d and \u201cwas suspected of having a learning disability,\u201d and had been committed to \"mental health facilities at a young age\u201d where he had been administered \"antipsychotic and sedative drugs.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at-, 135 S.Ct. at 2280-81. The circumstances facing the Court in <em>Brumfield </em>are far afield from those we face here. Most obviously, Tharpe is not seeking an evidentiary hearing to determine whether he is intellectually disabled in the first place; Tharpe is instead contesting Judge Winegar-den\u2019s conclusion that he is not intellectually disabled, a conclusion reached only after multiple such hearings had been held. <em>Cf. id. </em>at -, 135 S.Ct. at 2281 (\"It is critical to remember, however, that in seeking an evi-dentiary hearing, Brumfield was not obligated to show that he was intellectually disabled, or even that he would likely be able to prove as much. Rather, Brumfield needed only to raise a 'reasonable doubt\u2019 as to his intellectual disability to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
