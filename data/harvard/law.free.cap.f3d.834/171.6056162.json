Pierotti suffers from a hearing impairment that requires him to use hearing aids, but. those aids were broken during Pierotti\u2019s trial for murder. He says that although he told his trial counsel that he could not hear during his trial, counsel never requested an accommodation for Pierotti\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Pierotti now contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He presented this argument to a state court on collateral review, but the court declined to address its merits, concluding that the claim was procedurally barred because Pierotti could have brought- it on direct appeal. The district court held that this decision rested on a state procedural ground that was \u201cindependent\u201d of federal law and \u201cadequate\u201d to preclude federal habeas review.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">We disagree. We hold that this case falls within the limited category of exceptional cases where the \u201cexorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state ground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.\u201d <em>Lee v. Kemna, </em>534 U.S. 362, 376, 122 S.Ct. 877, 151 L.Ed.2d 820 (2002). Accordingly, the district court was not precluded from reviewing the merits of Pierotti\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for the court to consider the merits of Pierotti\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">In 1998, John Pierotti shot and killed two men outside of a bar. He was arrested and charged principally with two counts of first-degree murder. Pierotti admitted to shooting the men, but, at trial, argued that he acted in self-defense. The jury disagreed and convicted Pierotti of murder. The judge sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">Pierotti has had a hearing impairment since he was a child. An audiologist has determined that Pierotti has a \u201cbilateral sensorineural hearing loss,\u201d which is a \u201chearing impairment due to an abnormality of the functioning of the auditory nerve' located in the inner ear.\u201d App\u2019x at 1147. Pierotti accordingly wears hearing aids in both of his ears.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Shortly before a pretrial hearing, the only hearing aid that Pierotti had with him in jail broke. At the beginning of the hearing, the clerk asked Pierotti if he was ready to proceed. Pierotti responded, \u201cNo.\u201d App\u2019x at 141. Pierotti\u2019s lawyer at the hearing told the court that Pierotti\u2019s hearing aid had been broken in jail and that Pierotti was having \u201cextreme difficulty hearing,\u201d so that, if the court was going to proceed, it would have to \u201cmake some accommodations for his hearing loss.\u201d App\u2019x at 141. Counsel requested a continuance, but the court denied the request. The following colloquy then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">THE COURT: For the record, this is a very small courtroom \u2022 here in -the west wing. It was originally designed for misdemeanor trials.... [Pjlease keep your voice up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-15\">Mr. Pierotti, if you have any problem hearing anything, you let me know.... THE CLERK: Mr. Pierotti, I would just like to remind you, you are still under oath. You are still under oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al5\">THE WITNESS: Are you talking to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-17\">THE CLERK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-18\">THE COURT: You are still under oath, Mr. Pierotti.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May I ask you to give one more warning-to Mr. Pierotti that if he doesn\u2019t completely hear the question, don\u2019t assume what it is but ask to have it read back to him so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">THE DEFENDANT: I can\u2019t hear you from here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">THE COURT: All right, we are going to \u2014 Mr. Walsh come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">I am going to tell you, Mr. Pierotti, you heard me very clearly when I started as to whether' \u2014 -you heard the clerk from a lot further away as to whether or not the defendant was ready to proceed. You could hear that, and you answered that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">Please, don\u2019t play any games with me. I am a finder of fact here. I am telling you what I observed up to this point. Now let\u2019s stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">App\u2019x at 147-48. Pierotti then testified and responded to questions. At times he asked the prosecutor to repeat certain questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Pierotti was represented by new counsel at trial. The trial record does not indicate whether counsel was aware that Pierotti had a hearing impairment. According to Pierotti, his hearing aid was still broken during his trial. The trial was conducted in a different, larger courtroom than the pretrial hearing. Pierotti claims that he \u201cwas only able to understand limited parts of [his] trial,\u201d that it was \u201cmost difficult for [him] to understand when more than one person was speaking at a time or when the person speaking was at a distance or facing away from [him],\u201d and that he had a \u201cvery difficult time understanding witnesses who were testifying from the witness stand.\u201d App\u2019x at 1119. He says that he told his trial counsel many times that he was unable to hear what witnesses were saying and that counsel often responded by telling Pierotti to be quiet. He says that trial counsel refused to explain to him what witnesses were saying during the trial, that counsel would sometimes explain the proceedings outside of court but told him that he \u201cdid not need to hear all of the proceedings,\u201d and that counsel \u201cdid not once ask the judge to make any accommodations for [his] hearing impairment.\u201d App\u2019x at 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">Following his conviction, Pierotti filed a notice of appeal. He was again represented by new counsel on appeal. Pierotti\u2019s appellate counsel raised a number of issues, but he did not argue that Pierotti\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to secure an accommodation for Pierotti\u2019s hearing impairment. The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction on direct appeal, and a judge of the New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">Pierotti then filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. In his federal habeas suit, Pierotti asserted that he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because of his trial counsel\u2019s failure to secure accommodations for his hearing impairment. He requested that the district court stay his federal ha-beas proceedings so that he could exhaust this claim in state-court collateral proceedings. The court granted the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">Pierotti then filed a motion to vacate his conviction in state court pursuant to N.Y. Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440.10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argued principally that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to secure an accommodation for his hearing impairment. In sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>port of his petition, Pierotti submitted twelve exhibits that were not part of the trial record. Included in these exhibits was an affidavit from trial counsel in which counsel acknowledged \u2014 for the first time on the record \u2014 that Pierotti told him that he normally wore hearing aids to help with his hearing ability, but that he did not have any working aids during the trial. Counsel further acknowledged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">During the trial, Mr. Pierotti indicated to me on various occasions that he could not hear what was happening. When this happened, I either whispered to him, wrote him notes to explain what was happening, or indicated to him to be quiet so that I could listen to what was happening in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">During breaks, I was able to discuss specific witness testimony with Mr. Pier-otti, and he seemed aware of the gist of the testimony and the proceedings. However, I never directly asked Mr. Pierotti during these breaks how well he was able to follow the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">App\u2019x at 1141. None of this information was part of the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Pierotti\u2019s exhibits also included four hearing tests performed by the department of corrections documenting the severity of his hearing disability, an affidavit from Pierotti attesting to his inability to hear witnesses and counsel at trial and that he advised trial counsel of that fact, affidavits from four family members, three of whom witnessed Pierotti visibly struggling to hear during trial and who told trial counsel that Pierotti could not hear the proceedings, and an affidavit from an expert audiologist who analyzed the courtroom in which Pierotti was tried and concluded that Pierotti\u2019s disability would have made it difficult for him to understand his trial proceedings without accommodations. Again, none of this information was part of the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">The state court denied Pierotti\u2019s Section 440.10 motion on procedural grounds without a hearing. The court held that because \u201cthe issue of the defendant\u2019s hearing impairment was available pre appeal, the issue could have been raised upon appeal and [Pierotti\u2019s] failure to do so precludefs] consideration of his claim now\u201d pursuant to Section 440.10(2)(c). App\u2019x at 1238.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A justice of the Appellate Division denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">With his state remedies exhausted, Pier-otti returned to federal court to assert his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. A magistrate judge reviewed the record that had been before the state court, including the twelve exhibits Pierotti submitted, and recommended denying Pierotti\u2019s petition. Over Pierotti\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, holding that it could not review the merits of Pierotti\u2019s claim because the state court had rejected the claim on state procedural grounds, which were, in the district court\u2019s view, \u201cadequate\u201d to preclude federal habeas review. The court granted a certificate of appeala-bility on the issue, however. The court also stated that, were it to address Pierotti\u2019s claim on the merits, Pierotti \u201cwould, at the very least, be entitled to a hearing on his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.\u201d <em>Pierotti v. Walsh, </em>No. 03-3958 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(DRH), 2015 WL 2337316, at *15 (E.D.N.Y.\u2019 May 13, 2015). The court was \u201cparticularly disturbed by trial counsel\u2019s apparent failure to request any accommodation for [Pierotti] despite his admission that during the trial, Mr. Pierotti indicated to him on various occasions that he could not hear what was happening and that he never directly asked Pierotti how well he was able to follow proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). The court stated that, in its view, \u201c[t]o the extent trial counsel was aware of Pierotti\u2019s hearing impairment and failed to request any accommodation, counsel failed to assure Pierotti received his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Pierotti now appeals, arguing that his failure to raise his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal was not an \u201cadequate\u201d ground to bar federal habe-as review.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">DISCUSSION'</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We review the denial of a petition for habeas corpus de novo. <em>Clark v. Perez, </em>510 F.3d 382, 389 (2d Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Under the independent and adequate state ground doctrine, federal courts \u201cwill not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). The doctrine first arose in the context of direct appeals to the Supreme Court. <em>See Garcia v. Lewis, </em>188 F.3d 71, 76 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>see also, e.g., Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, </em>296 U.S. 207, 210, 56 S.Ct. 183, 80 L.Ed. 158 (1935); <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1038-42, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983). In that context, the doctrine is jurisdictional: \u201cBecause [the Supreme] Court has no power to review a state law determination that is sufficient to support [a state court] judgment, resolution of any independent federal ground for [such a] decision could not affect the judgment and would therefore be advisory.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546; <em>see also Garcia, </em>188 F.3d at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The independent and adequate state ground doctrine also applies to federal habeas review, albeit for different reasons. <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 729-30, 111 S.Ct. 2546. In the habeas context, the existence of an independent and adequate state ground of decision is not a jurisdictional bar, as the federal court is not technically \u201creviewing\u201d a state-court judgment, so there is no concern about the court rendering an advisory opinion. Rather, the federal court is answering a different question: whether a person is in custody \u201cin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>see Garcia, </em>188 F.3d at 76. Still, the Supreme Court has held that, under principles of comity and federalism, a federal habeas court faced with an independent and adequate state ground of decision must defer in the same manner as the Supreme Court would in a case on direct review. <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 730-31, 111 S.Ct. 2546; <em>Garcia, </em>188 F.3d at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">In this case, the district court held that it could not reach the merits of Pierotti\u2019s . ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim because the state court\u2019s rejection of that claim rested on an independent and adequate state ground, namely, that the claim was procedurally barred under Section 440.10(2)(c) because Pierotti could have brought the claim on direct appeal but failed to do so. On appeal, Pierotti does not dispute that this state procedural bar was \u201cindependent\u201d of federal law. The only question is whether it was \u201cadequate\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>preclude federal habeas review. This is a federal question. <em>Garcia, </em>188 F.3d at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">A habeas petitioner may bring two kinds of challenges to the adequacy of a state procedural bar. First, the petitioner may challenge a procedural bar on the ground that it is not \u201c \u2018firmly established and regularly followed\u2019 by the state in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ford v. Georgia, </em>498 U.S. 411, 423-24, 111 S.Ct. 850, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991)). Second, even if a procedural bar is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed,\u201d a petitioner may still challenge the adequacy of the bar in exceptional cases where the state court\u2019s application of the rule was \u201cexorbitant,\u201d \u201crender[ing] the state ground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.\u201d <em>Lee v. Kemna, </em>534 U.S. 362, 376, 122 S.Ct. 877, 151 L.Ed.2d 820 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Here, there is no dispute that Section 440.10 is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed.\u201d Rather, Pierotti\u2019s challenge concerns the state court\u2019s application of Section 440.10(2)(c) to the facts of his case. In <em>Cotto v. Herbert, </em>331 F.3d 217 (2d Cir. 2003), we identified three considerations that are relevant to assessing a state court\u2019s application of a generally sound rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">(1) whether the alleged procedural violation was actually relied on in the trial court, and whether perfect compliance with the state rule would have changed the trial court\u2019s decision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">(2) whether state caselaw indicated that compliance with the rule was demanded in the specific circumstances presented; \u25a0 and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">(3) whether petitioner had \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the rule given \u201cthe realities of trial,\u201d and, therefore, whether demanding perfect compliance with the rule would serve a legitimate governmental interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\"><em>Cotto, </em>331 F.3d at 240 (quoting <em>Lee, </em>534 U.S. at 382, 122 S.Ct. 877). These three considerations are \u201cguideposts\u201d for courts, not exclusive \u201cfactors.\u201d <em>Whitley v. Ercole, </em>642 F.3d 278, 287-88 (2d Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Where, as here, we are \u201cassessing the contours of a state court\u2019s denial of collateral review because of a petitioner\u2019s failure to raise an issue on direct appeal,\u201d we \u201cfocus on the second of the <em>Cotto </em>guideposts.\u201d <em>Fulton v. Graham, </em>802 F.3d 257, 262-63 (2d Cir. 2015). \u201cThe second <em>Cotto </em>[guidepost] considers whether state case law indicates that compliance with a procedural rule <em>was required </em>under the specific circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262-63 (quoting <em>Clark, </em>510 F.3d at 392).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Here, the state court based its decision on the procedural rule articulated in N.Y. Criminal Procedure Law Section 440.10(2)(e). Recently, in <em>Fulton, </em>we looked to the second <em>Cotto </em>guidepost to conclude that the state court\u2019s application of Section 440.10(2)(c) to bar an ineffective assistance of counsel claim was so \u201cexorbitant\u201d that it rendered Section 440.10(2)(c) inadequate to preclude federal habeas review of the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 262-64. In <em>Fulton, </em>petitioner was offered a plea that would have made him eligible for a 10-year sentence, but he turned it down and was eventually sentenced to 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 266. On collateral review in state court, he alleged that his trial lawyer gave him \u201cno guidance\u201d during plea negotiations and \u201cfailed to discuss the pros and cons of accepting the plea offer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The state court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction under Section 440.10 on the ground that petitioner could have raised the ineffective assistance argument on direct appeal, citing Section 440.10(2)(c). <em>Id. </em>at 261. The district court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, concluding that the state court had relied on an independent and adequate state ground in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>jecting the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We vacated and remanded, holding that Section 440.10(2)(c), as applied by the state court to petitioner\u2019s case, was inadequate to preclude federal habeas review. <em>Id. </em>at 264. In considering the state court\u2019s application of Section 440.10(2)(c), we noted that \u201cthe weight of state case law suggested] that New York Courts do not ordinarily apply [Section] 440.10(2)(c) to bar claims of ineffective assistance based on out-of-court conversations between a defendant and his counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263. Rather, our review of state court authority \u2022 \u201csuggested] the opposite: state courts ordinarily demand that such ineffective assistance claims be brought in collateral proceedings, rather than on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted that the trial record \u201cd[id] not clearly reflect the adequacy of counsel\u2019s advice\u201d and concluded that, under the circumstances, \u201cthe state court\u2019s reliance on [Section] 440.10(2)(c) to bar Fulton\u2019s claim represented] an \u2018exorbitant application\u2019 of the state rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264 (quoting <em>Lee, </em>534 U.S. at 376,122 S.Ct. 877).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The same is true here. New York case law indicates that Pierotti did not have to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal. To the contrary, while 440.10(2)(c) is designed \u201cto prevent Section 440.10 from being employed as a substitute for direct appeal,\u201d <em>Fulton, </em>802 F.3d at 263 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted), New York courts uniformly hold that where, as here, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim turns on facts that are outside of the trial-court record, the claim <em>must </em>be brought in collateral proceedings, not on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The New York Court of Appeals has held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">Generally, the ineffectiveness of counsel is not demonstrable on the main record .... Consequently, in the typical case it would be better, and in some cases essential, that an appellate attack on the effectiveness of counsel be bottomed on an evidentiary exploration by collateral or post-conviction proceeding brought under [Section] 440.10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-10\"><em>People v. Brown, </em>45 N.Y.2d 852, 853-54, 410 N.Y.S.2d 287, 382 N.E.2d 1149 (1978); <em>see also People v.

Where \u201ca defendant presents a mixed claim of ineffective assistance ...[,] such a mixed claim, presented in a [Section] 440.10 motion, is not procedurally barred, and the [Section] 440.10 proceeding is the appropriate forum for reviewing the claim of ineffectiveness in its entirety.\u201d <em>Id.-, see also People v.

His claim depended on some facts appearing on the trial record, such as his trial counsel\u2019s failure to secure an accommodation for Pierotti\u2019s hearing impairment, but his claim ultimately turns on facts appearing outside the record, such as his trial counsel\u2019s alleged awareness of Pierotti\u2019s hearing impairment. Although it is apparent from the transcript of the pre--trial hearing that Pierotti\u2019s counsel at that hearing was aware of Pierotti\u2019s hearing impairment, nothing in the trial record indicates that Pierotti\u2019s new counsel at trial was aware of this fact. Nor does the trial record indicate that Pierotti was unable to hear critical portions of his trial, as he now claims. Without this information, the Appellate Division could not have adjudicated Pierotti\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Indeed, the district court agreed with this analysis. It concluded that Pierotti</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auf\">presented a mixed ineffective assistance claim in his [Section] 440.10 motion because his claim rested partly on his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the lack of accommodation at trial for his hearing impairment which does appear on the record \u2014 and partly on the affidavits attesting to petitioner\u2019s inability to hear during the trial and his trial counsel\u2019s knowledge of that fact, and the affidavit of the expert explaining the nature of [Pierotti\u2019s] hearing impairment and why [Pierotti] was able to hear adequately during, for example, his direct examination at the pre-trial hearing and during the charge conference but not during the testimony of witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\"><em>Pierotti, </em>2015 WL 2337316, at *13. Thus, the court concluded that \u201ccompliance with ... [Section] 440.10(2)(c) was not demanded in the specific circumstances presented because sufficient facts did not appear on the record to permit adequate review upon direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The district court also, however, analyzed the first and third <em>Cotto </em>guideposts, found that they favored the state, and then concluded that, based on its consideration of all three guideposts, the state court\u2019s application of Section 440.10(2)(c) was adequate to bar federal habeas review. <em>Pierotti, </em>2015 WL 2337316, at *12-14. This was error. The <em>Cotto </em>guideposts are not all applicable in every case because we derived them from a fact-specific analysis in <em>Lee. See Cotto, </em>331 F.3d at 240. Here, as was the case in <em>Fulton </em>and <em>Clark, </em>only the second <em>Cotto </em>guidepost is instructive because the first and third pertain specifically to procedural violations that occurred before a trial court. The district court thus improperly \u201cforce[d] square pegs into round holes\u201d in considering those guideposts. <em>Clark, </em>510 F.3d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Under Cotto\u2019s second guidepost, the state\u2019s contention that Pierotti\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was \u201csufficiently reviewable from the record,\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 35, and that Section 440.10(2)(c)\u2019s procedural bar was properly applied, is mistaken. We can find no case law that supports the state\u2019s position, particularly given the essential facts of Pierotti\u2019s claim (namely, Pierotti\u2019s alleged hearing difficulties at trial, the extent of those difficulties, and trial counsel\u2019s awareness of them) are dependent on evidence outside the trial record. The cases cited by the state instead support only the unremarkable proposition that where there are record facts that dispose of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the state appellate court will address that claim on direct review. For example, in <em>People v. Koons, </em>213 A.D.2d 812, 623 N.Y.S.2d 398 (3d Dep\u2019t 1995), the Appellate Division was able to reject de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>fendant\u2019s claim \u201cthat his counsel acted ineffectively when he failed to raise the issue of defendant\u2019s [hearing] impairment prior to the hearing\u201d because the record indicated that defendant had \u201cadmitted that he was able to hear all of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399; <em>see also, e.g., People v. Feliz, 51 </em>A.D.3d 1278, 858 N.Y.S.2d 472, 473-74 (3d Dep\u2019t 2008) (rejecting ineffective-assistance claim premised on counsel\u2019s \u201calleged failure to secure an interpreter for defendant\u2019s various appearances,\u201d which depended on defendant\u2019s \u201cprofessed difficulties understanding the English language,\u201d because the claim was \u201cbelied by a review of the transcript at issue \u2014 most notably, defendant\u2019s plea allocution\u201d). Here,-by contrast, Pierot-ti has never admitted that he could hear witness testimony. To the contrary, he now claims that he could <em>not </em>hear the witnesses who were testifying against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In the absence of any New York authority indicating that claims like Pierotti\u2019s must be raised on direct appeal under Section 440.10(2)(c), \u201cwe can only conclude that the state court\u2019s reliance on [Section] 440.10(2)(c) to bar [Pierotti\u2019s] claim represents an \u2018exorbitant application\u2019 of the state rule.\u201d <em>Fulton, </em>802 F.3d at 264 (quoting <em>Lee, </em>534 U.S. at 376, 122 S.Ct. 877). Thus, Section 440.10(2)(e) was \u201cinadequate\u201d to foreclose review of Pierotti\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. On remand, the district court should decide the merits of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-10\">. Section 440.10(l)(h) provides, \"At any time after the entry of a judgment, the court in which it was entered may, upon motion of the defendant, vacate such judgment upon the ground that ...
