WALKER, Jr., Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">Ashim Khattri Chettri, doing business as Tarala Internationals (\u201cTarala\u201d), and Wu Lixiang (\u2018Wu\u201d) appeal from the decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Gar-dephe, /.) vacating a default judgment and dismissing their complaint against Nepal Rastra Bank (\u201cRastra Bank\u201d) and the Department of Revenue Investigation of the Government of Nepal (\u201cthe Department\u201d). The district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because both Rastra Bank and the Department, as political subdivisions or agencies of the Government of Nepal (\u201cNepal\u201d), are immune from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (\u201cFSIA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602 <em>et seq. </em>The district court also concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction because Tarala and Wu failed to comply with the service of process requirements of the FSIA. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and therefore need not address the issue of service of process. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment vacating the default judgment and dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Tarala, a Colorado corporation, is the principal supplier of clothing and military equipment to Nepal. Wu is the director of a company that helps Tarala coordinate the logistics of its international transactions. Wu has acted as Tarala\u2019s agent in connection with contracts with Nepal and has also independently conducted business with Nepal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Rastra Bank, located in Kathmandu, is Nepal\u2019s financial agent and is authorized to open and operate accounts, settle obligations, and issue letters of credit on behalf of Nepal. The Department is the prosecutorial arm of Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Finance and its duties include monitoring wire transfers for compliance with Nepalese laws such as the Nepal Asset (Money) Laundering Prevention Act of 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Between 2006 and 2008, Nepal placed several orders with Tarala for equipment for the Nepalese army and police force. Acting as Tarala\u2019s distribution partner in these .transactions, Wu coordinated procurement'and delivery of the goods. Nepal paid Tarala for the equipment through letters of credit issued by Rastra Bank to Chase Manhattan Bank, naming Tarala as a beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">On July 23, 2008, Tarala wired $1 million from Chase Manhattan Bank, located in New York, to Wu\u2019s personal account at Nepal Bangladesh Bank, Ltd. (\u201cBangladesh Bank\u201d), which is located in Kathmandu. Wu claims that he intended to use the $1 million to pay a third party to transport equipment and complete delivery of goods to Nepal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">On August 4, 2008, Bangladesh Bank notified Rastra Bank of irregularities concerning the wire payment to Wu. Bangladesh Bank informed Rastra Bank that Wu had failed to provide adequate documentation of the source of the funds and that, as a result, Bangladesh Bank was freezing the funds pending an explanation of their source and pending further instructions from Rastra Bank. On August 27, 2008, the Department instructed Rastra Bank to direct Bangladesh Bank to freeze Wu\u2019s account pending further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">In an attempt to persuade Bangladesh Bank to release the funds,. Tarala provided letters from financial institutions and government agencies attesting to the legitimacy of the wire transfer. Rastra Bank and the Department took the position that this documentation was insufficient to establish the source of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">On November 10, 2010, after the letters were unsuccessful in unfreezing the account, Tarala and Wu filed the underlying complaint in this action. Rastra Bank and the Department responded by claiming that Tarala and Wu failed to comply with the statutory requirements for service of process under the FSIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">On January 18, 2011, the district court ordered Rastra Bank and the Department to show cause why a default judgment should not be entered against them. After Rastra Bank and the Department failed to respond by a court-imposed deadline, the district court entered a default judgment in favor of Tarala and Wu in the amount of $1,000,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">On February 25, 2011, the Department charged Wu with violating the Nepal Asset (Money) Laundering Prevention Act of 2008 and, pursuant to that Act, demanded confiscation of the disputed funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">On September 2, 2014, on the motion of Rastra Bank and the Department, and after receiving a statement of interest from the United States recommending vacatur, the district court reversed course. The district court vacated the default judgment and dismissed the- complaint for lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Tarala and Wn now appeal, arguing that the district court had both subject matter and personal jurisdiction over this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s determination regarding subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA, we use a clear error standard for factual findings and we review legal conclusions de novo. <em>U.S. Titan, Inc. v. Guangzhou Zhen Hua Shipping Co., </em>241 F.3d 135, 150-51 (2d Cir. 2001). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to vacate a default judgment. <em>SEC v. McNulty, </em>137 F.3d 732, 738 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Tarala and Wu argue that the district court incorrectly determined that it lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction and that the district court abused its discretion by vacating the default judgment based on these incorrect determinations. We disagree. The district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Rastra Bank and the Department are immune from suit under the FSIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction and the FSIA</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The FSIA \u201cprovides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.\u201d <em>Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., </em>488 U.S. 428, 439, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). The Act renders a foreign state \u201cpresumptively immune from the jurisdiction of United States courts,\u201d <em>Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, </em>507 U.S. 349, 355, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993), and defines the term \u201cforeign state\u201d to include \u201ca political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Subject matter jurisdiction exists under the FSIA only if a specified exception to that Act applies. <em>Nelson, </em>507 U.S. at 355, 113 S.Ct. 1471. Because personal jurisdiction exists under the FSIA only if (a) service of process has been made in accordance with the Act and (b) subject matter jurisdiction exists under the Act, a finding that a federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction oyer a claim against a foreign state necessarily yields a finding that the court lacks personal jurisdiction as well. <em>See Verlinden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, </em>461 U.S. 480, 485 n. 5, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">A defendant seeking dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA bears the burden of presenting a prima facie case that it is a foreign sovereign. <em>Virtual Countries, Inc. v. Republic of S. Africa, </em>300 F.3d 230, 241 (2d Cir. 2002). If the defendant meets this burden, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the foreign sovereign lacks immunity due to an FSIA exception. <em>Cargill Int'l S.A v. M/T Pavel Dybenko, </em>991 F.2d 1012, 1016 (2d Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Tarala and Wu do not dispute the district court\u2019s determination that the Department is a political subdivision of a sovereign state and that Rastra Bank is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state. Tarala and Wu do, however, challenge the district court\u2019s rejection of their argument that two specified exceptions to the FSIA apply: the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception set forth in Section 1605(a)(2) and the \u201ctakings\u201d exception set forth in Section 1605(a)(3). We agree with the district court that neither exception applies on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">A. The Commercial Activity Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">Under the commercial activity exception set forth in Section 1605(a)(2), a foreign state lacks immunity under the FSIA when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the action is based [1] upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or [2] upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; or [3] upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of.the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 '1605(a)(2). None of the three grounds for invoking the commercial activity exception applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">1. The Inapplicability of the First Ground</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">With respect to the first ground, this action is not \u201cbased upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cthreshold step\u201d in assessing the applicability of the commercial activity exception is always to \u201cidentify the act of the foreign sovereign State that serves as the basis for plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d <em>Garb v. Republic of Poland, </em>440 F.3d 579, 586 (2d Cir. 2006). Tarala and Wu cite as a commercial activity Nepal\u2019s entering into a contract with Colorado-based Tarala to supply goods and equipment. This lawsuit, however, is based not upon that contract but upon the Department and Rastra Bank\u2019s freezing of Wu\u2019s account in Nepal.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The term \u201c \u2018based upon\u2019 ... calls for something more than a mere connection with, or relation to, commercial activity.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>507 U.S. at 358, 113 S.Ct. 1471 (footnote omitted). In order for a cause of action to be \u201cbased upon\u201d a commercial activity and thereby fit within the FSIA exception, there must exist a \u201cdegree of closeness ..: between the commercial activity and the gravamen of the plaintiffs complaint.\u201d <em>Kensington Int'l Ltd. v. Itoua, </em>505 F.3d 147, 156 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). This degree of closeness must be \u201cconsiderably greater than common law causation requirements.\u201d <em>Transatlantic Shiffahrtskontor GmbH v. Shanghai Foreign Trade Corp., </em>204 F.3d 384, 390 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The district court properly found that the gravamen of the complaint is the freezing of the $1 million that Tarala wired to Wu\u2019s Bangladesh Bank account. A foreign sovereign, engages in a commercial activity within the meaning of the FSIA only when it \u201cacts[ ] not as regulator of a market, but in the manner of a private player within it.\u201d <em>Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 607, 614, 112 S.Ct. 2160, 119 L.Ed.2d 394 (1992); <em>see also Garb, </em>440 F.3d at 598 (\u201c[A] state\u2019s confiscation of property within its borders is not a \u2018commercial\u2019 act.\u201d). Rastra Bank and the Department were acting as government regulators, not private commercial players, when they froze Wu\u2019s account as part of an investigation and therefore were not engaged in a commercial activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Tarala and Wu contend that Tarala wired the $1 million to Wu so that Wu could facilitate the delivery of equipment under the contracts with Nepal. Rastra Bank and the Department argue that insufficient evidence supports this contention. The dispute is beside the point, however, because, even if commercial activities had led to the conduct that eventually injured Tarala and Wu, this would not alone render such activities the basis of their suit. In <em>Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, </em>the Supreme Court held that alleged torts rather than the commercial activities preceding those torts formed the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 action if, \u201c[e]ven taking each of the [plaintiffs\u2019] allegations about [the commercial activities] as true, those facts alone entitle the [plaintiffs] to nothing under their theory of the case.\u201d 507 U.S. at 358, 113 S.Ct. 1471. Tarala and Wu are not alleging breach of contract in this action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>At the time Rastra Bank and the Department froze Wu\u2019s account, Rastra Bank had already paid in full the letters of credit in satisfaction of the contracts between Nepal and Tarala. This action is based upon Bangladesh Bank\u2019s allegedly tortious freezing, not the contract, and therefore the first ground for invoking the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">2. The Inapplicability of the Second Ground</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">With respect to the second ground, this action plainly is not \u201cbased ... upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere.\u201d \u00a7 1605(a)(2). This action is based upon the freezing of the $1 million wired to Wu\u2019s account at Bangladesh Bank. The freezing took place in Nepal: the Department, Rastra Bank, and the bank that held Wu\u2019s account are all located in Nepal. The freezing was in no sense \u201can act performed in the United States,\u201d and Tarala and Wu do not argue otherwise. Thus, the second ground of the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">3. The Inapplicability of the Third Ground</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">With respect to the third ground, this action is not \u201cbased ... upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere [when] that act causes a direct effect in the United States.\u201d \u00a7 1605(a)(2). This FSIA ground can be broken into three requirements: (1) that the operative act occur outside the United States, (2) that the act occur in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere, and (3) that the act cause a direct effect in the United States. Because the freezing of the funds at issue occurred in Nepal, this action plainly satisfies the first requirement, but the action does not satisfy the second or third.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">As to the second requirement, Tarala and Wu fail to establish that the freezing of Wu\u2019s funds occurred in connection with commercial activity. We interpret the term \u201cin connection with\u201d narrowly, <em>see Garb, </em>440 F.3d at 587, and a plaintiff must cite more than \u201ctangential commercial activities to which the \u2018acts\u2019 forming the basis of the claim have only an attenuated connection,\u201d <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert Grp. Inc. v. Comm. of Receivers for Galadari, </em>12 F.3d 317, 330 (2d Cir. 1993). In this matter, any connection between the contract and the freezing is too attenuated. As we have already pointed out, Nepal had fulfilled its obligations under the contract by the time \u25a0 that Rastra Bank and the Department froze Wu\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">As to the third requirement, Tarala and Wu also fail to demonstrate a \u201cdirect effect\u201d in the United States. \u201c[A]n effect is direct if it follows as an immediate consequence of the defendant\u2019s activity.\u201d <em>Weltover, </em>504 U.S. at 618, 112 S.Ct. 2160 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201c[T]he mere fact that a foreign state\u2019s commercial activity outside of the United States caused physical or financial injury to a United States citizen is not itself sufficient to constitute a direct effect in the United States.\u201d <em>Guirlando v. T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., </em>602 F.3d 69, 78 (2d Cir. 2010). Here, the immediate consequences of the account freezing took place outside of the United States. Even under the version of the facts most favorable to Tarala and Wu, freezing Wu\u2019s account at most prevented the payment of a third party in Nepal; it did not directly affect the satisfaction of the contract between Nepal and Tarala in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Accordingly, after examining each of the three grounds for invocation of Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>1605(a)(2), we conclude that the commercial activity exception does not apply in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">B. The Takings Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Tarala and Wu also attempt to invoke the FSIA\u2019s takings exception. Under Section 1605(a)(3), a foreign state lacks immunity under the FSIA in any action</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvL\">in which [1] rights in property [2] taken [3] in violation of international law are in issue and [4a] that property or any property exchanged for such property is present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or [4b] that property or any property exchanged for such property is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\"><em>See Garb, </em>440 F.3d at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The applicability of the takings exception founders, however, on the requirement that the rights in property must be \u201ctaken in violation of international law.\u201d We interpret the phrase \u201ctaken in violation of international law\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018the nationalization or expropriation of property without payment of the prompt adequate and effective compensation required by international law,\u2019 including \u2018takings which are arbitrary or discriminatory in nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zappia Middle E. Constr. Co. v. Emirate of Abu Dhabi, </em>215 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 19 (1976)). Tarala and Wu have not alleged sufficient facts to plausibly establish that the freezing of Wu\u2019s account constituted a taking, much less a taking \u201cin violation of international law.\u201d Rastra Bank and the Department froze Wu\u2019s financial assets in connection with an ongoing money laundering investigation. Unsurprisingly, Tarala and Wu offer no authority for the proposition that a routine law enforcement action such as this constitutes a taking within the meaning of \u00a7 1605(a)(3), and the complaint\u2019s conclusory criticisms of the manner in which Nepal has conducted its investigation are insufficient to prove a violation of international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Accordingly, the takings exception does not apply in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">II. Personal Jurisdiction and Service of Process</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Because we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Rastra Bank and the Department are immune from suit under the FSIA, we need not decide whether the district court correctly determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction due to defects in the service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment vacating the default judgment and dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
