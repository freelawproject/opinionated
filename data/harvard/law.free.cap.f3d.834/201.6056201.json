Several dozen United States, Israeli, and Canadian civilians seek to hold Defendant-Appellee Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL (\u201cLCB\u201d), a Lebanese bank headquartered in Beirut, liable for providing international financial services to Hezbollah that they claim facilitated Hezbollah\u2019s attacks that injured them or killed family members. These civilians assert claims against LCB under the Anti-Terrorism Act and Israeli tort law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, some of the Israeli and Canadian plaintiffs (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) assert claims under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350 (the \u201cATS\u201d) \u2014 these claims are the subject of the present opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">This case is not new to our Court. In fact, this appeal is in its third appearance before us in the last five years. In our prior opinions, we determined (with. an assist from the New York Court of Appeals, <em>see Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, </em>20 N.Y.3d 327, 339, 960 N.Y.S.2d 695, 984 N.E.2d 893 (2012) <em>(\u201cLicci IIP\u2019)) </em>that the District Court had personal jurisdiction over defendant LCB, and that subjecting the foreign bank to personal jurisdiction in New York comports with due process protections provided by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>United States Constitution. <em>See Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, </em>732 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir. 2013) <em>(\u201cLicci IV\u201d); Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, </em>673 F.3d 50, 73-74 (2d Cir. 2012) <em>(\u201cLicci II\u201d). </em>This case presents a different question: Whether the District Court has <em>subject matter </em>jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims. The District Court dismissed the ATS claims under <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1659, 185 L.Ed.2d 671 (2013) <em>(\u201cKiobel II\u201d), </em>reasoning that Plaintiffs failed to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application of the ATS. Though we disagree with the District Court\u2019s basis for dismissal, we affirm because the ATS claims seek to impose corporate liability in contravention of our decision in <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>621 F.3d 111, 145 (2d Cir. 2010) <em>(\u201cKiobel I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">I. Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">According to Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, Hezbollah,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a terrorist organization, fired thousands of rockets into northern Israel between July 12, 2006 and August 14, 2006. App. 58, 66. Plaintiffs or their family members were injured or killed by these attacks. <em>See </em>App. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">LCB is a Lebanese bank with no branches, offices, or employees in the United States. <em>Licci IV, </em>732 F.3d at 165; <em>Licci II, </em>673 F.3d at 56. To effectuate U.S.-dollar-denominated transactions, LCB maintained a correspondent bank account with defendant American Express Bank Ltd. (\u201cAmEx\u201d) in New York.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Licci IV, </em>732 F.3d at 165; <em>Licci II, </em>673 F.3d at 56. Plaintiffs allege that LCB used this account to conduct dozens of international wire transfers on behalf of the Shahid (Martyrs) Foundation (\u201cShahid\u201d), an entity that maintained bank accounts with LCB and that Plaintiffs allege to be an \u201cintegral part\u201d of Hezbollah and \u201cpart of [its] financial arm.\u201d App. 65; <em>see also id. </em>(alleging that the Shahid-titled bank accounts \u201cbelonged to [Hezbollah] and were under the control of [Hezbollah]\u201d). These wire transfers, which totaled several million dollars, \u201csubstantially increased and facilitated [Hezbollah\u2019s] ability to plan, to prepare for[,] and to carry out\u201d the rocket attacks that injured Plaintiffs. App. 66, 86. Plaintiffs further allege that LCB carried out the wire transfer services from 2004 until the rocket attacks began on July 12, 2006, and \u201csubsequently\u201d continued to carry out those transfers. App. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">As relevant here, Plaintiffs contend that LCB\u2019s role in conducting those wire transfers on Shahid\u2019s behalf amounted to aiding and abetting genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law, and is actionable under the Alien Tort Statute. App. 110. They allege that LCB had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that Hezbollah was a violent terrorist organization, as reflected on official U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>government lists,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that Shahid was \u201cpart of [Hezbollah\u2019s] financial arm.\u201d App. 88-90. They assert that the bank accounts held by LCB \u201cwere owned and controlled by [Hezbollah],\u201d and that the wire transfers carried out by the bank were \u201cby and at the direction of [Hezbollah].\u201d App. 90. According to Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, LCB carried out various wire transfer services between Hezbollah accounts \u201cvia Am[E]x Bank in New York,\u201d and all of the wire transfers at issue \u201cwere carried out in and through the State of New York.\u201d App. 66; <em>see also </em>App. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Plaintiffs contend, moreover, that LCB knew that Hezbollah required \u201ctransfer services in order to operate and in order to plan, to prepare for[,] and to carry out terrorist attacks.\u201d App. 89. They similarly allege that LCB knew that providing wire transfer services to Hezbollah would enable Hezbollah \u201cto plan, to prepare for[,] and to carry out terrorist attacks and/or enhance\u201d its ability to do so, in part because LCB was aware that the U.S. sanction regime \u201cis and was intended to prevent [Hezbollah] from conducting banking activities, including wire transfers, and thereby limit its ability to operate and to carry out terrorist attacks.\u201d App. 89. Plaintiffs allege that LCB, equipped with this knowledge, \u201cas a matter of official. LCB policy,\u201d \u201ccontinuously supports and supported [Hezbollah] and its anti-Israel program, goals[,] and activities.\u201d App. 88. In particular, Plaintiffs allege that. LCB carried out the wire transfers at issue \u201cwith the specific purpose and intention of: enabling and assisting [Hezbollah] [in] carrying] out terrorist attacks against Jewish civilians in Israel,\u201d App. 109, and \u201cto assist and advance [Hezbollah\u2019s] goal of using terrorism to destroy the State of Israel.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> App. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">II. Shaya Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Plaintiffs submitted an expert declaration from former Israeli intelligence officer Uzi Shaya (the \u201cShaya declaration\u201d) in support of the allegations set forth in then-complaint. App. 125-28. Shaya has served in various roles in the Israeli intelligence services since 1984. App. 125. From 2004 to 2008, Shaya served as the Deputy Chief of the Israeli National Security Council\u2019s Interagency Unit for Combating Terrorist Financing and Financing of State Sponsors of Terrorism. App. 126. After 2008, Shaya maintained a working relationship with Israel\u2019s National Security Council, providing assistance to counterterrorism staff on the matters he dealt with as Deputy Chief. App. 126. In this capacity, Plaintiffs requested that Shaya \u201cexamine documents in possession of the State of Israel relating to fund[ ] transfers carried out by [Hezbollah] via [AmEx and LCB].\u201d App. 126. Shaya stated that, with one exception identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>below, \u201call\u201d of his testimony was \u201cbased upon [his] examination\u201d of these documents. App. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Shaya stated that \u201c[f]or many years,\u201d \u201cincluding the period between 2004 and July 12, 2006,\u201d Hezbollah \u201cmaintained bank accounts at various LCB branches,\u201d and that some of the accounts Hezbollah maintained were \u201ctitled to\u201d Shahid. App. 126-27. He stated that Shahid was integral to Hezbollah, and that it \u201cserves as an important component of [Hezbollah\u2019s] financial apparatus.\u201d App. 127. He further specified that Hezbollah uses Shahid funds to prepare for and carry out \u201ca wide range of terrorist and other violent activities, including rocket and missile attacks on Israel.\u201d App. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Shaya stated that leading up to and following the July 2006 attacks, Hezbollah made \u201cdozens\u201d of wire transfers from one Shahid account at LCB in Lebanon, \u201ctotaling] several million dollars,\u201d and LCB executed the transfers \u201cthrough Am[E]x Bank in New York, which acted as LCB\u2019s correspondent bank for these dollar transfers.\u201d App. 127. \u201cIn other words,\u201d Shaya explained, \u201cLCB specifically requested Am[E]x Bank in New York to carry out all these dollar wire transfers, and Am[E]x Bank processed all these dollar wire transfers by and through its New York branch.\u201d App. 127. Shaya further stated that AmEx knew that it was executing wire transfers on behalf of Shahid. App. 128. In the sole statement not based on his review of Israel\u2019s documents related to the funds Hezbollah allegedly transferred through LCB and its correspondent bank, Shaya declared that, based on his experience in counterterrorism and familiarity with Hezbollah\u2019s operations, he had \u201cno doubt that the millions of dollars of wire transfers carried out by Am[E]x Bank and LCB for [Hezbollah]\u201d significantly enhanced Hezbollah\u2019s \u201cability to plan and carry out ... the rocket attacks\u201d that injured Plaintiffs. App. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">III. U.S. Government Actions Against LCB</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The U.S. government has taken two actions that reinforce many of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against LCB. First, in October 2012, the U.S. government initiated a civil forfeiture action against LCB properties. App. 323-95. In its complaint, the government asserted that there is \u201creason to believe that LCB has been routinely used by drug traffickers and money launderers,\u201d including at least one \u201cwho provides financial support to [Hezbollah].\u201d App. 328.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It also asserted \u201cthat there was reason to believe that LCB managers are complicit in the network\u2019s money laundering activities.\u201d App. 328. The government alleged that between approximately January 2007 and 2011, \u201cat least $329 million was transferred by wire from accounts held in Lebanon at LCB [and various other banks] to the United States through their correspondent bank accounts with U.S. financial institutions located in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere.\u201d App. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Second, we note that the U.S. Department of Treasury (\u201cTreasury\u201d) has designated LCB as \u201ca financial institution of primary money laundering concern.\u201d Finding That the Lebanese Canadian Bank SAL Is a Financial Institution of Primary Money Laundering Concern, 76 Fed. Reg. 9403-01, 9404 (Feb. 17, 2011). In identifying LCB as a potential conduit for money laundering, Treasury noted that while LCB is based in Lebanon, it \u201cmaintains extensive correspondent accounts with banks worldwide, including several U.S. financial institutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Treasury explained that it identified LCB as a cause for concern because the government \u201chas information through law enforcement and other sources indicating that LCB\u2014 through management complicity, failure of internal controls, and lack of application of prudent banking standards \u2014 has been used extensively by persons associated with ... money laundering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9405. Treasury also found that Hezbollah \u2014 a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization \u2014 \u201cderived financial support from the criminal activities\u201d of the network of drug traffickers and money launderers that rely on LCB, noting that \u201cLCB managers are complicit in the network\u2019s money laundering activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9404-05; <em>see also </em>App. 327-28, 402, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">IV. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Because our previous opinions recite much of the procedural history in this case, <em>Licci IV, </em>732 F.3d at 165-67; <em>Licci II, </em>673 F.3d at 55-59, we provide a truncated version of events here. In July 2008, Plaintiffs initiated this action against LCB and AmEx in state court; the action was removed to federal court soon thereafter. <em>Licci II, </em>673 F.3d at 57. In January 2009, Plaintiffs filed the amended complaint that is at issue on this appeal. <em>See id. </em>Plaintiffs brought five claims against LCB: (1) commission of international terrorism in violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333; (2) aiding and abetting international terrorism in violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act; (3) aiding and abetting genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law, under the ATS; (4) negligence in violation of Israeli Civil Wrongs Ordinance \u00a7 35; and (5) breach of statutory duty in violation of Israeli Civil Wrongs Ordinance \u00a7 63. LCB moved to dismiss all five claims for lack of personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) and for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\n<em>A. Lied I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">On March 31, 2010, the District Court granted LCB\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>Licci v. Am. Express Bank Ltd., </em>704 F.Supp.2d 403, 408 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) <em>(\u201cLied </em>/\u201d). The District Court correctly noted that a defendant may be subject to personal jurisdiction in New York under N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1) if (1) the defendant \u201ctransacted business within the state; and (2) the claim asserted ... arise[s] from that business activity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 406 (internal quotation marks omitted), but determined that the allegations in the amended complaint were insufficient to satisfy either prong, <em>id. </em>at 406-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">Although <em>Lied I\u2019s </em>Rule 12(b)(2) dismissal rested entirely on Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to make a <em>prima .fade </em>showing of long-arm jurisdiction under New York law, the District Court also offered its view \u2014 without further explanation \u2014 that \u201c[t]he exercise of personal jurisdiction over LCB on the basis alleged by plaintiffs would not comport with constitutional principles of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408. The court did not reach LCB\u2019s alternative argument that the claims against it should be dismissed for failure to plead a cause of action under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\n<em>B.Lied II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In our initial consideration of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, we found the scope and application of the long-arm statute\u2019s \u201ctransaction of business\u201d and \u201carising from\u201d tests to be uncertain. We determined that we could not \u201cconfidently say whether the New York Court of Appeals would conclude that the plaintiffs\u201d have made a <em>prima facie </em>showing of jurisdiction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1). <em>Licci II, </em>673 F.3d at 73. We therefore certified the following questions to the New York Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">(1) Does a foreign bank\u2019s maintenance of a correspondent bank account at a financial institution in New York, and use of that account to effect \u201cdozens\u201d of wire transfers on behalf of a foreign client, constitute a \u201ctransaction]\u201d of business in New York within the meaning of N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">(2) If so, do the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act, the ATS, or for negligence or breach of statutory duty in violation of Israeli law, \u201caris[e] from\u201d LCB\u2019s transaction of business in New York within the meaning of N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 74-75 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In the time between <em>Lied I </em>and <em>Lied II, </em>our Circuit decided <em>Kiobel I, </em>in which we held that the ATS does not provide subject matter jurisdiction for civil actions against corporations for violations of customary international law. <em>Kiobel I, </em>621 F.3d at 145; <em>see Licci II, </em>673 F.3d at 73. In <em>Lied II, </em>we predicted that should the Supreme Court affirm <em>Kiobel I, </em>and hold that ATS does not allow for corporate liability, \u201cwe will likely be required to affirm the dismissal of the ATS claims.\u201d <em>Licci II, </em>673 F.3d at 73. Accordingly, we decided to \u201cawait\u201d the decision of the Supreme Court \u201cas to the ATS claims against LCB,\u201d in addition to the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 response to our certified questions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">\n<em>C. Lied III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">On March 29, 2012, the New York Court of Appeals accepted the certified questions. Lic<em>ci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, </em>18 N.Y.3d 952, 944 N.Y.S.2d 472, 967 N.E.2d 697 (2012). The Court answered the certified questions in the affirmative. <em>Licci III, </em>20 N.Y.3d at 341, 960 N.Y.S.2d 695, 984 N.E.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">\n<em>D. Lied TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">Following the guidance from the New York Court of Appeals, we held that (1) Plaintiffs made a <em>prima fade </em>showing that the District Court had personal jurisdiction over LCB, <em>Licci IV, </em>732 F.3d at 168\u2014 69, and (2) subjecting LCB, as a foreign bank, \u201cto personal jurisdiction in New York comports with due process protections provided by the United States Constitution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 165; <em>see also </em>169-74. Accordingly, we vacated and remanded the portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment in <em>Lied I </em>dismissing claims against defendant LCB for lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">In <em>Lied IV, </em>we did not reach the question of whether the ATS provides subject matter jurisdiction over this case. We noted that while the- Supreme Court did in fact affirm <em>Kiobel I </em>on appeal, it did so on different grounds than those upon which we decided <em>Kiobel I. Id. </em>(citing <em>Kiobel II, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1669 (deciding that the presumption against extraterritoriality constrains federal courts from hearing causes of action under the ATS \u201cseeking relief for violations of the law of nations occurring outside the United States\u201d)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We decided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>therefore, that because <em>Kiobel II </em>\u201cdid not directly address the question of corporate liability under the ATS,\u201d and because \u201cthe question of subject matter jurisdiction was not briefed on appeal,\u201d it was best that the District Court \u201caddress this issue in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\n<em>E. Lied V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On remand, the District Court dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 case once more. In relevant part, the District Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims under <em>Kiobel II. </em>Specifically, the court held that Plaintiffs failed to rebut the presumption against the extraterritorial application of the ATS because their complaint\u2019s allegations regarding LCB\u2019s provision of banking services failed to state a claim for aiding and abetting another\u2019s violation of the law of nations. The court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to allege adequately that LCB had the required <em>mens rea </em>for aiding and abetting liability, reasoning that the complaint lacked sufficiently detailed allegations as to LCB\u2019s intent. Plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), accepting all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>City of Pontiac Policemen\u2019s &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys. v. UBS AG, </em>752 F.3d 173, 179 (2d Cir. 2014). Although courts are generally limited to examining the sufficiency of the pleadings on a motion to dismiss, on a challenge to a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the court may also resolve disputed jurisdictional fact issues by reference to evidence outside the pleadings. <em>Flores v. S. Peru Copper Corp., </em>414 F.3d 233, 255 n.30 (2d Cir. 2003) (consulting evidence outside the pleadings to resolve disputed jurisdictional fact issues); <em>see also Cargill Intl S.A. v. M/T Pavel Dybenko, </em>991 F.2d 1012, 1019 (2d Cir. 1993) (\u201cIn resolving the jurisdictional dispute, the district court must review the pleadings and any evidence before it, such as affidavits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">I. The Alien Tort Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">In full, the ATS states: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350. Enacted as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS received little or no judicial attention until 1980, when this Court decided <em>Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, </em>630 F.2d 876 (2d Cir. 1980). The years that followed <em>Filartiga </em>witnessed a dramatic increase in ATS litigation, as the ATS came to be viewed as a means to help victims of human rights violations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">In its history, the Supreme Court has decided two cases directly addressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the ATS: <em>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004), and <em>Kiobel II.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court clarified that the ATS is a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d statute in the sense that it \u201caddress[es] the power of the courts to entertain cases concerned with a certain subject.\u201d <em>Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 714, 124 S.Ct. 2739. Though the \u201cstatute provides district courts with jurisdiction to hear certain claims,- [it] does not expressly provide any causes of action.\u201d <em>Kiobel II, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1663. The ATS\u2019s grant of jurisdiction is \u201cbest read as having been en\u00e1cted on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for a modest number of international law violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 724, 124 S.Ct. 2739).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The Plaintiffs here \u2014 Israeli and Canadian citizens \u2014 assert a civil tort action, and thus satisfy the first clause of the ATS. In determining whether the tort was \u201ccommitted in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States,\u201d we look to Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent, mindful that there are \u201cnumerous jurisdictional predicates, all of which must be met before a court may properly assume jurisdiction over an ATS claim.\u201d <em>Mastafa v. Chevron Corp., </em>770 F.3d 170, 179 (2d Cir. 2014). These include, \u201cbut may not be limited to,\u201d <em>id. </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">(1) [T]he complaint pleads a violation of the law of nations, <em>see Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 732, 124 S.Ct. 2739; <em>Kadic v. Karadzic, </em>70 F.3d 232, 238 (2d Cir. 1995);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">(2) [T]he presumption against the extraterritorial application of the ATS, announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Kiobel </em>[77] does not bar the claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">(3) [C]ustomary international law recognizes liability for the defendant, <em>see Kiobel </em>[I], 621 F.3d at 145 ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">(4) [T]he theory of liability alleged by plaintiffs <em>(I.e., </em>aiding and abetting, conspiracy) is recognized by customary international law, <em>see Khulumani v. Barclay National Bank Ltd., </em>504 F.3d 254, 264 (2d Cir. 2007) (Katzmann, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-13\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">The District Court found that the complaint failed to rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality. On appeal, the parties focus on that inquiry, as well as whether customary international law recognizes liability for LCB in its capacity as a corporation. <em>See </em>Appellants Br. 18-40; Appellees Br. 36-48. Nevertheless, we consider all four inquiries, as each \u201crequires an affirmative determination before a court properly has jurisdiction over an ATS claim.\u201d <em>Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 179. As set forth below, we conclude that Plaintiffs have satisfied all of the jurisdictional predicates but one. Because this Circuit has ruled that customary international law does not recognize liability for corporations, <em>see Kiobel I, </em>621 F.3d at 145, we must conclude that the District Court does not have jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims against LCB, a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">II. Pleading a Violation of the Law of Nations</p>\n<p id=\"Ave\">The ATS confers jurisdiction over only two varieties of torts: (1) violations of treaties ratified by the United States and (2) violations of the law of nations, <em>i.e., </em>customary international law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350; <em>see also Flores, </em>414 F.3d at 247. \u201cThere is no federal subject-matter jurisdiction under the [ATS] unless the complaint adequately pleads a violation of the law of nations (or treaty of the United States).\u201d <em>Kadic, </em>70 F.3d at 238; <em>see also Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 179-81. \u201cBecause the [ATS] requires that plaintiffs plead a violation of the law of nations at the jurisdictional threshold, this statute requires a more searching review of the merits to establish jurisdiction than is required under the more flexible \u2018arising under\u2019 formula of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1331.\u201d <em>Kadic, </em>70 F.3d at 238 (other internal quotations marks omitted). Therefore, \u201cit is not a sufficient basis for jurisdiction to plead merely a colorable violation of the law of nations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This inquiry has a definitive historical dimension, as \u201cfederal courts should not recognize private claims under federal common law for violations of any international law norm with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the historical paradigms familiar when [the ATS] was enacted.\u201d <em>Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 732, 124 S.Ct. 2739.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Plaintiffs assert that Hezbollah\u2019s actions, including \u201cits attempts to physically exterminate or expel the Jewish residents of Israel and its intentional and systematic use of violence against civilians, constitute genocide, crimes against humanity^] and war crimes under customary international law, and therefore constitute violations of \u2018the law of nations\u2019 within the meaning of [the ATS].\u201d App. 110. They allege that LCB\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[ ] aiding and abetting [Hezbollah\u2019s] acts of genocide, crimes against humanity[,] and war crimes.\u201d App. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes certainly constitute violations of the law of nations under customary international law. <em>See Radio, </em>70 F.3d at 236 (observing that a defendant \u201cmay be found liable for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity\u201d under the ATS); <em>Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 762, 124 S.Ct. 2739 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (describing a \u201csubset\u201d of \u201cuniversally condemned behavior\u201d for which \u201cuniversal jurisdiction exists,\u201d including \u201ctorture, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes\u201d). Plaintiffs have alleged systematic rocket attacks against the Jewish civilian population in Israel, committed with the intent to exterminate or expel them from the territory. These allegations adequately plead acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. Therefore, Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden to assert a cause of action grounded in actions recognized as violations of the law of nations. <em>See Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 181 (finding that \u201cplaintiffs have satisfied their burden of asserting some causes of actions grounded in actions recognized as violations of customary international law\u201d where they asserted that the principal committed genocide, war crimes, and \u25a0crimes against humanity).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">III. Theory of Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Plaintiffs assert that the \u201cactions of defendant LCB ... constituted <em>aiding and abetting </em>[Hezbollah\u2019s] acts of genocide, crimes against humanity[,] and war crimes under the law of nations.\u201d App. Ill (emphasis added). Aiding and abetting is a theory of liability recognized by customary international law. <em>Khulumani, </em>504 F.3d at 260 (Opinion of the Court); <em>see id. </em>at 270 (Katzmann, J., concurring); <em>see also Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 181 (recognizing that, in this Circuit, a plaintiff may plead a theory of aiding and abetting liability under the ATS). Accordingly, Plaintiffs have pleaded a theory of liability over which we have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">IV. Displacing the Presumption against Extraterritoriality</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The presumption against extraterritoriality provides that \u201cwhen a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none, and reflects the presumption that United States law governs domestically but does not rule the world.\u201d <em>Kiobel II, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1664 (alteration, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). The presumption typically applies when a court is discerning \u201cwhether an Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In <em>Kiobel II, </em>the Supreme Court held that the presumption against extraterritoriality constrains courts exercising their power under the ATS. <em>Id. </em>at 1664-65. <em>Kio-bel II\u2019s </em>extension of the presumption against extraterritoriality to the ATS in its capacity as a \u201cstrictly jurisdictional\u201d statute was principally based on foreign policy considerations. <em>Id. </em>at 1664 (quoting <em>Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 713,124 S.Ct. 2739). The Court observed that the \u201cdanger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in the context of the ATS, because the question is not what Congress has done but instead what courts may do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It underscored, therefore, \u201cthe need for judicial caution in considering which claims could be brought under the ATS, in light of foreign policy concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court was careful, however, to provide that a plaintiff could \u201cdisplace\u201d the presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">[E]ven where the claims touch and concern the territory of the United States, they must do so with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application. Corporations are often present in many countries, and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1669 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">To determine whether Plaintiffs have displaced the presumption against extraterritoriality, we first consider the threshold inquiry of whether the presumption is \u201cself-evidently dispositive\u201d or whether \u201cits application requires further analysis.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Nat\u2019l Australia Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 266, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010); <em>see also Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 182. That is, when a complaint alleges <em>no </em>contact \u201cbetween the injuries alleged and the territory of the United States,\u201d the presumption against extraterritoriality is not displaced and the inquiry, in all likelihood, ends there. <em>Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 182-83; <em>Balintulo v. Daimler AG, </em>727 F.3d 174, 189 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality set forth in <em>Kiobel II </em>\u201cbecause the plaintiffs have failed to allege that <em>any </em>relevant conduct occurred in the United States\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The <em>Kiobel </em>complaint, which contained no averment of contact between the conduct alleged and U.S. territory, was self-evidently dispositive. <em>See Kiobel II, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1669. The <em>Kiobel </em>plaintiffs were Nigerian nationals alleging that certain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations aided and abetted Nigerian military and police forces in \u201cattacking] [plaintiffs\u2019] villages, beating, raping, killing, and arresting residents and destroying or looting property\u201d by \u201camong other things, providing the Nigerian forces with food, transportation, and compensation, as well as by allowing the Nigerian military to use respondents\u2019 property as a staging ground for attacks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1662-63. The Supreme Court held that because \u201call the relevant conduct took place outside the United States,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not displace the presumption against extraterritorial application. <em>Id. </em>at 1669.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\"><em>Kiobel </em>is not this case. Unlike the <em>Kio-bel </em>plaintiffs, who only alleged extraterritorial conduct, Plaintiffs allege, <em>inter alia, </em>that LCB used its correspondent banking account in New York to facilitate dozens of international wire transfers for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Shahid, an entity alleged to be an \u201cintegral part\u201d of Hezbollah. App. 65. Thus, Plaintiffs allege sufficient connections with the United States to require \u201cfurther analysis.\u201d <em>Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 182 (internal quotation mark omitted). Applying <em>Kiobel II </em>and <em>Morrison, </em>we have previously set forth exactly what that \u201cfurther analysis\u201d entails. <em>See Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 185-87. As a preliminary matter, the court must isolate the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d in the complaint \u2014 here, \u201cthe conduct of the defendant ... that constitutes aiding and abetting another\u2019s violation of the law of nations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In isolating the relevant conduct of the defendant, a court must evaluate the \u201cterritorial events\u201d or \u201crelationships\u201d that were the \u201cfocus\u201d of the ATS. <em>Id. </em>at 184 (alterations omitted) (quoting <em>Morrison, </em>561 U.S. at 266, 130 S.Ct. 2869). Then, in \u201cdetermining whether this conduct displaces the presumption, the district court must engage in a two-step jurisdictional analysis of this conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Step one is a determination of whether the relevant con<em>duct </em>\u2014 ie., conduct aiding and abetting a violation of the law of nations \u2014 \u201csufficiently \u2018touches and concerns\u2019 the territory of the United States so as to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186 (quoting <em>Kiobel II, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1669). Step two is a determination of whether \u201cthe <em>same conduct, </em>upon preliminary examination, states a claim for a violation of the law of nations or aiding and abetting another\u2019s violation of the law of nations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Applying this framework, the District Court appears to have found that step one was satisfied; it dismissed the complaint on its conclusion that Plaintiffs failed to meet the requirements of step two. Special App. 9-10. On appeal, the parties dispute whether either step is met. <em>See </em>Appellants Br. 21-23; Appellee Br. 37-39. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\n<em>A. Conduct that Touches and Concerns the United States</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The \u201crelevant conduct\u201d in the complaint is LCB\u2019s provision of wire transfers between Hezbollah accounts through its correspondent bank in New York. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege (1) LCB \u201cprovided extensive banking services to [Hezbollah]\u201d that \u201ccaused, enabled[,] and facilitated the terrorist rocket attacks in which the plaintiffs and their decedents were harmed and killed\u201d and (2) those banking services \u201cwere carried out by LCB <em>in and through the State of New York.\u201d. </em>App. 58 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs further allege that \u201cbetween 2004 and July 12, 2006 (and subsequently), [Hezbollah] made and received dozens of dollar wire transfers ... totaling several million dollars,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll\u201d of those wire transfers \u201cwere made to, from, and/or between\u201d Hezbollah\u2019s bank accounts at various LCB branches through AmEx in New York. App. 66. Plaintiffs allege that LCB worked \u201cin concert with\u201d AmEx to carry out the wire transfers, and that AmEx acted \u201con behalf of\u2019 LCB in carrying out the transfers. App. 66. Plaintiffs offer additional allegations that the New York State Banking Department investigated LCB\u2019s correspondent bank in New York when the wire transfers took place, and that the bank violated various terrorist financing and money laundering laws in carrying out the transfers. App. 104-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">We have previously concluded that a claim similar to the Plaintiffs\u2019 sufficiently touched and concerned the United States to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application. Specifically, in <em>Mas-tafa, </em>we considered an ATS claim brought by five Iraqi nationals against an oil company and a French bank. <em>See </em>770 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>174. The <em>Mastafa </em>plaintiffs alleged that the oil company and the bank aided and abetted the Saddam Hussein regime in its torture, imprisonment, and execution of the plaintiffs or their family members \u201cby paying the regime kickbacks and other unlawful payments, which enabled the regime to survive and perpetrate the abuses suffered by plaintiffs or their husbands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. The allegations stemmed from the United Nations\u2019 Oil for Food Pro-gramme (\u201cOFP\u201d), a program that \u201cpermitted the export of oil from Iraq in exchange for food, medicine, and other basic civilian necessities by allowing the purchase of Iraqi oil to proceed through <em>an </em>escrow account, into which purchasers submitted payments and from which providers of civilian necessities received payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In essence, the <em>Mastafa </em>plaintiffs alleged \u201cthat the Saddam Hussein regime \u2014 then subject to United Nations economic sanctions\u2014 misused the OFP in order to elicit income outside the United Nations\u2019 oversight and fund its regime and to fund its campaign of human rights abuses against its people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Three of the four allegations in the <em>Mas-tafa </em>plaintiffs\u2019 complaint came up short. The allegations were insufficient to satisfy the touch and concern inquiry because they were either (1) too tangential to the conduct alleged to aid and abet a violation of the law of nations or (2) inadequately pleaded. <em>See id. </em>at 189-90. First, we determined that \u201cthe fact that the United Nations is located in New York, and that the OFP\u2019s inception and - administration occurred in New York, [was] irrelevant\u201d to the touch and concern inquiry, as \u201c[s]uch allegations, by themselves, are not facts related to defendants at all, let alone alleged conduct taken by defendants to aid and abet violations of the law of nations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. Second, we considered the fact that the oil company is headquartered in the United States to be \u201cimmaterial\u201d because \u201cthe relevant inquiry is on conduct constituting a violation of customary international law or of aiding and abetting such violations, not on where defendants are present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, we rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that because the defendant oil company is headquartered in the United States, \u201cits profits reaped from the transactions were recouped in the United States\u201d as a mere conclusory statement that \u201cd[id] not satisfy basic pleading requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">However, we found that the <em>Mastafa </em>plaintiffs\u2019 fourth allegation \u2014 that the French bank \u201centered into a Banking Agreement with the United Nations in New York pursuant to which it maintained an escrow account in New York City through which all OFP funds moved, including the illicit surcharge payments\u201d\u2014 sufficiently touched and concerned the United States to surpass the first step of displacing the presumption against extraterritoriality. <em>Id. </em>at 190-91. Specifically, the <em>Mastafa </em>plaintiffs alleged that both the bank and the oil company made \u201cU.S.based attempts to skirt the sanctions regime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. As to the bank, plaintiffs alleged that it \u201cmaintained [an] escrow account in New York City through which all [relevant] payments were, transmitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiffs alleged that the bank \u201callowed payments\u201d through the New York City account that included kickbacks to the Saddam Hussein regime, and that the bank\u2019s financing arrangements \u201callowed the oil purchasers to conceal the true nature of the oil purchase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation mark omitted). As to the oil company, plaintiffs alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that it facilitated surcharge payments to the Hussein regime as part of particular transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tions. <em>Id. </em>Assessing this allegation, we concluded that the relevant conduct was sufficiently \u201cspecific and domestic\u201d to (1) be non-conclusory and (2) touch and concern the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 191. We held that the plaintiffs\u2019 fourth allegation touched and concerned the United States with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality and establish ATS jurisdiction \u2014 so long as it also \u201csatisfie[d] a preliminary determination that such conduct aided and abetted a violation of the law of nations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Like the <em>Mastafa </em>plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against the French bank, Plaintiffs here assert that LCB, a Lebanese Bank, used a correspondent banking account at a New York bank to facilitate wire transfers between Hezbollah\u2019s bank accounts in the months leading up to the rocket attacks. Plaintiffs specifically allege that LCB carried out the specific \u201cbanking services which harmed the plaintiffs and their decedents <em>... in and through the State of New York.\u201d </em>App. 58 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs here have alleged that LCB engaged in \u201cnumerous New York-based payments and \u2018financing arrangements\u2019 conducted exclusively through a New York bank account.\u201d <em>See Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 191. As in <em>Masta-fa, </em>we find these allegations to be both specific and domestic. <em>See id. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations \u201ctouch and concern\u201d the United States with sufficient force to displace the presumption, so long as such conduct also meets the second prong of our extraterritoriality analysis.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\n<em>B. States a Claim for Violation of the Law of Nations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">To displace the presumption against extraterritoriality, the conduct \u201cwhich the court has determined sufficiently \u2018touches and concerns\u2019 the United States\u201d must also, upon preliminary examination, state a claim for a violation of the law of nations or aiding and abetting another\u2019s violation of the law of nations. <em>Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 186-87. \u201cThis second step of the extraterritoriality analysis ensures ... that \u2018the statute\u2019s jurisdictional reach will match the statute\u2019s underlying substantive grasp.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186 (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Kiobel II, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1673 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment)). A defendant may be held liable under an aiding and abetting theory of liability under international law if the defendant \u201c(1) provide[d] practical assistance to the principal which has a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime, and (2) d[id] so with the purpose of facilitating the commission of that crime.\u201d <em>Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., </em>582 F.3d 244, 259 (quoting <em>Khulumani, </em>504 F.3d at 277 (Katzmann, <em>J., </em>concurring)). As to the latter requirement, we have underscored that the <em>mens rea </em>standard for accessorial liability in ATS actions is \u201cpurpose rather than knowledge alone.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The District Court here did not address whether Plaintiffs adequately alleged that LCB provided practical assistance to Hezbollah that had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>concluded only that Plaintiffs have \u201cinsufficiently allege[d] that the wire transfers aided and abetted a violation of the law of nations.\u201d Special App. 9. The court reasoned that Plaintiffs failed to surpass its preliminary <em>mens rea </em>determination because the complaint\u2019s allegations of LCB\u2019s intent are merely \u201cconclusory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It further noted that the complaint is \u201cdevoid of any factual allegations supporting LCB\u2019s specific intent, in executing the wire transfers, to promote or engage in Hezbollah\u2019s coercive actions against the Israeli government and public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBecause the [complaint] inadequately pleads that the wire transfers at issue were made with the intent to aid and abet the alleged terrorist activities,\u201d it concluded, \u201cPlaintiffs have not established that there is subject matter jurisdiction under the ATS.\u201d Special App. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The relevant conduct alleged <em>here </em>\u2014 ie., LCB\u2019s alleged act of carrying out wire transfer services on Hezbollah\u2019s behalf through the state of New York, <em>see </em>App. 58, 65-66 \u2014 satisfies a preliminary determination that such conduct provided practical assistance to Hezbollah that substantially affected Hezbollah\u2019s perpetration of the underlying violations of the law of nations. Plaintiffs adequately allege that these wire transfer services had a substantial effect on Hezbollah\u2019s actions insofar as they \u201cenabled\u201d and \u201cfacilitated\u201d terrorist rocket attacks harming or killing Plaintiffs and their decedents. App. 54. Plaintiffs further allege that LCB\u2019s wire transfers \u201csubstantially increased and facilitated [Hezbollah\u2019s] ability to plan, to prepare for[,] and to carry out rocket attacks on civilians,\u201d including the rocket attacks injuring or killing Plaintiffs and their family members. App. 86. In addition, Plaintiffs particularly allege that \u201c[Hezbollah] planned, made the preparations necessary for and carried out\u201d the rocket attacks by \u201cutilizing funds\u201d received as part of the wire transfers. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are bolstered by evidence in the record that LCB\u2019s wire transfers \u201csignificantly enhanced [Hezbollah]\u2019s ability to plan and carry out terrorist and other violent actions, including the rocket attacks in which [Plaintiffs] were harmed.\u201d App. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">LCB does not dispute whether Plaintiffs have adequately shown that it provided practical assistance to Hezbollah that has had a substantial effect on the perpetration of the underlying crimes. Rather, it argues only that the District Court correctly held that Plaintiffs have failed to meet the required <em>mens rea </em>for accessorial liability. We disagree. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, considered in conjunction with the Shaya declaration and the government\u2019s actions against LCB, satisfies our preliminary review of the <em>mens rea </em>requirement for aiding and abetting violations of the law of nations. <em>See Presbyterian Church, </em>582 F.3d at 259. In essence, Plaintiffs allege that (1) LCB acted intentionally, and pursuant to its official policy, in assisting Hezbollah in carrying out the rocket attacks by carrying out the wire transfers, and (2) LCB knew that the bank accounts between which it facilitated transfers were owned and controlled by Shahid, an integral part of Hezbollah.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">As an initial matter, Plaintiffs allege that \u201cas a matter of official LCB policy\u201d LCB \u201ccontinuously supports and supported [Hezbollah] and its anti-Israel program, goals[,] and activities.\u201d App. 88. They also allege that LCB had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that (1) \u201c[Hezbollah] is a violent terrorist organization [that] carried out numerous terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and American targets and which planned and intended to carry out additional such terrorist attacks,\u201d App. 88-89; (2) \u201cShahid is an integral part of [Hezbollah] and constitutes part of [Hezbollah\u2019s] financial arm,\u201d App. 90; (3) Hezbollah\u2019s bank ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>counts at various LCB branches and the funds therein \u201cwere owned and controlled by [Hezbollah],\u201d <em>Id.) </em>(4) the wire transfers made and received by Hezbollah leading up to the 2006 rocket attacks \u201cwere being carried out by and at the direction of [Hezbollah],\u201d <em>Id.) see also </em>App. 65-66; and (5) Hezbollah \u201crequire[d] wire transfer services ... in order to plan, to prepare for and to carry out terrorist attacks.\u201d App. 89. Plaintiffs then allege that LCB, equipped with this actual knowledge, carried out the wire transfers at issue \u201cwith the specific purpose and intention of enabling and assisting [Hezbollah] to carry out terrorist attacks against Jewish civilians in Israel.\u201d App. 109. Indeed, the complaint states that LCB carried out the wire transfers \u201cas a matter of official LCB policy, in order to assist and advance [Hezbollah\u2019s] terrorist activities against Jews in Israel, in order to assist and advance [Hezbollah\u2019s] goal of using terrorism to destroy the State of Israel and murder or expel its Jewish inhabitants and in order to assist and advance [Hezbollah\u2019s] goal of coercing, intimidating and influencing the Israeli government and public.\u201d App. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">As set forth above, in determining this disputed jurisdictional fact, we may also consider evidence in the record outside the pleadings. <em>See Flores, </em>414 F.3d at 255 n.30. The Shaya declaration provides, context to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that LCB aided and abetted Hezbollah\u2019s alleged violations of the law of nations. Specifically, the Shaya declaration states that between \u201c2004 and July 12, 2006 (and later),\u201d Hezbollah \u201cmade dozens of dollar wire transfers in and out of\u2019 a specific account number at LCB\u2019s headquarters. App. 127. Shaya stated that LCB requested that its correspondent bank in New York carry out the wire transfers and identified Shahid as the account-holder, and thus \u201cthere is no question\u201d that AmEx Bank <em>knew </em>that it was executing wire transfers on behalf of Sha-hid. App. 127-28. In addition, the government forfeiture action against LCB lends support to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. <em>See </em>App. 323-95. Specifically, the government alleged that LCB engaged in activity \u201cintended to conceal and disguise the true source, nature, ownership, and control of\u2019 proceeds of illegal activities in a scheme that \u201cbenefitted [Hezbollah].\u201d App. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges conduct by LCB that touched and concerned the United States, and that the same conduct, upon preliminary examination, states a claim for aiding and abetting Hezbollah\u2019s violation of the law of nations, with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have surpassed the jurisdictional hurdle set forth in <em>Kiobel II, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1669.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">V. Corporate Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Nevertheless, <em>Kiobel I </em>forecloses Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against LCB. In <em>Kiobel I, </em>we established that the law of nations, while imposing civil liability on individuals for torts that qualify under the ATS, immunizes corporations from liability. <em>Kiobel I, </em>621 F.3d at 120. Specifically, <em>Kiobel I </em>held that \u201cinsofar as plaintiffs bring claims under the ATS against corporations, plaintiffs fail to allege violations of the law of nations, and plaintiffs\u2019 claims fall outside the limited jurisdiction provided by the ATS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither party disputes that LCB is a corporation. Accordingly, we cannot exercise subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims pursuant to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">To the extent Plaintiffs submit that <em>Kio-bel I </em>was wrongly decided, we reaffirm <em>Arab Bank\u2019s </em>conclusion- \u2014 we are not free to consider that argument. <em>In re Arab Bank, </em>808 F.3d at 157. \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that a panel of this court is bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>See NML Capital v. Republic of Argentina, </em>621 F.3d 230, 243 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord In re Arab Bank, </em>808 F.3d at 157. Indeed, this Court has previously declined similar attempts by ATS plaintiffs to overturn <em>Kiobel I. See In re Arab Bank, PLC Alien Tort Statute Litig., </em>822 F.3d 34, 35 (2d Cir. 2016) (denying rehearing en banc). Accordingly, we faithfully apply <em>Kiobel I </em>and affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of this case on that basis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM IN PART<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-11\">.

At another point in the complaint, Plaintiffs allege that LCB carried out the wire transfers at issue \u201cwith the specific purpose and intention of enabling and assisting [Hezbollah] to carry out its goal of physically exterminating or expelling the Jewish residents of Israel, and its goal of intentionally and systematically using violence against Jewish civilians in Israel.\u201d App. 111.

As the above analysis indicates, the fact that LCB's correspondent bank in New York, AmEx, is no longer a party to this appeal, is immaterial to our conclusion that the allegations against defendant LCB sufficiently touch and concern the United States. Plaintiffs\u2019 only allegations against AmEx that did not also involve LCB's domestic contacts include (1) AmEx is headquartered in New York and incorporated in Connecticut, and (2) AmEx \"does extensive business and holds significant assets in New York.\u201d App. 57. Because the relevant inquiry is whether the defendant's conduct touches and concerns the United States, not where the defendant or particular assets are located, AmEx's absence as a party does not affect that inquiry. <em>See Mastafa, </em>770 F.3d at 190.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\">. In voting against reconsideration of <em>Kiobel I\u2019s </em>holding that the ATS does not regulate corporate conduct, four judges of our Court reasoned that \"the population of cases dismissible under <em>Kiobel I </em>is <em>largely coextensive </em>with those dismissible under <em>Kiobel II.\" In re Arab Bank, 822 </em>F.3d at 35 (Jacobs, concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis added).
