The only formal objection made was based upon the second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">After the third question had been answered by the witness, another objection was made, evidently in anticipation of further examination along the same line, that the proper way to prove a conviction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>by a court record. This objection was obviously prospective in its purpose and operation as indicated by the statements of counsel, \u2014 \u201cI am not anticipating what this witness may answer. I don\u2019t know what he may answer\u201d \u2014; and by the ruling of the court, \u2014 \u201cThe same ruling applies here as before, that Mr. Roberge must only tell what he himself knows.\u201d No further questions upon the subject were in fact asked of the witness. Finally an objection was made to the introduction of any record of Plante\u2019s conviction, upon the ground that it was immaterial and an exception taken to the ruling of the court that it would be admitted, but when the record was finally offered and further objection made, the offer was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">It thus appears that counsel, by his exceptions and objections, invoked three rules of evidence, viz:\u2014 (i) the rule excluding irrelevant facts, (2) the hearsay rule, (3) the \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule. All of the objections were evidently designed to prevent the giving of unfavorable answers by the witness. No objection was made to the form or the content of the questions themselves. On account of the negative nature of the answers and the failure of the defendant to press the subject further, no violations of any of these rules, in fact, took place. The objection now urged against the questions, that they involved a testimonial assertion by counsel of the fact that Plante had a criminal record, was not suggested to the trial court. It is well settled that this court will not consider grounds of exceptions not specified or called to the court\u2019s attention at the trial. <em>Monteith </em>v. <em>Company, </em>82 N.
