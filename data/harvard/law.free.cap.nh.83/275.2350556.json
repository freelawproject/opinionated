The testimony was that the officers found liquor and that it was alcohol. This was some evidence that the substance was not something else.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">It also appears that the bottle containing the alcohol was cunningly concealed, so as to prevent its discovery. It is not probable that this would have been done if it had contained an article freely and lawfully sold and used. The defendant\u2019s husband testified that he bought the commodity for his own use \u2014 evidently as a beverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The defendant was a witness in Her own behalf, but neither she nor her husband testified to anything tending to sustain the claim that the liquid was not fit for beverage use.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">There was ample evidence to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
