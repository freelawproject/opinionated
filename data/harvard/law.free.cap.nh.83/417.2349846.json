H. McNamara Tire Co. <em>v. </em>Edward F. Pillsbury <em>&amp; a.</em></parties>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-12\"><em>James A. Broderick </em>(by brief and orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-13\"><em>Maurice F. Devine </em>and <em>John E.

The plaintiff does not claim that any definite items or part of such assets were bought with the proceeds of its property, but takes the position that the use of the proceeds in the general course of the assignor\u2019s business shows a sufficient following to impress the assets in the assignee\u2019s hands in their entirety with a trust in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">The claim that the assets in the assignee\u2019s hands are enhanced in value by the amount of the assignor\u2019s conversion carries an assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>unsupported by the findings. The situation is on all fours with that in <em>Bank Commissioners </em>v. <em>Company, </em>70 N. H. 536, in which the court says <em>(p. </em>550): \u201cA claimant who seeks a preference by reason of a trust is called upon to prove the existence of the trust . . . proof by the claimants that the defendants, acting in a fiduciary capacity, collected money for them a year or six months, or a longer or shorter time before the appointment of the assignee, does not prove that the money or property into which it may have been converted was on hand at the time the assignee took possession, nor that the estate as a whole was then larger or more valuable than it would have been otherwise. The money may have been lost, [or] used in the payment of expenses or debts. . . .\u201d \u201cIf it does not appear . . . that the assignee received the money or property in which it [the property converted] was ultimately invested, the claimant must fall back on his rights as an ordinary creditor.\u201d <em>Ib., p. </em>551.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\">No convincing argument is made for altering or modifying this test. So far as the cases in other jurisdictions cited by the plaintiff do not apply it, they cannot be regarded as authority here. While it may not be necessary to follow the use of money charged with a trust into the purchase of, or investment in, particular items of a general mass of property, it must at least appear that it went into the acquisition of the mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Evidence here is. wholly lacking to show that any separate items, or any unseparated portion, of the assets received by the assignee were acquired directly or indirectly through the assignor\u2019s use of the proceeds of the plaintiff\u2019s property. All of such proceeds may have been used to pay debts, lost in the conduct of the business, or withdrawn from use in the business to other purposes of the assignor. For all that appears the assets coming into the assignee\u2019s possession would have been as much in amount and cost if there had been no conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-6\">Peaslee, C.
