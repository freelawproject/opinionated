This draft was not completed; and since the death of Judge <em>Doe, </em>the superior court <em>(Sawyer, </em>C. J.) has declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">The order of mistrial was not only authorized but apparently required by the situation in which the case was left. The defendant\u2019s exceptions raise various questions which would be material upon a petition for a new trial, under the statute (P. L., c. 342), but they have no application to the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
