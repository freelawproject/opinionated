P. L., c. 302, <em>ss. </em>1, 3. But it is also provided that \u201ca notice sent to the administrator or his agent by registered mail, setting forth the nature and amount of the claim and a demand for payment, shall be deemed a sufficient exhibition and demand.\u201d <em>Ib., s. </em>2. In accordance with the foregoing provisions, it is a well-established rule \u201cthat proof of notice is to be affirmatively established at the trial as a part of the plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Carvelle, </em>82 N. H. 453, 454. When the demand has been exhibited to the agent of an administrator or executor, lack of registration is immaterial if receipt of bill is admitted or established. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Carvelle, supra. </em>The statute does not prescribe any method for the appointment of an agent to receive claims against an estate. Therefore, the question of authority for that purpose is simply one of agency in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">1. The first position of the defendant is that there was no evidence that her attorney had authority to receive claims against the estate. It may be conceded that proof of the fact that an executrix has employed a lawyer to act as her \u201cattorney ... in the settling of the . . . estate\u201d would not in and of itself justify a conclusion that he was her agent for the purpose of receiving claims. Specific authority for that purpose is necessary. <em>Strafford Sav. Bank v. Church, </em>69 N. H. 582. But there is no reason why an attorney thus employed should not be clothed with the authority of such an agent. The employment being conceded, the extent of the agency thereby created is a question of fact. In the absence of a writing, the conduct of the parties, which has the effect of placing a contemporary construction upon their agreement, furnishes the best evidence of what the agreement was. <em>Atto </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>77 N. H. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In the present case both the defendant and her attorney acted as if he were her agent for the purpose of receiving claims. When the plaintiff sent her bill to him he acknowledged its receipt and asked for further information, without suggesting any lack of authority on his part. If he was not in fact authorized to receive claims against the estate the ordinary rules of fair dealing would require that, if he said anything to the plaintiff, he should tell her that she had presented her demand to the wrong person. Furthermore, he transmitted notice of the claim to the defendant and undertook, on her behalf, an investigation of its merits. He conferred with the plaintiff\u2019s counsel about it, and later on declined to pay it upon the ground that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>not think it was a just claim. Finally, he appeared for the defendant at the trial, but failed to testify that he was not authorized to act as her agent. The defendant testified that she received notice of the claim from the attorney and that she immediately began to look up accounts of the deceased and t\u00f3 investigate his whereabouts during the time in question. In other words, she treated the claim as though it were properly presented. Her conduct in failing to pay the claim and in going to trial as she did constituted a ratification of the attorney\u2019s action in rejecting the claim, and nowhere in the course of her testimony did she deny his authority to receive it. Under these circumstances, a finding that he was in fact her agent for this purpose was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">2. The second contention of the defendant is that the statement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as presented did not fulfill the requirements of the statute because the dates given in her letter to the defendant\u2019s attorney did not correspond with the dates proved at the trial. It is argued that \u201cthe exhibition of an intentionally misdated claim for services is not sufficient exhibition of a claim for an entirely different period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The above assertion of intentional misstatement finds scant support in the testimony and certainly was not conclusively proved. It might well be found that when her bill was sent to the attorney the plaintiff had no record and was uncertain as to the exact period during which the deceased was a member of her household, and that when-asked for dates she did her best to give accurate information. In her testimony she said, \u201cWell, I reckoned back as near as I could. . . . That is as near as I could reckon it. ... I thought it was right, there ... I run it over in my mind that I thought he came there at that time.\u201d If these statements be accepted as true, the admission, which was cleverly extracted from her on cross-examination, that she \u201cmade up\u201d the dates given in her letter only meant that she gave dates which she believed to be reasonably accurate but which subsequently proved to be erroneous. It is therefore unnecessary to decide at this time what the effect of an intentionally false statement in regard to dates would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The second branch of the defendant\u2019s argument, to the effect that the claim exhibited was not the one upon which a recovery was had, is equally without merit. The plaintiff\u2019s bill as originally presented was a substantial compliance with the statute, since it brought the nature and amount of the claim distinctly to the notice of the administratrix. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Carvelle, </em>82 N. H. 453, 455; <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>66 N. H. 385, 386; <em>Judge of Probate </em>v. <em>Runnells, </em>66 N. H. 271; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Little </em>v. <em>Little, </em>36 N. H. 224; <em>Tebbetts </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>31 N. H. 273, 282. This was sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the act which is to bring claims to the knowledge of the administrator, so that he may-judge in what manner the estate should be settled, and also that he may make inquiry into them with a view to furnishing himself with the necessary information for their proper adjustment. <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Chadwick, supra; Judge of Probate </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>51 N. H. 342, 349; <em>Little </em>v. <em>Little, supra; Tebbetts </em>v. <em>Tilton, supra. </em>It gave the administratrix that \u201cinformation as a basis for investigation and action\u201d which the statute contemplates. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Carvelle, supra, </em>456. Defendant\u2019s argument, therefore, comes to this: That a meritorious claim seasonably presented must fail because after exhibition a mistaken statement was made as to the time when it accrued. The inconsistency of this contention, with any conception of substantial justice between the parties, raises a presumption that it is unsound, which further consideration confirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In his argument, defendant\u2019s counsel assumes that plaintiff\u2019s bill and letter should be read together and treated as though each formed a part of the claim presented. It is by no means clear that this assumption is correct. The plaintiff\u2019s letter is not phrased, and apparently is not designed, as an amendment of her original claim or as a specification supplementing it. It appears to be rather an informal answer to counsel\u2019s request for further information, such as might have been given by word of mouth. The information contained in the letter might, therefore, be regarded merely as one of the fruits of investigation which defendant\u2019s counsel instituted on her behalf. If this be so, there is no justification for combining the letter with the bill. The statute merely requires the exhibition of the claim. Tt does not provide that all subsequent utterances of a claimant regarding it shall become a part of the statement of his demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">It is unnecessary, however, to rest the decision upon this ground, for if the bill and letter be read together as the complete statement of plaintiff\u2019s claim, defendant\u2019s argument that the demand exhibited to the administratrix was not the one upon which the jury passed comes to nothing. The legislative provision for exhibition of claims \u201cis a statute of limitations, calculated to promote the speedy settlement of estates.\u201d <em>Jaffrey </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>76 N. H. 168, 173. Under it, the claim presented operates as a limitation on the right subsequently to maintain a suit, and no recovery can be had on any other cause of action than that stated in the claim. See note to <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>34 A. L. R. 352, 356. In determining whether the purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>statute has been accomplished, questions of form and technical exactness are of little consequence. The statute is to be applied with reference to the substance and the realities of the situation. A statement as to the date when a transaction took place is usually immaterial in determining its legal effect. This is so in other departments of the law, where the claims of one party are required to be set forth clearly for the information of the other, and where technical exactness of statement might more properly be required. Thus in criminal law, although the constitution provides that \u201cNo subject shall be held to answer for any crime, or offense, until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him\u201d (Const. of N. H., Part I, <em>art. </em>15) the date stated in an indictment is usually immaterial, and a respondent may be convicted upon proof of the offense on any other date prior to the time when the indictment was returned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>74 N. H. 76, and cases cited. So also it was held, even under the strict rules of common-law pleading, that the allegation in a declaration of the date when a contract was made was immaterial, and that proof of a different date did not constitute a variance. <em>Glidden </em>v. <em>Unity, </em>33 N. H. 571, 580; <em>Atlantic &amp;c. Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>36 N. H. 252, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Throughout these proceedings the plaintiff has made but one claim. She has sought only to recover compensation for boarding and nursing her brother, the deceased, during a certain number of weeks in which he lived at her house. This was the substance of her demand as originally presented. Subsequently, she stated that this period extended from August 13, 1919 to June 29, 1920. Later she discovered and so informed defendant\u2019s counsel, that the time ran from October 12, 1917 to July 12, 1918, and it was for this period that the jury allowed a recovery. If the letter from her attorney containing the revised statement of dates had been received by the defendant\u2019s agent before the first year of administration had expired, the idea that a new and distinct claim was thereby presented would have appeared fantastic. The expiration of the year did not make it any -more reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel argues at some length that after the period for presenting claims has expired it is too late for a creditor to make a substantial change in his demand by amendment, although he seems to concede that amendments as to formal and technical matters should be allowed. There appears to be a conflict of authority on this point in other jurisdictions (see 24 C. J., Tit. Ex\u2019rs and Adm\u2019rs, ss. 991, 992; 11 R. C. L., Tit. Ex\u2019rs and Adm\u2019rs, s. 220) and it is unnecessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>us to consider it at this time. Under our law no public record of claims presented to an executor is required to be made. In a suit against an estate exhibition of the demand need not be averred in the declaration. <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Folsom, </em>8 N. H. 98, 114. Therefore, our conclusion that the claim sued on was in substance the one exhibited to the executrix involves no inconsistency with any existing record, and no amendment is necessary because there is nothing to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">There is a similar lack of merit in defendant\u2019s argument that evidence of a special promise by the testator that the plaintiff should be paid if she survived him asserted a different demand from that previously presented. The effect of this evidence was to show that the statute of limitations had not run against the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as the defendant was contending, but it was in no way inconsistent with the original demand. This point was specifically decided by the Iowa court in <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Outtrim, </em>139 Ia. 192, and with the conclusion reached in that case we are in full accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">3. Subject to defendant\u2019s exception, a witness for the plaintiff was permitted to testify to a conversation which she had with the deceased while he was living with the plaintiff, in which he said, \u201cI want her to have her pay ... if anything happens to me ... I want Nellie to have what I have.\u201d And in answer to the question, \u201cHave you come to any price yet; have you asked them how much they were going to charge you?\u201d, the testator replied, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t make any difference . . . she is my sister and all I have, and, ... I want her to have her pay and I shall see that she does get it.\u201d It is argued that these statements \u201cwere simply hearsay, and should have been excluded.\u201d The answer is that they were properly admitted as admissions by the deceased that his sister\u2019s services were not gratuitously rendered. \u201cNo modern Court doubts that a <em>decedent, </em>whose rights are transmitted intact to his successor, is a person whose admissions are receivable against a party claiming the decedent\u2019s rights as <em>heir, executor, </em>or <em>administrator.\u201d </em>2 Wig., Ev., <em>s. </em>1081; <em>Patten </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>80 N. H. 590; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>66 N. H. 588, 591; <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>57 N.
