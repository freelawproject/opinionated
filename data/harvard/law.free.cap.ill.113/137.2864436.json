Pleading and evidence\u2014as to allegations not traversed. To an information in the nature of a quo warranto to test the defendant\u2019s right to an office, the defendant filed a plea showing his appointment to the office by the city council, the filing of his oath of office in proper time, and the approval of his official bond. The relator, by replication, denied the appointment and the approval of his bond: Held, that as the filing of defendant\u2019s oath of office was not traversed, it stood confessed by the pleadings.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b137-18\" pgmap=\"137\">2.

Where a city council, consisting of eight aldermen and a mayor, are all present, or a quorum is present, and the election of an officer is properly proposed, whoever receives a majority of those who do vote will be elected, although a majority of the members of the council may abstain from voting, or may even protest against the election.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b137-19\" pgmap=\"137\">3.

Under a city charter which gives the mayor a right to vote only in case of a tie, if four out of the eight councilmen vote in the affirmative, and the other four, though present, refuse to vote either way, the mayor may treat those not voting as opposed to those who have voted, and decide the question by voting also in the affirmative.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b137-20\" pgmap=\"137(26) 138(87)\">4.

At a full meeting of a city council, consisting of eight aldermen and a mayor, on motion to approve the city treasurer\u2019s bond, and upon a call for the ayes and noes, four councilmen voted in favor of the motion and the other four refused to vote, and the mayor thereupon declared the motion carried, voting also in the affirmative: Held, that as the approval of the officer\u2019s bond was of the same nature as his election, without which the election was unavailing, the same rule as in elections should apply, and a majority of those voting having voted in the affirmative, the bond was legally approved.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-5\" pgmap=\"138\">5.

The defendant justified by pleading that he had been duly appointed to the office by the city council of East St. Louis, on May 7, 1884; that his oath of office was filed May 8, 1884, and that his official bond was accepted and approved by the city council on May 21, and again on May 29, 1884. Eeplications were filed, denying, first, that defendant had been so appointed; and secondly, that his bond had been accepted and approved. The cause was tried upon these issues.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-9\" pgmap=\"138(46) 139(387) 140(18)\">The bill of exceptions states that the defendant proved that he was appointed to the office of city treasurer at a meeting of the city council held on May 7, 1884, at which the mayor and five councilmen were present, and at which meeting a majority of the said five councilmen voted for his appointment; that on May 21, 1884, there was a special meeting of the city council called for the purpose of approving the minutes of the meetings of the council held on May 7 and 16, 1884, and approving the official bond of the defendant, at which meeting all of the members of the council, eight in number, and the mayor, were present, and that on those questions, on a call of the roll of the members of the council, by a vote by yeas and nays, which was entered upon the journal, four councilmen voted in favor of said motions and the other four refused to vote, and the mayor thereupon declared the motions carried;, that on May 29, 1884, at a special meeting of the council duly called to read the minutes of previous meetings, and to take action in regard to the appointment and qualification of city officers, all of the councilmen and the mayor were present, and on the questions of approving the minutes of the previous meetings, and approval of the official bond of the defendant, four councilmen and the mayor voted in the affirmative, on a call of the roll of members of the council for the yeas and nays, and the other four refused to vote, and did not vote, and the mayor thereupon declared - said motion carried; that the city of Bast St.Louis is organized under an act of the General Assembly of the State of.Illinois, entitled \u201cAn act to reduce the charter of the city of East St. Louis, and the several acts amendatory thereto, into one act, and to revise the same, approved March 26, 1869.\u201d (1 Private Laws, 1869, p. 885.) The defendant also gave in evidence an oath of office taken by him, a commission issued to him by the mayor of the city, and an official bond as treasurer of the city-of Bast St. Louis,\u2014and this was all the evidence ; and thereupon the court, a jury having been waived, found the issues for the People, and the defendant guilty, and after overruling a motion for a new trial, made upon the ground that the.finding was contrary to. the law and to the evidence, rendered judgment of ouster, which was affirmed by the Appellate Court for the Fourth District, and the defendant took the present appeal to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\" pgmap=\"140\">The charter directs the city council to require of each one holding an office of trust in the city, a bond, with sufficient penalty and security, etc.; requires the council to exercise all its powers by ordinance; provides that \u201ca majority'of the couneilmen shall constitute a quorum to do business; \u201d directs the council \u201cto determine the rule of its proceedings in conformity with the usual practice of deliberative bodies; \u201d requires the council to keep a journal of its proceedings, and that \u201cthe yeas and nays, when demanded by any member present, shall be entered on the journal; \u201d makes the mayor presiding officer at city council meetings, and gives him a casting vote in case of a tie, and no other; provides that any office, where the officer appointed fails to qualify within ten days after receiving notice of his appointment, shall be filled by a new appointment ; prescribes the oath of office required of each one elected or appointed to any office, to be made, subscribed and filed before entering upon his office. Under the ordinance in the record, by the stipulation of the parties, the treasurer is required, after his appointment, in addition to making, subscribing and filing the prescribed oath of office, and \u201cbefore entering upon the duties of the office, \u201d to \u201cgive an official bond, in the penal sum of $100,000, payable to the city, with sureties to be approved by the city council. \u201d</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-6\" pgmap=\"140\">Mr. M.

The filing of his oath of office is averred in the plea, and not traversed by the replication. It therefore stands confessed by the pleading, so that all there is remaining to give to defendant complete title to the office of city treasurer, is the approval by the city council of his official bond.</p> <p id=\"b142-6\" pgmap=\"142(294) 143(61)\">There were eight members in the body of the city council; a quorum consisted of five members; the mayor had a casting vote in case of a tie. On the 21st and 29th of May, the council being duly convened, and all its members present, a motion was made to approve defendant\u2019s bond, and one-half of the aldermen (four) and the mayor voted to approve the bond, and the other half refused to vote. This action of the city council, it is claimed by appellant, was a valid approval of the bond.- On the other-hand, it is contended that a majority of the aldermen present (five) should have voted in its favor, to make a valid approval of the bond. In respect of the election of corporate officers, the well settled rule is, as stated in Wilcox on Corporations, sec. 546: \u201cAfter an election has been properly proposed, whoever has a majority of those who vote, the assembly being sufficient, is elected, although a majority of the entire assembly altogether abstain from voting, because their presence suffices to constitute the elective body; and if they neglect to vote, it is their own fault, and shall not invalidate the act of the others, but be construed an assent to the determination of the majority of those who do vote; and such an election is valid though the majority of those whose presence is necessary to the assembly protest against any election at that time, or even the election of the individual who has the majority of votes.\u201d And see Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, secs. 126, 127; Rex v. Foxcraft, 2 Burr. 1017; Commonwealth v. Read, 2 Ashm. 261; State v. Green, 37 Ohio St. 227. This doctrine is admitted by appellee\u2019s counsel, with respect to elections; but they \u2022 claim that it is limited to cases of elections, and does not extend to the transaction of other corporate business,\u2014that in the latter case a majority of those present must vote for a proposition, to carry it. There is authority for this distinction. Gosling v. Veley, 4 H. L. Cases, 679.</p> <p id=\"b143-5\" pgmap=\"143(319) 144(316)\">It is further insisted that as the city charter directs the city council \u201cto determine the rule of its proceedings in conformity with the usual practice of deliberative bodies, \u201d the parliamentary rule which is adopted by such bodies should obtain, and that that rule requires the vote of a quorum to transact business, and that where the roll is called, and the yeas and nays are taken, and it appears from the response to the call that no quorum is voting, business must be suspended till a quorum answers. We do not find it necessary here to pass upon these positions of appellee\u2019s counsel, for, conceding their correctness, we think the admitted rule which applies in cases of elections should be taken to govern in this case of approval of the bond, as being a thing pertaining to the matter of the officer\u2019s appointment. The appointment and approval of the bond are both necessary to the investiture of the office. Both are to be by the same body, and we think they may be looked upon as an entirety in investing any one with the office,\u2014that the approval of the bond is a step in the completely filling of the office of city treasurer by the city council, and thus is not other business, but the same business with that of the officer\u2019s appointment. What the propriety of separating the proceeding, and requiring another mode of expressing the will of the council in the approving of the bond than in the choosing of the officer? We see not why, properly enough, the same rule may not be held to cover the whole proceeding of the making of the officer, and that the same vote in respect of number of members voting, which admittedly suffices in the case of the election of the officer by the city council, should be deemed sufficient for the approval of the officer\u2019s bond. This should be so, unless the authorities forbid. Where the members of the council are equally divided, four voting one way and four the other, there is a \u25a0tie, and the mayor may vote with either side, and make a majority. What reason is there why, when all the eight members are present, and four vote and four refuse to vote, the mayor should not vote with one side or the other, and make a majority? Why may it not be considered as equivalent to a tie, counting the members who do not vote as voting the contrary way from the mayor ? This would be fulfilling the purposes of the law in giving the mayor a casting vote in case of a tie. It would enable the making of a majority, and prevent the obstruction of business by .refusing to act, \u25a0and would be giving effect to the will of the majority, which is the governing rule in the action of corporations. (Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, sec. 499.) What the. propriety of \u25a0giving to a refusal to vote more potency than to a vote cast ?\u2014 of allowing a gain from violation of duty, in making the refusing to vote of more effect in governing the action of the body of which one is a member, than voting ? The charter provision, \u2022that where the officer appointed fails to qualify within ten days after receiving notice of his appointment, the office shall be filled by a new appointment, did not render the appointment void on failing to qualify within the time; but such failure was but a cause of forfeiture of the office, which the city council might waive, and they did here waive it, in proceeding afterward in the approval of the bond. Chicago v. Gage, 95 Ill. 621; Cawley v. People, id. 249.</p> <p id=\"b144-7\" pgmap=\"144(77) 145(86)\">It is said that all controverted questions of fact were finally settled by the judgment of the Appellate Court, and therefore the judgment of that court must be conclusive. It is true that under the Practice act the reexamination of cases brought to this court is to be in respect of questions of law only, and that no assignment of error is to be considered which calls in question the determination of the court below upon controverted questions of fact in any case except as there provided. But in the present case there is no controverted question of fact. Appellee\u2019s counsel say, in their brief, \u201cthere is no controversy as to the facts, and that the only question in either the trial court or the Appellate Court was as to their legal effect.\u201d The question is, whether the unco\u00fctroverted facts sustain the defendant\u2019s plea of justification, which is a ques-. tion of law only, and we answer it in the affirmative.</p> <p id=\"b145-5\" pgmap=\"145\">The judgment of the Appellate Court must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b145-6\" pgmap=\"145\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b145-7\" pgmap=\"145\">Mr. Justice Mulkey :</author> <p id=\"A6z\" pgmap=\"145\">I dissent from the opinion in this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
