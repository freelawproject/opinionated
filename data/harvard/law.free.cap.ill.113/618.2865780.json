Corporation\u2014plea of mil tiel corporation\u2014evidence required. In a suit by a corporation upon an agreement in writing to pay it a sum of money, a plea of nul tiel corporation will not impose upon the plaintiff the burden of proving that it is in all respects a perfectly legal corporation. The plaintiff will be entitled to recover on the issue presented by such plea, by making proof that it has a de facto existence.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b618-15\" pgmap=\"618\">2. Same\u2014proof of de facto existence of corporation\u2014admissibility of evidence\u2014in the case of a foreign corporation. In a suit in this State in the name of an alleged corporation claimed to have been organized under the laws of Indiana, a special act of the General Assembly of that State purporting to legalize its incorporation, even though the act be invalid, as falling under the provision of the constitution of that State prohibiting the passage of special laws, is properly admissible in our courts as evidence of the recognition by that State pf the fact that the plaintiff assumes to exist and act as a corporation, and has a de facto existence.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b618-16\" pgmap=\"618\">3. Upon the question of the de facto corporate existence of a corporation of the State of Indiana, in a suit by it in this State, in which nul tiel corporation is pleaded, a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Indiana not pertinent to the issue being tried, is properly excluded as evidence to the jury.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b618-17\" pgmap=\"618\">4. Same\u2014what'will show the defacto existence of a corporation. In a suit by a corporation upon a promissory note or written obligation made by the defendant for the payment of money, the execution of such note or obligation will afford sufficient prima facie evidence of the de facto corporate existence of the plaintiff, and no further proof thereof is necessary until such proof is rebutted.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-4\" pgmap=\"619\">5. An association may be regarded as a de facto corporation when there is a law authorizing the creation of a corporation of its class and powers, and when there is an attempt, in good faith, to comply with the law; and the only error is in filing a certified copy of the articles of association with the proper depositary, instead of a duplicate of such articles, and when there is also an exercise of corporate functions by the association.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-5\" pgmap=\"619\">6. Same\u2014corporate existence\u2014when strict proof required\u2014distinction in the application of the rule. Where a corporation brings suit to recover for a subscription to its capital stock, the existence of the corporation and its capacity to lawfully issue stock are conditions precedent to its right of recovery. If the stock can not be lawfully issued, the subscriber can not get what he has contracted for, and there is an entire failure of consideration. In such a case it is necessary to give strict proof of incorporation,\u2014in other words, that the plaintiff is a corporation de jure.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-6\" pgmap=\"619\">7. But this rule has no application to the case of a subscription to a corporation for which the subscriber is to receive no stock in consideration of his undertaking. The real consideration in such case upon which the plaintiff is entitled to recover, is that it has expended money, furnished materials or bestowed labor upon the faith of the subscription, and not any special benefit derived, or to be derived, by the promisor from the corporation.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-7\" pgmap=\"619\">8. Same\u2014who may question validity of a foreign corporation. The authority to inquire by quo warranto whether a corporation de facto, organized and acting under the laws of another State, is in all respects a legal and valid corporation, belongs to such State, and to it alone.

In 1855, an act was passed which declared an emergency existed, and that it should be in force from and after its passage, and publication in the \u201cIndiana State Sentinel\u201d and \u201cJournal:\u201d Held, that the publication in the papers named was a condition, only, of the law taking effect before it otherwise would, and that a failure to have the same so published did not prevent its becoming a law upon the publication and distribution of the body of the laws passed at that session.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-9\" pgmap=\"619\">10.

The Supreme Court of Indiana, under a similar law, decided, in an action by an assignee of a purported corporation against a subscriber to the capital stock, that it was necessary that the assignee should prove that a duplicate was filed in the office of the Secretary of State, before it could recover the subscription, and that a copy did not fulfill the law.

Neff, 73 Ind. 68, objection was urged that a corporation could not exist, under the general law of that State, until a duplicate of the articles of incorporation was filed in the office of the Secretary of State; but the objection was overruled, the court, among other things, observing: \u201cIf appellants were correct in their theory that there was no corporation until the duplicate of the articles of association was filed in the office of the Secretary of. State,\u2014 a point we need not, and do not, decide,\u2014they are not in a situation to successfully urge it, because they are conclusively estopped by the deed made to the association, wherein it is recognized and acknowledged to be a corporation.\u201d And there was like ruling, by the same court, in Williamson v. Kokomo Building and Loan Association, 89 Ind. 389. In that ease, as here, a copy, instead of a duplicate, was filed with the Secretary of State, and the court said: \u201cWhere persons assume to incorporate under the laws of the State, and in part comply with their requirements, assume corporate functions and transact business as a corporation, private persons can not collaterally question the right of such an association to a corporate existence, although there has not been a full compliance with the provisions of the statute. (Baker et al. v. Neff, 73 Ind. 68.) This rule is not limited to cases where one, by contract, admits corporate existence, but is a rule of general application. \u201d And, after some further discussion, the court proceeds: \u201cThe rule stated by us does not go to the extent of precluding strangers from showing that there was no law authorizing a corporation, nor from showing that there was no attempt at corporate organization, nor any assumption of corporate powers. (Oroville Railroad Co. v. Plumas Co. 37 Cal. 354.) Where, however, the acts done by persons assuming to act as a corporation are such as to constitute them a de facto corporation, a collateral attack by a private person will, as a general rule, be unavailing. Without attempting to define what a de facto corporation is, we adjudge that an association may be regarded as a de facto corporation where there is a law authorizing the creation of a corporation of its class and powers, and where there is an attempt, in good faith, to comply with the law, and the only error is in filing a certified copy of the articles of association, instead of a duplicate, with one of two designated depositaries, and where there is also an exercise of corporate functions. \u201d And so it follows this was a good de facto corporation in the State of Indiana, where it had its origin, notwithstanding the objection of appellant in regard to the non-filing of the duplicate articles of association.</p> <p id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626(54) 627(123)\">Abbott, in his work on Trial Evidence, page 19, sec. 3, says: \u201cThe cases in which it is necessary to give strict proof of incorporation,\u2014that is, to prove not only the being, but the right to be,\u2014are: First, actions by the State to ascertain or to put an end to corporate existence; second, proceedings by a private corporation in the exercise of a franchise in derogation of common right,\u2014for instance, to divest title to private property; third, proceedings of a penal character by a private corporation; fourth, actions on contracts, like subscriptions for stock, if the very consideration is the organization of a corporation having a right to existence,\u2014in such cases the inquiry may extend to the due compliance with all the requirements of the law, but often, in these cases, it is narrowed or precluded by estoppel or admission; fifth, where the question is whether there is corporate power to take by will, sufficient regularity of origin to show an attempt in good faith to comply with the law may be required. \u201d</p> <p id=\"b627-5\" pgmap=\"627(244) 628(269)\">There can be no reasonable pretence that the present case falls within either of these exceptions; but Nelson v. Blakely, 54 Ind. 30, Stowe v. Flagg et al. 72 Ill. 401, and Bigelow v. Gregory, 73 id. 197, cited by counsel for appellant, and Gent v. Manufacturers and Merchants\u2019 Ins. Co. 107 Ill. 652, and Allman v. Havana, Rantoul and Eastern Railroad Co. 88 id. 521, fall within the principle of the fourth exception. Nelson v. Blakely, and Allman v. Havana, Rantoul and Eastern Railroad Co., were suits to recover for subscriptions to the capital stock of corporations. The contract in such cases is to pay for stock of a corporation, and the existence of the corporation, and its capacity to lawfully issue stock, are therefore necessarily conditions precedent to the right to sue upon the subscription. If stock can not lawfully be issued, the subscriber can not get what he contracted for. There is an entire failure of consideration,\u2014as much so as where one contracts to buy a thing which the seller is afterwards unable to deliver because it has no existence. But appellant made no contract of subscription for stock, here. He is entitled to no stock. His promise to pay was a mere offer until acted upon; but when money was expended or materials furnished, or labor bestowed, upon the faith of it, it became irrevocable, and binding as a promise to pay, (Pratt, Admx. v. Trustees, 93 Ill. 475,) and this, although at the time the writing was executed the corporation was only in contemplation. (Johnston v. Ewing Female University, 35 Ill. 518,; Snell v. Trustees M. E. Church of Clinton, 58 id. 290.) The real consideration upon which the plaintiff is entitled to recover, in such cases, is, that it has expended money, furnished materials, or bestowed labor, upon the faith of the promise in writing, and not any special benefit derived or expected to be derived by the promisor from the corporation. (McClure v. Wilson, 43 Ill. 356, and eases there cited.) In Stowe v. Flagg, the question was whether, in a contest between parties who had taken some, but insufficient, steps to organize a corporation, certain property belonged to these parties as individuals, or to the corporation they had ineffectually attempted to organize; and in Bigelow v. Gregory, the defendants, who were sought to be made liable as individuals, interposed the defence that the liability was corporate,\u2014and in that case it was said: \u201cAnd there would seem to be a distinction between the case where, in a suit between a corporation and a stockholder or other individual, the plea of nul tiel corporation is set up to defeat a liability which the one may have contracted with the other, and the case of a suit against individuals who claim exemption from individual liability on the ground of their having become a corporation formed under the provisions of a general statute. In the latter case a stricter measure of statutory requirements will be required than in the former. \u201d</p> <p id=\"b628-5\" pgmap=\"628(84) 629(111)\">Second\u2014Appellee was organized, or attempted to be organized, under an act of the legislature of the State of Indiana, entitled \u201cAn act for the incorporation of high schools, academies, colleges, universities, theological institutions and missionary boards,\u201d approved February 28, 1855. The ninth section reads as follows: \u201cAs an informality exists in regard to the amendment to the high school law passed in 1853, rendering corporations formed under it of doubtful legality, it is therefore deemed that an emergency exists, and therefore this law shall be in force from and after its passage, and publication in the \u2018Indiana State Sentinel,\u2019 and \u2018Journal.\u2019 \u201d On the trial, the act was read from a book purporting to be printed under the authority of the State of Indiana, entitled as follows: \u201cLaws of the State of Indiana, passed at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly, begun on the fourth day of January, A.

Brown, State printer.\u201d But appellant objected to the reading of the same because it had not been previously proved that the act had been published in the Indianapolis \u201cSentinel\u201d and \u201cJournal,\u201d as provided in the ninth section.</p> <p id=\"b629-5\" pgmap=\"629(244) 630(33)\">By article 4, section 28, of the constitution of the State of Indiana, it is provided that \u201cno act shall take effect until the same shall have been published, and circulated in the several counties of this State, by authority, except in case of emergency,\u2014which emergency shall be declared in the preamble, or in the body of the law. \u201d The publication required by the ninth section was only for the purpose of giving effect to the statute, as an emergent one, before the publication and circulation of the laws of that session as a body; and whether it was thus published or not, manifestly could not prevent its taking effect upon the publication and circulation of the body of laws passed at that session. (Mark v. State, 15 Ind. 98.) Inasmuch, therefore, as this corporation was not attempted to be organized until July 23, 1868,\u2014more than fifteen years after the enactment of the statute,\u2014the question whether it took effect immediately, on account of publication in those journals, or only after the publication and circulation of the body of laws passed at that session, does not, in the remotest degree, affect the parties to this suit. Section 10, chapter 51, of the Revised Statutes of 1874, entitled \u201cEvidence and Depositions, \u201d expressly provides that \u201cthe printed statute books of the United States, and of this State, and of the several States, * * * purporting to be printed under the authority of said United States, any State or territory, shall be evidence in all courts and places in this State, of the acts therein contained.\u201d The objection is utterly destitute of merit.</p> <p id=\"b630-5\" pgmap=\"630\">Third\u2014Objection is urged that the court erred in admitting in evidence an act of the Indiana legislature assuming to validate and legalize the appellee- as a corporation, approved February 19, 1881. We deem this question immaterial. The evidence was sufficient of the organization of at least a defacto corporation, under the act of 1855. The question whether it was also one dejare, we have shown, under point first, is immaterial. But we are also of opinion that the objections urged against the admission of the act in evidence are, in any view, not well taken. Those objections are, first, that it does not appear upon the face of the act that it was signed by the Governor; and second, that inasmuch as the act is special, it is in contravention of a provision of the constitution of the State of Indiana, which provides that \u201ccorporations, other than banking, shall not be created by special act, but may be formed under general laws.\u201d The act is authenticated by the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana, by having the seal of State affixed thereto, in conformity with section 905 of the United States Revised Statutes, (2d ed.) 1878, title 13, chapter 17, and this is held to be a sufficient authentication, without the attestation of any officer, or any other proof. 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 489; United States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392; Henthorn v. Doe ex dem. 1 Blackf. 157; United States v. Johns, 4 Dall. 412.</p> <p id=\"b630-6\" pgmap=\"630(71) 631(128)\">Conceding that, under the constitutional provision referred to, it is incompetent for the legislature to render the corporation absolutely legal and valid in all respects, about which we express no opinion, still the authority to inquire, by quo warranto, whether, there being a corporation de facto, it is, in all respects, a legal and valid corporation, belongs to the State of Indiana alone. If that State does not choose to institute such a proceeding, and oust it of its assumed franchise, no one else can do so. This act may be regarded, therefore, as evidence that that State has treated the appellee as a corporation cle facto, for that much is recited in the preamble to the act, and that it has acquiesced in its acting as such. Although, in other words, this act might be no defence to a proceeding by the State of Indiana by quo warranto, or in that nature, against appellee, it is evidence of the recognition by that State that appellee assumes to exist and act as a corporation within that State, and so is competent evidence under the issue. Central Agricultural Association v. Alabama Company, 70 Ala. 120.</p> <p id=\"b631-5\" pgmap=\"631\">Fourth\u2014There was evidence tending to prove, even apart from this legislative recognition and the signature to the contract, that appellee, in good faith, attempted to organize under the general law of 1855, and afterw'ards proceeded to act as a corporation. The weight and effect of this evidence are not within our province' to discuss.</p> <p id=\"b631-6\" pgmap=\"631\">Fifth\u2014It is very earnestly contended by counsel for appellant that the court erred in refusing to allow the decision of the Supreme Court of Indiana, in Nelson v. Blakely, 54 Ind. 30, to be read in evidence to the jury. But it has been seen, under point first, that the decision in that case is not pertinent to any question in this case. It could have only tended to confuse the minds of the jury, and lead them from the real questions to be decided. It was very properly excluded.</p> <p id=\"b631-7\" pgmap=\"631\">Sixth\u2014The court below, in giving and refusing instructions, conformed substantially to the views we have here expressed, and there was no error in that regard. There was no evidence tending to prove fraudulent misrepresentations on the part of appellee\u2019s agent, or a failure of consideration in any other way, and we have been unable to discover any error in excluding or admitting evidence in any respect.</p> <p id=\"b632-3\" pgmap=\"632\">All the questions discussed upon this record have now been twice carefully considered by the court, and we remain of the opinion, heretofore expressed, that there is no error in the record for which the judgment below should be reversed. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b632-4\" pgmap=\"632\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
