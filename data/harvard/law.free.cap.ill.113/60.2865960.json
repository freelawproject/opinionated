Contested election\u2014requisites of petition\u2014as to qualifications of petitioner\u2014for a town office. A petition for the contest of an election by one to the office of town clerk, or other town office, should aver that the petitioner was an elector of the town, or it will be fatally defective on demurrer. An averment that the contestant was a citizen and resident of the town is not sufficient.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b60-14\" pgmap=\"60\">2. Citizenship\u2014defined\u2014whether it includes the right to vote. A citizen, in the popular and appropriate sense of the term, is one who by birth, naturalization, or Otherwise, is a member of an independent political society, called a State, kingdom or empire, and who, as such, is subject to its laws and entitled to its protection in all his rights incident to that relation. The term includes females and minors.

Petitioner prays that he may be declared and adjudged to be lawfully elected clerk of said town, and duly installed in said office, and said Blanck ousted therefrom. \u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\" pgmap=\"62\">The court below overruled a demurrer to the petition, and the defendant refusing to answer further, final judgment of ouster was thereupon entered in favor of the petitioner, and against the defendant, to reverse which this appeal is brought.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-6\" pgmap=\"62\">Messrs.

Admitting all this, it does not give him a standing in court as a contestant of this election. An elector is one who has the right to make choice of public officers\u2014one who has a right to vote. 10 Minn. 107.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-10\" pgmap=\"62\">It has been decided in 21 Wall. 162, and 43 Cal. 43, that \u201cthe right to vote and the right to hold office are not necessary constituents of citizenship.\u201d So one being a citizen and resident does not necessarily imply that he is an elector, and as it is a rule of law that pleadings must always be construed strongest against the pleader, the court must presume that the petitioner is not of age, and is not an elector of the town of Lebanon, and therefore the petition is insufficient.</p><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-3\" pgmap=\"63\">Messrs. Wilderman &amp; Hamill, for the appellee:</attorneys><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-4\" pgmap=\"63\">Section 113 of the Election law declares that a person desiring to contest an election shall, within thirty days, etc., file with the clerk of the court a statement in writing, setting forth the points on which the contest will be made, etc. The statute does not specify what this statement shall contain, except the points of contest.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\" pgmap=\"63\">The petition shows that petitioner is a citizen and resident of the town, and this is equivalent to stating he is an elector. \u201cCitizen,\u201d as used in the constitution, means an elector. (Const. 1870, art. 4, sec. 3; art. 5, sec. 5; art. 6, secs. 3,17.) \u201cCitizen,\u201d according to Webster, is \u201ca person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of voting for public officers, and who is qualified to fill offices in the gift of the people.\u201d Stating that petitioner was a citizen of the town of Lebanon, in the county of St. Clair, and State of Illinois, was equivalent to stating that he had resided -in the State one year, in the county ninety days, and in the election district thirty days next preceding the election, and that he was a qualified elector of this State, or a male citizen of the United States above the age of twenty-one years. The term \u201ccitizen\u201d means all of that, and more. If petitioner did not have all of those qualifications, he was not a citizen in the sense in which the word is used in the petition. , Spraggins v. Houghton, 2 Scam. 377; Rev. Stat. sec. 66, chap.46; Dale v. Irwin, 78 Ill. 181; Frey\u2019s Election Cases, 71 Pa. St. 302; Union Hotel Co. v. Hersee, 79 N. T. '454.</p> <opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b63-6\" pgmap=\"63\">Mr. Justice Mulkey</author> <p id=\"Ax5\" pgmap=\"63\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b63-7\" pgmap=\"63(57) 64(165)\">By the 112th section of chapter 46, of the Revised Statutes of 1874, the right to contest an election of this kind is confined exclusively to electors of the town. In order to show title in himself, the petitioner should therefore have averred in the petition that he was an elector of the town of Lebanon. Whether he has done this or not, presents the only question of importance for determination. That the petition contains no express averment to that effect is manifest. But it is contended on behalf of the petitioner that the averment in the petition that the contestant was \u201ca citizen and resident of the town of Lebanon,\u201d is, in legal effect, the same as the more specific charge that he was an \u201celector.\u201d We can not concur in this view. It may be admitted the word \u201ccitizen\u201d is sometimes used to denote a person having the right to vote and hold office, but that is certainly not its ordinary or popular meaning. In the latter sense of the term it is applicable alike to males and females, and to minors as well as adults. Such being the case, it is clear the right of suffrage is not coextensive with the right of citizenship, and this is expressly held in Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162.</p> <p id=\"b64-5\" pgmap=\"64\">A \u201ccitizen,\u201d in the popular and appropriate sense of the term, is one who by birth, naturalization, or otherwise, is a member of an independent political society, called a State, kingdom or empire, and as such is subject to its laws and entitled to its protection in all his rights incident to that relation. And as the right to vote, as we have just seen, is not necessarily incident to or coextensive with the right of citizenship, it follows the petitioner failed to show any right in himself to contest the respondent\u2019s election, and for that reason the petition was fatally defective, and the demurrer to it should have been sustained. To hold otherwise would be to simply abrogate the familiar rule of pleading that requires all pleadings to be construed most strongly against the pleader. This we are not prepared to do.</p> <p id=\"b64-6\" pgmap=\"64\">The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings, with directions to set aside the order overruling the demurrer and to sustain the demurrer to the petition, and that leave be given to amend the petition if the petitioner shall be so advised.</p> <p id=\"b64-7\" pgmap=\"64\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
