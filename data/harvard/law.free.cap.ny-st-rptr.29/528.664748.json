The statute expressly provides that <em>the same fund must he claimed, </em>not that <em>it is claimed </em>that the funds are the same. A mere general and bare statement that the funds in dispute in the action are the identical funds claimed by the parties sought to be substituted as defendants, in the absence of any specification whatever showing the actual identity of the funds in question, could not have been contemplated by the statute as sufficient ground whereon to relieve a savings bank as therein provided for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-14\">Eespondent claims that the claim is to the deposit, the same fund, the bank has no power to go behind the demand and institute a private court of inquiry as to the merits of the <em>claim; </em>it must pay at its peril; that savings banks having no interest in the funds received on deposit, acting simply as trustee without compensation, are highly favored by the law, and it was clearly the intention of the law makers to free savings banks from all embarrassment and expense concerning adverse claims to funds on deposit, since such expense must be borne by the other depositors.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-15\">The court in granting the motion delivered the following opinion:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-16\">Sedgwick, J.\u2014The application should be grantr . under \u00a7 259, chap. 409, Laws of 1882.
