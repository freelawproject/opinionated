Intestate was stealing a ride on a car of said railroad, and at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>point jumped or was thrown off and run over by the car and killed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-2\">Plaintiff\u2019s testimony tended to show that a timber projecting sideways from defendant\u2019s apparatus took off the step on which intestate was standing; while defendant\u2019s testimony tended to prove that a larger boy jumped off and tilted a plank which was laying alongside and which took off the step; that deceased jumped off immediately after the other boy, and was pushed under the car by him.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-3\">In the charge the court remarked: \u201c The first witness called by the plaintiff said that the plank was. running at right angles to the railroad track. * * * I think it may be taken for granted that there was no such plank lying in that position at all, for all the other witnesses stated that the planks were what were called sheathing planks, that is, stood perpendicularly in the cut, except two planks which were lying parallel to the railroad track; that is, north and south across the cut I think it may be taken for granted, because the plaintiff and other witnesses so testified, and so did the witnesses for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">Exception being taken to this portion of the charge, the judge said: \u201cYou may believe Mr. Cunningham and also disbelieve every other witness in this case if you wish to.\u201d * * <em>* </em>\u201c As I remember the testimony, almost every witness, if not every witness, except Mr. Cunningham, testified that it was the plank that ran parallel with the car that did the injury.\u201d * * * \u201c I do not say this is the fact. You may believe Mr. Cunningham and disbelieve every other witness that has been called, or you may do the other thing, you may believe the other witnesses and disbelieve Mr. Cunningham\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-8\">Appellant contends that this was error, as the court substantially charged that the jury were at liberty to disregard the testimony of Cunningham, who was an eye witness, not interested and was not impeached or discredited ; that his credibility was for the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-9\">Respondent claims that the judge could state the impressions made on his mind by the testimony; leaving it, to the jury to come to their own conclusions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-10\"><em>George C. </em>Coffin, for app\u2019lt; <em>Thomas S.
