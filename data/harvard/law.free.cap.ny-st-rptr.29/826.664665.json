By that act the moneys produced either by the payment of the assessments or by the sale for an unpaid assessment do not pass into the general treasury of the city, but are held as a separate and distinct fund to be applied only to satisfaction of the improvement certificates; by \u00a7 9 of the act it is provided that those certificates shall \u201c At all times \u201d be receivable at par and interest in payment of the assessments!</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b864-16\">The language of the statute is very broad \u201c Shall be receivable at all times \u201d in payment of the assessments. I do not think the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>'certificate on the sale is a substantially different thing from the assessment. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b865-3\">The owner has the right to redeem within a given time, and until the expiration of the time for redemption is not divested of his property, the redemption is substantially a payment of the assessment with the expenses of the sale and interest. I think therefore a payment in improvement certificates good, and no harm or loss can occur to the city if enough is paid in cash to defray the expenses of the sale and the interest payable to the purchaser. This the petitioner is willing to do. To the extent of the amount due on the assessment for principal and interest accrued at the time of sale, the redemption in my opinion can be made in the certificates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b865-4\">Motion granted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b865-5\">Dykman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arr\">The order appealed from should be affirmed on the opinion of the court below, with ten dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Pratt, J., concurs; Barnard, P.
