The declaration was oil a bill of exchange, dated ihe 22d of <em>September, </em>1810, for 124 dollars and 16 cents, drawn by <em>Henry Wiswell, </em>directed to the defendant below, by the name of <em>Henry Croswell, </em>payable to <em>Byrnes, </em>or order, on demand; which was <em>accepted </em>by <em>Croswell, </em>payable ninety days from the date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-20\">The defendant below pleaded, 1. <em>Non </em>assumpsit; 2. <em>Byrnes, </em>in <em>February </em>term, 1811, sued the defendant in the may- or\u2019s court of <em>Albany, </em>on the same bill, &amp;c. and recovered judgment for 145 dollars and 25 cents, <em>prout patet per </em>recordum, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-25\">The plaintiff replied <em>nul tiel record. </em>There was a trial by record, and <em>Croswell </em>did not appear, nor produce the record, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>which judgment was given for the plaintiff, <em>Byrnes, </em>on the second plea. On the first issue there was a trial by jury, and a verdict found for the plaintiff on which judgment was given by the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\">The <em>bill of exceptions </em>stated the pleadings and issues, and that the defendant, on the trial of the second issue, produced the record in support of the second plea, which record was set forth. It stated the declaration, in which the bill is described as drawn on <em>Harry Croswell; </em>that a judgment was entered by default, for want of a plea, for 145 dollars and 25 cents, damages and costs, and the judgment signed, and filed the 9th of <em>March, </em>1811. It appeared further, that on the trial of the issue by record, after <em>Croswell </em>had produced the record above mentioned, the plaintiff in order to disprove it, produced the book of the minutes of the entries in the. court below, in which was entered a rule, in <em>August </em>term, 1811, by which the default, and all subsequent proceedings, Were ordered to be set aside, for irregularity, with costs, and that <em>Croswell </em>be discharged from custody on the <em>ca. sa. </em>issued on that judgment. The court below decided, that the entry of the rule destroyed the record of the judgment; and that there was, therefore, a failure of record. It also appeared that, on the trial of the first issue, the plaintiff produced the bill of exchange,1 which was directed to Mr. <em>Henry Croswell; </em>on which was written, \u00ab accepted, payable in 90 days. <em>September </em>22, 1810. <em>H. </em>Cros\u00bb <em>7vell.\u201d </em>The defendant objected, that this was not the same bill as that described in the declaration, as drawn on <em>Harry Croswell; </em>.and that there was no such custom of merchants, as to a bill so accepted ; that the parties were not merchants, and that the acceptance was not suEcient to charge the defendant, and moved for a \u00a1nonsuit. The court below intimatingan opinion that <em>the alleged </em>variance was fatal, the plaintiff produced the original declaration, filed on the 11th of <em>February, </em>1811, in which the bill is stated to be drawn on <em>Henry Croswell. </em>The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted that the copy of the declaration served ought to govern, and not the original; but the court decided that the original declaration on file must govern, which was to be read <em>Henry, </em>and not <em>Harry, </em>and denied the motion for a nonsuit, on which a verdict was found for the plaintiff, under the direction of the court. To this opinion of the court a <em>bill of exceptmis </em>was tendered, which was signed and sealed by the recorder.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The errors assigned were, 1.

There is no doubt of a competent power in the court to make such rule; but the question is, whether the entry of such a rule upon the minutes, is to be received as evidence against the record ? It appears to be contrary to all the well-settled\u2019 technical rules upon the subject, to give the entry that effect. A record imports verity, and can only be tried by itself. The <em>vacatur </em>ought to be enrolled, or entered of record, as much as the rule for judgment. The 90urt could not receive the entry on the minutes of a rule for judgment, as evidence to support a plea of a former recovery, and why should an entry vacating a judgment be received to contradict the enrolment of the judgment ? The maxim in this, as well as in other cases, is, that <em>nihil tarn naturale quam quidlibet dissolvi eo modo quo </em>ligatur. <em>(Jenk. Cent. </em>120.) To give an entry on the minutes that authority, would destroy the certainty, order and solemnity of enrolments; and it has been frequently held, that the courts cannot regard any proceeding as a matter of record until it is enrolled. (1 <em>Salk. </em>329 , 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>243. <em>Jenk. Cent. </em>25.).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">As the judgment for the damages is entire, and the plea of a former recovery went to the entire right of action, it becomes unnecessary to examine the other errors assigned, in respect to the trial of the issue joined on the plea of <em>non assumpsit. </em>The judgment rendered must he reversed <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
