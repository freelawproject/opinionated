And where a person, after a perot agree~ ment for the purchase of hod, entered. and cut timber, and the agreement was after-wards rescinded by him; it was held that he was liable as a trespasser.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-7\">THIS was an action of trespass quare clausu~m fregit, and for cutting and carrying away trees, &amp;c. Plea, not guilty, with notice that the defendant would give in evidence, at the trial, a license to cut and carry away the timber and treeS, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-10\">The cause was tried, at the Orange circuit, on the 12th of September, 1811. The plaintiff having proved the entering, and cutting, and carrying away the trees, &amp;c. the defendant offered to give in evidence, in bar of the plaintiff's action, that at the time of the trespass complained of, lie was in possession of the locus in quo, by virtue of aparol agreement, for the purchase of the lot, on which the trespass was alleged to be committed. That this agree~ ment was made in the autunrn of 1809, immediately after which the defendant entered, as owner, and the plaintiff showed the lines and bounds of the lot. A deed was to be executed in the following spring. In March, 1810, when the lot was surveyed, the defendant, finding that it did not include all the land he supposed, abandoned the lot, a~d informed the plaintiff that he would not take it, on account of the misrepresentation as to the bounds. The plaintift accordingly, sold it to another person in Max,, 1811. The alleged trespass was committed while the defendant was so in possession of the lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-11\">This evidence was objected to, as not constituting a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action, and was overruled by the judge, and the jury, under his direction, found a verdict for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-12\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-13\"><em>Fisk, </em>for the defendant, contended, that the evidence offered at the trial ought to have been received.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa-\">Though the <em>parol </em>agreement was void as to the purchase, under the statute of frauds, yet it was good evidence of a <em>license </em>to enter. A <em>license </em>need not be in writing. A license to, enter is a good plea in bar to an action of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>trespass quare clausum fregit.

Rep. </em>1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIBb\">J. <em>Duer, </em>contra, insisted, that a <em>parol </em>agreement for a purchase did not imply a <em>license </em>to enter on the land. Suppose even an agreement for a purchase in writing, yet if it does not contain an express permission to enter, it will not give such <em>license, </em>by implication. Again, if the plaintiff had expressly consented to let the defendant enter, on condition that he would become a purchaser, yet if the defendant, afterwards, refused to purchase, he would, by breach of the condition, become a trespasser <em>ah initio.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b48-10\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ap4_C\">The defence set up as a bar to the action was properly overruled. The agreement to purchase and convey did not, of itself, amount to a license to enter. It was a mere executory agreement. And even if a license to enter had been shown, it would not have been sufficient, without showing a further license to cut and consume the timber. The one license does by no means imply the other. The defendant could not have pretended to have been in possession, in any higher character than a tenant at will, as the agreement for the purchase of the premises was by parol, and if a tenant at will cuts timber, it is trespass. The matter offered as a defence was altogether insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Motion deniedi</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
