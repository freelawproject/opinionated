The other two defendants suffered judgment by default to be entered against them. The cause was tried at the <em>Washington </em>circuit, before Mr. Justice <em>Yates, </em>in June, 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Apa\">A wit i ess for the plaintiff testified, that he was with the plaintiff, pitimin\u00ed ic\u00edsuaacU) mat, jjg wao wjuii me jjiaimijLi^ and hearing a waggon coming rapidly on the road, advised the plaintiff to turn out of the road, which he immediately did, quite ouf: \u00b0fthe road to the right, when the tongue of the waggon of the defendants struck the breast of the plaintiff\u2019s horse with great force, and when the plaintiff said he hoped nothing was hurt, one of the defendants abused him for not keeping out of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AY3\">Another witness saw the defendants at a tavern, about half a mile from the place where the plaintiff\u2019s horse was injured, and they were in high spirits, and talking of what had happened. <em>Ely </em>said to one of the defendants, he must take care how he run against people. The horse died of the wound he received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AV8\">The waggon belonged to <em>Ely, </em>and the horses to the other defendants, one of whom <em>(A.) </em>was driving the waggon when the plaintiff\u2019s horse was hurt. <em>Ely </em>was asked by the other defendants to go with them in the waggon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Avj\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiflj against <em>Ely, </em>as equally guilty with the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-17\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATQ\"><em>Crary, </em>for the defendants, contended, that <em>Ely </em>had done no act that could make him a trespasser.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akkc\">He was a mere passenger in the waggon, and had no control over the horses. To make a person liable, in such case, it must be shown that he was driving the waggon or carriage. Would a passenger in the public stage coach be liable as a trespasser, if the driver should run against another carriage ?<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It does not appear that <em>Ely </em>was in any way consent\u201d <em>mg </em>to the trespass, or that he could have prevented it,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Z. R. Shepherd, contra, insisted that Fly was not a mere passenger.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7RC\">He was the owner of the v~aggon, and being in it at the time, he must be coi~sidered as a party to the trespass. He was one of the company in the waggon, and present at the time the trespass was committed; and if liable at all, it must be in an action of trespass.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-4\">In the case of M'Manus v. Cricket, (1 East, 106.) the master was not preseni, and it was, therefore, held, that he could not be liable as a trespasser.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-18\"> 5 <em>Esp.

They were all together in the waggon, ard each had his due shore of interest in the horses and waggon. <em>Ely </em>owned the waggon, and was not in the light of a mere passenger. The case of <em>Davey </em>v. <em>Chamberlain </em>(4 Esp. <em>N. P. </em>229.) applies. It does not appear that <em>Ely </em>dissented, at the time, from the violent manner of driving the team, nor at the time of the accident; and when seen, shortly after, at the tavern, he acted as one of the party, jointly concerned in the act, for they were all in high spirits, and he expressed no dissent, or even regret.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
