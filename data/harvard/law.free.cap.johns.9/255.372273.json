On the 9th or <em>December, </em>a plea <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>verified by affidavit, setting forth the discharge of the defendant under the insolvent act,Mated the 24th of <em>September, </em>1811, was sent by the defendant, and served on the . , . <em>n-r </em>mi . . . plaintiffs attorney the 1st of January, 1812. 1 he plaintiffs, without taking notice of the last plea, noticed the cause for trial, by record, in <em>January </em>term last. The notice for trial was for the first <em>Monday </em>of <em>January, </em>and was received on the 28th of <em>December, </em>by the agent of the defendant\u2019s attorney, who lived 150 miles from <em>Albany. </em>Notice of taxing costs was received in <em>July </em>last, which was the first notice the defendant\u2019s attorney had of the plaintiffs\u2019 having pro ceeded under the issue.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-28\"><em>Russell, </em>contra, contended, that a term having intervened between the time of the discharge and the delivery of the plea <em>puis </em>^ v jl jt <em>darrein continuance, </em>it was a nullity, and might be treated as such, lle cited 3 <em>Eh Com. </em>37. 7 <em>Johns.

The first notice he afterwards had of the plaintiffs\u2019 having proceeded, in <em>January </em>term, to trial, upon the issue of <em>mil fiel record, </em>was in <em>July </em>last. Under these circumstances, the defendant is still entitled to be heard upon the merits of his motion.,</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The plaintiffs were not warranted in treating the plea as a nullity. Though the discharge bore date in <em>September, </em>it might not have been actually executed: or, if executed, it might not have been delivered to the party, until after <em>October </em>term. The plea was duly verified by affidavit, and the defendant was entitled to have the goodness of the plea, both as to form and substance, referred to the judgment of the court. If the plaintiffs did not choose to demur, or take issue on the plea, the least they could have done would have been to have applied to the court, on notice, to set it aside, as was done in the cases of <em>Paris </em>v. <em>Salkeld, </em>(2 <em>Wils. </em>137.) and of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Wyvill. </em>(1 <em>Str. </em>493.) In the latter case the motion was grounded on the very allegation that the plea was not pleaded since the last continuance, but after the lapse of two continuances... The decision of the court turned upon another point, but this case shows the practice; and if that course had been pursued, the defendant might very possibly have shown that the matter had arisen since the last continuance. But if not, and if in fact another continuance had intervened between a certificate of bankruptcy and the plea of it, as a plea <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>the courts in <em>England, </em>and here, have permitted the defendant to plead it <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>on payment of costs. (1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. 637. </em>2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>294.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The defendant is, accordingly, entitled to his motion, except as to the costs of the application, which, under the particular circumstances of the case, are denied to either party as against the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Rule granted. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> See Bancker v. <em>Ash, ante, </em>p. 250.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
