The claim as to the <em>horses </em>was, however, atterwards, aband\u00f3ned. The cause was tried at the <em>New-York </em>sittings, in <em>November, </em>1811, before Mr. Justice <em>Van Ness.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-9\">The plaintiff, in <em>May, </em>1809, purchased of one <em>Gordon, </em>as agent of the estate of <em>Patrick Shay, </em>deceased, divers horses, carriages, See. and a lease of certain stables in <em>Courtlandt-street, </em>forming what was called the livery-stable establishment, for which a bill \u00b0 ... - of sale was given by the executors of <em>Shay. </em>The plaintiff paid 400 dollars in cash, and gave three promissory notes for 400 dol)nrs paoil lars eacn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-14\">It was proved, that the plaintiff bought the <em>coachee, </em>or carriage, in question, of <em>Burtis 8c Woodward, </em>coachmakers, m <em>June, </em>1809, for 90 dollars, which was afterwards put into the possession of Ja<em>cob Crissy, </em>and was considered as part of the livery-stable establishment. The coachee and horses, which were established as stage to run from <em>Pawles Hook </em>to <em>Brighton, </em>were attached <em>Newark, </em>in <em>New-Jersey, m August, </em>1809, at the suit of <em>Ward, </em>fora debt due to him from <em>Crissy, </em>and sold. The plaintiff put in a claim of property, which was tried before a sheriff\u2019s jury, in <em>New-Jersey, </em>who found the property to be in <em>Crissy.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-19\">. <em>j__4. Z4._______j </em>From the evidence on the part of the defendant, it appeared that <em>Crissy </em>had been in possession of the livery-stable establishment from the time it ivas first purchased by <em>Craig, </em>who had said that <em>Crissy </em>was to pay the notes given for the purchase, the rent and wages of the persons employed, &amp;c.; that a <em>sign </em>was put up on which was written \u201c <em>Crissy\u2019s Livery </em>Stable;\" and a notice was published in the <em>gazette, </em>by which <em>Crissy </em>informed the pub-lie, that <em>he </em>had established a regular stage between <em>New-York </em>and <em>Brighton, </em>&amp;c. and a similar advertisement was posted up in <em>New-Jersey ; </em>and <em>Craig </em>admitted that he had drawn the advertisements. When the carriage and horses were seized under the attachment,, the driver, at first, said they belonged to <em>Crissy, </em>but, afterwards, said they were the property of the plaintiff. The coachman was employed and paid by <em>Crissy, </em>and he testified that <em>Crissy </em>had the whole management of the establishment, which was conducted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>in the name of <em>Crissy, </em>who paid the expenses; and that when the plaintiff wanted a \u25a0 horse, or carriage, he applied to <em>Crissy </em>for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0D\">The plaintiff gave in evidence an agreement made between him and <em>Crissy, </em>dated the 1st of <em>May, </em>1809, which recited that <em>Craig </em>had that day purchased the livery-stable establishment of the executors of <em>Shay, </em>with the carriages, horses, &amp;c. and taken a lease of the ground and stable, &amp;c. \u201c with the intent, and for the purpose, of carrying on the business, &amp;c. through the agency, of <em>Jacob Crissy, </em>and had intrusted the same to the care and. management of the said <em>Jacob </em>Crissy.\u201d <em>Crissy </em>then covenanted with <em>Craig to </em>take the care and management of the said carriages, horses, gigs, <em>See. </em>and to enter into the occupation of the said stables, &amp;c. and to carry on the said business in all its branches, to the best advantage, &amp;c. for and on account of <em>Craig, </em>for and during the term of three years from the date of the agreement and to account to <em>Craig, </em>monthly, during the term, for all moneys received, &amp;c.; add <em>Craig </em>covenanted, that he would, monthly, and as often as he should receive from <em>Crissy </em>any sum or sums of money arising from the business, after deducting all expenses, rent and charges, incident to the establishment, pay to <em>Crissy one third </em>of the <em>net proceeds, </em>or <em>profits, </em>received, &amp;c.; which one third of the net proceeds, or profits, was to go as a full compensation, or consideration, for <em>Crissy's </em>services, care and management of the stables, &amp;c. during the said term of three years; and <em>Crissy </em>covenanted to keep regular books of accounts, which <em>Craig </em>was to have leave, at all times, to inspect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIr\">The counsel for the defendant moved for a nonsuit, on the ground, that in whomsoever the <em>property </em>in the carriage in question was, the <em>possession </em>of it, for the term mentioned in the agreement, was in <em>Crissy, </em>and that the plaintiff could not maintain the <em>trespass. </em>The judge was of that opinion, as it respected the horses; but as the carriage was purchased subsequent to the agreement, he thought that if <em>Crissy, </em>under all the circumstances of the case, was not to be deemed the <em>owner, </em>and the property, therefore, liable to pay his debt, he might be considered as the agent of <em>Craig, </em>who would, in judgment of law, be deemed to have the possession. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel contended that, even if the acts of <em>Craig, </em>and the <em>ostensible ownership </em>of <em>Crissy, </em>might have subjected the property to the creditors of Crissy, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>debts accrued subsequent to his possession; yet the rule could not apply as to debts existing prior to such possession; as the creditors could not then be deemed to have trusted <em>Crissy </em>on the faith of the property. The judge expressed his doubts as to the correctness of this distinction; and charged the jury that if they believed that <em>Crissy </em>had such an ostensible ownership as would render the property liable to debts of creditors subsequently accrued, it would be liable to all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-4\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for 102 dollars and 66 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\"><em>Slosson, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYM\">To maintain trespass for goods, the plaintiff must have the actual or constructive possession, at the time of the alleged trespass. If he has not the actual possession, he must have a right to reduce them to his possession when he pleases.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> By the agreement, <em>Crissy </em>was to have the possession for three years, so that the plaintiff could not claim it before the expiration of that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">The carriage, it is true, was purchased after the agreement, but it was turned into the establishment, of which <em>Crissy </em>was to have the sole management. It was as -much in his possession as any other article belonging to the establishment. Though the carriage did not pass by the agreement, yet that agreement shows the intention of the parties as to the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">Again, the advertisement of <em>Crissy, </em>written by the plaintiff shows it to be his property. The acts and declarations of the plaintiff recognise it as the property of <em>Crissy, </em>and he cannot, now, be permitted to gainsay those acts, and declarations, after <em>Crissy </em>may have obtained credit on the faith of the ownership.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-9\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A56Z\">At the time of the purchase by <em>Craig? </em>and the agreement with <em>Crissy, </em>the carriage was not in the possession of either party, for it was not then purchased. This case is different from that of <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>or <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Macauley. </em>It is, in fact, an attempt to extend the law of partnership to a most dangerous length. For there are very many useful public works and manufactories, on a similar establishment, carried on by confidential agents, who are to have a <em>per centage, </em>or portion, of the <em>net profits, </em>as a compensation for their services. The agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>between <em>Craig </em>and <em>Crissy </em>contains no words of demise, It de\u00ab c]ares that the plaintiff had purchased the property, and had <em>in* trusted Crissy </em>with the care and management of it. All the covenants are on the part of <em>Crissy. </em>The plaintiff merely promises to pay him his wages. <em>Crissy </em>was a mere servant, or agent, who was to receive a portion of the net profits, as a compensation for his services. <em>Crissy </em>had no <em>jus disponendi </em>in regard to the property. If <em>Craig </em>had been dissatisfied with the conduct of <em>Crissy, </em>and had turned him out of possession, the latter could not have maintained any possessory action against the former.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-6\">As to the point of <em>visible ownership; </em>the cases have gone no further than to say, that where a person, trusting to the visible ownership, has given a credit, he may set off the debt against the claim by the real owner, or principal ;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but none of them go so and antecedent debt to be set off by the person claiming to be the real owner. The doctrine of partnership is not applicable to the present case: and if <em>Crissy </em>could have no \u00bfght of action against <em>Craig, </em>if dispossessed by him, the creditors of <em>Crissy </em>could have no right to take the property in execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-13\"><em>D. B. Ogden, </em>in reply, observed, that the advertisements, drawn up by the plaintiff, as well as his declarations, showed, conclusively, that the livery-stable establishment belonged to <em>Crissy, </em>and that this carriage was delivered to him to form a part of that establishment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHp\"><em>Possession </em>is the only <em>indicium </em>of property in personal chattels ; and <em>Crissy </em>having advertised the property ip his own name, with the assent of the plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot now claim to be the owner. The distinction between debts contracted before or after the visible ownership, is not to be found in the books. case of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Dey</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>supports the principle for which we contend. After the plaintiff by his conduct, has led the defendant to believe that <em>Crissy </em>was the real owner, he cannot pull off the mask, and claim the property as his own.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-16\">Again, <em>Crissy </em>was to have <em>one third </em>of the <em>profits. </em>Now a participation in the profits renders the person a partner, and if he was a partner, he had an interest which could be taken in execution. . ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-17\">Again, if <em>Crissy </em>had an interest in the property, it was liable to ' be attached in <em>New-Jersey, </em>and the right of property being <em>there </em>decided, the present action cannot be brought for the same pro\u00bb perty in this state.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Agh\"> <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Wiley, 8 Johns.

The carriage was not embraced by the agreement, and m~ht have been recalled by the plaintiff at any time~ As to this article, Crissy was the mere agent or servaiit of the plaintiff Th~~ property in the coachee did not, therefore, pass as between them and imless the possession was fraudnlent, and intended for colourable purposes, the ceachee was not liable to the creditors of Crissy~ The bankrupt law of 21 <em>Jac. </em>I. c. 19. s. 11. considers chattels so possessed by the bankrupt, and used by him as reputed owner, with the consent of the true owner, as liable to pay the debts of the bankrupt. But independent of any statute provision, the mere possession of a chattel will not, of itself, render the chattel liable to the debts or disposition of the possessor. There must be a fraudulent or deceptive purpose in view, or implied, under the special circumstances of the case. The jury by their verdict in this case, have negatived the suggestion of fraud; and the motion for a new trial ought to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Motion denied:</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
