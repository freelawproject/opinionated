It was proved tha<em>t </em>the defendant was m possession of the whole 10 acres, and that the defendant\u2019s mill-dam extended 24 links on the land of the lessors of the plaintiff. In 1811, <em>Pelton, </em>one of the lessors, requested the defendant to let him enter on the premises, and build a dam on the creek, according to the reservation in <em>MiDowel,s </em>deed to <em>Smithy </em>which was refused by the defendant. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff! subject to the opinion of the court. And the question was, whether, under the judgment, possession could be token' of the premises reserved in the deed from <em>M\u2018Dowel </em>to <em>Smith, </em>or only of the premises in the possession of the defendant, and not included in the 10 acres.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-28\"><em>Foot, </em>for the plaintiff, contended, that the privilege reserved was like a right of way, for which an ejectment will lie.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7a1\">He cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>Sunn.

This is admitted by the case; but the great point is, whether the right reserved in the deed of <em>erecting or building a dam on the bank of the creek at the place specified, </em>be such an interest as that an ejectment will lie for it. The exception fur* ther states that the grantor, &amp;c. is to <em>occupy and possess the afore* mid premises without any let, See. </em>It is evident that an interest in the soil was reserved at the given place, not only for erecting the dam, but for occupying and possessing it. There can be no. doubt but that this interest would be considered a <em>tenement, </em>within, the decisions under the <em>English </em>settlement law; for it has been held that a right of pasturage, of a- dairy, of a rabbit warren, and of a fishery, carried ouch an interest in the land as to create a tenement. (1 <em>Term Rep. </em>358. 2 <em>Term Rep. 451. 3 Term Rep. </em>772. 4 <em>Term </em>Rep. 671.) In one of the cases, <em>Ashhurst, J. </em>said that a fishery was a tenement, and recoverable in ejectment; and in another of them, Lord <em>Kenyon </em>held that a <em>praecipe </em>would lie for a free warren, though the party has no further interest in the. land than to enter and use the animals;\u2019 and if a <em>pmcipe </em>will lie, <em>(i fortiori </em>an ejectment, which requires much less certainty, will lie. In <em>Mellington </em>v. <em>Goodlittle, (And. </em>106.) it was decided in. error, that an ejectment would lie for a beast or cattle-gate which was a right of common for a beast; and in that case the court admitted that an ejectment would lie for a common appurtenant. Whenever a right of entry exists, and the interest is tangible, no that possession can be delivered, an ejectment will lie; and such an interest was reserved by the deed ia question.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The lessor of the plaintiff is, accordingly, entitled to recover, as well the premises reserved, as the other land encroached upon by the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
