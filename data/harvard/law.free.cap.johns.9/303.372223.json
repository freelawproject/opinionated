Sc afterwards took a promissory note from the tenant, for the arrears of rent, payable to P. In an action brought on the note by the administrator of P. it was held to be void under the act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">THIS was an action of <em>assumpsit. </em>The declaration was on a promissory note given by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, dated the 27th of <em>December, </em>1803, for 362 dollars and 52 cents, payable on the 1st of <em>January, </em>1805, with interest. The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and <em>the statute of limitations, </em>with notice of a set-off, and that he would give in evidence at the trial, that in and by an act of the legislature entitled. An act to enable aliens to purchase and hold real estate in this state, under certain restrictions therein mentioned,\u2019 passed the 2d <em>April, </em>1798, it was, amongst other things, ordained, that all and every conveyance or conveyances, thereafter to be made or executed, to any alien or aliens, not being the subject or subjects of some sovereign, state or power at the time of such conveyance at war with the <em>United States of America, </em>should be deemed valid to vest the estate thereby granted in such alien or aliens, and that it should be lawful to and for such alien or aliens to have and to hold the same <em>to </em>his, her or their heirs and assigns, for ever, any plea of alienism to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, that it should not be lawful for any such alien to reserve any rent or service whatever, upon any <em>grant, lease, </em>or demise or conveyance whatever, to <em>be </em>made of any such lands or tenements ; and all notes, payments, services or reservations whatever, which should be reserved or made payable, in, by, or in consequence of, such grant, lease, demise or conveyance whatsoever of any such lands or tenements, were, by the said act, declared to be utterly void and of no effect;\u201d and that the defendant would further give in evidence \u00ab that the testate, Sir <em>William Pulteney, </em>in his lifetime, was an alien, and subject of the King of <em>Great Britain ; </em>and, being such alien, did, in <em>March, </em>1801, under and by virtue of the said act, accept receive, from <em>Charles Williamson, </em>a conveyance of a certain farm, or lot of land, being, &amp;c. which farm was leased to the defendant, and an annual rent reserved thereon; and that the promissory note, mentioned in the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, was given by the defendant to the said Sir <em>William Pulleney, </em>for arrears rent, due at the date thereof, and payable in consequence of such demise; and so the defendant will contend that the said note utterly void and of no effect.\u201d The making of the note was mitted, and there was an endorsement of 216 dollars and 78 cents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>paid by one <em>Samuel Colt, </em>dated the 18th of <em>July, </em>1806, signed by <em>John Hyslop, </em>who was the <em>agent </em>of the intestate; and who had gone to <em>Europe </em>a short time before the commencement of the present suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\">The proof of the plaintiff was objected to as insufficient to take the case out of the statute; but the judge ruled that it was <em>prima facie </em>sufficient for that purpose. The defendant then proved that the intestate was an alien ; that the note was given to him on a settlement of accounts between him and the defendant; that the items of the account, admitted to be valid, were for rent for the use and occupation of a lot of land in <em>Ontario </em>county, which had been conveyed to the intestate, on the 31st of <em>March, </em>1801; that the defendant held the land by permission of the intestate ; but it did not appear that any lease had been executed, or any express reservation of rent made. A verdict was taken for the.plaintiff for 298 dollars and 85 cents, subject to the opinion of the court,, on a case containing the facts above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-5\"><em>Henry, </em>for the plaintiff, contended, 1. That the evidence, on the part of the plaintiff, was sufficient to take the case out of the statute. Any slight acknowledgment of a debt had been considered sufficient for that purpose. An endorsement of part payment on the note takes it out of the statute ; and it has been decided, that a receipt for interest endorsed on a bond, within twenty would prevent the operation of the statute.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVMF\">2l The special matter offered in evidence at the trial, could not be received under the notice which accompanied the plea of <em>non assumpsit. </em>A notice should, in substance, be as precise as a special plea. Now this notice does not state to whom the farm was leased, nor at what time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-7\">Again, the statute, (sess. 21. c. 72.) passed the 2d of <em>April, </em>1798, supposes the lands to be conveyed by the alien, on <em>which </em>the rents are reserved; but the notice does not state by whom the farm was leased; and it might be, that <em>Williqmson </em>leased it. The act, no doubt, intends leases given by aliens, reserving rent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AaB\"><em>H. Bleecker, </em>contra, said, that the statute of limitations was a very useful act, and ought to be favoured ; and judges in <em>England, </em>of late years, had regretted that they had been so easy to <em>take </em>cases out of the operation of the statute.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> There is a great difference between <em>length of time </em>which operates as a <em>bar </em>to a claim-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>and that which is used only b~j na~j of evidence. A jury is co~ eluded by length of time which operates as a bar, as where the statute of Iimitation~ is pleaded in bar to a debt.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">In the case of Serle V. Barrington,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Pratt, Ch. J. doubted as to the evidence of the endorsement oil the bond; there was a new trial granted, and it appears<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> that, on the second trial, additioiial evidence was given to induce the jury to believe the bond ~atis~~ fled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">In Fuller v. Hancock,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> in the superior court of Gonnecticut, it was decided that an endorsement on the bond did not take it out `of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-8\">The facts stated in the case clearly show that the note was given for rent reserved to ~ir Wiltiam Pultene~y, on land which had been couveyed to him. Any contract for letting land, reserving rent, whether by deed, or writing, or by parol, was with-~n the statute. It was not necessary to prove a written lease.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAeD\"><em> 2 Str. 826. 2 Ld. Raym. 1370. S. C. 3 Bro. P.

This objection is fatal to the plaintiff's right of action. It is to be understood, from the case, that the lands were demised from year to year, under a reservation of rent, by the agent of the in~ testate, and that this was done as well since, as prior, to the sale to Sir William Pultei~ey, and the payments upon the note were more than sufficient to cancel all the lawful charges included in the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Judgaient for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
