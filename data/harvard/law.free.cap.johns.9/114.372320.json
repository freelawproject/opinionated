P, Grosvenor, </em>attorney for the defendant. The plaintiff served several writs, in which the present defendant was plaintiff and <em>Grosvenor </em>the attorney. The plaintiff kept a book in- which he charged his fees to the attorneys who issued the process; and in the present case he charged, his fees to <em>Grosvenor, </em>to whom he afterwards presented a bill of the fees, and demanded payment. <em>Grosvenor </em>neglecting to pay the bill, the plaintiff brought an action against him, and recovered judgment, which remained unsatisfied. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-11\">The plaintiff had collected money for <em>Grosvenor, </em>and retained it, giving him credit for the amount in the account. <em>Grosvenor </em>had charged, in his bills of costs, all the sheriff\u2019s fees, and received the amount. The plaintiff\u2019s demand for his fees accrued five years ago, and he did not make any demand of the defendant un\u00ab til a short time before the present suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-12\">\u25a0<em>Sudam, </em>for the defendant, contended that the mere lapse of time before the plaintiff applied to the defendant, was sufficient to discharge him.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9\">As to the general question of the liability of the client and attorney, the case of <em>Adams </em>v. Hopkins<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> repels the idea of any credit being given by the sheriff to the client. At <em>common law, </em>two persons cannot be responsible for one and the same service, by an <em>implied </em>contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av9\">As between principal and agent, the question is, to whom the credit is given. The principle by which it is to be decided, is laid down in several late <em>English </em>cases.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> If goods are bought by an agent, the principal is liable to the vendor, if called upon when payment becomes due; otherwise, if the day of payment is suffered to pass by without any demand being made on the principal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-16\"><em>Foot, </em>contra, insisted that as the services rendered were solely for the benefit of the defendant, he was responsible; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>there was a difference between services voluntarily performed, and at the option of a party, and such as he was compelled by law to perform-</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b126-13\">5 <em>Johns.Rep. </em>252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b126-15\"> <em>1 Campb. </em>N.P. 109. 2 Campb.

Admitting, therefore, that the plaintiff was entitled, in the first instance, to look to the client, he has here waived that right, and resorted to the attorney. Under the circumstances of the case, it would be unjust not to conclude the plaintiff by his election. The principle stated in the cases cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel is applicable There must be judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
