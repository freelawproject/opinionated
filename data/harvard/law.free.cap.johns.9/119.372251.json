The order was made on the first day of <em>May, </em>1809, and the appeal entered at the then next general sessions of the peace, held in and for the county of <em>Washington i </em>and at the <em>August </em>sessions, in 1810, the order was quashed; at the then next general sessions of the peace, in <em>December </em>thereafter, the appellant moved for <em>costs </em>against the appellees, which the court granted.

The provision in the act of 30th <em>\"March, </em>1810, c. 109. does not apply to cases of appeal, brought before the passing of the act, and unless the sessions are authorized specially by statute, to award costs, they have no authority to award them. The quarter sessions in <em>England </em>have no authority, to this day, to award costs in cases of this nature. (King v. <em>Sweet, </em>9 <em>East, </em>25.) In this case, then, none were to be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
