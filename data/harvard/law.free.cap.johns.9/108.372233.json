Van Antwerp, </em>and also, that the wheat and rye thereon growing, belonged to him, and that the defendants, as servants to the said <em>Van Antwerp, </em>and by his di- . . <em>* J </em>rection, entered and cut, and took and carried away the said , , <em>\u201e </em>Wheat, &amp;C.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALp\">The cause was tried at the <em>Saratoga </em>circuit, in <em>May, </em>1811, before Mr. Justice <em>Spencer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AA9\">The plaintiff gave in evidence an agreement dated 4th <em>Septemher, </em>1804, between <em>Andrew Stewart </em>and <em>Van Antwerp, </em>by which let a farm, including the premises, to <em>A. Stewart, </em>for six years, from the 1st <em>May, </em>1805, or from the time of his taking the possession. By the 8th article of this agreement, <em>A. Stewart </em>stipulated \u201c to render, yield and pay, to <em>Van Antwerp, </em>the one half of all the wheat, rye, corn and other grain, raised on the said farm, in each year, in the bushel, after deducting the seed,\u201d &amp;c. By the 12th article, it was agreed, between them, that either party might determine the other\u2019s right to the benefit of the agreement, \u00ab on giving six 'months\u2019 previous notice in writing, of such intention to the other partyand if <em>Van Antwerp </em>gave the notice, he was to allow Jt. <em>Stewart </em>for preparing the ground-for the seed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>and for any other extra labour, as should be assessed by indjfferent persons to be chosen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-4\"><em>A.

The wheat and rye, &amp;c. for which this action was brought, had been sown by <em>A. </em>SI on the premises, the autumn before he received the notice to quit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">A <em>fieri facias </em>was issued out of this court, against <em>A. Stewart, </em>at the suit of <em>John Sayles, </em>on a judgment entered up on the 28th <em>December, </em>1808, for 300 dollars. The execution was tested the 28th <em>November, </em>1808, and made returnable the first <em>Monday </em>of <em>February, </em>1809. Before the return day of the execution, the sheriff; by virtue thereof, sold the right and title of <em>A. Stewart </em>to the wheat and rye in <em>Halfmoon, </em>where the premises are situated, to the plaintiff and gave a bill of sale to turn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">The advertisement and sale were made at <em>Ballston, </em>and at the time of the sale, the sheriff said, that he did^know whether he had advertised at <em>Halfmoon; </em>that if he had no power to sell, it diust be at the peril of the purchaser. The sheriff did not go to the field where the wheat and rye were growing, and he made no delivery of them to the purchaser. He went to the house on the farm, and levied on personal property of <em>A, Stewart </em>there. At the time of sale, he mentioned the wheat and rye as growing. They were not designated in the advertisement, which mentioned, . generally, all the personal property of A. Stewart, The sale was in <em>January, </em>1809-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-9\">Fa?! <em>Antwerp </em>and <em>A.

Stewart </em>and <em>Van Antwerp, </em>amounted to a lease or tenancy at will.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As between, them, therefore, <em>A. Stew</em>\u00cdfr\u00ed was entitled to the wheat and rye, as <em>emblements. </em>The law on this subject is clear and well settled.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aof\">The only question is, whether the plaintiff in this case, can maintain trespass <em>quare clausum fregit.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI0\"><em>Van Antwerp </em>was not interested as a <em>tenant in common </em>with <em>Stewart, </em>in <em>the </em>growing crop. The reservation expressed in the 8th article of the agreement is by way of <em>rent.</em><footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al0\"><em>\u00c1. Stewart, </em>the tenant, had the right of <em>ingress, egress </em>and <em>regress, </em>for the purpose of cutting and carrying away the wheat and rye. Having an exclusive right to the growing crop, he had also a right, in that respect, to the soil. <em>Close </em>properly means an interest in the soil. Every person who has a right to the herbage, or <em>prima tonsura, </em>or a right to the <em>profits, </em>in exclusion of others, may maintain this action.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqV\">... If, then, <em>A. Stewart, </em>the tenant, could maintain the action, the plaintiff, who purchased all his right, may maintain it. The title to wheat and corn growing is a chattel, and may be taken and sold on execution.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am8t\">If <em>Van Antwerp </em>was tenant in common of the crop with his tenant, this action would be equally maintainable.<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah9\">The 12th article of the agreement, by which it was stipulated that if <em>Van Antwerp gave </em>the notice to quit, he was to allow <em>A. Stewart, </em>for preparing the ground, <em>See. </em>may, perhaps, be set up in bar of the right to <em>emblements. </em>But the tenant was to furnish the see The object of this special agreement was to compensate the tenant for preparing the ground, sowing the seed, and extra labour, which he could not, otherwise, recover at common law, as emblements; for if the lessor enters before sowing, the lessee at will is not entitled to the cost of ploughing and manuring the land.<footnotemark>\u2021\u2021</footnotemark> This clause, therefore, could not have been intended to bar the tenant\u2019s common law right to emblements; nor can this rJght be barred or taken away, unless by express words. <footnotemark>\u00a7\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ArJ\"><em>Parker </em>and <em>Foot, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWz\">By the agreement, the interest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>A. Stewart </em>was determined, on receiving the notice to quit; and after he left the premises, pursuant to that notice, he could no longer maintain trespass. His only remedy is on the contract. To maintain trespass <em>quart clausum fregit, </em>the plaintiff must show a right of entry. <em>A. Stewart </em>had no such right, as against <em>Von </em>Antwerp, his landlord. Admitting that the tenant had a right to the crop, the plaintiff could only have a right to enter and take it, or to maintain an action <em>de bonis asportatis, </em>against the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-4\">Corn growing is susceptible of delivery in no other way, than by putting the party in possession of the soil.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">The reservation in this case was not of rent, but the tenant was to have the crop on shares. He and <em>Van Antwerp </em>were joint owners of the crop, and might maintain trespass, as such, according to the principle laid down in <em>Foot and Litchfield </em>v. <em>Colvin.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Now, to enable the plaintiff to maintain trespass <em>quart clausum fregit, </em>he must have the exclusive right to the crop.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-6\">Again, there was, in fact, no seizure of the wheat and rye, by the sheriff. <em>Van Antwerp </em>had put another tenant in possession. To maintain this action, there must be a possession, in <em>fact, </em>of the property. A general properly is not sufficient.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\"> <em>Woodfall, 235. </em>Cruise's Dig. <em>ut. 9. c. 1. s. 4. 1 Inst. 55. a. n. 1.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AAW\"> <em>Woodfall, 306. 309. 2 Bl.

J. delivered the opinion of the court.</author>\n<p id=\"APW\">There are several questions raised in this case, which it will be necessary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">1. The first question is, whether the plaintiff be entitled, in any form of action, to recover ?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">The lease was determined while the crop was in the ground, and it was determined by the lessor, under the provision contained in the 12th article of the agreement. The right to the emblements which would otherwise exist in the lessee, as the duration of his estate depended upon the will of the lessor, does not appear to be controlled or affected by the special contract of the parties. In case of the determination of the estate by the lessor, the contract provides for compensation only, \u201cfor preparing the ground for the reception of seed, or for any other <em>extra </em>labour.\u201d ' This preparation of the ground for the reception of seed is not necessarily a substitute for the right to the emblements, for it may apply to clearing and manuring and ploughing the ground, and these acts may have taken place long before seed time. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>common law has established a distinction in respect to this very subject of emblements, between the right to emblements and the costs of plowing and manuring the ground, so that the determination of an estate at will, would give to the lessee his emblements, but not any compensation for these improvements. He might be ousted of the possession before the crop was in the ground, and wholly lose the expense of plowing and manuring the land, though if he was ousted afterwards, he would be entitled to the emblements, (Bro. <em>Abr. </em>tit. <em>Emblements, </em>pl. 7. tit. <em>Tenant per copie de court roll, </em>pl. 3.) We ought to'consider the compensation intended by the article for such a case as this, and not \u00e1s an equivalent for the crop itself. The doctrine of emblements is founded on the clearest equity and the soundest policy, and ought to receive a liberal encouragement. Compensation for <em>preparing the ground for seed </em>is not an indemnity for the loss of the crop, which includes the loss of the seed, the labour of sowing and nursing it, and the hopes, to the labourer and his family, of a fruitful harvest.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">While the crop was in the ground, and before notice to quit, it Was sold by the sheriff under an execution against the lessee, and the plaintiff became the purchaser. This was a valid sale, and the purchaser became entitled to the right of <em>ingress, </em>&amp;c. to gather the crop. He succeeded to all the interest of the original lessee in the crop sown, and so the law was understood by this court, in the case of <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Foot. </em>(2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>423.) The subsequent act of the lessee, in abandoning the premises, soon after notice was given, did not impair or affect the purchaser\u2019s right which had already vested. Quitting the premises was not injurious to the lessor. He lost no rent by it. It was in furtherance of his wishes, and in obedience to his notice; and if the lessee had continued in possession for the whole six months, he would probably have been an injury to the farm, by preventing' its improvement the ensuing season. His prompt abandonment of the premises was no injury, and no reason why he should lose his emblements, even if we were to admit that he had it in his power, by this means, to affect the purchaser\u2019s interest. The lessor himself did not intend by the notice, to deprive the lessee of the crop already sown, for the six months would not have expired until after harvest. The plaintiff, therefore, appears to have had a clear right and title to the emblements, at the time they were gathered by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>2. The next question is, whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the whole or only a moiety of the crop. This will depend upon the question, whose property the grain was before a moiety was delivered to the lessor. By the 8th article of the agreement, the lessee was to \u201c render and yield and pay to the lessor the one half of all the wheat, rye, com and other grain, raised on the farm, in each year, in the bushel, after deducting the seed, and also the one half of the butter and cheese,\u201d &amp;c. and by the 9th article he was to deliver such a proportion of the hay, <em>ike. </em>But here was a lease for five years, and the articles of agreement expressly declared, that <em>Van Antwerp </em>\u201c rented and hired, and suffered the lessee to possess and enjoy the farm, and gave him the quiet and uninterrupted possession,\u201d &amp;c. An interest in the soil passed, and the lessee would have been entitled to an action of trespass, for any unlawful entry upon it; the proportion of the productions of the farm which the tenant was yearly to render, was a payment of rent in kind. They were not tenants in common in the crops and productions raised. The interest and property in the crops was exclusively in the tenant, until he had separated and delivered to the lessor his proportion, it might as well be said that the lessor would have been tenant in common in the crop, though he was to receive only every tenth bushel of grain as a rent. The interest in the <em>whole </em>crop, therefore, passed to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">3. The only remaining question is, whether the plaintiff is entitled to an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit, </em>for the loss of the crop. As he had an exclusive interest, I think the action will lie. The case of <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Wadsworth </em>(6 <em>East, </em>602.) was an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit, </em>and the court of K. B. held that the action was proper if the plaintiff had made out his alleged interest, which was to the exclusive enjoyment of a growing crop of grass, and to the right to cut; and carry it away. The general language of the authorities is to this effect, that the grantee <em>yestum term, </em>or <em>herbagii term, </em>may maintain trespass, though, he has not the soil. <em>(Co. Litt. </em>4. b. <em>Com. Dig. </em>tit. Trespass, B. 1.) There are numerous authorities which support the general position, and which are referred to in <em>Crosby v. </em>Wadsworth, and in 1 <em>Chit. on Plead. </em>176, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The court are, accordingly, of opinion, that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
