G. Detouches, </em>the sum of .1,750 guilders, for passage and boarding on board of my vessel, the <em>Urania, </em>on her present voyage to <em>Batavia, </em>for which I engage myself to afford him my table, and every other accommodation, (liquors excepted.) <em>Amsterdam, </em>3d <em>October, </em>1809. <em>John M. Peck.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-11\">The <em>Urania, </em>after leaving <em>Amsterdam,, </em>for <em>Batavia, </em>put inte <em>New-York </em>in distress, where she arrived the 6th <em>December, </em>1809. She did not proceed to <em>Batavia, </em>but: was, afterwards, sent on a <em>voyage </em>from <em>New-York to Naples, </em>for which place she cleared out the 21st <em>December, </em>1809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5o\">On the arrival of the <em>Urania </em>at <em>New-York, Minturn 8c Champlin </em>had another vessel, a large and very fine ship, called ^ the <em>Thames, </em>nearly ready to sail for <em>Batavia; </em>and told the plaintiff and the other passengers, that they should proceed in her to <em>Batavia. </em>All the other passengers, except the plaintiff, gladly accepted the proposal, as the <em>Thames </em>was a large and commodious ship, and in every respect preferable to the <em>Urania, </em>which was a small schooner, with very indifferent accommodations. The plaintiff made no objection to the change, but informed Champlin, one of the owners, through the witness, who acted as interpreter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that he had business of importance to transact at <em>Philadelphia, </em>and should not be able to proceed immediately to <em>Batavia. </em>It appeared that the plaintiff was indisposed from the time of his arrival at <em>New-York, </em>until after the sailing of the <em>Thames </em>for <em>Batavia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-3\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, by consent, for 760 dollars, subject to the opinion of the court, on the above case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-4\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>for the plaintiff, admitted that no similar case was to he found in the books.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASM\">He said that the plaintiff did not demand a return of the whole passage money, but was willing to allow a <em>pro rata </em>freight for bis passage to <em>New-York. </em>In that view, it might be likened to the case of goods accepted by the owner or consignee, at an intermediate port. But he contended that a passenger, a reasonable and intelligent being, was not to be treated as a bale of merchandise, and transferred from one ship Its another, as it might suit the convenience or pleasure of \u00abhe captain, or Ms owners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-5\">The plaintiff had a judgment to exercise, and a choice to make, as to the particular vessel in which he was to be carried. Having made bis election, and the defendant having engaged to carry him sn a particular ship, he ought not to be obliged, unless in a case of necessity, to proceed in another. It may be, he was better pleased with the <em>Urania, </em>and liked his accommodations in that vessel. He might also prefer the master, and have greater confidence in his skill as a navigator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-6\">\u2022Again, this may be considered as a contract rescinded by mutual consent, and the plaintiff, therefore, entitled to have, his money back.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-7\"><em>Bristed </em>and Robinson, contra, contended, that it was owing to the plaintiff\u2019s own act that he was not carried to <em>Batavia, as </em>the Uranio.; put into <em>New-York </em>from necessity, and the defendant offered to \u00ab\u2022 provide, and did actually provide, another and a better ship.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXs9\">They admitted that no case in point was to be foundbut on principles, they thought it a clear case for the defendant The defendant must have expended some part of the money he received, in providing diet and accommodation for the plaintiff; and ought, therefore, to retain to that amount, at least, besides, for the transportation <em>pro rata, </em>if that could be ascertained.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\"> 10 <em>East, </em>468.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ASX\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AHGA\">The plaintiff is not entitled to recover; for it'., was Jug own act that the voyage was not performed by him. The schooner <em>Urania </em>deviated from her direct course, and entered the port of <em>New-York, </em>from necessity, and as the plaintiff bad a better ship provided for his voyage, and made no objection to the change, but was prevented from sailing by his own private business or indisposition, he has no right to call for a return of the freight money, or any part of it. The providing of provisions and accommodations for his passage entered essentially into the consideration for the advance, and part of the voyage was performed. It would be difficult to find a just rule by which to liquidate a <em>pro rata </em>freight in such cases,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but there is no reason, in this case, for giving the plaintiff the return of any part of the freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b226-5\"> See in a note to <em>Ingersoil\u2019s </em>translation of <em>Roccus, </em>(p. 70.) the following ease decided in the supreme court of <em>Pennsylvania. </em>It is stated from the relation of one of the counsel in the cause. <em>Maureau </em>was master of a <em>French </em>vessel bound from <em>Philadelphia </em>to <em>Bordeaux, </em>on board of which <em>Germain </em>took his passage, and paid his passage money in advance. Two days after her sailing, the vessel was wrecked and totally lost in <em>Delaware Bay. </em>In an action brought by <em>G. </em>against <em>M'., </em>the court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to recover hack the whole of the money he had advanced, <em>deducting a reasonable compensation pro rata intineris, for the two days the plaintiff had been on board. </em>See <em>Roccus, </em>n. 80. 3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>34.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
