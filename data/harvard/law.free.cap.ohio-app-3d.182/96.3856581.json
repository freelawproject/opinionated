The trial court sentenced appellant to serve six months at the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio and four years of community control, with express conditions, e.g., random urinalysis. The judge further determined that under R.C. 2950.01, et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, Ohio\u2019s version of the Adam Walsh Act, appellant was a Tier II sex offender and, consequently, is required to register as such for a period of 25 years, with \u201cin person\u201d verification to occur every 180 days. The trial court did not impose a community-notification requirement. Appellant appeals his classification and asserts the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cWhether the application of Senate Bill 10 violates the United States and Ohio Constitutions? [sic]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant first claims that S.B. 10 is retroactive legislation that is punitive, not remedial, in nature and, thus, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. This court, as well as several other appellate courts, rejected this contention. See <em>Montgomery v. Leffler, </em>6th Dist. No. H-08-011, 2008-Ohio-6397, 2008 WL 5147935, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>6th Dist. Nos. H-07-040, H-07-041, and H-07-042, 2008-Ohio-6387, 2008 WL 5148003, \u00b6 19. See also, e.g., <em>State v. Ellis, </em>8th Dist. No. 90844, 2008-Ohio-6283, 2008 WL 5096923, \u00b6 40; <em>In re Kristopher W., </em>5th Dist. No. 2008 AP030022, 2008-Ohio-6075, 2008 WL 4965172, \u00b6 40; <em>State v. Byers, </em>7th Dist. No. 07CO39, 2008-Ohio-5051, 2008 WL 4416519, \u00b6 28. We therefore find appellant\u2019s contention on this issue meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant next argues that S.B. 10 violates Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution, which prohibits the enactment of retroactive laws. This argument is found without merit on the authority of <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>\u00b6 19, and <em>Montgomery v. Leffler, </em>\u00b6 23. Finally, appellant maintains that S.B. 10 abrogates the separation-of-powers principle that is inherent in Ohio\u2019s constitutional framework. This constitutional challenge is found without merit on the authority of <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>\u00b6 22, and <em>Montgomery v. Leffler, </em>\u00b6 26. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 5} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Lucas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-10\">Skow, P.J., and Singer, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
