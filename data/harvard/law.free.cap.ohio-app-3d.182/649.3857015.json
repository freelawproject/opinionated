Appellee commenced the instant action on July 19, 2007. He advanced claims in both battery and negligence and requested compensatory and punitive damages. Appellant is currently incarcerated and filed a rambling pro se narrative of his version of events that, essentially, denied the gist of the allegations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">{\u00b6 4} At the March 24, 2008 initial pretrial hearing, appellant did not appear. His wife appeared on appellant\u2019s behalf, but because she is not licensed to practice law, she was prohibited from arguing on his behalf. The trial court set the matter for a July 14, 2008 final pretrial and further specified that if any party failed to abide by the directions set forth in the entry, a default judgment could follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">{\u00b6 5} The matter came on for the final pretrial on the scheduled date. Once again, appellant did not appear. The trial court and appellee\u2019s counsel initially discussed changing the original trial date, but the trial court invited counsel to make a motion to \u201cdefault [appellant] out * * * for a no-show.\u201d The court granted the motion and appellee gave testimony concerning damages. Appellee stated that $100,000 would compensate him for his injuries. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">{\u00b6 6} We initially point out that appellant\u2019s brief is almost as unintelligible as his pleadings. We, however, have a long history of affording leniency to pro se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>litigants. See <em>Besser v. Griffey </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 379, 382, 623 N.E.2d 1326; <em>State ex rel Karmasu v. Tate </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 199, 206, 614 N.E.2d 827, 832. With this in mind, we construe appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error as arguing that the trial court entered a default judgment against him in violation of Civ.R. 55(A). We agree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">{\u00b6 7} Civ.R. 55(A) states that if a party against whom affirmative relief is sought has \u201cfailed to plead or otherwise defend\u201d against the action, the party seeking affirmative relief can apply for a default judgment. But, \u201c[i]f the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action, he * * * shall be served with <em>written notice of the application </em>for judgment at least seven days prior to the hearing on such application.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Once an appearance has been made by the party against whom default judgment is sought, the notice and hearing are mandatory. Any default judgment entered without notice and hearing is void and shall be vacated on appeal. See <em>Hartmann v. Ohio Crime Victims Reparations Fund </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 235, 238, 741 N.E.2d 149; <em>State v. Heft, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-211, 2003-Ohio-4893, 2003 WL 22128908, at \u00b6 7-8; <em>Montgomery v. Doe </em>(Dec. 22, 1998), Franklin App. Nos. 98AP-534 and 98AP-623, 1998 WL 894845.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 8} In the case sub judice, appellant entered an appearance in the action. Indeed, the record is replete with rambling and almost nonsensical pro se filings. We, however, decline to answer at this time the question of whether his inability to attend the trial court proceedings constitutes a \u201cfailure to defend\u201d against the action, although decisional law does provide otherwise. Assuming arguendo that it does, Civ.R. 55(A) requires that appellant be given seven days notice that appellee moved for a default judgment. This did not happen, as the trial court invited the motion, counsel made the motion, and the court granted the motion and considered the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 9} Although appellee did not file a brief in this matter, to the extent that he may rely on the March 25, 2008 entry to provide the requisite notice, we believe that such reliance is misplaced. It is true that the entry warned of the potential for a default judgment if any party failed to comply with the entry. However, Civ.R. 55(A) addresses what must take place after the motion for default judgment is made. Obviously, at the time of the March 25, 2008 entry, no such motion had been made. Thus the warnings included in the entry do not satisfy the notice provisions of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">{\u00b6 10} For these reasons, we hereby sustain appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error to the limited extent discussed herein. Thus, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>this opinion. Appellant\u2019s remaining assignments of error are now rendered moot and will be disregarded pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"AV5\">Harsha and McFarland, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-14\">. We have no idea what appellant means by \"thirty-three (33) errors of the original trial court.\u201d As they are not set forth as assignments of error, we will disregard them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-15\">. It is unclear from the record whether appellant's current incarceration is related to the assault at issue in this case or some other charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
