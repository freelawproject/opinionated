Appellees Enlow, Osgood, and Smidebush are physicians with appellee FIA. Smidebush is also chairman of the radiology department at appellee Fairfield Medical Center (\u201cFMC\u201d). While employed as a radiologist with appellee FIA, appellant provided radiology services to appellee FMC in accordance with an agreement between appellees FIA and FMC. Appellant\u2019s employment agreement with appellee FIA stated in Section 8:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c(a) In the event that Dr. Cramer at any time shall not be duly licensed or otherwise legally authorized to render professional services as a radiologist in the State of Ohio, or shall not be approved for and maintain a Medical Staff appointment at Fairfield Medical Center or its successor in interest, then this Agreement shall immediately and automatically terminate * *</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">{\u00b6 4} In 2000, appellant, who was married, began a consensual relationship with a nurse, Rebecca Flautt, who was in the radiology department of FMC. Jolene Cramer, appellant\u2019s then wife, called appellee Enlow and told her that appellant had physically injured her and had molested their children. Enlow testified during her deposition that she thought that she had heard about the affair from a technologist and that she probably had discussed the affair with her partners. She testified that she probably spoke with Smidebush because his office was next to hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">{\u00b6 5} On or about March 21, 2001, appellant sent a letter to Howard Snider-man, Vice President of Ancillary Services at appellee FMC, advising him that he was in the process of getting a divorce and that the gossip in the Radiology-Department about his relationship with Rebecca Flautt \u201chas lately become incessant and destructive.\u201d Appellant, in his letter, indicated that two technologists, appellees Sweeney and Black, were responsible for much of the gossip and asked that appellee FMC take action to stop the gossip. On March 29, 2001, appellee Lister, the radiology department manager, and Carol Cogossi, head of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>human resources, met with appellees Sweeney, Black, and Martin, advised them of the complaint made about their gossiping, and advised them to avoid gossiping.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">{\u00b6 6} Between March 29, 2001, and April 2, 2001, appellee Black alleged that appellant was harassing her and provided documentation of the alleged harassment to appellee Lister. On July 6, 2001, appellant reported appellee Jennifer Black and another technologist for allegedly leaving a patient unattended for at least an hour, putting the patient, who was thought to have a blood clot in her lungs, at risk. Appellant requested that the matter be investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 7} Thereafter, on or about July 24, 2001, appellant sent a letter to appellee Smidebush alleging that his working relationship with Sweeney had deteriorated over the past few months. Appellant indicated that on July 19, 2001, Sweeney had, he believed, intentionally pulled the wire out of a patient having an abdominal aortagram. Appellant requested that Sweeney not be assigned to \u201cscrub\u201d on cases with him in the future. According to appellant, appellee Smidebush refused to investigate, telling appellant that he was the one causing the problems. Smidebush, in a letter to appellant dated July 25, 2001, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cYou have accused her [appellee Vicki Sweeney] of intentionally performing an act while assisting you which sabotaged the procedure and caused added discomfort to the patient to re-establish arterial access. In your stated opinion, an adversarial relationship has developed which placed patients at risk. You have requested that Vicki not be assigned to \u2018scrub\u2019 on cases with you in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cAs you know, we currently have only three trained angio techs, of which Vickie is the lead tech with the most experience. It is not possible for the department to staff the angio suite in a manner that will ensure that Vickie does not assist you during procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cAs you have made it clear that a risk to patients exists because of your adversarial relationship, I have a duty to honor your request. Effective immediately, I am removing you from the angiography schedule in an attempt to assure patient safety. Your assigned work schedule will be adjusted accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">{\u00b6 11} On or about July 27, 2001, Smidebush and Osgood, president of FIA, sent a letter to appellant asking the \u201cexact basis\u201d for his \u201ccurrent discontent.\u201d The two indicated that they could not reasonably investigate appellant\u2019s claims until they knew who appellant was upset with, what had been done to him or said about him that appellant felt was unfair, when the events had occurred, and what information appellant had in support of his allegations. When appellant, on August 28, 2001, hand-delivered his written response, Osgood called the police and indicated that appellant had threatened him.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Thereafter, on August 31, 2001, Mina Ubbing, the president of FMC, notified appellant that he was being summarily suspended. The chairman of appellee FMC\u2019s board of trustees, in an undated letter to appellant, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cDue to the escalation of various incidents regarding your disruptive behavior as a Medical Staff member at Fairfield Medical Center and in order to assure a safe environment at Fairfield Medical Center, you have been provided with notice that effective Friday, August 31st your clinical privileges and medical Staff appointment have been summarily suspended pending further investigation by the Board of Trustees. (This action is being taken pursuant to our authority and obligations under The code of Regulations of Fairfield Medical Center, Section 5.04 \u2014 -Summary Suspensions.) You were notified in person of this summary suspension by the President of the Hospital, Mina Ubbing, on Friday, August 31st, acting on my behalf as Chairman of the Board of Trustees * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cWhile other issues may or may not surface during the course of our review, the issues of concern which have led to our action are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cDisruption of the normal function of the department as evidenced by:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c1) complaints from staff of harassment</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c2) numerous unscheduled prolonged meetings of the radiology group during normal business hours and after hours to address your behavior and issues raised by you</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c3) conflict with department management and failure to take issues regarding staff through proper channels as requested</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c4) continued imposition of personal issues upon department staff during business hours</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c5) ongoing concern regarding your perceived threatening demeanor and cryptic remarks which raise concerns about staff safety</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c6) failure to alter behavior in spite of requests to do so both by Hospital Administration and the radiology group</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c7) a direct threat made by you to one of the other radiologists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">{\u00b6 23} The chairman, in a letter to appellant dated September 7, 2001, advised appellant that the board of trustees, at a meeting held the same day, had unanimously voted to continue the summary suspension \u201cuntil such time as an investigation is completed and a decision made as to the action, if any, which should be taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">{\u00b6 24} On September 21, 2001, appellee FIA terminated appellant\u2019s employment agreement based on the indefinite suspension of his privileges at appellee FMC. The termination was pursuant to Section 8 of appellant\u2019s employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>agreement with appellee FIA. FIA, in its September 21, 2001 letter to appellant, stated that it was not renewing his employment agreement ending March 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"ARV\">{\u00b6 25} As memorialized in a letter to appellant from FMC\u2019s chairman of the board of trustees dated October 18, 2001, the board voted to continue appellant\u2019s summary suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 26} In October 2001, appellant filed a lawsuit against FMC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. Appellant sought an injunction against appellee FMC to prevent it from reporting him to the National Database of Physicians. Appellant and FMC entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release, which stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201ci. Save and except for the agreement and obligations set forth in this agreement, Dr. Cramer hereby releases and forever discharges Fairfield from any and all claims, controversies, actions, demands, causes of action, debts, obligations, damages, liabilities, duties, agreements or contracts of every kind and description, whether known or unknown, and whether at law or in equity, which Dr. Cramer now has, has had, or hereafter may have against Fairfield arising out of any matter, cause or thing from the beginning of the world to the date of this Settlement Agreement, including, but not limited to, any and all claims, causes of action, liability or damages arising out of the acts, transactions, contracts, agreements, bylaws, occurrences or events alleged in the pleadings or which could have been alleged in the pleadings or other papers filed in the litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 28} The settlement agreement and mutual release defined \u201cFairfield\u201d as Fairfield Medical Center, its present and former officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors, heirs, and assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant\u2019s federal case was then voluntarily dismissed with prejudice on December 26, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">{\u00b6 30} On September 20, 2005, appellant and Rebecca Cramer, nee Rebecca Flautt, filed a complaint against appellees FIA, FMC, Smidebush, Osgood, and Enlow. The two, in their complaint, also named appellees Sweeney, Martin, Black, and Lister as defendants. Appellant filed an amended complaint on February 14, 2006. In Count One of the amended complaint, appellant alleged that appellee FIA had breached its contract of employment with him and its duty of good faith and fair dealing. Appellant in Count Two alleged that appellee FIA had wrongfully discharged him in violation of Ohio\u2019s policy that protects whistle-blowers and in violation of Ohio\u2019s quality-assurance statutes as well as the common law of assault. Appellant and Rebecca Cramer, in Count Three of the amended complaint, alleged that appellees Lister, Black, Sweeney, Martin, En-low, Smidebush, and Osgood conspired to defame their good name and reputation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>and conspired to tortiously interfere with appellant\u2019s staff privileges through their gossip and defamatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">{\u00b6 31} Rebecca Cramer, in Count Four of the amended complaint, set forth sexual-harassment claims against appellee FMC. She alleged that she experienced unwelcome sexual harassment and was retaliated against. Appellant, in Count Five of the amended complaint, alleged that appellees Smidebush, Osgood, Enlow, Sweeney, and Black tortiously interfered with his relationship with appellee FMC by providing false and salacious information that was used by appellee FMC to suspend his hospital privileges. Finally, appellant, in Count Six of the amended complaint, alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c51. The Defendants, FMC, fraudulently manipulated the circumstances surrounding Plaintiff, Dr. Cramer\u2019s allegations of improper technician performance on patients, to make it appear as if the hospital had summarily suspended his privileges. In fact, his hospital privileges were never suspended; the hospital failed to follow any of the procedures outlined in the Hospital Medical By-laws for removing a physician\u2019s privileges, and had no basis in fact to institute such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c52. Defendant, FMC, refused to provide Plaintiff, Dr. Cramer with any due process, and never properly investigated the incidents of which he complained that could have caused serious patient injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c53. The Defendants, FMC created the false threat of suspended privileges in order to induce the Plaintiff to sign a release which would prevent Plaintiff, Dr. Cramer, from being paid for the damage they did to his career, his finances, and his reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c54. The Plaintiff, Dr. Cramer, received no consideration for the promise to forebear from any suits for damages as a result of the Defendants\u2019 FMC, and individuals\u2019 behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">{\u00b6 36} All appellees filed motions for summary judgment. As memorialized in an entry filed on August 13, 2007, the trial court granted the motions for summary judgment with the exception that the trial court denied the motion for summary judgment filed by appellees FMC, Lister, Black, Sweeney, and Martin regarding Count Four of the amended complaint. A jury trial on that count commenced on September 11, 2007. As memorialized in an entry filed on September 17, 2007, the jury found in favor of Rebecca Cramer and against appellee FMC on her hostile-environment sexual-harassment claim and awarded her $146,840. The jury found in favor of appellee FMC on Rebecca Cramer\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">{\u00b6 37} Appellant now raises the following assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>{\u00b6 38} \u201cI. Whether the trial court erred in dismissing Dr. Cramer\u2019s breach of contract claim since the evidence shows FIA breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cII. Whether the trial court erred in dismissing Dr. Cramer\u2019s wrongful discharge claims based on a clear violation of Ohio\u2019s policy protecting patients from assault and employees who report workplace safety violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cIII. Whether the trial court erred in granting immunity to FIA physicians under HCQIA when they participated in bad faith fraudulent peer review activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cIV. Whether Dr. Cramer\u2019s claim for tortious interference with business relations against FIA was timely filed within four years of when he discovered the harm caused by the interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u2018V. Whether the trial court erred in failing to set aside a release fraudulently obtained based upon illegal consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">{\u00b6 43} Summary judgment proceedings present the appellate court with the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. The Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212. Therefore, we must refer to Civ.R. 56(C), which provides: \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence or stipulation, and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">{\u00b6 44} Pursuant to the above rule, a trial court may not enter summary judgment if it appears that a material fact is genuinely disputed. The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The moving party may not make a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. The moving party must specifically point to some evidence demonstrating that the nonmoving party cannot support its claim. If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>trial. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">{\u00b6 45} It is based upon this standard that we review appellants\u2019 assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 46} Appellant, in his first assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his breach-of-contract claims against appellee FIA because appellees Osgood, Enlow, and Smidebush, who are referred to as the \u201cFIA Physicians,\u201d breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 47} As is stated above, after appellant\u2019s privileges at appellee FMC were suspended, appellant\u2019s employment agreement with appellee FIA was terminated in accordance with Section 8 of the same. Section 8 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c(a) In the event that Dr. Cramer at any time shall not be duly licensed or otherwise legally authorized to render professional services as a radiologist in the State of Ohio, or shall not be approved for and maintain a Medical Staff appointment at Fairfield Medical Center or its successor in interest, then this Agreement shall immediately and automatically terminate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant now contends that \u201cthe radiologists [appellees Osgood, Smidebush, and Enlow] at FIA participated in the gossip sessions with the technologists once Dr. Cramer\u2019s affair * * * came to light, and exploited the tension between the technologists and Dr. Cramer to create circumstances that led to a sham peer review process that stripped Dr. Cramer\u2019s privileges to practice at FMC,\u201d leading to the termination of his agreement with appellee FIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">{\u00b6 50} However, Ohio law does not recognize a good-faith-and-fair-dealing requirement in employment-at-will relationships. <em>Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 100, 105, 19 OBR 261, 483 N.E.2d 150; <em>Edelman v. Franklin Iron Metal Corp. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 406, 411, 622 N.E.2d 411. Section 7 of appellant\u2019s contract with appellee FIA provides that either appellee FIA or appellant could voluntarily terminate the contract at any time <em>without cause. </em>While appellant argues that Section 8, captioned Termination of Employment for Cause, removes the employment agreement from the at-will clause in Section 7, we do not agree. Although the employment agreement states in Section 8 that appellant\u2019s employment with appellee FIA will terminate if appellant loses his medical staff appointment at FMC, nowhere does the agreement state that appellant may be discharged only with just cause. Nor does the agreement state that appellant\u2019s employment agreement will remain in effect as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>long as appellant has privileges at appellee FMC. We find that appellant was an at-will employee and that no duty of good faith and fair dealing was owed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 51} While appellant also contends that appellant\u2019s employment was not at will because Section 7 of the employment agreement permitted either side to voluntarily terminate the agreement by giving four months prior written notice, we disagree. Employment terminated on the giving of a specified notice is still employment at will and not employment for a specified term. See <em>La France Elec. Constr. Supply Co. v. Interntl. Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local No. 8 </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 61, 88, 140 N.E. 899. Specifically, when an employment agreement requires a written notice of the employee\u2019s intention to terminate employment, the notice provision does not establish a term for the duration of a contract, but merely a period of convenient notice, and the relationship between the employer and the employee remains at will. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 52} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on appellant\u2019s breach-of-contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 53} Appellants first assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">{\u00b6 54} Appellant, in his second assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim that appellee FIA had wrongfully discharged him in violation of Ohio\u2019s policy of \u201cprotecting patients from assault and employees who report workplace safety violations.\u201d Appellant maintains that he was discharged for asking for investigations into two incidents in which technologists allegedly intentionally jeopardized patient care and argues that his discharge was in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">{\u00b6 55} In essence, appellant argues that FIA wrongfully discharged him because FMC suspended his privileges for trying to report employee actions that jeopardized the physical safety of patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">{\u00b6 56} Pursuant to <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E .2d 981, a discharged employee has a private cause of action sounding in tort for wrongful discharge when his or her discharge is in contravention of a \u201csufficiently clear public policy.\u201d Id. at 233, 551 N.E.2d 981. In <em>Ghaeeley, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court recognized that the public policy was \u201csufficiently clear\u201d when the General Assembly had adopted a specific statute forbidding an employer from discharging or disciplining an employee on the basis of a particular circumstance or occurrence. <em>Greeley </em>noted other exceptions might be recognized when the public policy could be deemed to be \u201cof equally serious import as the violation of a statute.\u201d Id. at 235, 551 N.E.2d 981. \u201cThe existence of such a public policy may be discerned by the Ohio judiciary based on sources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>such as the Constitutions of Ohio and the United States, legislation, administrative rules and regulations, and the common law.\u201d <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 384, 639 N.E.2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 57} In order to establish a claim for wrongful termination in violation of Ohio public policy, a plaintiff must demonstrate:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c1. That clear public policy existed and was manifested in a state or federal constitution, statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the <em>clarity </em>element).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c2. That dismissing employees under circumstances like those involved in the plaintiffs dismissal would jeopardize the public policy (the <em>jeopardy </em>element).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c3. The plaintiffs dismissal was motivated by conduct related to the public policy (the <em>causation </em>element).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c4. The employer lacked overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the <em>overriding justification </em>element).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 384, 639 N.E.2d 51, fn. 8. See also <em>Wiles v. Medina Auto Parts, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 7-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">{\u00b6 62} The clarity and the jeopardy elements are questions of law and policy to be determined by the court. <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 70, 652 N.E.2d 653. The causation and overriding-justification elements are questions of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">{\u00b6 63} The crucial issue for determination is whether appellee demonstrated that a clear public policy existed that prevented his discharge (the \u201cclarity element\u201d). See <em>Wiles, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526. As an initial matter, we note that appellant, in his brief, concedes that he failed to commence a civil action under R.C. 4113.52 within 180 days of his discharge and that any whistleblower claim under that section is time-barred. R.C. 4113.52, Ohio\u2019s \u201cWhistleblower Act,\u201d states: \u201cIf an employee becomes aware in the course of the employee\u2019s employment of a violation of any state or federal statute or any ordinance or regulation of a political subdivision that the employee\u2019s employer has authority to correct, and the employee reasonably believes that the violation is a criminal offense that is likely to cause an imminent risk of physical harm to persons or a hazard to public health or safety, a felony, or an improper solicitation for a contribution, the employee orally shall notify the employee\u2019s supervisor or other responsible officer of the employee\u2019s employer of the violation and subsequently shall file with that supervisor or officer a written report that provides sufficient detail to identify and describe the violation * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>{\u00b6 64} Thus, appellant was required to identify a source of public policy separate and apart from the public policy embodied in R.C. 4113.52. See <em>Lesko v. Riverside Methodist Hosp., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1130, 2005-Ohio-3142, 2005 WL 1482549, \u00b6 34. It was appellant\u2019s burden to indicate the specific public policy at issue and to establish how that clear public policy was violated by his termination. <em>Poland Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Swesey, </em>Mahoning App. No. 02 CA 185, 2003-Ohio-6726, 2003 WL 22946148, \u00b6 10. We concur with the trial court that appellant failed to do so. Appellant failed to identify an additional source of public policy separate from the public policy embodied in R.C. 4113.52. Appellant was terminated by appellee FIA pursuant to Section 8 of his employment agreement after his privileges at appellee FMC were summarily suspended. Appellant has failed to allege or even argue how Ohio\u2019s public policy was violated by his discharge. In short, we concur with appellees that appellant has failed to allege any facts indicating why appellee FIA discharged him or how such discharge contravened a clear public policy. While appellant argues that his discharge was in violation of R.C. 5122.32, which concerns confidentiality of quality-assurance records, appellant failed to show or argue how his discharge was caused by a violation of such section or other common-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 65} Appellant cites R.C. 2903.11, the felonious-assault statute, for the proposition that Ohio has a clear public policy \u201cthat prohibits assault, or unprivileged and unconsenting touching of a patient.\u201d However, that statute does not support appellant\u2019s contention that a \u201cclear public policy exists separate from the dictates of R.C. 4113.52.\u201d <em>McNett v. Hardin Community Fed. Credit Union, </em>Allen App. No. 1-04-46, 2004-Ohio-6957, 2004 WL 2940872, \u00b6 23. See also <em>Evans v. PHTG, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2001-T-0054, 2002-Ohio-3381, 2002 WL 1401476, \u00b6 38 in which the court held: \u201cThe essence of appellant\u2019s claim is that the public policy of this state encourages employees to report criminal conduct occurring in the workplace to their employers. However, * * * this particular public policy upon which appellant relies is specifically set out in the whistleblower statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 66} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Ill, IV</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 67} Appellant, in his third and fourth assignments of error, argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Counts Three and Five of appellant\u2019s amended complaint. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">(\u00b6 68} As is stated above, appellant, in Count Three of the amended complaint, alleged that appellees Lister, Black, Sweeney, Martin, Enlow, Smidebush, and Osgood conspired to defame his good name and reputation and conspired to tortiously interfere with appellant\u2019s staff privileges through their gossip and defamatory statements. Appellant, in Count Five of the amended complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>alleged that appellees Smidebush, Osgood, Enlow, Sweeney, and Black tortiously interfered with his relationship with appellee FMC by providing false and salacious information that was used by appellee FMC to suspend his hospital privileges. The trial court, in its August 13, 2007 entry, found that such claims were time barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 69} As the court stated in <em>Cully v. St. Augustine Manor </em>(Apr. 20, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67601, 1995 WL 237129: \u201c[A] claim for conspiracy cannot be made subject of a civil action unless something is done which, in the absence of the conspiracy allegations, would give rise to an independent cause of action. <em>Katz v. Banning </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 543, 552, 617 N.E.2d 729; <em>Palmer v. Westmeyer </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 296, 300, 549 N.E.2d 1202; and <em>Stafford v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(Dec. 23, 1993), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 63663 &amp; 65530, 1993 WL 536089. Thus, the applicable statute of limitations for the underlying cause of actions applies to the civil conspiracy charge. (Emphasis added).\u201d Id. at *4. R.C. 2305.11 requires that an action for libel or slander, which includes defamation, be brought within one year after the cause of action accrued. A cause of action for defamation accrues upon the date of publication of the defamatory matter or at the time the words are spoken. See <em>Lewis v. Delaware Cty. Joint Vocational School Dist., </em>161 Ohio App.3d 71, 2005-Ohio-2550, 829 N.E.2d 697, and <em>Altier v. Valentic, </em>Geaga App. No. 2003-G-2521, 2004-Ohio-5641, 2004 WL 2376265.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 70} In the case sub judice, the allegedly defamatory statements were made prior to appellant\u2019s summary suspension of privileges in 2001. Appellant did not file his complaint in this matter until 2005. While appellant argues that appellant\u2019s cause of action for conspiracy to defame did not commence until he was reasonably aware of the injury associated with the act, we note that this court has rejected applying the discovery rule to defamation claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Lewis </em>at \u00b6 38 (\u201cWith regard to appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court should have applied the discovery rule, we find that the date of publication and not the discovery thereof is the time for accrual of such an action. <em>Snell v. Drew </em>(Nov. 1, 1985), Lucas App. No. L-85-074, at 4, 1985 WL 8216; <em>Rainey v. Shaffer </em>(1983), 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Ohio App.3d 262, 8 OBR 354, 456 N.E.2d 1328; <em>Palmer v. Westmeyer </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 296, 549 N.E.2d 1202\u201d). We find, therefore, that the trial court did not err in finding that appellant\u2019s conspiracy-to-defame claim was time-barred and granting summary judgment on such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 71} As is stated above, appellant, in Counts Three and Five, set forth claims of tortious interference. The statute of limitations for a claim of tortious interference with contract is four years pursuant to R.C. 2305.09(D). Appellant, in the case sub judice, was advised verbally by Mina Ubbing, appellee FMC\u2019s president, on August 30, 2001, that he was being summarily suspended. At such time, appellant was escorted by security guards off of the premises. Appellant did not file his complaint until September 20, 2005, which is more than four years after such date. Appellant argues that his \u201ccause of action sounding in conspiracy, or in tortious interference with contract, or with prospective relations cannot begin to run until he [appellant] understood the magnitude of his injury\u201d and that he did not understand the same until he was notified by appellee FMC on October 18, 2001, that his privileges had been suspended indefinitely and on December 4, 2001, when appellee FIA terminated his agreement. However, appellant knew that he had suffered an injury when he was advised on August 30, 2001, of his summary suspension. This court is unaware of any case law, nor does appellant cite any, applying the discovery rule to claims of tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">(\u00b6 72} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err in holding that appellant\u2019s tortious-interference claims in Counts Three and Five of the amended complaint were time-barred and granting summary judgment on such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 73} Appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error are, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">{\u00b6 74} Appellant, in his fifth assignment of error, contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Count Six of appellant\u2019s amended complaint. Appellant, in Count Six, had sought to set aside the settlement agreement and mutual release between appellant and appellee FMC regarding the federal case on the basis that the same was fraudulently obtained. According to appellant, the release \u201cis void, predicated on a fraudulent \u2018peer review\u2019 procedure that violated [appellee FMC\u2019s] By-laws, denied [appellant] due process, and forced him to sign a contract of adhesion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">{\u00b6 75} Appellant, in Count Six of his amended complaint, specifically alleged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>{\u00b6 76} \u201cThe Defendant\u2019s FMC, fraudulently manipulated the circumstances surrounding Plaintiff, Dr. Cramer\u2019s allegations of improper technician performance on patients, to make it appear as if the hospital had summarily suspended his privileges. In fact, his hospital privileges were never suspended; the hospital failed to follow any of the procedures outlined in the Hospital Medical By-laws for removing a physician\u2019s privileges, and had no basis in fact to institute such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cDefendants, FMC, refused to provide Plaintiff, Dr. Cramer with any due process, and never properly investigated the incidents of which he complained that could have caused serious patient injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cThe Defendants, FMC created the false threat of suspended privileges in order to induce the Plaintiff to sign a release which would prevent Plaintiff, Dr. Cramer, from being paid for the damage they did to his career, his finances, and his reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cThe Plaintiff, Dr. Cramer, received no consideration for the promise to forebear from any suits for damages as a result of the Defendants\u2019 FMC, and individuals\u2019 behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 80} In sum, Count Six alleges that FMC made it appear that Cramer\u2019s privileges had been suspended when, in fact, the privileges had not been suspended and could not have been suspended because Cramer had not received due process in the peer-review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 81} As is stated above, appellant, in October 2001, filed a lawsuit against appellee FMC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, seeking an injunction against appellee FMC to prevent it from reporting him to the National Database of Physicians. Appellant and appellee FMC entered into a settlement agreement and a mutual release and, on December 26, 2002, appellant voluntarily dismissed his complaint against appellee FMC with prejudice. Appellant voluntarily dismissed all claims, known or unknown, that he had against appellee FMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">{\u00b6 82} In the case sub judice, appellant attached an affidavit to his April 3, 2006, brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment filed by appellee FMC with respect to Count Six. The affidavit establishes that appellant was aware of the alleged fraud <em>prior </em>to his voluntary dismissal of the claims against appellee FMC on December 26, 2002, in the federal case. Appellant, in his affidavit, alleged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">{\u00b6 83} <em>\u201c2. </em>I first contacted Joe Vitale at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation looking for new employment on September 20, 2001, by sending him my CV, and had my first meeting with him on September 27, 2001. It was in December, 2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>when I learned from him that FMC had not verified that my privileges had been suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">{\u00b6 84} \u201c3. In fact, they informed him that I was Active Staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 85} \u201c4. The undated letter from James Parker, M.D., is a true and accurate copy of the letter I received after my August 31, 2001 meeting with Mina Ubbing, where she told me that my privileges were suspended. I did not receive that letter until a few days after the meeting with Ms. Ubbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 86} \u201c5. The hospital kept telling me that I was going to be given an opportunity to request a hearing. Meanwhile, Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees met on September 7th, 2001, and continued the \u2018suspension\u2019 of my privileges. Present at that meeting were Mina Ubbing, James Parker, Jerome Roche, Vincent Burgess and Sandy Davis, along with two other attorneys for the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 87} \u201c6. I was not informed prior to the meeting what the factual nature of the allegations were that provided the basis for the suspension of my privileges; I was given only 3 or 4 minutes to talk, and was then escorted from the meeting. I was told this was not a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 88} \u201c7. I was told by a physician on the staff at the hospital that the reason for the suspension of my privileges was to help FIA get rid of me without having to buy out my contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">{\u00b6 89} \u201c8. Bill Lister bragged at a technologist\u2019s meeting in early September, 2001, that he had gotten rid of \u2018half the problem (referring to my summary suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">{\u00b6 90} \u201c9. The termination of my employment was not finalized until December, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">{\u00b6 91} \u201c10. I never received the hearing I requested from FMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">{\u00b6 92} \u201c11. No investigation was ever conducted into the evidence I gave to the Executive Committee, including the list of witnesses I asked them to contact on my behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">{\u00b6 93} Appellant now contends that appellee FMC withheld information that he needed to \u201cassess the situation at the time the prior litigation was settled.\u201d Appellant further alleges in his brief that only after he filed the case sub judice did he find evidence of \u201cBill Lister and Jennifer Black feeding distorted and false information on a regular basis to Dr. Osgood, Smidebush\u201d and others. However, as noted by appellees, \u201cas confirmed by the April 3, 2006, Affidavit of Dr. Cramer * * *, Plaintiff-appellant had prior knowledge of the claims he knowingly released when he signed the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release and authorized his attorney to file a Notice of Voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Dismissal with Prejudice on December 26, 2002.\u201d Appellant discovered the alleged fraud between September 2001 and December 2001. We find that the release bars the claims alleged in Count Six.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 94} Based on the foregoing, we find that appellant has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the allegations contained in Count Six. Construing the evidence in appellant\u2019s favor, we find that appellant has failed to demonstrate that the release was fraudulently obtained based upon illegal consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 95} Appellant also alleges that the release was an unconscionable contract of adhesion that he signed because he had no meaningful choice. In other words, appellant had to sign the release or a report would have been sent to the National Physicians Data Base about appellant\u2019s privileges being suspended, and that report would prevent him from obtaining employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 96} Appellant provides little analysis of this issue. But we find that it was not an unconscionable contract of adhesion. The appellant had a meaningful choice. He could have pursued his litigation, and if his rights had been as blatantly violated as he alleges, then he would have prevailed in obtaining an injunction to prohibit a report being sent to the National Physicians Data Base. He decided not to take any risk. This fact does not make the settlement agreement an unconscionable contract of adhesion.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 97} Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 98} Accordingly, the judgment of the Fairfield County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"Axz\">Gwin, P.J., and Farmer, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">. We note that appellant, in his third assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in granting immunity to appellees Enlow, Smidebush, and Osgood under the Health Care Quality Immunity Act C'HCQIA\"). However, we note that the trial court held that those appellees were entitled to immunity as an alternative reason for granting summary judgment on counts three and five.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\">.
