Grendell, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellants, Douglas W. Kern Jr. (\u201cDouglas Jr.\u201d), in his individual capacity and as executor for the estate of Douglas W. Kern Sr. (\u201cDouglas Sr.\u201d), and Richard Kern appeal the opinion and journal entry of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee, Diana Miller. Douglas Jr. and Richard are contesting the trial court\u2019s determination that Miller is the proper beneficiary of a life insurance policy covering Douglas Sr. For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the court below and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">{\u00b6 2} Douglas Sr., the father of Douglas Jr. and Richard, was employed by defendant, the city of Mentor, for 21 years beginning in July 1985. As a benefit of employment, Douglas Sr. received life insurance. Initially, Douglas Sr. identified his wife, Leni Kern, as sole beneficiary on the policy. Upon Leni\u2019s death, Douglas Jr. and Richard were identified as beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">{\u00b6 3} In 1994, Douglas Sr. began dating Miller. In December 1995, Douglas Sr. and Miller became engaged, although they never married. From about 1998 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>until 2001, when their relationship ended, Douglas Sr. and Miller lived together in a house they jointly purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">{\u00b6 4} In 2001, Douglas Sr. began dating June Layman. Douglas Sr. and Layman lived together for about four years, beginning in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 5} In 1996, Unum became Mentor\u2019s life insurance carrier. In that year, Douglas Sr. completed a life and accidental-death beneficiary card identifying Miller, \u201cfriend,\u201d as sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">(\u00b6 6} In 1999, Anthem Life Insurance Company of Indiana became Mentor\u2019s life insurance carrier. In November of that year, Douglas Sr. completed an employee application identifying Miller, \u201cfianc\u00e9[e],\u201d as sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">{\u00b6 7} In January 2006, defendant, Minnesota Life Insurance Company, became Mentor\u2019s life insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 8} In August 2006, Douglas Sr. was diagnosed with cancer of the lungs and brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">{\u00b6 9} On December 20, 2006, Douglas Sr. died.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">{\u00b6 10} Douglas Jr. and Richard subsequently learned that the most recent beneficiary-designation form on file for Douglas Sr. was the Anthem form filled out in 1999 identifying Miller as the sole beneficiary. Douglas Jr. and Richard attempted, unsuccessfully, to have Miller waive her claim to the proceeds of the life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">{\u00b6 11} On August 20, 2007, the Kerns filed a verified complaint against Miller, Minnesota Life, and the city of Mentor. Among the relief sought, the Kerns requested that \u201ceach Defendant be required to interplead and set up any claims that they may have to the proceeds of the policy, and that the Court shall adjudge who is entitled to a recovery herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">{\u00b6 12} Miller answered and filed a cross-claim seeking a declaration that she is entitled to the proceeds of Douglas Sr.\u2019s life insurance policy. Mentor answered and filed a cross-claim against Minnesota Life for negligent misrepresentation, contribution, and indemnification. Minnesota Life answered and filed a cross-claim against Mentor. In its answer, Minnesota Life denied that interpleader was an appropriate remedy and asserted that \u201cany and all claims made under the Minnesota Life Insurance policy of insurance at issue herein are subject to its temxs, conditions and exclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">{\u00b6 13} The trial coux't set May 30, 2008, as the deadline for filing summary-judgment motions. Thereafter, the Kerns dismissed their claims against Mentor, and Mentor dismissed its claim against Minnesota Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">{\u00b6 14} On April 1, 2008, Minnesota Life filed a motion for leave to file an amended answer to plaintiffs complaint and counterclaim and a crossclaim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>interpleader and declaratory judgment. Minnesota Life now asserted \u201ca claim for interpleader and declaratory judgment whereby Minnesota deposits the policy proceeds plus interest with the Court, leaving the disputing parties to argue to the Court who is the proper beneficiary, and having Minnesota Life discharged from liability and otherwise dismissed from this action.\u201d In the motion, Minnesota Life explained that normally it would have moved the trial court for interpleader in its initial answer but was unable to do so in the present case because of Mentor\u2019s cross-claims against it. Since Mentor has dismissed its claims against it, \u201c[tjhere is no reason for Minnesota Life, upon the deposit of the insurance funds, to continue to expend time and money on this issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 15} In May 2008, the Kerns and Miller filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 16} Layman, Douglas Sr.\u2019s fianc\u00e9e at the time of his death, testified that one morning after they had begun living together and before Douglas Sr.\u2019s diagnosis, he called her from work. Layman testified by affidavit that Douglas Sr. told her \u201cthat he was changing the beneficiaries on his life insurance policy * * * and that he was filling out the change of beneficiary form and then sending it through inter-office mail.\u201d According to Layman, Douglas Sr. was changing the policy\u2019s beneficiary so that Douglas Jr. and Richard would receive the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">{\u00b6 17} After Douglas Sr.\u2019s diagnosis with cancer, Layman testified that Douglas Sr. told her that the life insurance policy through his employment with Mentor \u201cwas taken care of\u2019 and the proceeds \u201cwill go to the boys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 18} Richard testified by affidavit that he had numerous conversations with his father following the diagnosis and that his father clearly stated his intention that the proceeds of the Minnesota Life policy should be divided evenly between him and Douglas Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 19} In August 2006, Douglas Sr. and Douglas Jr. met with Roseanne Graham, then Mentor\u2019s acting personnel director and human-resources officer. Graham testified by deposition that the purpose of this meeting was to discuss Douglas Sr.\u2019s sick-leave and health-care benefits in light of his current medical condition. Graham testified that all issues involving employee life insurance are handled by the Mentor finance department and that the issue did not arise at the August 2006 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">{\u00b6 20} Graham testified that Douglas Sr. and Douglas Jr. became emotional during the meeting and began to address one another: \u201c[Douglas Sr.] said that he was so lucky and he felt blessed to have the boys and that everything he had was in order. And Doug Jr. said, \u2018My dad is meticulous in that he\u2019s got everything in perfect order.\u2019 And Doug, Sr. said, \u2018I have files at home.\u2019 And they were basically talking to each other with me there. And Doug, Jr. said, \u2018You got us where we are today; now it\u2019s our turn to take care of you.\u2019 And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>that\u2019s about when Doug, Sr. said, \u2018The boys know where everything is and everything will go to the boys.\u2019 \u201d This meeting lasted about 20 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 21} On October 10, 2008, the trial court granted Miller\u2019s motion for summary judgment and declared her the sole beneficiary of the Minnesota Life Insurance policy. The court ruled: \u201c[Wjhile Douglas Kern, Sr. expressed his intent that the proceeds of his group life insurance policy were to go to his sons, he did not take or direct someone to take on his behalf, sufficient steps to notify his employer (or the insurer) or to otherwise carry out his intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 22} On October 15, 2008, the trial court denied as moot Minnesota Life Insurance\u2019s motion for leave to file amended answer to the plaintiffs complaint and counterclaim and cross-claim for interpleader and declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 23} On October 21, 2008, the Kerns filed a notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s October 10 and 15 judgment entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">{\u00b6 24} The Kerns raise the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">(\u00b6 25} \u201c[1] The trial court erred in overruling Appellants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[2] The trial court erred in granting Appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">{\u00b6 27} Miller raises the following cross-assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[1] In the absence of Civil Rule 22 Interpleader and the deposit of funds the Trial Court erred in not requiring Appellants to prove strict compliance with the Policy terms and conditions in order to change beneficiary [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">{\u00b6 29} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is proper when (1) the evidence shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d to be litigated, (2) \u201c[t]he moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\u201d and (3) \u201cit appears from the evidence * * * that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence * * * construed most strongly in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d A trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is reviewed by an appellate court under a de novo standard of review. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. A de novo review requires the appellate court to conduct an independent review of the evidence before the trial court without deference to the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Brown v. Cty. Commrs. of Scioto Cty. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">{\u00b6 30} The arguments raised by the Kerns and Miller are interrelated. Accordingly, they may be considered in a consolidated fashion. Both parties rely on the terms of the life insurance contract to support their positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>{\u00b6 31} According to the policy, Minnesota Life Insurance \u201cwill pay the death benefit to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. A beneficiary is named by an insured to receive the death benefit to be paid at the insured\u2019s death.\u201d However, \u201c[i]f there is no eligible beneficiary, or if the insured does not name one, [Minnesota Life] will pay the death benefit to * * * the insured\u2019s natural or legally adopted child (children) in equal shares, if living * * With respect to changing beneficiaries, the policy provides: \u201cAn insured can add or change beneficiaries * * *. A request to add or change a beneficiary must be made in writing. All requests are subject to our approval. A change will take effect as of the date it is signed, but will not affect any payment we make or action we take before receiving an insured\u2019s notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">{\u00b6 32} Miller claims that since she is the only \u201cnamed\u201d beneficiary of record, she is entitled to the death benefit according to the policy\u2019s terms. The Kerns maintain that Miller is a beneficiary only under the prior life insurance policy, issued by Anthem and no longer in effect. Thus, they are entitled to the proceeds in the absence of a named beneficiary under the Minnesota Life policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 33} In support of her position, Miller relies on the following admission made by Minnesota Life Insurance: \u201cWhen Minnesota Life Insurance Company issues a Group Life Insurance Policy that replaces or is successor to a Group Life Insurance Policy issued by a previous insurance carrier, it is the Plan Administrator who determines whether new beneficiary designation forms will be disseminated to the insured employees or if it will continue to recognized [sic] the prior designation forms. If the Plan Administrator determines that it will continue to honor the beneficiary designations made prior to Minnesota Life replacing a prior insurance carrier, Minnesota Life\u2019s customary and usual business practice is to accept and recognize as the eligible beneficiary(ies) the person or persons identified in the last written beneficiary designation submitted by the insured employee.\u201d In a separate admission, Minnesota Life acknowledged this \u201cis the standard practice within the group life insurance industry for the group life company coming on the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 34} Consistent with these admissions, Graham (Mentor\u2019s human-resource officer), deposed that in conversations with the finance department as plan administrator, it was discussed that new enrollment cards were not necessary since the new carrier would honor the cards filled out under the old policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> {\u00b6 35} In light of this testimony, Miller is the named beneficiary under the Minnesota Life policy as a matter of law. \u201cThe intent of the parties to a contract is presumed to reside in the language they chose to employ in the agreement.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, at paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201c \u2018If the meaning of the instrument, by itself, is intelligible and certain, extrinsic evidence is admissible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>identify its subjects or its objects, or to explain its recitals or its promises, so far, and only so far, as this can be done without any contradiction of, or any departure from, the meaning which is given by a fair and rational interpretation of the words actually used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blosser v. Enderlin </em>(1925), 113 Ohio St. 121, 132, 148 N.E. 393, quoting 2 Parsons, Contracts (9th Ed.) 717; <em>Kelly, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 132, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 36} In the present case, the Minnesota Life policy does not define a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d beyond being someone \u201cnamed by an insured to receive the death benefit to be paid at the insured\u2019s death.\u201d Minnesota Life\u2019s practice of recognizing persons named as beneficiaries under prior group life policies is consistent with this definition. Contrary to the Kerns\u2019 position, nothing in the Minnesota Life policy requires beneficiaries to be named or re-enrolled at the inception of coverage. In fact, the policy expressly provides for the contingency when there is no named beneficiary at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 37} Miller argues further that since she is the named beneficiary under the policy, the trial court should have simply declared that she is entitled to the proceeds without considering Douglas Sr.\u2019s expressed intentions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 38} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he provisions in a policy of insurance regulating the mode and manner of making a change of beneficiary are for the benefit of the insurance company and may be waived by it.\u201d <em>Atkinson v. Metro. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1926), 114 Ohio St. 109, 150 N.E. 748, at paragraph four of the syllabus; <em>Rindlaub v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 303, 25 O.O.2d 177, 194 N.E.2d 577, at paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cWhere an insured during his lifetime communicated to the insurer his clearly expressed intent to name certain new beneficiaries and the insurer has interpleaded and deposited the policy proceeds in court, such expressed intention of the insured will be determinative of the rights of contesting claimants to the policy proceeds, notwithstanding the absence of the written approval by the insurer required by the provisions of the policy.\u201d <em>Rindlaub, </em>175 Ohio St. 303, 25 O.O.2d 177, 194 N.E.2d 577, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Atkinson, </em>114 Ohio St. 109, 150 N.E. 748, at paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> {\u00b6 39} As interpreted by this court, the <em>Atkinson </em>and <em>Rindlaub </em>decisions stand for the following proposition: \u201c \u2018Where the insurance company interpleads in an action by a claimant to recover the proceeds of the policy, it waives compliance with its regulatory provisions and the action proceeds between the respective claimants to the proceeds of the policy uninfluenced by any rights or interests of the insurance company. * * * Where the facts, in an action in which the insurer interpleads * * * indicate that the insured communicated to the insurer, or to those who cared for such matters [i.e. the Plan Administrator], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>his clearly expressed intention to name a new beneficiary, such expressed intention alone is determinative of the rights of the contesting claimants, notwithstanding that the insured has not done everything reasonably possible under the circumstances to comply with the provisions of the policy as to the mode and manner of effectuating the change.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Am. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 6, 1996), 11th Dist. No. 96-T-5478, 1996 WL 760908, at *5, quoting <em>Donahue v. Carpenter </em>(Mar. 31, 1992), 6th Dist. No. 91WD057, 1992 WL 66564, at *14.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 40} Miller argues that the above analysis, sometimes referred to as the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d test, is not applicable, since the trial court never ruled on Minnesota Life\u2019s motion for interpleader and thus the insurance proceeds were never deposited with the court. In other words, Minnesota Life did not effectively waive the necessity of compliance with the terms of the policy with respect to changing the beneficiary. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 41} Minnesota Life unequivocally stated its position that after the dismissal of Mentor\u2019s cross-claims, it had no further interest in the dispute between the Kerns and Miller. Minnesota Life did not file a motion seeking summary judgment and did not oppose the motions filed by the Kerns or Miller. Although Minnesota Life did not deposit the proceeds of the policy with the trial court, neither had it paid the claim to either party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To hold that Minnesota Life did not waive compliance with the change of beneficiary conditions because the policy proceeds were not actually deposited with the trial court would be to frustrate Minnesota Life\u2019s expressed intent for technical reasons of no practical significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 42} Moreover, the case law does not absolutely require the deposit of the disputed funds. The syllabus of <em>Rindlaub </em>does speak of the \u201cinsurer * * * depositing] the policy proceeds in court.\u201d 175 Ohio St. 303, 25 O.O.2d 177, 194 N.E.2d 577, at paragraph two of the syllabus. The court in <em>Rindlaub, </em>however, was merely following the precedent established by <em>Atkinson, </em>which does not expressly mention the deposit of the proceeds. The discussion of the issue in <em>Atkinson </em>demonstrates that it is the insurer\u2019s intention that is material: \u201cThe fact that the [insurance] company files an interpleader indicates that it has no interest in the outcome of this case. If any condition in the policy was in any sense vital to the insurance company, it could only be determined in favor of the company by an answer making a defense against the claims of the party whose rights were questioned by it. * * * As the case now stands, therefore, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>purely a question of the respective rights of the two claimants, uninfluenced by any alleged interests of the insurance company.\u201d 114 Ohio St. at 120, 150 N.E. 748; cf. Annotation, <em>Change of Beneficiary in Old Line Insurance Policy as Affected by Failure to Comply with Requirements as to Manner of Making Change </em>(1951), 19 A.L.R.2d 5, 35, 1951 WL 7452, fn. 7 (\u201cIn these cases the insurer has waived its defense by interpleading <em>or has shoimi in some other way </em>that it has no further interest in the litigation between the parties\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 43} Finally, there is case law for the proposition that \u201cthe doctrine of substantial compliance is not limited to those cases in which the insurer, via an interpleader action, has deposited the insurance proceeds with the court.\u201d <em>Ogle v. Metro. Life Ins. </em>Co. (Dec. 23, 1994), 4th Dist. No. L-94-101, 1994 WL 709682, at *5; see, e.g., <em>Benton v. United Ins. Co. </em>(1959), 110 Ohio App. 151, 153-155, 12 O.O.2d 422, 159 N.E.2d 912 (applying the substantial-compliance test when the insurer had paid the death benefit prior to suit being filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 44} In the present case, Minnesota Life filed for leave to interplead and expressly disclaimed its interest in the outcome of the proceedings. Minnesota Life took no action inconsistent with this position. Thus, the trial court properly considered Douglas Sr.\u2019s intentions and compliance with the provisions of the Minnesota Life policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">(\u00b6 45} We take exception, however, to the test applied by the trial court. The court below stated: \u201cSubstantial compliance occurs when the facts clearly show: (1) the desire or intent of the insured to change the beneficiary; and (2) the insured did everything reasonably possible under the circumstances to carry out his intention to change the beneficiary.\u201d Cf. <em>Donahue, </em>1992 WL 66564 at *13.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 46} This part of Donahue\u2019s holding, however, does not apply to the present case. <em>Donahue </em>further held that \u201c[w]here the facts, in an action in which the insurer interpleads indicate that the insured communicated to the insurer, or those who cared for such matters, his clearly expressed intention to name a new beneficiary, such expressed intention alone is determinative of the rights of the contesting claimants, <em>notwithstanding that the insured has not done everything reasonably possible under the circumstances to comply with the provisions of the policy </em>as to the mode and manner of effectuating the change.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at *14. It was also this part of Donahue\u2019s holding that this court approved in <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 47} We must now consider whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Douglas Sr. \u201cduring his lifetime communicated to the insurer his clearly expressed intent to name certain new beneficiaries\u201d in the policy. <em>Rindlaub, </em>175 Ohio St. 303, 25 O.O.2d 177, 194 N.E.2d 577, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>{\u00b6 48} The evidence, as Miller acknowledges, demonstrates that Douglas Sr. was very familiar with the administrative procedures for designating a new beneficiary and had done so on four different occasions. Layman testified that, at some time prior to January 2006, Douglas Sr. told her that \u201che was changing the beneficiaries on his life insurance policy * * * and * * * was filling out the change of beneficiary form and then sending it through inter-office mail\u201d to designate his sons, Douglas Jr. and Richard, as beneficiaries. After his diagnosis with cancer, Douglas Sr. told Layman that the matter \u201cwas taken care of.\u201d Graham testified that Douglas Sr. said that everything he had was in order and that \u201ceverything will go to the boys.\u201d Construing this evidence most strongly in the Kerns\u2019 favor, it is reasonable to infer that Douglas Sr. took the appropriate steps to notify the plan administrator of his intention to change beneficiaries. Therefore, summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b6 49} The trial court found Douglas Sr.\u2019s conduct \u201cinexplicable\u201d in light of the fact \u201cthat he knew he was gravely ill and was going to die.\u201d Since neither Douglas Sr. nor Douglas Jr. checked the information on file with Mentor regarding the group life insurance policy, they failed to \u201cdo all [they] reasonably could have done under the circumstances to carry [Douglas Sr.\u2019s] intention into execution.\u201d As noted above, it was not necessary for Douglas Sr. to do everything reasonably possible under the circumstances. If, as Layman\u2019s testimony suggests, Douglas Sr. completed a change-of-beneficiary form as he had done on four prior occasions, he would have no reason to suspect that his intentions were not communicated to Minnesota Life or otherwise put into effect. The possibility of Douglas Sr.\u2019s form being misplaced by another Mentor employee is not so remote as to require judgment to be entered in Miller\u2019s favor. Cf. <em>Colonial Life &amp; Acc. v. Leitch, </em>9th Dist. No. 24263, 2008-Ohio-6616, 2008 WL 5244588, at \u00b6 14 (summary judgment reversed where there was evidence demonstrating that the insured \u201cexpressly stated his intention to remove Leitch as beneficiary, and that he had taken affirmative steps towards removing Leitch as beneficiary <em>* * * </em>[although he never completed the appropriate paperwork\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 50} Miller argues that Layman\u2019s affidavit is uncorroborated by documentary evidence, which one would expect in light of Douglas Sr.\u2019s purportedly \u201cmeticulous\u201d record-keeping. This argument goes to the weight of Layman\u2019s testimony. In a summary-judgment exercise, we do not weigh the evidence but must construe it in the Kerns\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 51} The Kerns\u2019 assignments of error are with merit and Miller\u2019s cross-assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">{\u00b6 52} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, granting summary judgment in Miller\u2019s favor and declaring her the beneficiary under the Minnesota Life group life policy, is reversed. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

In November 2007, Mentor submitted a notice-of-death form to Minnesota Life, identifying the \"Beneficiary as Recorded on Records of Employer\u201d as follows: \"Death proceeds to be interplead [sic] to the Lake County Court of Common Pleas in Case No. 07 CV 002477, as a dispute has arisen as to who is the beneficiary under this policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b492-6\">Colleen Mary O\u2019Toole, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AOa\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 53} I agree that the decision of the trial court should be reversed but reach that end by a different path than the majority. For this action, the relevant portion of the insurance certificate issued to Kern Sr. is that entitled \u201cDeath Benefit,\u201d at the subsection headed \u201cTo whom will we pay the death benefit?\u201d After explaining who a beneficiary is, there is a default provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cIf there is no eligible beneficiary, or if you do not name one, we will pay the death benefit to</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(2) your natural or legally adopted child (children) in equal shares, if living* *</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 57} There is evidence in the record that it is the customary business practice of group life insurers to accept a designation of beneficiary made under a prior policy, if a new one is not filed by the insured. However, custom and usage in the insurance industry cannot be used to alter the unambiguous terms of a written insurance contract. <em>White v. Bur. of Natl. Salesmen\u2019s Assns. </em>(Nov. 8, 1979), 8th Dist. No. 40121, 1979 WL 210682, at *6. I would find that the terms of the subject Minnesota Life policy unambiguously render Kern Sr.\u2019s children his beneficiaries under the default provision set forth above and that there is no need to look at industry custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">{\u00b6 58} I respectfully concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b492-13\">Timothy P. Cannon, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Azr\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">{\u00b6 59} I agree with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">{\u00b6 60} I write separately to point out that the most important issue in this case is to achieve, if possible, a just and equitable result based on what might be determined was the intention of the deceased. Public policy demands that a broad range of information should be admitted in an effort to make this determination. Guidance as to what the public policy should be is set forth in the state of Ohio through R.C. 5815.33, providing that a prior designation of a spouse in a life insurance policy is invalid if the marriage is terminated by a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>divorce, dissolution, or annulment. R.C. 5815.83(B)(1). The law will treat that spouse as predeceased. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">{\u00b6 61} In this case, we have a designation of Miller as the sole beneficiary, not in her name alone, but with the qualification of her status as \u201cfianc\u00e9[e].\u201d It is clear from the record this status was extinguished long before the death of the insured. What sense would our public policy make if we gave greater status to a former \u201cfianc\u00e9[e]\u201d than we do to a former spouse? I am well aware of the holding in other jurisdictions that indicate it is the name of the beneficiary, not the designated status, that controls. See <em>Congrove v. Ogan </em>(Mar. 26, 2002), 4th Dist. No. 01CA2639, 2002 WL 485793, at *7-12. However, under the facts of the instant case and in view of the clear public policy set forth in the statute, one wonders whether that analysis should be blindly followed in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 62} I agree with the majority that a factual question exists that would allow one to consider whether Douglas Sr. thought he had followed the necessary procedures to change the beneficiary. The trial court felt his failure to verify his beneficiaries was inexplicable. However, if the testimony of Ms. Layman is admitted through Evid.R. 804(B)(5) or some other exception and believed by a trier of fact, it is perfectly consistent with appellants\u2019 contention that Douglas Sr. expressed his intentions to the proper authority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
