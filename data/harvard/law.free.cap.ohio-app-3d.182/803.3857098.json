At the time, the pool was closed for the season and the adjoining clubhouse and parking lot were completely vacant. Appellant, an Eagle Scout aspirant and student near the top of his high school class, created a \u201cWorks bomb\u201d or \u201cbottle bomb\u201d comprised of a plastic water bottle, \u201cThe Works\u201d toilet bowl cleaner, and aluminum foil; a process he first witnessed while attending a Boy Scout bonfire. The combination of cleaner and foil creates a chemical reaction that when placed in a capped plastic bottle causes the bottle to rupture. Appellant combined the materials in the bottle and placed it in a grassy area adjacent to the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">{\u00b6 3} A couple who lived in the neighborhood were walking their dogs at the time and heard the loud noise caused by the rupturing bottle. They observed appellant and his friend get into a vehicle with a loud muffler and drive away from the location. The husband decided to inspect the area to determine the cause of the noise. He observed the mutilated bottle, but found no property damage. He also noticed a second water bottle on the premises that appeared to be about three-quarters full. He returned to his wife, who had remained on the sidewalk. The couple then continued on their walk. The wife stopped at a neighbor\u2019s house while the husband proceeded to their home to return the dogs. Approximately 15 minutes later, the wife decided to telephone the police while at the neighbor\u2019s home to report the incident. After dropping the dogs off, the husband returned to the neighbor\u2019s house and learned that his wife had called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>police. The husband then went to the pool area to offer any assistance needed by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">{\u00b6 4} An officer from the Springboro Police Department responded to the call. The husband provided a description of what he had observed, including a general description of the vehicle. The officer observed the same remnants of the plastic bottle and some pieces of aluminum foil. The fire department also responded to the scene to investigate the second water bottle, which was determined to contain only water.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">{\u00b6 5} As the officer processed the scene, he noticed a vehicle matching the description provided by the husband drive past the pool complex. The officer initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle driven by appellant\u2019s friend. Upon approaching the vehicle, the officer observed water bottles, a roll of aluminum foil, and a bottle of \u201cThe Works\u201d cleaning solution in the rear of the vehicle. The officer ordered the boys out of the car and began asking about the incident. Appellant admitted setting off the bottle. The boys were permitted to call their parents and were placed in the back seat of the squad car. Once appellant\u2019s parents arrived, appellant was asked to write a statement. Appellant claims that the officer threatened that if he did not write a statement, he would be taken to the juvenile detention center. The officer denies the allegation, claiming he never threatened appellant to provide a statement. Appellant provided the written statement, admitting that he had detonated the bottle but stating that he \u201cdidn\u2019t realize it was a crime.\u201d The statement also says, \u201cI had no intent to hurt or scare anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant was charged with illegal possession of a dangerous ordnance in violation of R.C. 2923.17(A) and inducing panic in violation of R.C. 2917.31(A)(3). Appellant filed motions to suppress and dismiss, which were overruled by the magistrate. Following trial, the magistrate adjudicated appellant delinquent on both charges. Appellant received a suspended commitment of six months with the Ohio Department of Youth Services, was placed on reporting probation for 90 days, and was required to make pro rata restitution. Appellant filed timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, which were overruled by the trial court. Appellant timely appeals, raising five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">{\u00b6 7} Assignment of error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">{\u00b6 9} Assignment of error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant combines his first and second assignments of error. In both assignments, appellant argues that the facts are insufficient to support a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>of delinquency because the \u201cbottle bomb\u201d at issue in this case is not a \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d as defined under R.C. 2923.17. Appellant directs the court to the various exceptions listed under \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d as provided in the Revised Code. Further, appellant argues that the state failed to prove that the bottle bomb in this case meets the elements of a \u201cdangerous ordnance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cDangerous ordnance\u201d includes \u201cany explosive device or incendiary device.\u201d R.C. 2923.11(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">I. DEFINITIONS AND RELATED EXCEPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">{\u00b6 13} The difficulty in analyzing whether a specific instrument constitutes a \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d results from the myriad of applicable definitions and layered exceptions listed separately in the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">\u201cExplosive Device\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">{\u00b6 14} An \u201cexplosive device\u201d is defined as \u201cany device designed or specially adapted to cause physical harm to persons or property by means of an explosion, and consisting of an explosive substance or agency and a means to detonate it. \u2018Explosive device\u2019 includes without limitation any bomb, any explosive demolition device, any blasting cap or detonator containing an explosive charge, and any pressure vessel that has been knowingly tampered with or arranged so as to explode.\u201d R.C. 2923.11(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Explosive</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">{\u00b6 15} The Revised Code further provides a definition for \u201cexplosive,\u201d which also contains exceptions. \u201cExplosive\u201d is defined as \u201cany chemical compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion. \u2018Explosive\u2019 includes all materials that have been classified as class A, class B, or class C explosives by the United States department of transportation in its regulations and includes, but is not limited to, dynamite, black powder, pellet powders, initiating explosives, blasting caps, electric blasting caps, safety fuses, fuse igniters, squibs, cordeau detonant fuses, instantaneous fuses, and igniter cords and igniters.\u201d R.C. 2923.11(M).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u2018Explosive\u2019 does not include \u2018fireworks,\u2019 as defined in section 3743.01 of the Revised Code, or any explosive that is not subject to regulation under the rules of the fire marshal adopted pursuant to section 3737.82 of the Revised Code.\u201d Id. The legislature has recently altered the definition and exceptions to \u201cexplosive\u201d under R.C. 2923.11(M), effective September 23, 2008. The revised version has changed the classifications of explosive materials from \u201cclass A, class B, or class C explosives\u201d to \u201cdivision 1.1, division 1.2, division 1.3, or division 1.4 explosives\u201d to reflect the revised federal classifications of explosive materials. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>{\u00b6 17} More significantly though, as will be explained later in the opinion, R.C. 2923.11(M) changed the exceptions of \u201cexplosive,\u201d declaring that \u201cexplosive\u201d does not include fireworks or any \u201csubstance or material otherwise meeting the definition of explosive set forth in this section that is manufactured, sold, possessed, transported, stored, or used in any activity described in section 3743.80 of the Revised Code, provided the activity is conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the provisions of section 3743.80 of the Revised Code and the rules of the fire marshal adopted pursuant to section 3737.82 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 18} Since the alleged offense occurred prior to the effective date and the legislature did not expressly provide for the retroactive application of the revised version of R.C. 2923.11(M), the former version is applicable to the case at bar. <em>Wilson v. AC &amp; S, Inc., </em>169 Ohio App.3d 720, 2006-Ohio-6704, 864 N.E.2d 682, \u00b6 69, citing <em>State v. Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 404, 410, 700 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"Amv\">Dangerous-Ordnance Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 19} In addition to the exclusions provided under the definition of \u201cexplosive,\u201d R.C. 2923.11(L)(6) also provides specific exclusions to \u201cdangerous ordnance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cDangerous ordnance\u201d does not include \u201c[a]ny device that is expressly excepted from the definition of a destructive device pursuant to the \u2018Gun Control Act of 1968/ 82 Stat. 1213, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(4), as amended, and regulations issued under that act.\u201d R.C. 2923.11(L)(6). Accordingly, to determine whether the bottle bomb in this case is a \u201cdangerous ordnance,\u201d the court must also examine the federal Gun Control Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">{\u00b6 21} The Gun Control Act of 1968 provides, \u201cThe term \u2018destructive device\u2019 <em>shall not include any device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon; </em>any device, although originally designed for use as a weapon, which is redesigned for use as a signaling, pyrotechnic, line throwing, safety, or similar device; surplus ordnance sold, loaned, or given by the Secretary of the Army pursuant to the provisions of section 4684(2), 4685, or 4686 of Title 10; or any other device which the Attorney General finds is not likely to be used as a weapon, is an antique, or is a rifle which the owner intends to use solely for sporting, recreational or cultural purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 921(a)(4), Title 18, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">{\u00b6 22} Various courts in Ohio, including this court, have previously examined the criminality of bottle bombs. As provided in R.C. 2923.11(H), to prove that the subject matter is an \u201cexplosive device\u201d and, therefore, a \u201cdangerous ord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>nance,\u201d the state must demonstrate three elements: the device must (1) contain an explosive substance or agency, (2) have a means to detonate, and (3) be \u201cdesigned or specifically adapted\u201d to cause physical harm to persons or property. Further, the device must not fall within one of the enumerated exclusions listed under the definitions of \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d or \u201cexplosive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b6 23} With regard to the first element, that the offending device contain an explosive substance or agency, R.C. 2923.11(M) defines \u201cexplosive\u201d as any \u201cmixture * * * the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion.\u201d The primary or common purpose in combining \u201cThe Works\u201d with foil in a capped plastic bottle is to cause the bottle to rupture.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">{\u00b6 24} Next, regarding the \u201cmeans to detonate\u201d requirement, in <em>In re Smith </em>(1995), Paulding App. No. 11-95-9, 1995 WL 737921, the Third District Court of Appeals concluded that a bottle bomb\u2019s \u201cmeans to detonate\u201d resulted from its function as a \u201cpressure vessel which has been knowingly tampered with or arranged as to explode.\u201d Id. at *2. Appellant disputes the conclusion that a bottle bomb constitutes a \u201cpressure vessel,\u201d noting that no actual definition for \u201cpressure vessel\u201d is provided under the weapons-control definitions. The only definition for \u201cpressure vessel\u201d in the Revised Code appears under the labor and industry provisions. Under the section for \u201cBoiler Definitions,\u201d \u201cpressure vessel\u201d is defined as \u201ca container for the containment of pressure, either internal or external. This pressure may be obtained from an external source or by the application of heat from a direct or indirect source or any combination thereof.\u201d R.C. 4104.01(G). It is unnecessary for this court to analyze this argument, due to our findings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">{\u00b625} In <em>In re P.G., </em>Brown App. No. CA2006-05-009, 2007-Ohio-3716, 2007 WL 2077147, this court held that a bottle bomb with the same chemical composition was a \u201cdangerous ordnance.\u201d Id. at \u00b642. In <em>P.G., </em>the defendant detonated the bomb in a trash can in his high school cafeteria. Id. at \u00b6 3. In determining that the bottle bomb was a \u201cdangerous ordnance,\u201d this court reviewed the definition of \u201cexplosive device\u201d and concluded, based upon P.G.\u2019s knowledge and belief of the chemical composition, that the bottle bomb was a dangerous ordnance. Id. at \u00b6 42. This court reasoned as follows: \u201c[AJppellant knowingly combined a cleaning agent and aluminum foil in an effort to create a chemical reaction that resulted in an explosion. Based on appellant\u2019s previous experience with these materials and the reaction that would result from combining them, appellant knew the explosion was likely to cause substantial damage to property and persons [when detonated in the school cafeteria trash can.]\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">{\u00b6 26} Similarly, in <em>In re Travis </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 684, 675 N.E.2d 36, the Tenth District Court of Appeals also found a bottle bomb to be a \u201cdangerous ordnance.\u201d The court reasoned, a \u201ctwo-liter soda pop bottle, by itself, will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>explode. However, when toilet bowl cleaner, containing hydrochloric acid, and aluminum foil are combined inside the bottle, and the bottle is sealed and shaken, the bottle has become a device designed or adapted to explode. Furthermore, the record indicates that the explosion of such a device can cause physical harm to persons or property. * * * If human beings are in close proximity when the device explodes, there is a high probability that they will be hurt.\u201d Id. at 690, 675 N.E.2d 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">{\u00b6 27} In contrast, in State <em>v. Dommer, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 404, 2005-Ohio-4073, 833 N.E.2d 796; and <em>State v. Young, </em>Stark App. No. 2005CA00009, 2005-Ohio-3925, 2005 WL 1802509, the Fifth Appellate District declined to find criminal culpability for bottle bombs based upon the explicit exclusions for \u201cexplosive\u201d in R.C. 2923.11(M). Both <em>Dommer </em>and <em>Young </em>involve the same incident, wherein the defendants created a bottle bomb and detonated it on a sidewalk near a school. Id. at \u00b6 2. The defendants were charged with illegally manufacturing or processing explosives under R.C. 2923.17(B); a different charge than illegal possession of a dangerous ordnance, but the same applicable definition of \u201cexplosive.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 9. The Fifth Appellate District concluded that the bottle bomb is not an \u201cexplosive\u201d due to the exclusions included in R.C. 2923.11(M). The court explained: \u201c[T]he term \u2018Explosive\u2019 does not include \u2018fireworks,\u2019 as defined in section 3743.01 of the Revised Code, or any explosive that is not subject to regulation under the rules of the fire marshal * * *. [The state] does not dispute that none of the materials in this case that were used to make the bottle bomb, including toilet bowl cleaner containing hydrochloric acid, are subject to the rules and regulations of the fire marshal. Nor, as noted by appellant, are they classified as an \u2018explosive\u2019 by the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Rather, the materials used in the case sub justice were all common household items readily available at a grocery store.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">{\u00b6 28} Statutory definitions and penalties must be \u201cstrictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d R.C. 2901.04(A); <em>Harrison v. Ohio </em>(1925), 112 Ohio St. 429, 147 N.E. 650; <em>State v. Maxson </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 190, 8 O.O.3d 173, 375 N.E.2d 781; <em>In re B.S. </em>(1998), 103 Ohio Misc.2d 34, 39, 725 N.E.2d 362. In attempting to regulate dangerous ordnances, the legislature has created a labyrinthine scheme of applicable definitions and exclusions that must be thoroughly examined to determine whether criminal liability applies to the device at issue. Accordingly, to constitute a dangerous ordnance, the bottle bomb must meet the criteria of \u201cexplosive device\u201d and not be exempted from the exclusions of \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d and \u201cexplosive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">{\u00b6 29} After review of the record, along with the applicable definitions and exclusions, we conclude that the bottle bomb in this case cannot be classified as a dangerous ordnance.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>{\u00b6 30} As described in <em>Dommer </em>and <em>Young, </em>the exclusions to \u201cexplosive\u201d are equally controlling in the case at bar. \u201cExplosive\u201d does not include (1) \u201cfireworks\u201d or (2) any explosive that is not subject to regulation by the fire marshal. R.C. 2923.11(M). Like <em>Dommer </em>and <em>Young, </em>there is no evidence in this case that the substances used in appellant\u2019s bottle bomb were subject to regulation by the fire marshal. <em>United States v. Oba </em>(C.A.9,1971), 448 F.2d 892, 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">{\u00b6 31} More significantly, though, the legislature recently changed the exclusions to \u201cexplosive,\u201d no longer exempting all substances not subject to regulation by the fire marshal. It is apparent that the legislature perceived problems with these statutory exclusions and corrected the ambiguities. However, as described above, the effective date of the revision occurred after the events of this case and, as a result, the exclusions applicable in <em>Dommer </em>and <em>Young </em>remain applicable in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">{\u00b6 32} Further, as an element of \u201cexplosive device,\u201d the legislature requires that the device be \u201cdesigned or specifically adapted\u201d to cause damage to persons or property. \u201cKnowingly\u201d is the culpable mental state required under R.C. 2923.17(A). <em>Travis, </em>110 Ohio App.3d at 690, 675 N.E.2d 36. It is insufficient to merely show that the device is capable of causing damage to persons or property. Rather, the definition requires that the device be actually \u201cdesigned or specifically adapted\u201d for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">{\u00b6 33} Similarly, the definition for \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d explicitly excludes any device that is expressly exempted from the definition of \u201cdestructive device\u201d in the federal Gun Control Act. R.C. 2923.11(L)(6). The Gun Control Act specifically excludes any device that is not designed or redesigned as a weapon. Section 921(a)(4), Title 18, U.S.Code. As a result, for the device to constitute a \u201cdangerous ordnance,\u201d it must be designed for use as a weapon. <em>In re Joseph S. </em>(2005), 13 NebApp. 636, 651, 698 N.W.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">{\u00b6 34} Under the facts of this case, there is no evidence to support a finding that appellant intended or knowingly used the bottle bomb as a weapon or constructed the bomb to cause damage to any person or property. The state in this case presented an expert who testified about the composition and the common use of bottle bombs such as the one used in the case at bar. The expert testified about the chemical reaction created by the mixture and the explosive effect. Further, the expert testified that these bombs are capable of causing damage, noting that bottle bombs are commonly used to detonate mail boxes and other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">{\u00b6 35} All of these theoretical uses cited by the state are irrelevant to the case at bar, since appellant did not use the bomb in this case in the manner the expert described. Rather, the facts of this case demonstrate that the bomb was neither used as a weapon nor \u201cdesigned or specifically adapted\u201d to cause damage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>persons or property. Appellant went to a remote location, constructing the device on a grassy area near the parking lot at a vacant pool complex. Moreover, no actual damage resulted from the detonation of the bomb. The exhibits introduced by the state of the location and the device reveal no damage to the surrounding area. Mere capability of causing damage does not create liability for possession of a dangerous ordnance, since the definitions and exclusions require the device to be \u201cdesigned or specifically adapted\u201d to cause damage and used as a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">{\u00b6 36} In <em>P.G., Travis, </em>and <em>Smith, </em>the courts never examined the various applicable exclusions to \u201cdangerous ordnances.\u201d Despite this, no conflict exists between this case and our previous decision in <em>P.G. </em>In <em>P.G., </em>evidence existed that the bottle bombs were \u201cweapons\u201d and \u201cdesigned or specifically adapted\u201d to cause harm to persons or property. Specifically, this court found that the defendant detonated the device in the garbage can in the crowded cafeteria at his high school. 2007-Ohio-3716, 2007 WL 2077147 at \u00b6 2. Similarly, no conflict exists with <em>Smith, </em>because Smith combined the ingredients, then threw and kicked the bottle bombs in a destructive manner. 1995 WL 737921 at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">{\u00b6 37} However, our conclusion departs from the Tenth Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>Travis. </em>In <em>Travis, </em>the defendant detonated a bottle bomb in a public park. 110 Ohio App.3d at 686, 675 N.E.2d 36. There are few details about the incident, the park\u2019s surroundings, or whether other individuals were present nearby. Yet the Tenth Appellate District found culpability while also concluding that Smith \u201cdid not intend to hurt anyone or cause any property damage.\u201d Id. at 690, 675 N.E.2d 36. The <em>Travis </em>court reasoned: \u201c[T]he record indicates that the explosion of such a device can cause physical harm to persons or property. * * * Appellant was aware that the device would explode and cause a loud noise. * * * It is hard to comprehend that appellant did not know what he was doing was wrong. Appellant knew the device would explode * * * when Officer Kerin asked appellant if he was the person who set off the \u2018bomb thing,\u2019 appellant responded that he was sorry. Appellant knew that he was doing something that he should not be doing. The fact that appellant did not fully comprehend the gravity of his actions is not violative of his rights.\u201d Id. at 690-691, 675 N.E.2d 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">{\u00b6 38} In affirming Smith\u2019s adjudication, the Tenth Appellate District disregarded the actual elements of the offense. Instead, the court focused upon the capability of bottle bombs, the general notion that detonating a bottle bomb is \u201cwrong,\u201d and Smith\u2019s general admission that the act was \u201cwrong,\u201d rather than examining whether the bomb was \u201cdesigned or specifically adapted\u201d to cause damage and despite the court\u2019s conclusion that Smith did not use the bomb in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Simply because an act is \u201cwrong,\u201d does not automatically result in culpability; the act must still satisfy the elements of the crime. R.C. 2901.03; R. C. 2901.21(A). Appellant in this case knew the device would rupture and create a loud noise, based upon previous experience observing the creation of a \u201cWorks bomb.\u201d In his written statement, appellant acknowledged that he had made a \u201cmistake\u201d and was \u201csorry\u201d for detonating the bottle. It was wrong for appellant to detonate the bottle bomb, but the evidence does not support a delinquency adjudication for possession of a dangerous ordnance.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">(\u00b6 40} We recognize the societal concerns that bombs present in today\u2019s world. A bottle bomb can be a dangerous ordnance, as in <em>P.G., </em>when it is detonated for destructive purposes and as a weapon. Appellant\u2019s actions in this case may constitute a different criminal violation, but it does not satisfy the definition of a \u201cdangerous ordnance.\u201d If the legislature wished to outlaw or classify all bottle bombs as dangerous ordnances, as done in other states, it could have explicitly done so or removed the various exceptions. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. 12301(a)(6); S. C.Code Ann. 16-8-10; Tenn.Code Ann. 39-17-1301(3)(B)(ii); Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. 13-3101(A)(7). In contrast, see Indiana Code Ann. 35-47.5-2-4 and Neb. Rev.Stat. 28-1213(7)(b), which create statutory schemes similar to Ohio\u2019s, excluding devices not classified as weapons. Yet the Ohio legislature has refused to do so and instead defines \u201cdangerous ordnances\u201d as devices designed or specifically adapted to cause injury or damage and exempts devices that are not used as weapons; creating, at most, an ambiguity in this case. See <em>Joseph S., </em>13 Neb.App. 636, 698 N.W.2d 212. And if such ambiguity exists, it must be strictly construed against the state. R.C. 2901.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">(\u00b6 41} Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">{\u00b6 42} Assignment of error No. 5:</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s finding that appellant violated R.C. 2923.17(A) and R.C. 2917.31(A)(3) is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">{\u00b6 44} Under his fifth assignment of error, appellant challenges the weight of the evidence for both charges. Having already found that the evidence in this case does not support the delinquency finding for unlawful possession of a dangerous ordnance, we need only address appellant\u2019s argument in the context of the inducing-panic charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant was charged with inducing panic under R.C. 2917.31(A)(3), which provides, \u201cNo person shall cause the evacuation of any public place, or otherwise cause serious public inconvenience or alarm, by * * * committing any offense, with reckless disregard of the likelihood that its commission will cause serious public inconvenience or alarm.\u201d R.C. 2917.31(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Having found that no predicate offense was committed by appellant, the delinquency finding for inducing panic is against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>State v.

The majority has set forth a very thorough and sound analysis of the primary issue in this case, that is, whether a \u201cbottle bomb\u201d as used by appellant falls within the intended scope of the statutory definitions of \u201cdangerous ordnance,\u201d \u201cexplosive device,\u201d and \u201cexplosive.\u201d See R.C. 2923.11(K), (H), and (M), respectively. Although I believe, especially following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, that the legislative intent and purpose behind enacting these statutes would certainly encompass an explosive device such as the one used in this case, that intent and purpose is clearly lost in the statutory ambiguities outlined in the majority\u2019s opinion. Thus, until the legislature chooses to directly address these ambiguities and unequivocally make its intent clear, we are unfortunately stuck with the current, confusing statutory scheme.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
