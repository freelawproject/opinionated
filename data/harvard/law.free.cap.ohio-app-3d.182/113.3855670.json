Rayburn, appeals the judgment of the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas, affirming the decision of appellee, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cODJFS\u201d), requiring Rayburn to pay $876 per month for his medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">{\u00b6 2} In 1990, Michael Rayburn was seriously injured in a diving accident that rendered him a paraplegic. He began receiving assistance under the home- and community-based services (\u201cHCBS\u201d) waiver program, which is a Medicaid program administered through the Fayette County Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cFCDJFS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">{\u00b6 3} In 1992, Rayburn, as settlement for his injuries, began receiving payments from an annuity that originally were $700 per month for life, with payments guaranteed for 30 years, compounded annually at three percent. The annuity named Rayburn as the annuitant, but ownership of the annuity was retained by the insurance company that issued it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As of 2007, the annuity pays Rayburn $1,090.59 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On July 3, 2007, the FCDJFS proposed increasing Rayburn\u2019s patient liability under the HCBS waiver program from $0 to $876 per month, after learning of his monthly annuity payment. Rayburn requested a state hearing on the proposed increase with the ODJFS. On August 6, 2007, the state hearing officer found the proposed increase to be correct. Rayburn filed an administrative appeal of the state hearing officer\u2019s decision with the ODJFS, which affirmed the state hearing officer, and then appealed the ODJFS\u2019s decision to the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas, which affirmed the ODJFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">{\u00b6 5} Rayburn now appeals the decision of the common pleas court and assigns the following as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error as a matter of law in affirming the decision of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, essentially depriving appellant from participating in home care based services administered through the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 7} Rayburn argues that the common pleas court erred as a matter of law in affirming the ODJFS\u2019s decision to increase his patient liability for receiving Medicaid assistance from $0 to $876 per month, after learning of his monthly annuity payment. Specifically, he asserts that \u201cthe annuity payment is not a countable resource, nor is it unearned income and was not payable to him for lost wages or pain and suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 8} In appeals brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 119, a common pleas court reviews the order of the administrative agency to determine whether it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>Castle v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 74, 2006-Ohio-3702, 858 N.E.2d 843, \u00b6 7. When reviewing the common pleas court\u2019s decision as to whether an administrative order is supported by such evidence, an appellate court determines whether the common pleas court abused its discretion. Id. However, on questions of law, an appellate court\u2019s review is plenary. Id. at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c \u2018Patient liability\u2019 means the individual\u2019s financial obligation toward the medical cost of care.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-24(B)(22). The procedure for determining an individual\u2019s patient liability is set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1\u2014 39-24(C)(2), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe administrative agency must determine the individual\u2019s patient liability by utilizing the following procedure, in sequence, subsequent to notification of an appropriate level of care, and, if applicable, HCBS waiver agency approval * * *:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(a) Total all income, earned and unearned, of the individual, without applying any exemptions or disregards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The provisions in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-24(C)(2)(b) to (C)(2)(g) provide a number of items that are exempted or disregarded when determining the individual\u2019s total income, including \u201cthe special individual maintenance needs allowance.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 39\u201424(C)(2)(c)(iii). After these exemptions or disregards are subtracted from the total income, the remainder is the individual\u2019s monthly patient liability. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39~24(C)(2)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 13} The FCDJFS, the ODJFS, and the common pleas court found that Rayburn receives a total monthly income of $2,091 per month. This amount consists of the $1,090.59 he receives from his monthly annuity payment, which the administrative agencies and the common pleas court found to be \u201cunearned income\u201d pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 39\u201422.8(C)(4)(g)(i), and the $1,001 per month he receives in Social Security (RSDI) benefits. The agencies and the common pleas court found Rayburn\u2019s special individual maintenance needs allowance to be $1,215. They subtracted this amount from his total monthly income of $2,091 and determined Rayburn\u2019s monthly patient liability to be $876.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 14} The initial question before us is whether the monthly annuity payment that Rayburn receives is, in fact, \u201cunearned income,\u201d as the administrative agencies and the common pleas court found, and therefore, a countable resource for purposes of determining his monthly patient liability under Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-24(0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 15} Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-22.8(0(4) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(g) Any annuity provided for under paragraphs (C)(4)(a) to (C)(4)(k) of this rule that has not been annuitized shall be considered an available resource when completing a resource assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(i) An annuity that is making payments in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs (C)(4)(a) to (C)(4)(k) of this rule, at the time of application for Medicaid, will not be considered an available resource. <em>However, any payments will be considered unearned income to the annuitant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">{\u00b6 18} Under its plain terms, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(g)(i) applies to annuities that are \u201cmaking payments in accordance with the provisions\u201d in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(a) to (C)(4)(k). Therefore, in order for Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 39\u201422.8(C)(4)(g)(i) to apply in this case, Rayburn\u2019s annuity must be \u201cmaking payments in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs (C)(4)(a) to (C)(4)(k) of [Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-22.8].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">{\u00b6 19} While the FCDJFS, the ODJFS, and the common pleas court found that Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(g)(i) applies in this case, they failed to identify the specific provision in paragraphs (C)(4)(a) to (C)(4)(k) of Ohio Adm. Code 5101:1-39-22.8, under which Rayburn\u2019s annuity was supposedly making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>payments. An examination of the provisions in those paragraphs shows that Rayburn\u2019s annuity was not making payments in accordance with any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 20} For instance, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(a) applies to annuities that name the applicant for Medicaid benefits as \u201cthe owner and annuitant.\u201d While Rayburn\u2019s annuity names Rayburn as the annuitant, it does not name him as the owner. Instead, ownership of the annuity was retained by the insurance company that issued it and is now retained by that company\u2019s successor. Thus, paragraph (C)(4)(a) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 21} The provisions in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(b) to (C)(4)(f) apply in situations where an annuity is purchased for the benefit of the applicant\u2019s spouse or for the benefit of both spouses. However, there is no evidence in the record showing that Rayburn has a spouse, and therefore, none of these provisions apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 22} Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(h) applies to annuities that contain \u201ca balloon payment provision.\u201d Rayburn\u2019s annuity does not contain such a provision. Therefore, paragraph (C)(4)(h) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">{\u00b6 23} Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(i) applies to \u201c[pjrivate annuity agreements * * * not purchased from a bank, insurance company, or other person or entity engaged in the business of the sale of commercial annuities to the public.\u201d Rayburn\u2019s annuity was purchased from an insurance company that was engaged in the sale of commercial annuities to the public. Therefore, paragraph (C)(4)\u00ae does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">{\u00b6 24} Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 39\u201422.8(C)(4)(j) and (C)(4)(k) are related to the issue of improper transfers. Paragraph (C)(4)(j) provides the dates on which improper transfers are considered to have occurred for purposes of Ohio Adm. Code 5101:1-39-22.8. However, the FCDJFS, the ODJFS, and the common pleas court did not find that an improper transfer occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">{\u00b6 25} Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(k) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cIf the applicant/recipient or the community spouse is the annuitant of an annuity in which neither individual, at any time, held an ownership interest in the funds used to establish [the annuity,]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the annuity will not result in an improper transfer if the owner of the annuity fails to make the payments available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>{\u00b6 27} As stated, Rayburn is named as the annuitant under the annuity but not its owner. However, even if it is assumed that Rayburn never held, at any time, an ownership interest in the funds used to establish the annuity, the evidence shows that the owner of the annuity made the annuity payments available to Rayburn. Therefore, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 39\u201422.8(C)(4)(k) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">{\u00b6 28} In light of the foregoing, Rayburn\u2019s annuity is not governed by Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 39\u201422.8(C)(4)(g)(i) since it is not \u201c[a]n annuity that is making payments in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs (C)(4)(a) to (C)(4)(k) of [Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-22.8].\u201d Therefore, the payments Rayburn receives from that annuity cannot be considered unearned income under Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(g)(i). The common pleas court erred as a matter of law in concluding otherwise. See <em>Castle, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 74, 2006-Ohio-3702, 858 N.E.2d 843, at \u00b6 8. However, our analysis does not end here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 29} As stated, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-22.8(C)(4)(k) provides that if an applicant is the annuitant of an annuity in which he did not hold, at any time, an ownership interest in the funds used to establish the annuity, the annuity \u201cwill not result in an improper transfer if the owner of the annuity fails to make the payments available.\u201d While this provision does not apply in this case because the annuity\u2019s owner did not fail to make payments from the annuity available, the provision strongly suggests that such an annuity will constitute an improper transfer where the annuity\u2019s owner does make the payments available. Because the owner of Rayburn\u2019s annuity made payments from the annuity available to Rayburn, it is likely that the creation of the annuity constituted an improper transfer. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 30} Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-07 governs \u201cthe treatment of a transfer of resources,\u201d including \u201cimproper transfers.\u201d Id. at paragraphs (A) and (B)(5). On remand, it must be determined whether Rayburn\u2019s annuity does in fact constitute an \u201cimproper transfer\u201d as defined in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-07(B)(5) and, if so, whether Rayburn is subject to \u201ca restricted Medicaid coverage period.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-07(B)(10) and (I)(l). If it is determined that a restricted Medicaid coverage period applies, the restricted Medicaid coverage period must be calculated in accordance with Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 39\u201407(J)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 31} Rayburn\u2019s assignment of error is sustained to the extent indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">{\u00b6 32} The judgment of the common pleas court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-10\">Powell and Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-15\">.
