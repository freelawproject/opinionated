Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">{\u00b6 1} In this real estate foreclosure action, plaintiff-appellant Sky Bank,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the original mortgagee, appeals from an order of the Cuyahoga County Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Common Pleas that (1) vacated the court\u2019s previous decree confirming the sheriffs sale of the property to intervenor-appellee Mijero, Inc., (2) set aside the sale, and (3) denied the bank\u2019s R.C. 2329.30 motion for a contempt citation against Mijero.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">{\u00b6 2} The bank presents two assignments of error. First, the bank argues that since the trial court initially denied Mijero\u2019s motion to vacate the order confirming the sale of the property, the court lacked jurisdiction to reverse that decision. Second, the bank argues that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to hold Mijero in contempt for refusing to complete its purchase of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 3} Upon a review of the record, this court agrees that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to reverse its original decision to deny Mijero\u2019s motion to vacate the order confirming the sale. Consequently, the court abused its discretion in denying the bank\u2019s motion for a contempt citation against Mijero. The order from which the bank appeals is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 4} The bank brought this action in May 2007 seeking foreclosure on a mortgage owed by defendants Joseph and Patricia Mamone with respect to an apartment building located in Lakewood, Ohio. After all the necessary parties had been served with the complaint, the trial court appointed a receiver to manage the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 5} The receiver filed his first report with the trial court in June 2007, noting that the inventory of the premises consisted of a \u201ctwenty (20) unit apartment building.\u201d The receiver informed the court that he was collecting the tenants\u2019 rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 6} In October 2007, the bank filed a motion for summary judgment on its complaint. The bank supported its motion with evidence that demonstrated that due to the Mamones\u2019 default on the cognovit note with respect to the property, it had obtained a judgment in the amount of $927,602.75 against them, and that the property should be sold to pay the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 7} In November 2007, the trial court granted summary judgment to the bank on its complaint, and issued a decree of foreclosure with respect to \u201cPermanent Parcel No. 312-12-006.\u201d In January 2008, the county sheriff secured an appraisal of the property. The independent appraisal valued the property at $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">{\u00b6 8} The sheriff duly issued notice that the sale of the property would be held on March 3, 2008. The notice set forth the specifics of the recorded deed, set forth the address, stated that the \u201cabove described property is further known as a brick apartment with five car garage,\u201d and indicated the appraised value of the parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>{\u00b6 9} On March 3, 2008, the sheriff issued an order of sale of the property to Mijero; Mijero was the \u201chighest and best bidder\u201d at $750,000. The trial court confirmed the sale in an order issued on March 14, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 10} Approximately one month later, Mijero filed a motion to intervene in the action. Mijero made this request \u201cin order to submit a Motion to Vacate Judicial Sale,\u201d attaching a copy of that document, and, concomitantly, filing the additional motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 11} In its motion to vacate, Mijero sought to rescind its purchase \u201con the grounds that there was a mistake regarding the identity of the property.\u201d Mijero asserted that its agent had inspected the property prior to the sale and \u201cbelieved that two connected buildings were one building and that all 39 rental suites within the two connected buildings were included in the sale.\u201d Mijero claimed that its agent \u201chad no intention to bid on a building with 20 suites.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 12} Mijero attached to this motion the affidavit of Michael Zemba, its agent. Zemba acknowledged that he was the successful bidder on Mijero\u2019s behalf for the property located at 15119 Lake Avenue, Lakewood, Ohio, and further stated only that the \u201cfacts in the attached Motion to Vacate Judicial Sale and supporting brief [were] true to the best of [his] knowledge and belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 13} The bank responded to Mijero\u2019s motion to vacate with a brief in opposition, combined with a motion for a contempt hearing pursuant to R.C. 2329.30.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bank argued that Mijero provided no adequate basis to vacate the order of sale, since by its own admission, the \u201cmistake\u201d occurred as a result of its own lack of \u201cdue diligence.\u201d The bank requested the trial court to conduct a hearing for Mijero to \u201cexplain why it should not be held in contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 14} On April 22, 2008, the trial court issued an order that granted Mijero\u2019s motion to intervene in the action but denied Mijero\u2019s motion to vacate the judicial sale of the property. The same journal entry also scheduled a hearing to be held on June 19, 2008, on the bank\u2019s contempt motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">{\u00b6 15} On June 20, 2008, the trial court issued the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cMotion for contempt is denied; PT/SC held; the court finds there was no meeting of the minds on the number of units to be sold. The buyer has agreed to pay the costs of the sale; all other monies ($10,000 deposit, less costs of sale) are ordered to be returned by the sheriff to the buyer Mijero, Inc. * * * Sale is vacated, decree of confirmation is vacated, sheriff is ordered to return the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>order of sale unexecuted and the clerk is immediately ordered to issue an alias order of sale without re-appraisal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 17} The bank filed its notice of appeal from the foregoing order. It presents two assignments of error for review, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">I. The trial court\u2019s June 20, 2008 <em>Sua Sponte </em>decision vacating the judicial sale of the property to Mijero, Inc. was void as the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter such order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkF\">II. The trial court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s motion for contempt pursuant to R.C. 2329.30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">{\u00b6 18} The bank first argues that once the trial court denied Mijero\u2019s motion to vacate the order of sale on April 22, 2008, the court lacked authority to revisit that decision. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2329.27 provides the statutory authority for a judicial sale of property taken in execution of a judgment and states that if the court \u201centers its order confirming the sale * * *, the order shall have <em>both of the following effects-.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(a) The order shall be deemed to constitute a judicial finding * * *:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(i) That the sale * * * complied with * * * written notice requirements of division (A)(1)(a) of section 2329.26 * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(ii) That all parties entitled to notice under division (A)(1)(a) of section 2329.26 * * * received adequate notice of the date, time, and place of the sale</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(b) The order bars the filing of any further motions to set aside the sale * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-17\">{\u00b6 24} The statute, therefore, provides that an order confirming the sale, although a phase of the entire foreclosure action, is itself a final, appealable order. <em>Triple F Invests., Inc. v. Pacific Fin. Servs., Inc. </em>(June 2, 2001), Portage App. No. 2000-P-0090, 2001 WL 589343. \u201cOnce an order of sale and decree of foreclosure is filed, a creditor may file a praecipe for an order directing the sheriff to sell the property. This second phase of the proceedings is viewed as a separate and distinct action seeking enforcement of an order of sale and decree of foreclosure. [Citation omitted.] The appraisal of the foreclosed property, the sheriffs sale, and the confirmation of that sale [all] have been described as special proceedings to enforce an order of sale and decree of foreclosure.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-18\">{\u00b6 25} In making this separate decision to confirm the sheriffs sale of the property, the trial court must \u201cdetermine that all the requirements of the Revised Code have been met.\u201d <em>Smith v. Najjar, </em>163 Ohio App.3d 208, 2005-Ohio-4720, 837 N.E.2d 419, \u00b6 10. As the court noted, \u201cThe distinction is not merely academic, but has important procedural implications. An order of foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and sale is a final appealable order, * * * and the <em>later order confirming the sale </em>* * * <em>is a second, separate, final appealable order.\u201d </em>Id. at \u00b6 11; cf. <em>Gaul v. Leeper </em>(July 15,1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 63222, 1993 WL 266818.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">{\u00b6 26} An order of confirmation thus becomes \u201cdispositive as to <em>the propriety of the sale </em>and the sale confirmation procedures <em>unless properly vacated by the trial court pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Triple F Invests., </em>supra. This court too has determined that a trial court may review an order confirming a sheriffs sale only if its jurisdiction is invoked by means of Civ.R. 60(B). <em>Rokakis v. Snipes </em>(Mar. 4, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 73938, 1999 WL 126943.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"> {\u00b6 27} In order to prevail on a Civ.R. 60(B) motion, the movant must demonstrate that (1) the party has a meritorious defense or claim to present if relief is granted, (2) the party is entitled to relief on one of the grounds set forth in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5), and (3) the motion is timely. <em>Kest v. Leasor, </em>Lucas App. No. L-06-1200, 2007-Ohio-1871, 2007 WL 1165429, \u00b6 19, citing <em>GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC Industries </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113. A trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying the motion if one of the requirements is not met. <em>Rose Chevrolet v. Adams </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 17, 520 N.E.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 28} Mijero\u2019s motion failed all three requirements. The sheriffs notice contained the measurements of the property as described in the deed filed in the county recorder\u2019s office. The file of this case, also a public record, contained the property\u2019s permanent parcel number along with documents that indicated the property consisted of a 20-unit apartment building. Mijero\u2019s agent admitted that he had inspected the property prior to submitting the bid and that no one made any false representations as to its size.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, Mijero presented no evidence of a mutual \u201cmistake,\u201d or \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d and did not present a valid defense against the requirement that it proceed with its purchase. <em>Fed. Home Loan Mtge. Corp. v. Langdon, </em>Hocking App. No. 07AP12, 2008-Ohio-776, 2008 WL 501599; <em>Commercial Natl. Bank v. Zeis </em>(Oct. 13, 1987), Seneca App. No. 13-86-3, 1987 WL 18219; <em>Schneider v. Schneider </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 134, 8 OBR 190, 456 N.E.2d 509; cf. <em>Soc. Natl. Bank v. Wolff </em>(Apr. 26, 1991), Sandusky App. No. S-90-13, 1991 WL 64865. Mijero also neglected to explain why it waited a month to file its motion to vacate the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">{\u00b6 30} In any event, although the trial court provided no analysis for its denial of Mijero\u2019s motion to vacate the order of sale in its April 22, 2008 judgment entry, that entry constituted a final order. <em>Kest v. Leasor, </em>2007-Ohio-1871, 2007 WL 1165429; cf. <em>Culkar v. Fanter </em>(Dec. 27, 1984), Cuyahoga App. No. 48151, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>1984 WL 6394. This court recently observed that \u201c[a]s a general rule, a trial court has no authority to vacate or modify its final orders sua sponte.\u201d <em>N. Shore Auto Financing v. Valentine, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90686, 2008-Ohio-4611, 2008 WL 4183327, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 31} Consequently, the bank\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 32} The bank further argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a contempt citation against Mijero. This argument also has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 33} The record of this case reflects that once it ruled on Mijero\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion, the trial court simply set the case for a hearing on the bank\u2019s R.C. 2329.30 motion. A contempt hearing is not, as Mijero suggests, a \u201cclaim\u201d but a collateral proceeding. <em>State ex rel. Special Prosecutors v. Judges, Court of Common Pleas </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 94, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">{\u00b6 34} The bank brought its motion pursuant to the statute. Since R.C. 2329.30 states that the trial court \u201cshall\u201d punish the purchaser \u201cas for contempt\u201d for failing to pay, the trial court was mandated to consider the matter; this, however, did not grant the trial court license to act as its own appellate court. <em>Triple F Invests.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">{\u00b6 35} No transcript of the hearing on the bank\u2019s R.C. 2329.30 motion is included in the record on appeal. Ordinarily, the lack of a transcript precludes appellate review of the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action. Id. In this case, however, in view of the fact that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider its final order of April 22, 2008, and, indeed, lacked any justification for its order, its decision to deny the bank\u2019s motion at the hearing held on that motion necessarily constitutes an abuse of its discretion. <em>Hopkins v. Oliphant </em>(1917), 27 Ohio Decisions 643, 1917 WL 1792.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, the bank\u2019s second assignment of error also is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">{\u00b6 37} The order from which the bank appeals is reversed in its entirety, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"A4\">Cooney, A.J., and Jones, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-19\">.
