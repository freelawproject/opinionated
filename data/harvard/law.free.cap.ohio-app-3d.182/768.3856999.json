The jury\u2019s verdict of $1,705,300 was reduced by the 22 percent comparative negligence assigned to Mrs. Segedy. Following the entry of judgment on the verdict, the trial court granted Netzley\u2019s motion for a new trial based on juror confusion regarding the interrogatory and verdict forms and the jury\u2019s reference to some excluded evidence regarding the length of the surgery. Mr. Segedy appealed the new-trial order and the comparative-negligence verdict. Netzley cross-appealed the new-trial order, arguing that judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been entered in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>{\u00b6 2} The judgment of the trial court is reversed because (1) the jury\u2019s interrogatory responses were consistent with the general verdict form following a reconciliation instruction that did not taint the verdict, and (2) references to the length of the surgery did not deprive Netzley of a fan- trial. The trial court incorrectly denied Mr. Segedy\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict regarding contributory patient negligence because, based on the evidence, reasonable minds could only conclude that any lack of care by Mrs. Segedy in smoking or failing to follow her physicians\u2019 advice did not proximately cause her death. The trial court correctly denied Netzley\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because reasonable minds could have differed regarding whether Netzley\u2019s actions proximately caused Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">{\u00b6 3} At 30 years of age, Christina Segedy suffered from heart and lung problems likely caused by rheumatic fever. In June 2001, she saw Dr. Islam Ibrahim, a pulmonologist, who diagnosed mitral stenosis, meaning that her mitral valve was restricting the flow of blood through her heart. On Friday, September 21, 2001, Mrs. Segedy\u2019s cardiologist performed a heart catheterization to further evaluate the problem. The test revealed unobstructed coronary arteries, but critical mitral stenosis. The cardiologist called Netzley, a cardiothoracic surgeon, for a consult. Netzley scheduled mitral-valve-replacement surgery for Monday, September 24, 2001. Although the cardiologist advised Mrs. Segedy to remain in the hospital over the weekend, she signed herself out, explaining that she wanted to see her children before the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">{\u00b6 4} On Monday morning, Netzley performed mitral-valve-replacement surgery. The procedure required that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s heart be stopped and clamped off temporarily while a machine did the work of her heart and lungs. When the procedure was finished, Netzley determined that Mrs. Segedy was stable and transferred her to the intensive-care unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">{\u00b6 5} Soon nurses realized that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s heart was not pumping well and, along with Netzley, began a series of measures designed to improve heart function. They administered various medications and fluids and ran tests. Netzley re-opened Mrs. Segedy\u2019s chest and tried open heart massage. He also inserted a balloon pump to try to improve blood flow. After several hours, Netzley returned Mrs. Segedy to the operating room and placed her on a ventricular-assist device. After more tests, doctors informed Mr. Segedy that his wife was brain dead. Mrs. Segedy was removed from life support on September 28, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">{\u00b6 6} Mrs. Segedy\u2019s husband, Ian Segedy, sued Netzley and his corporation, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery of Akron, Inc., as well as Mrs. Segedy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>pulmonologist, Dr. Ibrahim, and his corporation, Summit Pulmonary &amp; Internal Medicine Inc., for medical negligence. At trial, Mr. Segedy claimed that Ibrahim had violated the standard of care by failing to properly complete or reschedule a bronchoscopy, proximately causing Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death through a delay in diagnosis. Mr. Segedy accused Netzley of violating the standard of care by transferring Mrs. Segedy from the operating room too soon after surgery and by failing to immediately return her to the operating room for appropriate treatment thereafter, proximately causing her death. The jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Ibrahim and his corporation. The trial court entered judgment on that verdict, and it was not appealed. Thus, Ibrahim is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">{\u00b6 7} The jury also returned a general verdict for Mr. Segedy and against Netzley in the amount of $1,755,300. It was signed by only six jurors, one of whom had not signed the liability interrogatories supporting the verdict. After twice returning for further deliberations, the jury returned the final time with a reduced verdict against Netzley. The final verdict was signed by the same six jurors who had signed the liability and damages interrogatories. All eight of the jurors had also signed an interrogatory assigning 22 percent comparative negligence to Mrs. Segedy. The trial court denied Netzley\u2019s motion for a mistrial and entered judgment on the verdict for plaintiff, reduced by 22 percent for comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">{\u00b6 8} One month later, the trial court denied Netzley\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but granted his motion for a new trial based on juror confusion and a response to an interrogatory referencing some evidence that had been excluded. Mr. Segedy appealed, arguing that a new trial was not warranted and that the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict regarding the assignment of comparative negligence. He also argued that the jury\u2019s comparative-negligence finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Netzley appealed, arguing that his directed-verdict motions and motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted because Mr. Segedy failed to prove proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">PROXIMATE CAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">{\u00b6 9} Netzley\u2019s first and third assignments of error are that the trial court incorrectly failed to direct a verdict in his favor based on Mr. Segedy\u2019s failure to prove proximate cause. His second assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly denied his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the same basis. Netzley has argued that Mr. Segedy\u2019s expert recanted his testimony during cross-examination and, therefore, failed to contradict Netzley\u2019s experts\u2019 assertion that, by the time Netzley had met her, Mrs. Segedy was too sick to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>save. Mr. Segedy has responded that his expert testified that Netzley\u2019s actions following the surgery were the proximate cause of Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death and that he did not recant that testimony during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">{\u00b6 10} An appellate court\u2019s review of the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is identical to its review of the denial of a motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence. <em>Levey &amp; Co. v. Oravecz, </em>9th Dist. No. 21768, 2004-Ohio-3418, 2004 WL 1465635, at \u00b6 6. An appellate court\u2019s review of the denial of either motion is de novo. Id. Either motion requires the court to construe the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party and determine whether, based on the evidence, reasonable minds could come to different conclusions regarding any determinative issue. Civ.R. 50(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">{\u00b6 11} In order to prove medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant breached the standard of care owed to the plaintiff and that the breach proximately caused an injury. <em>Bruni v. Tatsumi </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 127, 75 O.O.2d 184, 346 N.E.2d 673, paragraph one of the syllabus. Netzley\u2019s motion challenged Mr. Segedy\u2019s proof of proximate cause. A medical-malpractice claim requires the plaintiff to \u201cprove causation through medical expert testimony in terms of probability to establish that the injury was, more likely than not, caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Ohio Permanente Med. Group, Inc. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 483, 485, 668 N.E.2d 480. In order to prove his wrongful-death claim based on medical negligence, Mr. Segedy had the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the doctor deviated from the applicable standard of care in treating Mrs. Segedy and that the deviation more likely than not caused her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">SHEARS\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">{\u00b6 12} Mr. Segedy\u2019s expert cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Larry Shears, testified that, in his opinion, Netzley deviated from the standard of care after the surgery by sending Mrs. Segedy out of the operating room before she was stable. According to Shears, \u201c[Mrs. Segedy] should never have left [the operating room],\u201d and when she started showing signs that her heart function was not improving with medicine, \u201cshe should have immediately gone back to the operating room\u201d where a ventricular assist device could have been used to \u201cact[ ] as a motor for the heart.\u201d Shears testified that he believed Netzley\u2019s delay in returning her to the operating room caused her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">{\u00b6 13} According to Shears, \u201c[everything in [her] chart suggests she was not doing well [after surgery].\u201d After quickly taking steps to try to improve her heart function, the nurses paged Netzley. According to Shears, within 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>minutes of Mrs. Segedy\u2019s arrival in the intensive-care unit after the surgery, her test results revealed that she was \u201cready to arrest,\u201d that is, her heart was very close to stopping. Shears said that at that point, \u201cyou don\u2019t have any time to mess around, you need to help her out.\u201d He was critical of Netzley for waiting another three hours before returning Mrs. Segedy to the operating room. Shears testified on direct examination at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-4\">Q. Do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that that delay caused any decrease in her likelihood of survival?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\">A. It\u2019s my opinion that was the cause of her failure to survive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">Q. That was the cause of her death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">Q. That delay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">During cross-examination Dr. Shears testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-11\">Q. So today you\u2019re saying that she would have survived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-12\">A. I\u2019m not saying she would have survived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-13\">Q. Can you state to a reasonable degree of medical probability that she would have survived? That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-15\">Q. You can\u2019t, can you? You\u2019re engaging\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-16\">A. Nobody can say for sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-17\">Q. What I\u2019m asking is, you cannot say to a reasonable degree of probability that she would have survived if Dr. Netzley had done what you\u2019ve espoused he should have done here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-18\">A. I can\u2019t tell you what percentage of the time she would have survived if he had done that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">{\u00b6 14} Netzley has argued that the trial court should have directed a verdict in his favor because Shears recanted his testimony during cross-examination. He has cited a concurring opinion in <em>Galletti v. Burns Internatl. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 680, 684, 600 N.E.2d 294 (Christley, P.J., concurring), for the proposition that \u201c[w]hen a plaintiff expert recants a previous opinion on proximate cause, a directed verdict is proper.\u201d As this court has previously noted, that same concurring opinion also provides that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[o]nce an expert properly states his professional opinion to a properly formed question as to probability, he or she has established a prima facie case as a matter of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Birney, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA009171, 2008-Ohio-2250, 2008 WL 2003142, at \u00b6 20, quoting <em>Heath v. Teich, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP1100, 2004-Ohio-3389, 2004 WL 1446042, at \u00b6 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>quoting <em>Galletti, </em>74 Ohio App.3d at 684, 600 N.E.2d 294 (Christley, P.J., concurring). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[ejrosion of [an expert\u2019s] opinion due to effective cross-examination does not negate that opinion, rather it only goes to weight and credibility.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Heath, </em>2004-Ohio-3389, 2004 WL 1446042, at \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Galletti, </em>74 Ohio App.3d at 684, 600 N.E.2d 294 (Christley, P.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">{\u00b6 15} There is an important difference between impeaching a witness\u2019s testimony and causing him to recant it. \u201cA witness recants * * * by formally or publicly withdrawing or repudiating earlier testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Covender, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA009228, 2008-Ohio-1453, 2008 WL 834417, at \u00b6 21 (Dickinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 1274. Impeaching a witness, on the other hand, involves \u201cdiscrediting his] veracity.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">{\u00b6 16} This court considered whether a witness had recanted her testimony in <em>State v. Covender, </em>2008-Ohio-1453, 2008 WL 834417. As a young child, the witness accused her stepfather, Covender, of molesting her and testified against him at trial. Years later, the witness voluntarily came forward as an adult and submitted an affidavit in support of Covender\u2019s motion for a new trial. By affidavit, the witness testified that Covender had never hurt her or attempted to touch her inappropriately. Id. at \u00b6 13. She explained that as a child, she had felt pressured to say what the adults around her wanted her to say. Id. At an evidentiary hearing on the motion, the witness was asked: \u201cAnd your testimony is that what you stated in 1996 was not true?\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. The witness responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">{\u00b6 17} In determining whether a witness has recanted, a court \u201cmust determine whether [a witness] presented evidence, in the form of [the witness\u2019s] own formal or public statements, that, if believed, would convince the * * * court that [he or] she testified falsely\u201d on a prior occasion. Id. at \u00b6 21 (Dickinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In <em>Covender, </em>the witness testified that \u201cwhat [she] stated [at trial] was not true.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. Although it meets the definition of recantation, even this language may not be sufficient in certain circumstances. Id. at \u00b6 16 (held insufficient for lack of foundation of personal knowledge based on memory problems).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">{\u00b6 18} In this case, Mr. Segedy\u2019s expert testified on direct examination that Netzley sent Mrs. Segedy out of the operating room too soon, and his delay in returning her to the operating room was the proximate cause of her death. Mr. Segedy, therefore, established a prima facie case as a matter of law. See <em>Galletti, </em>74 Ohio App.3d at 684, 600 N.E.2d 294 (Christley, P.J., concurring); see also <em>Jones, </em>2008-Ohio-2250, 2008 WL 2003142, at \u00b6 20. The subsequent erosion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>that proximate-cause opinion on cross-examination was not a recantation of it. Shears did not repudiate or withdraw his opinion that Netzley\u2019s actions following surgery proximately caused Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death. Any conflict between his answers to questions during direct examination and cross-examination may have affected the weight and credibility of his opinions, but did not, alone, serve to recant his prior testimony. It was for the jury to consider whether to believe Shears\u2019s direct-examination testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">{\u00b6 19} Netzley has also argued that the trial court should have directed a verdict in his favor because Mr. Segedy failed to present evidence to support his lost-chance claim. A lost-chance claim is applicable, however, only if the plaintiff is unable to meet the traditional burden of proving proximate cause. <em>McMullen v. Ohio State Univ. Hosp. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 332, 339, 725 N.E.2d 1117. An expert may offer evidence of proximate cause through testimony that the causative event probably caused the harm. <em>Stinson v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 633 N.E.2d 532, at paragraph one of the syllabus. That is, that \u201cthere is a greater than fifty percent likelihood that it produced the occurrence at issue.\u201d Id. In this case, Shears testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Netzley\u2019s delay in returning Mrs. Segedy to the operating room after prematurely removing her was the proximate cause of her death. Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of Mr. Segedy, reasonable jurors could have determined that Netzley\u2019s actions proximately caused Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">THE CORONER\u2019S CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">{\u00b6 20} Netzley\u2019s third assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly denied his motion for a directed verdict \u201cbased on the overwhelming weight of the evidence that * * * Mr. Segedy failed to meet his burden of proof.\u201d Netzley has relied on the autopsy results to argue that Mrs. Segedy died of a postoperative heart attack \u201cdue to severe coronary artery disease.\u201d He has argued that \u201c[t]he coroner\u2019s conclusions were admissible as fact, and no expert disagreed with those findings.\u201d In response, Mr. Segedy has argued that his expert, Shears, disagreed with the autopsy findings, creating a question for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">{\u00b6 21} In disposing of either a motion for directed verdict or one for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a court \u201c \u2018must neither consider the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Texler v. D.O. Summers Cleaners &amp; Shirt Laundry Co. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 677, 679, 693 N.E.2d 271, quoting <em>Wagner v. Roche Labs. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 116, 119, 671 N.E.2d 252. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a \u201ccoroner\u2019s factual determinations concerning the manner, mode and cause of the decedent\u2019s death, as expressed in the coroner\u2019s report and death certificate, create a nonbinding, rebuttable presumption concerning such facts in the absence of competent, credible evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the contrary.\u201d <em>Vargo v. Travelers Ins. Co. Inc. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 27, 30, 516 N.E.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">(\u00b6 22} According to the autopsy report, Mrs. Segedy died of \u201c[a]cute myocardial failure\u201d due to \u201c[cjoronary artery insufficiency\u201d due to \u201c[atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.\u201d The medical examiner\u2019s report indicated that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s heart failed because of significant blockage of a coronary artery. Contrary to Netzley\u2019s assertion that \u201c[e]very expert agreed with the results of the autopsy,\u201d Shears strongly disagreed with the coroner\u2019s conclusion. Shears pointed to the results of the recent heart catheterization to support his opinion that although she may have had some coronary artery disease, it did not contribute to her death because it was not obstructing the flow of blood. He testified that coronary artery disease does not progress rapidly enough to have blocked the vessel and caused her death just three days after a heart-catheterization test revealed normal coronary arteries. At least two of Netzley\u2019s own experts seemed to agree that they could not reconcile the recent heart-catheterization results with the coroner\u2019s conclusion. Shears further explained that the medical examiner\u2019s findings were incorrect because they were based on assessment of a dead vessel with no blood flowing through it. According to him, the live vessel looked much different, as the recent heart-catheterization images revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">{\u00b6 23} Mr. Segedy presented competent, credible evidence contesting the medical examiner\u2019s assigned cause of death. The jury was free to believe Shears\u2019s testimony. Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of Mr. Segedy, reasonable jurors could have found that Netzley\u2019s actions rather than disease proximately caused Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death. Therefore, the trial court correctly denied Netzley\u2019s motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Netzley\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">INTERROGATORIES INCONSISTENT WITH VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">{\u00b6 24} Mr. Segedy\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly granted Netzley\u2019s motion for a new trial based on juror confusion. Mr. Segedy has argued that the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories were consistent with the general verdict both before and after they were amended. He has argued that the requisite three-fourths of the jury signed interrogatory responses regarding deviations from the standard of care and proximate cause that supported the general verdict for the plaintiff against Netzley. Netzley has argued that initially, the interrogatories were inconsistent with the general verdict because the verdict contained only six signatures including that of one juror who had not signed the liability interrogatories. Netzley has further argued that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>court impermissibly tainted the jurors with a faulty instruction when it sent them back to reconcile the interrogatory responses and the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">{\u00b6 25} Article 1, Section 5 of the Ohio Constitution and Civ.R. 48 require a jury verdict to be based on the concurrence of not less than three-fourths of the jury. \u201cThe essential purpose [of] * * * interrogatories is to test the correctness of a general verdict by eliciting from the jury its assessment of the determinative issues * * * in the context of evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum Inc. v. McNulty Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 333, 336-337, 28 OBR 400, 504 N.E.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">{\u00b6 26} Under Civ.R. 49(B), when the general verdict is consistent with the interrogatory answers, the court \u201cshall\u201d enter \u201cthe appropriate judgment upon the verdict and answers.\u201d If there is an inconsistency between the general verdict and one or more interrogatory answers, then the trial court \u201cmay\u201d do one of three things: (1) enter judgment in accordance with the interrogatory answers, notwithstanding the general verdict, (2) return the jury for further consideration of the interrogatories and the general verdict, or (3) order a new trial. Id. When an interrogatory response is inconsistent and irreconcilable with the general verdict, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe clear, best choice [is] to send the jury back for further deliberations.\u201d <em>Shaffer v. Maier </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 416, 421, 627 N.E.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">{\u00b6 27} In this case, the interrogatory responses initially appeared to support the general verdict for the plaintiff. Three-fourths of the jury signed interrogatory responses finding that Netzley had deviated from the standard of care, proximately causing Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death. Three-fourths of the jury signed the general verdict for plaintiff, awarding $1,755,300 in damages. The confusion arose when the parties realized that it was not the same three-fourths of the jury who had signed the liability interrogatories and the general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">{\u00b6 28} The same six jurors signed the forms agreeing to the answers to interrogatories one, two, and three. Interrogatory one asked, \u201cDo you find by a greater weight of the evidence that Dr. Netzley failed to comply with the standard of care in his care and treatment of Christina Segedy?\u201d Six jurors answered yes. Interrogatory two asked: \u201cIf you answered Yes to Interrogatory No. 1, please describe how Dr. Netzley failed to comply with the standard of care.\u201d The same six jurors who had answered yes to interrogatory one signed the form, answering: \u201c1. excessive clamp time [and] 2. leaving operating room with patient unstable.\u201d Interrogatory three asked: \u201cDo you find by the greater weight of the evidence that Dr. Netzley\u2019s failure to comply with the standard of care was a proximate cause of Christina Segedy\u2019s death?\u201d The same six jurors who had signed interrogatories one and two signed this form, answering yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>{\u00b6 29} The \u201cGENERAL VERDICT FOR PLAINTIFF\u201d form was completed with a checkmark indicating that the jury found \u201cfor the Plaintiff and against * * * Dr. Netzley.\u201d The general-verdict form also indicated that \u201cthe total amount of damages is $1,755,300, consistent with our total in Jury Interrogatory No. 11.\u201d Interrogatory 11 asked the jurors to \u201c[s]tate the total amount of compensatory damages and reasonable funeral and burial expenses to the Plaintiff in the wrongful death action.\u201d The same six jurors who signed the general verdict form for the plaintiff signed this interrogatory, indicating that compensatory damages totaled $1,750,000 and funeral and burial expenses totaled $5,300. One of those six, however, had not signed the standard-of-care and proximate-cause interrogatories against Netzley.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">THE \u201cSAME-JUROR RULE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">{\u00b6 30} The initial question for this court is whether the interrogatory responses were consistent with the general verdict. In order to answer that question, this court must consider whether a juror who has not signed interrogatory forms finding that the defendant breached a duty and proximately caused injury to the plaintiff may sign the general verdict form for plaintiff against that defendant. If the answer to that question is no, then the original verdict form in this case was invalid, as it was not rendered based on a concurrence of three-fourths of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>O\u2019Connell v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio RR. Co. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 226, 236, 569 N.E.2d 889, the Ohio Supreme Court adopted the \u201csame-juror rule\u201d in comparative-negligence cases so that only those jurors who find liability (i.e., breach of duty and proximate cause) may participate in the decision apportioning liability among the pax-ties. The court in <em>O\u2019Connell </em>examined the law of other jurisdictions, describing two distinct lines of cases. The court cited several states that followed the same-juror rule because \u201ca juror\u2019s finding as to whether liability exists is so conceptually and logically connected with apportioning fault that inconsistent answers to the two questions render that juror\u2019s vote unreliable and thus invalid.\u201d Id. at 233, 569 N.E.2d 889. Therefore, the courts held, only jurors who agreed with the majority regarding liability could participate in the apportioning of that liability in a comparative negligence case. Id. The court also cited several states that followed the \u201cany-majority rule.\u201d Id. at 233, 569 N.E.2d 889. Under this rule, there is no requirement of individual juror consistency in voting. Id. at 233-235, 569 N.E.2d 889. Therefox-e, once three-fourths of the jux-y has found a party liable, dissenting jurors may \u201c \u2018accept the majority\u2019s finding * * * and participate in apportioning liability.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 234, 569 N.E.2d 889, quoting <em>Juarez v. Superior Court of Los Angeles </em>(1982), 31 Cal.3d 759, 768, 183 Cal.Rptr. 852, 647 P.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>{\u00b6 32} The Ohio Supreme Court held that in comparative-negligence cases, the same-juror rule applies to require individual voting consistency between interrogatory responses finding liability and apportioning it. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>58 Ohio St.3d at 236, 569 N.E.2d 889. The court explained that it would be \u201cillogical to require, or even allow, a juror to initially find a defendant has not acted causally negligently, and then subsequently permit this juror to assign some degree of fault to that same defendant.\u201d Id. at 235, 569 N.E.2d 889. The court described \u201cthe allocation of fault\u201d as a \u201cmethod through which a juror clarifies his or her finding that a party is causally negligent for the injury sustained.\u201d Id. at 236, 569 N.E.2d 889. On that basis, the court in <em>O\u2019Connell </em>held the verdict for the defendant invalid because less than the requisite three-fourths of the jury had agreed that the plaintiff was more than 50 percent liable for her own injuries. Id. at 237, 569 N.E.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">{\u00b6 33} The Ohio Supreme Court did not adopt a strict application of the same-juror rule in all cases. In fact, the court pointed out in <em>O\u2019Connell </em>that it was not willing to \u201cextend [its] holding to reach\u201d the application of the rule to \u201c[a] jury\u2019s determinations as to liability and damages,\u201d as other jurisdictions had done. Id. at 232, 569 N.E.2d 889, fn. 3. The court emphasized that the same-juror rule \u201c \u2018applies only to cases in which the answers are interdependent, not where they are separate and independent\u2019 \u201d like those of liability and damages. Id. at 233, 569 N.E.2d 889, quoting <em>Veberes v. Knappton Corp. </em>(1988), 92 Or.App. 378, 759 P.2d 279, 280. A juror could logically find that the defendant was not liable, but agree that the plaintiffs damages total a certain amount. It is, however, illogical for a juror to find the defendant was not liable, yet sign a general verdict finding against him and awarding damages to the plaintiff. That is what happened in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">{\u00b6 34} One juror who had not agreed that Netzley had deviated from the standard of care or proximately caused Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death signed the verdict form awarding damages to Mr. Segedy. That juror\u2019s interrogatory responses were inconsistent and irreconcilable with the general-verdict form. The vote of that juror on the verdict form was invalid, rendering the verdict invalid because without her vote, the verdict remained supported by just five jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">{\u00b6 35} Netzley has argued that the verdict was also invalid because two jurors who had not found that Netzley deviated from the standard of care participated in the apportionment of fault. According to Netzley, \u201c[u]nder <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>this is plain error and grounds for a new trial.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell </em>does not support Netzley\u2019s position, however, because the court in that ease remedied the situation by invalidating the improper votes. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>58 Ohio St.3d at 237, 569 N.E.2d 889. This left less than three-fourths of the jury in agreement regarding the apportionment of liability. Id. In this case, all eight jurors signed interrogatory ten, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>apportioning \u201cthe percentages of negligence that directly and proximately caused the Plaintiffs injuries and death.\u201d Therefore, even after excluding the votes of the two jurors who did not sign the liability interrogatories, the interrogatory apportioning 78 percent of the liability to Netzley remains based on the agreement of three-fourths of the jury. Therefore, the two invalid votes on interrogatory ten did not create any inconsistency between the interrogatories and the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">RECONCILIATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">{\u00b6 36} When instructing the jury regarding the need to reconcile the interrogatories and verdict, the trial court must be careful not to suggest or imply that the jury came to the wrong conclusion. <em>Phillips v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 433, 449, 676 N.E.2d 565, citing <em>De Boer v. Toledo Soccer Partners Inc. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 251, 258, 583 N.E.2d 1004. The court should encourage the jury to consider whether the interrogatory answers represent their true intentions. Id. Ideally, the trial court will instruct the jury that \u201cthe interrogatory responses and general verdicts should be reconciled with each other\u201d rather than insisting that they must reconcile them. <em>Perez v. Falls Fin. Inc. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 371, 377, 721 N.E.2d 47. The trial court should also make it clear that neither the interrogatories nor the verdict controls the other, but that \u201cthe two should be harmonious.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">{\u00b6 37} In this case, the defense objected to the inconsistency before the court had discharged the jury. The court addressed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">We have encountered a problem in checking the signatures of the people who signed the general verdict for the plaintiff and checking those of you who signed the Jury Interrogatories 1, 2 and 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-8\">The Jury Interrogatories 1, 2 and 3 deal with Dr. Netzley\u2019s failure to comply with the standard of care, the description of it, and then that you found it was a proximate cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">The signatures on those do not match totally with the signatures on the general verdict for plaintiff and they should.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">If you found \u2014 if you agreed that Dr. Netzley has failed to comply with the standard of care and that that was a proximate cause, then your name should probably be on the Plaintiffs verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-11\">If you didn\u2019t agree with that, it probably shouldn\u2019t be on there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\">Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">{\u00b6 38} Netzley\u2019s lawyer then asked to approach and informed the court, outside the presence of the jury, that he was \u201cconcerned that the jury is not understanding- \u2014 that those jurors who signed Interrogatories 1, 2 and 3 in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>plaintiff also need to sign the general verdict form.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe other thing, what you said to them was if you signed 1, 2 and 3, your name should be on that verdict form. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s necessarily true.\u201d The court addressed the jury again, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\">I\u2019m trying to think of ways to say this without causing problems. It\u2019s just inconsistent that you would find for the Plaintiff if you didn\u2019t think Dr. Netzley was negligent; therefore, it\u2019s inconsistent to find a name on the general verdict for this Plaintiff that does not appear on the jury interrogatories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">It\u2019s also somewhat inconsistent that there is a name on the interrogatories that doesn\u2019t appear on the general verdict form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">If you agreed that Dr. Netzley failed to comply, then your name should appear on Jury Interrogatory No. 1, and those same people \u2014 well, not necessarily. Jury Interrogatory No. 3 is a little different, did his failure to comply with the standard of care, was it a proximate cause, but if your name\u2019s on both of those, in all likelihood it would appear on the general verdict for Plaintiff. Wouldn\u2019t have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">Go back and see if you can clear this up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">{\u00b6 39} Neither party objected to this reconciliation instruction. After additional deliberation, the jury returned the forms, having made two changes to the general-verdict form. The juror who had signed the general verdict without signing the liability interrogatories had crossed out her name on the verdict form. The juror who had signed the liability interrogatories, but had not previously signed the verdict form, had added her name as the sixth vote in favor of the verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">{\u00b6 40} The trial court asked the juror who had added her signature to the verdict whether she had found that Netzley had violated the standard of care. She said that she had. The court asked whether she had found that his violation of the standard of care was a proximate cause of Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death. She said that she had. The court finally asked her whether she was in agreement with the general verdict for the plaintiff. She said that she was. The court then asked the lawyers whether they had additional questions. After conferring with counsel, the trial court asked the same juror, who had initially refused to sign the general-verdict form, whether she \u201cagree[d] with the amount.\u201d The juror answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-11\">No. That was my issue. We thought the people that agreed on that form had to sign the verdict form. That\u2019s why my name wasn\u2019t on the verdict form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abr\">The trial court then spoke again to the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-12\">I know these things are very confusing, but I\u2019m going to need you to go back and redo some stuff.* * *. At least six people who agree on the amount are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the ones who sign the general verdict, but you have to have an agreement on the amount to agree on the verdict, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">Now, if six people agree on the amount and agree on the verdict and two other people also said yes, it should be a verdict for the plaintiff, but if you don\u2019t agree on the amount, don\u2019t do anything, okay? * * * We\u2019re going to give you a clean set. * * * We\u2019ll give you the interrogatories that apply to Dr. Netzley. You can rethink them if other people \u2014 if all eight want to sign, seven, six, but we have to have \u2014 they have to be consistent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Neither party objected to the court\u2019s final reconciliation instruction. At that point, the jury began deliberations with clean forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">{\u00b6 41} When they returned to the courtroom, the liability interrogatories against Netzley, one through three, were filled out in exactly the same manner as the original set. The same six jurors signed each of the three forms finding liability against Netzley for precisely the same violations of the standard of care described in the jury\u2019s initial response to interrogatory two. In response to interrogatory eleven, the amount of compensatory damages had been decreased by $50,000 from the original response to that interrogatory. The final response to interrogatory eleven indicated that six jurors agreed that the plaintiffs compensatory damages totaled $1,700,000 and the funeral and burial expenses were $5,300. The same six jurors signed interrogatories one, two, three, and eleven. The \u201cGENERAL VERDICT FOR PLAINTIFF\u201d form was filled out and signed by the same six jurors who had signed the liability and damages interrogatories. The general verdict awarded $1,705,300 to the plaintiff, consistent with the answer to interrogatory eleven.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">{\u00b6 42} Before the trial court dismissed the jury, Netzley moved for a mistrial, arguing that the jury was \u201cconfused with [the] process\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere is not a general consensus either on liability or damages.\u201d The trial court disagreed and entered judgment against Netzley. One month later, the trial court denied Netzley\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but granted his alternative motion for a new trial based on juror confusion and the inclusion of a reference to excluded evidence in the responses to the jury interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">{\u00b6 43} Mr. Segedy has argued that the trial court incorrectly ordered a new trial when the interrogatory responses were consistent with the general verdict, and the court had not tainted the jury with its reconciliation instructions. In response, Netzley has argued that the trial court ordered a new trial because it realized it had invaded the province of the jury by suggesting \u201chow to resolve the inconsistency in order to award a plaintiffs verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">{\u00b6 44} There is nothing in the trial court\u2019s judgment entry to support Netzley\u2019s assertion that the trial court ordered a new trial because it believed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>reconciliation instructions were inappropriate. The court said only that \u201cthe judgment in this case should be set aside, and a new trial held\u201d because of \u201cthe confusion displayed by the jury as shown in the answers to the interrogatories, and the inclusion therein of a finding of negligence [against Netzley] * * * partly because of the long clamp time, which this Court had disallowed as a claim for negligence.\u201d The judgment entry does not refer to the reconciliation instructions at all. In any event, the court did not impermissibly coach the jury to change its responses to find in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">{\u00b6 45} Jury interrogatories are useful to ascertain a jury\u2019s true intentions. <em>Phillips v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 433, 449, 676 N.E.2d 565. In this case, the intent of the jury regarding the liability of Netzley was clear from the initial responses, and that intent did not change with further deliberation. The only inconsistency involved the personal voting consistency of one juror as between liability interrogatory responses and the verdict for the plaintiff. The jury returned the second time with another invalid verdict. Although the juror who had found Netzley liable but initially refused to sign the verdict had signed it, she still had not signed interrogatory eleven, regarding damages. When the court questioned that juror, it became clear that she had not agreed with the other five jurors regarding the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">{\u00b6 46} The reconciliation instructions did not improperly suggest that the jurors had made the wrong decision about damages or anything else. The court told them that they \u201chave to have an agreement on the amount to agree on the verdict.\u201d The court also told them not to do anything if they did not agree on the amount. This language allowed for the possibility that they may not reach a verdict. The court made it clear that they should \u201crethink\u201d \u201cthe interrogatories that apply to Dr. Netzley.\u201d They were given clean forms, and after further deliberation, they returned with three liability interrogatories answered in precisely the same manner as they had been the first time, including the same six signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">{\u00b6 47} The reconciliation instructions were not ideal, but they do not indicate that the trial court attempted to impose its will on the jurors. \u201c \u2018A jury charge must be considered as a whole and a reviewing court must determine whether the jury charge probably misled the jury in a matter materially affecting the complaining party\u2019s substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perez v. Falls Fin. Inc. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 371, 376, 721 N.E.2d 47, quoting <em>Becker v. Lake Cty. Mem. Hosp. W. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 202, 208, 560 N.E.2d 165. In this case, despite its imperfections, the charge, as a whole, did not mislead the jury. It seems that the instruction did precisely what it was intended to do. It cleared up the misconception the jury had, based on the instructions to the interrogatories, regarding who should sign the verdict. Without influencing the jurors in favor of either party, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>the trial court instructed them to reconsider each of the interrogatory responses and the general verdict regarding Netzley.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">{\u00b6 48} The jurors returned the final time, having made only one substantive change from their original responses. The jury solved the impasse by compromising on the amount of damages. The jury\u2019s final response to interrogatory eleven reduced the compensatory damages by $50,000. The same six jurors agreed that Netzley had violated the standard of care, that his violation was a pi-oximate cause of Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death, and that the damages totaled $1,705,300. There was no inconsistency between the final interrogatory responses and the final verdict. Therefore, under Civ.R. 49(B), the trial court had no discretion to order a new trial on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">{\u00b6 49} The trial court indicated that its new trial order was based in part on the jury\u2019s response to interrogatory two, regarding Netzley\u2019s violations of the standard of care. The jury had responded to that interrogatory, on each occasion, with a reference to \u201cexcessive clamp time.\u201d The trial court noted that it had excluded evidence that the amount of time Mrs. Segedy was on the bypass machine during surgery (i.e., \u201cclamp time\u201d) was a violation of the standard of care. As part of his first assignment of error, Mr. Segedy has argued that the trial court incorrectly ordered a new trial because the verdict was valid based on the jury\u2019s complete response to interrogatory two, regardless of the jury\u2019s reference to clamp time.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">{\u00b6 50} Interrogatory two asked the jury to \u201cdescribe how Dr. Netzley failed to comply with the standard of care.\u201d The question was followed by blank lines on which the jury wrote: \u201c1. excessive clamp time [and] 2. leaving operating room with patient unstable.\u201d The parties agree that the second basis was a theory of liability presented to the jury through expert testimony. The parties also seem to agree that \u201cexcessive clamp time\u201d was not a theory properly presented to the jury because the trial court granted a motion in limine on that topic during the trial. The court excluded the testimony based on unfair surprise because it determined that Shears had not previously testified to that criticism during his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">{\u00b6 51} In regard to this issue, Netzley has argued at length regarding the \u201cmisconduct\u201d of Mr. Segedy\u2019s counsel and his expert, Shears. It appears that Netzley has argued that the new-trial order was justified under Civ.R. 59(A)(1). Civ.R. 59(A)(1) permits a new trial in the event that \u201c[ijrregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, * * * or prevailing party, or any order of the court, * * * or abuse of discretion * * * prevented * * * a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>{\u00b6 52} Although Netzley moved in limine to exclude any new standard-of-care opinions not previously disclosed at deposition, the trial court did not grant the motion until Netzley objected during Shears\u2019s direct-examination testimony. Just before the objection, Shears explained that 101 minutes \u201cis very long, particularly in a sick heart * * * that has a bad ventricle[,] * * * particularly a right ventricle * * *. * * * [T]hat is an exceptionally long period of time to keep the heart stopped and * * * expect it to restart and be able to provide the circulatory support that it needs.\u201d After the court questioned Shears outside the presence of the jury, it excluded his opinion that Netzley had deviated from the standard of care by permitting such a long clamp time, but denied Netzley\u2019s motion to strike the last answer. Thus, contrary to Netzley\u2019s implication, the trial court did not exclude any reference to long clamp time.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">{\u00b6 53} During direct examination by Mr. Segedy\u2019s lawyer, in accordance with the court\u2019s ruling, Shears never testified that the long clamp time was a deviation from the standard of care. To the contrary, he testified that \u201cchronologically * * * [Dr. Netzley\u2019s] first deviation from the acceptable standard of care\u201d occurred when he sent Mrs. Segedy from the operating room before she was stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">{\u00b6 54} During cross-examination, however, Netzley\u2019s own lawyer asked Shears, \u201cYou\u2019re not critical about the length of this surgery, correct?\u201d Shears answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ5\">I still to this point in time think that the clamp time of 101 minutes on a sick heart is excessive. In a normal heart a clamp time of 101 minutes is acceptable. In this case it doesn\u2019t matter what I said in that deposition that you\u2019re going to read here in a few minutes, but 101 minutes as proved by the fact that I\u2019m sitting here today, we\u2019re all sitting here today, is excessive. * * * [I]t\u2019s not unheard of to have an operation that\u2019s that long, but in her case it was too long. Otherwise her heart would have been able to sustain her. I\u2019m not saying they deviated from any standard of care in this particular point in terms of her survival. The clamp time was what ultimately caused her heart to fail. It\u2019s not what caused her \u2014 in my opinion, her death. Her death was the inaction in response to the failure that occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-7\">Mr. Griffin: Unresponsive, Doctor. I move to strike, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-8\">The Court: Well, I think he answered what you asked him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Netzley has now argued that this exchange is evidence of Shears\u2019s \u201cmisconduct.\u201d Netzley has argued that \u201c[t]he witness does not have unfettered right and free reign to testify on any matter he pleases.\u201d It is not the witness\u2019s job, however, to ensure compliance with in limine evidentiary rulings, and this is not a case of a savvy expert testifying \u201con any matter he pleases.\u201d According to Shears, he had never before testified as an expert witness. Furthermore, his answer was responsive to a question asked by Netzley\u2019s lawyer, not Mr. Segedy\u2019s lawyer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Therefore, to the extent this testimony caused the jury to become confused about whether Netzley deviated from the standard of care via clamp time, Netzley invited it by asking the question. Netzley cannot take advantage of juror confusion that he created. See <em>State ex rel. Downs v. Panioto, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 347, 2006-Ohio-8, 839 N.E.2d 911, at \u00b6 32, quoting <em>State ex rel. Kline v. Carroll, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 404, 2002-Ohio-4849, 775 N.E.2d 517, at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">{\u00b6 55} Furthermore, even though Shears appears to have testified during cross-examination that the clamp time violated the standard of care, he also testified that it did not proximately cause Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death. Shears did not testify that Netzley was liable for the death based on excessive clamp time, so this issue could not support a verdict against Netzley in any event. It is difficult to see how Netzley could have been prejudiced by Shears\u2019s testimony. Although Netzley has noted various occasions in the transcript of either Mr. Segedy\u2019s lawyer or Shears mentioning clamp time, his argument is based on the misconception that this amounted to misconduct. The record reveals that Mr. Segedy\u2019s lawyer did not violate the trial court\u2019s order prohibiting a standard-of-care opinion regarding clamp time.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">{\u00b6 56} Netzley has cited <em>Chesney v. Brunner </em>(May 22, 1975), 10th Dist. No. 74AP-557, 1975 WL 181375, as authority for the proposition that \u201ca court cannot simply ignore an interrogatory answer based on improper evidence.\u201d In <em>Chesney, </em>the trial court ordered a new trial because interrogatory responses revealed that the jury had considered an extra element of damages, one that had apparently not been authorized by the trial court. Id. at *5. The facts of <em>Chesney </em>are readily distinguished from the facts of this case. The jury in this case did not incorrectly inflate the damages award, as the jury in <em>Chesney </em>had done. Netzley was not prejudiced by the jury\u2019s consideration of excluded evidence regarding the standard of care. Each violation of the standard of care was an independent basis for liability. Therefore, the reference to clamp time was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">{\u00b6 57} Netzley has also argued that a jury may not base its verdict on grounds not supported by the evidence. The reference to clamp time in response to interrogatory two, however, does not affect the fact that three-fourths of the jury found that Netzley violated the standard of care by leaving the operating room before Mrs. Segedy was stable. There is no dispute that that was an independent, valid basis for the verdict against Netzley. Therefore, the references to clamp time by experts and lawyers did not affect the fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 58} Furthermore, the jury\u2019s reference to clamp time in response to interrogatory two was not inconsistent with the general verdict for the plaintiff. Regardless of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the standard-of-care issue, the evidence did not support the jury\u2019s finding that the clamp time proximately caused Mrs. Segedy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>death. If the reference to clamp time in response to interrogatory two is deleted, the fact remains that three-fourths of the jury found that Netzley had deviated from the standard of care by leaving the operating room too soon after the surgery. Therefore, interrogatory two remains consistent with the general verdict. Under Civ.R. 49(B), the trial court had no discretion to order a new trial when the interrogatories were consistent with the general verdict. Mr. Segedy\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">{\u00b6 59} Mr. Segedy\u2019s second assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly denied his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as it pertained to the assignment to Mrs. Segedy of 22 percent comparative negligence. He has argued that there was no evidence that anything Mrs. Segedy did or failed to do proximately caused her death. Netzley has argued that \u201c[Mrs. Segedy\u2019s] negligence in failing to follow her physicians\u2019 medical advice and her long history of smoking contributed to her death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">{\u00b6 60} Netzley has first argued that Mr. Segedy forfeited this argument by failing to move for a directed verdict on this basis at the close of all evidence or otherwise object to the jury instruction or interrogatories on this issue before the case went to the jury. In support of his position, Netzley has cited an Eighth District Court of Appeals opinion involving a plaintiff who after failing to object to a jury instruction, assigned the giving of that instruction as error on appeal. See <em>Faber v. Syed </em>(July 7, 1994), 8th Dist. No. 65359, 1994 WL 326151 at *8. <em>Faber </em>does not support Netzley\u2019s position. Mr. Segedy was not required to object or otherwise challenge the sufficiency of the evidence prior to moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Civ.R. 50(B) (motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict does not require a previous directed verdict motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">{\u00b6 61} To prove the affirmative defense of contributory negligence, the defendant must prove that the plaintiff breached a duty, proximately causing her own injury. Thus, the plaintiffs own \u201cwant of ordinary care * * * [must have] combined and concurred with the defendant\u2019s negligence and contributed to the injury as a proximate cause thereof, and as an element without which the injury would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Brinkmoeller v. Wilson </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 223, 226, 70 O.O.2d 424, 325 N.E.2d 233. In medical-negligence cases, \u201csuch negligence must be contemporaneous with the malpractice of the physician.\u201d <em>Lambert v. Shearer </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 266, 284, 616 N.E.2d 965; see also <em>Viox v. Weinberg, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 12-14 (in missed-diagnosis case, patient\u2019s failure to follow doctor\u2019s advice to have a second chest x-ray in year following defendant doctor\u2019s negligent reading of first x-ray was not contemporaneous with defendant\u2019s negligence). Therefore, \u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>improper to suggest * * * that the negligent conduct of the patient prior to coming under the care of the defendant physician could serve to constitute [contributory patient] negligence.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>84 Ohio App.3d at 284, 616 N.E.2d 965 (physician could not base contributory-negligence defense on patient\u2019s 30-year history of smoking, because physician accepted the patient for treatment \u201cas he was\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\"> {\u00b6 62} Disregarding a physician\u2019s orders may constitute contributory patient negligence if there is also evidence that it was \u201can active and efficient contributing cause of the injury that is the basis of the patient\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 13; see also <em>Sorina v. Armstrong </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 113, 115-116, 554 N.E.2d 943 (plaintiffs expert testified that injury was caused by doctor\u2019s failure to diagnose and treat complication following elective abortion, but evidence indicated that patient proximately caused her own injury by failing to follow defendant physician\u2019s advice to return for follow-up care). In order to offer admissible evidence of proximate cause, an expert must testify that the causative event probably caused the harm. <em>Stinson v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 633 N.E.2d 532, at paragraph one of the syllabus. That means that \u201cthere is a greater than fifty percent likelihood that it produced the occurrence at issue.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 63} In this case, interrogatory seven asked the jury whether the plaintiff was negligent. All eight jurors signed the affirmative response. Interrogatory eight asked: \u201cIf you answered Yes to Interrogatory No. 7, please describe how the Plaintiff was negligent?\u201d The jury responded: \u201cFailing to comply with medical instruction and advice. Smoking.\u201d All eight jurors signed interrogatory eight as well. Interrogatory nine asked whether the jury found \u201cby a greater weight of the evidence that the Plaintiffs negligence was a proximate cause of death?\u201d All eight jurors signed the affirmative response. Interrogatory ten asked the jury to \u201c[s]tate the percentages of negligence that directly and proximately caused the Plaintiffs injuries and death.\u201d All eight jurors signed the response, assigning 22 percent of the negligence to the plaintiff and 78 percent to Netzley.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">FAILING TO FOLLOW MEDICAL ADVICE</p>\n<p id=\"A4N\">{\u00b6 64} Netzley has pointed to the testimony of Mrs. Segedy\u2019s pulmonologist and her cardiologist regarding her failure to follow up and schedule additional tests as instructed after her June 2001 echocardiogram revealed moderate mitral stenosis. According to Netzley, the testimony indicated that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s mitral stenosis progressed rapidly between June and September. Netzley testified, however, that he had not become involved in Mrs. Segedy\u2019s care until September 21, 2001. Therefore, any failure on her part to follow up with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>doctors in the summer of 2001 could not have \u201ccombined and concurred with [Netzley\u2019s] negligence\u201d to proximately cause her death. See <em>Brinkmoeller v. Wilson </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 223, 226, 70 O.O.2d 424, 325 N.E.2d 233. Netzley agreed to undertake the care and treatment of Mrs. Segedy as he found her on September 21, 2001. See <em>Lambert v. Shearer </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 266, 284, 616 N.E.2d 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">{\u00b6 65} Netzley also argued that the evidence revealed that Mrs. Segedy had signed herself out of the hospital against medical advice the Friday before her Monday surgery. He has failed, however, to point to any expert testimony tending to show that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s absence from the hospital over the weekend more likely than not was a cause of her death. A review of the trial transcript failed to reveal any such evidence. Without evidence of proximate cause, reasonable jurors could not find that Mrs. Segedy was liable for her own death due to her failure to follow the advice of her cardiologist to stay in the hospital over the weekend before her surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">SMOKING</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 66} Netzley has pointed to the testimony of Dr. Robert Gorman, a cardiovascular-surgery expert. According to Netzley, Gorman testified that \u201c[Mrs. Segedy\u2019s] \u201830-pack-a-year\u2019 smoking history contributed to her death preoperatively.\u201d Netzley has also argued that Mr. Segedy\u2019s expert, Shears, testified \u201cthat smoking could contribute to operative complications.\u201d Shears testified that smoking \u201cincreases your risk of pneumonias perioperatively,\u201d but does not substantially increase the risk of death from mitral valve surgery. Not only did Shears not testify that smoking increases the risk of the kind of complications Mrs. Segedy suffered, but he did not testify on this topic in terms of Mrs. Segedy\u2019s case at all. His testimony did not provide any evidence that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s smoking probably was a cause of her death. Gorman testified that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s history of smoking \u201ccontributed to her risk preoperatively,\u201d but her history of smoking was not contemporaneous with Netzley\u2019s negligence. See <em>Lambert, </em>84 Ohio App.3d at 284, 616 N.E.2d 965. A history of smoking, even coupled with expert testimony that smoking can cause postoperative complications, is not evidence of Mrs. Segedy\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 67} Netzley has also argued that \u201c[Mrs. Segedy\u2019s] decision not to stop smoking for two weeks and delay surgery was a contemporaneous factor that increased her operative risk.\u201d In support of this argument, he has pointed to his own testimony that Mrs. Segedy refused his offer to briefly postpone the surgery for that purpose and the testimony of Dr. Thomas Lee, the treating anesthesiologist, who testified that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s history of smoking affected her poor cardiac-output values.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>{\u00b6 68} Netzley did not mention, and this court has not found, any evidence indicating that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s refusal to stop smoking for two weeks prior to surgery probably was a cause of her death. In fact, Netzley testified that smoking increased the risk of postoperative pneumonia, not the complications that occurred after Mrs. Segedy\u2019s surgery. Without evidence of proximate cause, a reasonable juror could not conclude that Mrs. Segedy\u2019s decision constituted contributory patient negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 69} Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of Netzley, reasonable jurors could only conclude that any lack of care by Mrs. Segedy in smoking or failing to follow her physicians\u2019 advice did not proximately cause her death. Therefore, the trial court incorrectly denied Mr. Segedy\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the extent that the jury assigned 22 percent comparative negligence to Mrs. Segedy. Mr. Segedy\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 70} Mr. Segedy\u2019s third assignment of error is that the verdict finding Mrs. Segedy partially at fault for her own death was against the manifest weight of the evidence. This assignment of error is rendered moot by this court\u2019s disposition of Mr. Segedy\u2019s second assignment of error and is overruled on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">{\u00b6 71} Netzley\u2019s assignments of error are overruled because reasonable jurors could have determined that Netzley\u2019s actions proximately caused Mrs. Segedy\u2019s death. Mr. Segedy\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained; the trial court was incorrect in ordering a new trial because (1) the jury\u2019s interrogatory responses were consistent with the general-verdict form following a reconciliation instruction that did not taint the verdict, and (2) references to excessive clamp time did not deprive Netzley of a fair trial. Mr. Segedy\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained; the trial court incorrectly denied his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict regarding comparative negligence because, based on the evidence, reasonable jurors could only conclude that any lack of care by Mrs. Segedy in smoking or failing to follow her physicians\u2019 advice did not proximately cause her death. The judgment of the Summit County Common Pleas Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for the trial court to enter judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict without reducing it for comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b828-10\">Moore, P.J., and Whitmore, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
