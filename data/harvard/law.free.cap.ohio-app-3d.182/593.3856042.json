Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">{\u00b6 2} In the early morning hours of February 19, 2008, a law-enforcement officer observed three individuals carrying appliances in the street. Police officers from the Alliance Police Department followed tracks in the snow to the back door of a residence owned by appellant. Upon knocking on the front door, the officers spoke with two juvenile girls, Tehtyana Cooper and Tammara Crawford. Cooper is appellant\u2019s daughter. Cooper went upstairs and awoke appellant, who had been sleeping. Appellant consented to a search of her home. The officers found wet winter coats and clothing, but all three denied any knowledge of anyone hiding in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The police arrested the girls for stealing the appliances that had been taken from a nearby garage. During questioning at the police station, the girls admitted to hiding three male individuals under the crawl space of appellant\u2019s residence, one of whom was appellant\u2019s brother. Upon returning to appellant\u2019s residence, appellant\u2019s son told the officers that appellant had taken her brother and another individual to the bus station. The third individual was discovered still hiding in the crawl space. Appellant returned home and eventually admitted to driving her brother and his friend to the bus station after driving a neighbor to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 4} On March 24, 2008, the Stark County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of obstructing justice in violation of R.C. 2921.32. A bench trial was held on May 16 and June 4, 2008. Appellant had subpoenaed the two juvenile girls to testify. Because the girls had been charged with obstructing justice in juvenile court but had yet to be arraigned and secure counsel, the trial court determined that they were unable to knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive their Fifth Amendment rights and therefore precluded their testimony. The trial court did not permit appellant\u2019s counsel to proffer the girls\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 5} At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court found appellant guilty as charged. By judgment entry filed July 30, 2008, the trial court sentenced appellant to six months in prison, suspended in lieu of six months of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant filed an appeal, and this matter is now before this court for consideration. The assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court violated the appellants (sic) right to due process when it precluded the testimony of two defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s finding of guilty was against the manifest weight of the evidence and was not supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant claims that the trial court denied her rights to compulsory and due process when it excluded the testimony of the two juvenile girls. Appellant also claims that the trial court erred in prohibiting her trial counsel from proffering on the record their proposed testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">{\u00b6 10} The gravamen of this assignment of error is the manner in which the trial court denied appellant\u2019s right to put these witnesses on the stand. Admittedly, both girls were tangentially involved in the underlying predicate offense (theft) and the harboring of the three individuals who perpetrated the theft. While the girls had been charged with obstructing justice in juvenile court, they had not been arraigned and had not yet secured counsel. Both girls appeared at trial pursuant to a subpoena issued by appellant. After a discussion on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>record of the girls\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, appellant stated that she did not want her daughter to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 11} Under the doctrine of \u201cinvited error,\u201d it is well settled that \u201ca party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error which she herself invited or induced the trial court to make.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Smith v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 660, 663, 646 N.E.2d 1115, citing <em>State ex rel. Fowler v. Smith </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 357, 359, 626 N.E.2d 950. See also <em>Lester v. Leuck </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 91, 26 O.O. 280, 50 N.E.2d 145, paragraph one of the syllabus. As the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c \u2018The law imposes upon every litigant the duty of vigilance in the trial of a case, and even where the trial court commits an error to his prejudice, he is required then and there to challenge the attention of the court to that error, by excepting thereto, and upon failure of the court to correct the same to cause his exceptions to be noted. It follows, therefore, that, for much graver reasons, a litigant cannot be permitted, either intentionally or unintentionally, to induce or mislead a court into the commission of an error and then procure a reversal of the judgment for an error for which he was actively responsible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lester </em>at 92-93, 26 O.O. 280, 50 N.E.2d 145, quoting <em>State v. Kollar </em>(1915), 93 Ohio St. 89, 91, 112 N.E. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 13} Based upon the invited-error doctrine and appellant\u2019s personal statement regarding her daughter, we will limit our review of this assignment of error to the denial of Tammara Crawford\u2019s testimony. As the record indicates, Crawford was 16 years old and was not accompanied to the trial by a parent or an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 14} It is apparent from the record through the trial court\u2019s questioning of appellant\u2019s counsel, the testimony of Officer Heaviln, and the testimony of Brelon Young, that if Crawford had been permitted to testify, she could have said: (1) the girls were responsible for initially hiding the three suspects in the crawl space, (2) appellant therefore did not know that the suspects were in the house the first time the police came to her home, and (3) whether appellant had observed the stolen items prior to the police arriving.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 15} The state argues that any error on this issue was harmless. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">(\u00b6 16} Crim.E. 52(A), which governs the criminal appeal of a nonforfeited error, provides that \u201c[a]ny error * * * which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d Thus, Crim.E. 52(A) sets forth two requirements that must be satisfied before a reviewing court may correct an alleged error. First, the reviewing court must determine whether there was an \u201cerror\u201d \u2014 i.e., a \u201c[deviation from a legal rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 725, 732-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508. Second, the reviewing court must engage in a specific analysis of the trial court record \u2014 a so-called \u201charmless error\u201d inquiry \u2014 to determine whether the error \u201caffect[ed] substantial rights\u201d of the criminal defendant. In <em>U.S. v. Dominguez Benitez </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 74, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157, the court defined the prejudice prong of the plain-error analysis. \u201cIt is only for certain structural errors undermining the fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole that even preserved error requires reversal without regard to the mistake\u2019s effect on the proceeding. See <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 309-310[, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d \u2019302] (1991). * * * Otherwise, relief for error is tied in some way to prejudicial effect, and the standard phrased as \u2018error that affects substantial rights,\u2019 used in Rule 52, has previously been taken to mean error with a prejudicial effect on the outcome of a judicial proceeding. See <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750[, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557] (1946). To affect \u2018substantial rights,\u2019 see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111, an error must have \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the * * * verdict.\u2019 <em>Kotteakos, </em>supra, at 776[, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557].\u201d <em>Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at 81, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157. See also <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 759 N.E.2d 1240; <em>State v. Fisher, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 7. Thus, a so-called \u201c[t]rial error\u201d is \u201cerror which occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury, and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 307-308, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302; <em>State v. Ahmed, </em>Stark App. No. 2007-CA-00049, 2008-Ohio-389, 2008 WL 307711, \u00b6 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWhen a claim of harmless error is raised, the appellate court must read the record and decide the probable impact of the error on the minds of the average jury.\u201d <em>State v. Young </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 221, 226, 5 OBR 484, 450 N.E.2d 1143, citing <em>Harrington v. California </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 18} The bill of particulars filed by the state in appellant\u2019s case specified that appellant drove the suspects from her residence and to a bus station, knowing that they were wanted by the police with respect to the stolen appliances.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 19} Testimony at trial established that Officer Palozzi returned to appellant\u2019s home after his investigation revealed that the actual suspects were not the juvenile girls, but rather three men \u2014 Tristan Naugle, Dereck Bruce and Brelon Young. Officer Palozzi discovered that the men were hiding in appellant\u2019s home in a crawl space. Appellant was not home when officers initially arrived, but returned home shortly thereafter. Officer Palozzi spoke with appellant, and his body microphone recorded the conversation. During that conversation, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>first lied to Officer Palozzi. Instead of telling him that she had just transported the suspects to the bus station, she initially told him that she had just returned home from a trip to the store. She later changed her story. Appellant told Officer Palozzi that after the police had arrested her daughter and her friend and left her home earlier that morning, she observed her brother and Bruce exiting the crawl space and did not contact police, but instead took them to the bus station. This conversation was played for the court twice, once during Officer Palozzi\u2019s testimony and once during appellant\u2019s testimony. Additionally, during appellant\u2019s own testimony, she admitted that she went through with dropping the men off at the bus station even after she learned that they had committed the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 20} The trial judge acting as the trier of fact in appellant\u2019s case was free to accept or reject any and all of the evidence offered by the parties and assess the witness\u2019s credibility. \u201c \u201cWhile the jury may take note of the inconsistencies and resolve or discount them accordingly * * * such inconsistencies do not render defendant\u2019s conviction against the manifest weight or sufficiency of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Craig </em>(Mar. 23, 2000), Franklin App. No. 99AP-739, 2000 WL 297252, *3, quoting <em>State v. Nivens </em>(May 28, 1996), Franklin App. No. 95APA09-1236, 1996 WL 284714, *3. Indeed, the jurors need not believe all of a witness\u2019s testimony, but may accept only portions of it as true. <em>State v. Raver, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-604, 2003-Ohio-958, 2003 WL 723225, \u00b6 21, citing <em>State v. Antill </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 26 O.O.2d 366, 197 N.E.2d 548; <em>State v. Burke, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1238, 2003-Ohio-2889, 2003 WL 21291042, citing <em>State v. Caldwell </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 667, 607 N.E.2d 1096. Although the evidence may have been circumstantial, we note that circumstantial evidence has the same probative value as direct evidence. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 21} In the case at bar, the trial judge heard the witnesses, evaluated the evidence, and was convinced of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, we find that no manifest injustice occurred. Further, there is no reasonable possibility that had the trial judge heard the testimony of Tammara Crawford, he would have found appellant not guilty. <em>State v. Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 403, 2 O.O.3d 495, 358 N.E.2d 623, vacated on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 24} In her second assignment of error, appellant claims that the trial court\u2019s finding of guilty was against the sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>{\u00b6 25} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, our inquiry focuses primarily upon the adequacy of the evidence; that is, whether the evidence, if believed, could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541, 546, stating that \u201csufficiency is the test of adequacy\u201d; <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492. The standard of review is whether, after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560; <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 273, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 26} Weight of the evidence addresses the evidence\u2019s effect of inducing belief. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 25-26. \u201cIn other words, a reviewing court asks whose evidence is more persuasive \u2014 the state\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s? * * * [E]ven though there may be sufficient evidence to support a conviction, a reviewing court can still re-weigh the evidence and reverse a lower court\u2019s holdings.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>\u00b6 25-26. However, an appellate court may not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, but must find that \u201c \u2018the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. Accordingly, reversal on manifest-weight grounds is reserved for \u201c \u2018the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>Martin </em>at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>State v. Thompkins, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held, \u201cTo reverse a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the judgment is not sustained by sufficient evidence, only a concurring majority of a panel of a court of appeals reviewing the judgment is necessary.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. However, to \u201creverse a judgment of a trial court on the weight of the evidence, when the judgment results from a trial by jury, a unanimous concurrence of all three judges on the court of appeals panel reviewing the case is required.\u201d Id. at paragraph four of the syllabus; <em>State v. Miller, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 384, 2002-Ohio-4931, 775 N.E.2d 498, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 28} Employing the above standard, we believe that the state presented sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant committed the offense of obstructing justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 29} The elements of obstructing justice as charged in appellant\u2019s case are (1) no person, with purpose to hinder the discovery, apprehension, prosecution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>conviction or punishment, (2) of another for crime, or to assist another to benefit from the commission of a crime, (3) harbor or conceal the other person, or (4) provide the other person with money, transportation, a weapon, a disguise or other means of avoiding discovery or apprehension, or (5) communicate false information to any person. R.C. 2921.32(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 30} Viewing the evidence in the case at bar in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a reasonable person could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had committed the crime of obstructing justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 31} We hold, therefore, that the state met its burden of production regarding each element of the crime and, accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 32} As an appellate court, we neither weigh the evidence nor judge the credibility of witnesses. Our role is to determine whether there is relevant, competent, and credible evidence upon which the fact-finder could base its judgment. Cross <em>Truck Equip. Co. v. Joseph A. Jeffries Co. </em>(Feb. 10, 1982), Stark App. No. CA-5758, 1982 WL 2911. \u201cA fundamental premise of our criminal trial system is that \u2018the <em>jury </em>is the lie detector.\u2019 <em>United States v. Barnard, </em>490 F.2d 907, 912 (C.A.9 1973) (emphasis added), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 959, 94 S.Ct. 1976, 40 L.Ed.2d 310 (1974). Determining the weight and credibility of witness testimony, therefore, has long been held to be the \u2018part of every case [that] belongs to the jury, who are presumed to be fitted for it by their natural intelligence and their practical knowledge of men and the ways of men.\u2019 <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, </em>140 U.S. 76, 88, 11 S.Ct. 720, 724-725, 35 L.Ed. 371 (1891).\u201d <em>United States v. Scheffer </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 303, 313, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 33} Although appellant cross-examined the witnesses and argued that she had no knowledge that the men were hiding in her house, and further, that she did not know until they were exiting the car that they had committed any crime, the weight to be given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are issues for the trier of fact. <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 552 N.E.2d 180, certiorari denied (1990), 498 U.S. 881, 111 S.Ct. 228, 112 L.Ed.2d 183. The trial judge was free to accept or reject any and all of the evidence offered by the parties and assess the witness\u2019s credibility. \u201c \u2018While the jury may take note of the inconsistencies and resolve or discount them accordingly * * * such inconsistencies do not render defendant\u2019s conviction against the manifest weight or sufficiency of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Craig, </em>2000 WL 297252, *3, quoting <em>State v. Nivens, </em>1996 WL 284714, *3. Indeed, the jurors need not believe all of a witness\u2019s testimony, but may accept only portions of it as true. <em>State v.

The jury did not create a manifest injustice by concluding that appellant was guilty of the crimes of burglary and violating a protection order. We conclude that the trier of fact, in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, did not create a manifest injustice to require a new trial. The jury heard the witnesses, evaluated the evidence, and was convinced of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Stark County, Ohio, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-8\">Hoffman, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b637-9\">Farmer, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b637-10\">Farmer, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">{\u00b6 37} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s view that the harmless-error rule applies to the resolution of assignment of error I.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">{\u00b6 38} The majority does not address the issue of the refusal of the trial court to grant a continuance to resolve the Fifth Amendment issues of Crawford\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">{\u00b6 39} The purpose of the continuance was to secure independent legal counsel for Crawford so she could be advised of the consequences of testifying about her involvement in the incident. The trial court denied this request, given its prior diatribe about the lateness of the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">{\u00b6 40} Generally, a denial of a continuance is viewed under the abuse-of-discretion standard, which is a determination as to whether the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983) 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. This court is required to balance this standard against appellant\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed rights to compulsory and due process. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution establishes a defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process. It provides, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor * * Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution similarly affords a defendant the right to compulsory process. \u201cCompulsory process enables a defendant to present his or her defense by means of subpoenaing witnesses on his or her behalf and by requiring subpoenaed witnesses to produce books, papers, documents, or other evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Buhrman </em>(Sept. 12, 1997), Greene App. No. 96 CA 145, 1997 WL 566154, *7. The essence of \u201cdue process of law\u201d under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution is \u201cfair play.\u201d The absolute fundamentals of due process are jurisdiction, adequate notice, and a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">{\u00b6 41} I would balance these issues in a vacuum, not knowing whether Crawford, after being counseled, would have waived her right against self-incrimination. Also, we cannot determine Crawford\u2019s credibility, as that is within the province of the triers of fact. <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 552 N.E.2d 180, certiorari denied (1990), 498 U.S. 881, 111 S.Ct. 228, 112 L.Ed.2d 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 42} In balancing these factors, I would find that appellant\u2019s right to compulsory process trumps the trial court\u2019s discretion to deny the continuance of the nonjury trial. The continuance would not have inconvenienced any of the state\u2019s witnesses, as they had testified at the previous hearing held on May 16, 2008. In fact, the May 16, 2008 hearing was interrupted by a sua sponte continuance by the trial court:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 43} Second, appellant took the witness stand during her case-in-chief. This was done after the trial court\u2019s denial of the Crawford testimony on a continuance. I would find that placing appellant in this untenable position was tantamount to forcing her to testify against herself. Because appellant\u2019s choice to testify was a substantial right, I would find that it is unjust to employ the harmless standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 44} I would reverse the conviction and remand the matter for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
