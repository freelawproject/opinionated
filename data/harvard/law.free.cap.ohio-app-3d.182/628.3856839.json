Anthony M. Johnson, defendant below and appellant herein, pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of crack cocaine in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant assigns the following errors for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-15\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-16\">The trial court did not comply with Ohio Criminal Rule 11 when it entered into a negotiated a [sic ] plea agreement with the parties which was legally impossible and failed to advised <em>[sic </em>] the appellant that the plea in case number 04 CR 281 would require that the appellant serve mandatory time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3p\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-17\">The trial court erred in not allowing the appellant to withdraw his plea based upon him being under the influence of crack-cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">The appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">The trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentence^] on remand as the only statutory authority for imposing consecutive terms was stricken by the Ohio Supreme Court as being unconstitutional in <em>State v. Foster </em>(2006) 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 845 N.E.2d 470.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">FIFTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">The trial court involvement in the plea negotiations should bind the court to the agreed sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">{\u00b6 3} On February 25, 2004, authorities executed a search warrant at 1526 Twelfth Street, Portsmouth. Deputies chased several occupants of that building, including appellant, outside. A subsequent search revealed that appellant possessed a baggie of \u201cwhite rocks,\u201d later identified as crack cocaine. The Scioto County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging appellant with one count of cocaine possession and one count of trafficking (case No. 04CR281).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">{\u00b6 4} On April 23, 2004, authorities executed another search warrant at 1417 Fourth Street, Portsmouth. There they found appellant and, once again, he possessed a baggie that contained a white powdery substance, later identified as cocaine. The Scioto County Grand Jury returned an indictment, charging appellant with possession (case No. 04CR500).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant initially pleaded not guilty, but later agreed with the prosecution to plead guilty to the two possession counts in exchange for (1) the dismissal of the trafficking charge, (2) the imposition of a three-year prison sentence in case No. 04CR281, (3) the imposition of a four-year prison sentence in case No. 04CR500, (4) that the sentences be served consecutively for a total of seven years\u2019 imprisonment, and (5) that appellant be eligible for judicial release after four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">{\u00b6 6} After reviewing the terms of the agreement and advising appellant of his rights, on August 5, 2005, the trial court accepted appellant\u2019s pleas and found him guilty. The court set the matter for sentencing on September 13, 2005, but appellant did not appear in the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">{\u00b6 7} Approximately one year later, appellant was apprehended in Franklin County and returned to Scioto County for sentencing. On December 11, 2006, appellant filed a motion to withdraw his previously entered guilty pleas and claimed that he agreed to the prosecution\u2019s terms while under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">{\u00b6 8} At the December 20, 2006 hearing, appellant conceded that he passed a drug test on the day that he pleaded guilty. He explained, however, that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ingested a substance called \u201cReally Clean\u201d or \u201cExtra Clean\u201d that he had purchased in Columbus and that this substance masked the presence of drugs in his system. Appellant further related that on his way to Scioto County for the hearing, he smoked crack cocaine. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AG8\">{\u00b6 9} The matter proceeded to sentencing and at that point becomes somewhat confusing. The transcript of the December 20, 2006 sentencing hearing indicates that the trial court sentenced appellant to serve eight years\u2019 imprisonment in case No. 04CR281 and three years in case No. 04CR500, with the two sentences to be served consecutively, for a total of 11 years. A judgment entry in case No. 04CR281 imposed the sentence pronounced at the hearing. Similarly, in case No. 04CR500, a judgment entry was filed the same day as the sentencing hearing and reflected the same sentence imposed at the hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 10} However, on February 20, 2007, nunc pro tunc entries were filed in each case. The nunc pro tunc entry in case No. 04CR281 imposed a reduced three-year prison sentence, and the nunc pro tunc entry in case No. 04CR500 retained the same three-year sentence imposed in the December 20, 2006 entry. The entry in case No. 04CR281 further states that the sentences in both cases must be served consecutively, for a total of seven years. In view of the three-year sentences imposed in both entries, however, the aggregate total time in prison could only be six years. As for the nunc pro tunc entry in case No. 04CR500, that judgment specified that the consecutive sentences should total 11 years, which is mathematically impossible in light of the three-year sentences imposed in both of the entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 11} Appeals were taken from those judgments and the nunc pro tunc entries. Because it was unclear exactly what sentences the trial court actually imposed, we vacated appellant\u2019s sentences. See <em>State v. Johnson, </em>Scioto App. Nos. 07CA3135 and 07CA3136, 2007-Ohio-7173, 2007 WL 4615951. A new sentencing hearing was held on February 15, 2008, at which time appellant was sentenced to eight years in case No. 04-CR-281 and three years in case No. 04-CR-500. On remand, the trial court ordered the two sentences to be served consecutively, for a total of 11 years\u2019 imprisonment. These appeals followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant asserts in his first assignment of error that the terms of the 2005 plea agreement are legally unenforceable and, thus, render his plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>involuntary and unknowing and require us to vacate the agreement. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 13} The basis for appellant\u2019s argument stems from the terms of the 2005 plea agreement. The transcript of the 2005 change-of-plea hearing reveals that as part of the agreement, appellant was informed that \u201cthere [would] be no objection to a judicial release at the end of four years in the penitentiary.\u201d The trial court also represented to appellant that it \u201canticipated\u201d that he would be given judicial release within that time frame.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties do not dispute that those assurances were based on a misinterpretation of Ohio law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its brief, the prosecution candidly concedes that during the plea hearing, \u201cthe prosecution, the defendant, and the trial court were all under the mistaken impression that [appellant] would be eligible for judicial release after serving four years of his seven year sentence.\u201d The prosecution further admits that appellant was not \u201celigible for judicial release after serving four years.\u201d Furthermore, at the December 20, 2006 sentencing hearing, the court asked the prosecution why the plea agreement was even entered into \u201cif it\u2019s in violation of law * * *?\u201d The assistant prosecutor answered that \u201cit was probably an oversight at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 14} The central issue in this matter is whether the plea agreement can be permitted to stand, in light of the fact that counsel and the court misrepresented appellant\u2019s eligibility for judicial release. Generally, if the parties and the trial court have made a mutual mistake regarding the terms of a plea agreement, the proper remedy is to rescind it. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hart, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84531, 2005-Ohio-107, 2005 WL 77054, at \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Wintrow, </em>Preble App. No. CA2003-10-021, 2005-Ohio-3447, 2005 WL 1545792, at \u00b6 21; <em>State v. Ulrey </em>(Apr. 30, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 71705, 1998 WL 213085. Here, there is no question that everyone involved in the case sub judice misunderstood the law. We also recognize that the complexity of the felony-sentencing statutes contributed greatly to this misunderstanding. Thus, as in any other contractual situation, no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d existed, and the appropriate recourse is to rescind the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Additionally, the Greene County Court of Appeals recently held in a similar case that by promising a sentence less than what is required by law, a trial court induced the guilty plea based on a promise that was unlawful and could not be fulfilled. The court went on to find that this false promise to the defendant rendered his guilty plea unknowing and void. See <em>State v. Barajas-Larios, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 613, 2008-Ohio-5460, 899 N.E.2d 212, \u00b6 19. Although the Barajas-Larios case involved the misrepresentation of a lighter sentence, rather than eligibility to apply for judicial release, the effect remains the same \u2014 an accused was promised a shorter sentence than Ohio law required.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 16} In the case sub judice, we find no indication of malfeasance. Rather, the evidence in the record points to this as a simple mistake as to the law. Still, concerns for potential future abuse and fundamental fairness require that we not allow a plea agreement to stand when it was obtained on the basis of a misrepresentation to the accused that he would be released from prison earlier than what the law permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 17} The prosecution counters that the mistake is rendered nugatory by appellant\u2019s failure to appear at the original sentencing hearing, thus allowing the trial court to take the original plea agreement \u201coff the table.\u201d The problem, however, is not with the sentence the court imposed, but rather with the terms of the original plea agreement. If the terms of the plea agreement were lawful, and if appellant was not enticed to enter into the agreement due to a misrepresentation of the law, we would agree that the trial court was not bound by the agreement\u2019s terms insofar as sentencing goes. However, this mistake occurred at the change-of-plea hearing. Appellant was ostensibly induced to enter a guilty plea in exchange for the promise that he would be released from prison earlier than what the law allows. We do not believe that this misunderstanding can form the basis of a valid plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 18} For all these reasons, we hereby sustain appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">{\u00b6 19} Because our decision to sustain appellant\u2019s first assignment of error necessitates the reversal of his convictions and sentences, the remaining four assignments of error have been rendered moot and are hereby disregarded. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). Therefore, we hereby reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment, vacate the plea agreement, and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b667-11\">Kline, P.J., and Harsha, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\">. The December 20, 2006 sentencing entry in case No. 04CR281 also formally dismissed count II of the indictment in that case (trafficking) pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\">. We ordered these new appeals consolidated on July 24, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\">. Appellant was represented by different counsel at that time. Also, the trial court judge involved in the change-of-plea hearing is different from the judge who imposed the sentence being appealed herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\">. While neither party has explicitly explained the nature of the error in the plea agreement, we presume it is as follows: The agreement called for appellant to spend stated terms of imprisonment of three and four years, to be served consecutively, for a total of seven years. Under R.C. 2929.20(C)(3), appellant could apply for judicial release no earlier than five years after he began serving his term, rather than the four-year time frame that had been represented to him during the trial court proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
