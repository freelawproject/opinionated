(\u201cSeitz\u201d). Winner contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there were genuine issues of material fact regarding its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>breach-of-eontract claim. Winner also contends that the trial court erred in granting a motion in limine that limited the testimony of Winner\u2019s expert and precluded Winner from establishing proximate cause and damages on its negligence claim. Finally, Winner contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion to strike the testimony of Seitz\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b62} We conclude that the trial court erred in limiting the testimony of Winner\u2019s expert, because there is legitimate disagreement about the scientific theory involved in the case, i.e., the extent of stray voltage required to adversely affect milk production in cows. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it weighed the evidence and gave preclusive effect to certain scientific studies. Consequently, the trial court also erred in rendering summary judgment on behalf of Seitz, because the evidence and the testimony of Winner\u2019s expert, when admitted, establishes genuine issues of material fact regarding the claims against Seitz. Finally, the trial court erred in overruling Winner\u2019s motion to limit the testimony of the defense expert. In rendering an opinion about stray voltage and its effect on animals and milk production, the defense expert relied wholly on scientific literature and was simply a conduit for the out-of-court statements of others. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 3} In 1997, Winner and Seitz entered into a contract for electrical wiring to be installed in a new freestall dairy barn that Winner was budding. Winner wanted to ultimately increase the size of its herd from about 200 to 1,200 Holstein cows. The barn was ready after October 1997, and Winner began adding cows. When Winner first started in the new facility, the cows milked well, but production never recovered after the hot summer of 1998. Winner consulted with five nutritionists to determine why the cows were not producing enough milk. In a normal herd, 75% of the cows should produce over 100 pounds of milk per day. However, Winner was lucky to have ten or 12 cows producing at that level. Winner also experienced problems with breeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b64} Winner experimented with the nutritionists\u2019 various suggestions for several years, but nothing really changed. These suggestions included feeding the cows more grain, lengthening the preparation time for milking (more massaging before the milking process began), removing some grain and substituting more fiber, and some changes in how the cows were being handled.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 5} The final group of nutritionists was from Land O\u2019 Lakes. One of these experts indicated that the Winner cows should be drinking 30 gallons of water per day, but they were not. Milk production was also dropping significantly at about 200 days after the cows gave birth. One of the Land O\u2019 Lakes experts matched Winner\u2019s data with data from 80 other herds and could find no explanation for these problems. After placing the question on the Internet, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>expert received a response from a Pennsylvania State University professor, who suggested that the problem could be caused by stray voltage.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">{\u00b6 6} Stray voltage is a small amount of voltage that can be measured between two contact points. If an animal comes into contact with these points, current will flow and can cause a response in the animal, depending on the amount of voltage and the resistance involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 7} After being alerted to this potential issue, Winner asked Buschur Electric Company to check for stray voltage in the spring of 2004. Buschur employees found that the freestall barn was not grounded at the main service box on the south side of the building (also referred to as the \u201cbackboard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 8} In a barn of this type, there is no plumbing other than a water supply system, and the barn sits on a concrete pad. Water comes from a well to the pump house and is transported down the south side of the barn via two-inch PYC pipe. The pipe comes up out of the ground through the concrete pad. At that point, plastic water hoses are spliced to the pipe and are attached to a steel watering trough. As the cows drink and the water level goes down, the trough fills back up. The barn contained 16 stainless-steel watering troughs.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 9} After discovering that the main service box was not grounded, Buschur\u2019s general superintendent, Byron Bomholt, put in a ground rod and tested the voltage with a \u201cFluke\u201d voltage meter. The meter showed .9 to 1.0 volts of electricity from the steel in the barn to the ground rod. Bomholt concluded that this was a high amount of voltage. Bomholt also found that the pump house was not grounded, either. After both locations were grounded and bonding was done, the reading on the water line in the pump house was .2, and the reading on the water fountain in the barn was also .2. Bomholt indicated that ideally, he would like zero voltage, but he considered these amounts acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 10} Following these repairs, milk production increased about 13 pounds per cow per day for about six weeks, or until July 2004. After that, production was steady for a bit and then began to slowly decrease. In October 2004, Winner asked Bomholt to come back out to check the voltage. At that time, Bomholt obtained a reading on the Fluke meter of .78 volts on the water line from the ground to the pump, because the pump was going bad. After Bomholt replaced the pump, he then obtained a reading of .54 volts.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 11} After the pump replacement, milk production went up a bit, but not the way it had after the previous repairs. Subsequently, at Winner\u2019s request, Dayton Power and Light Co. (\u201cDP &amp; L\u201d), placed a blocker on its neutral, which should have eliminated more voltage. However, even after DP &amp; L put on the blocker, the stray voltage was not entirely eliminated and stayed between .2 and .4 volts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Milk production also did not improve between that time and when the dairy herd and farm were sold in November 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">{\u00b6 12} In May 2006, Winner filed suit against Seitz, alleging negligence, breach of contract, breach of express and implied warranties that Seitz\u2019s work would be done in accordance with industry standards, and tortious interference with business relations. In an amended complaint, Winner alleged that it had sustained $5,433,600 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 13} During the discovery process, Winner identified Gerald Bodman as a voltage expert, and Seitz identified several experts, including Mike Wald, of Investigative Engineering, Inc. (\u201cIEI\u201d). In September 2007, Seitz filed a motion in limine, seeking to preclude Winner from offering opinion testimony linking any alleged stray voltage to claims of lost milk production. The basis for the motion was the lack of support in scientific literature for finding a causal connection between less than one volt of electrical current and reduced milk production. The motion was supported by Wald\u2019s investigation report. In the report, Wald noted that the maximum level of stray voltage shown at the dairy barn was one volt or less. Wald further observed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA review of the academic and industry literature on the subject of stray voltage at dairy farms revealed that while there has been significant research and testing on the effects of stray voltage, and specifically on milk production, not a single study has even suggested that the voltage levels documented at this barn (1 volt or less) could possibly cause a reduction in milk production. In fact, there have been specific studies showing that voltage levels many times higher than those which may have been present in this facility do not cause any negative effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 15} Also attached to the motion was United States Department of Agriculture and Agricultural Research Service (\u201cUSDA\u201d) Agricultural Handbook No. 696, \u201cEffect of Electrical Voltage/Current on Farm Animals.\u201d This handbook was published in 1991 and is referred to in the industry as the \u201cRedbook.\u201d In addition, Seitz submitted a 1995 study by the University of Wisconsin, an undated article on Michigan Stray Voltage Protocols, and a 2003 article written about stray voltage by a professor at the University of Wisconsin. This latter article indicated that the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin had identified one volt measured across a 500 ohm resistor as a level above which action should be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 16} Winner\u2019s response included an affidavit from Gerald Bodman, who is a licensed professional agricultural engineer, as well as scientific articles and papers dated between 1982 and 1997. Bodman indicated that he had conducted extraneous-voltage investigations on over 1,000 farms, representing over 100,000 cows, in 22 to 27 states, and had served as an expert witness in at least 13 cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>dealing with stray voltage. Bodman stated that he had conducted applied research on farms, in \u201creal world\u201d situations approximating conditions in the Winner freestall barn, where the soles of the cows\u2019 feet are in direct contact with manure. Bodman criticized the Redbook as unrepresentative of mainstream science as set out in the published literature and as being simply the opinion of a few authors who had appeared numerous times on behalf of utility companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">{\u00b6 17} According to Bodman, the defense argument was also flawed because it failed to distinguish between the effects of voltage and current. Voltage is the \u201cforce\u201d that drives current through the resistance of the body of the cow. In contrast to humans, cows have much less resistance, with an average of 361 ohms from the mouth to the feet. Based on studies from 1982 to 1985, Bodman concluded that the Redbook had provided false information and had contradicted peer-reviewed literature when it stated that \u201c \u2018the worst case\u2019 for cow plus contact resistance is 500 ohms.\u201d Bodman further stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cGiven these numbers [regarding resistance], the 0.85 volts reportedly found in the Winner barn is sufficient to potentially subject at least some cows to upwards of 4+ milliamps (mA) and the majority of the cows to more than 2 mA. My experience is that as little as 1 mA will adversely affect the majority of cows in a herd. My own experience on my farm with my dairy heifers is that as little as 0.080 mA is sufficient to significantly reduce, if not stop, water intake by cows, which will significantly reduce the cow\u2019s milk production.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cIt is a common strategy in the dairy industry to cause a cow to cease milk production to withhold water from her. In as little as three days, the milk production of most cows is almost stopped. We use this strategy to cause a cessation of milk production when we are trying to dry a cow up in preparation for her next lactation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cBased upon a Missouri study that when a single point of measurement to represent the cows\u2019 feet is used, as Mr. Bomholt did in this case and is customary in the field, the voltage [sic] which a cow would be exposed is actually underestimated by a factor of 1.4. Thus, the voltage to which the Winner cows were exposed was more likely about 1.4 x 0.85 or 1.2 volts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 21} Like the defense expert, Bodman had visited the Winner farm and had access to the repairs Bomholt made between 2004 and 2006. Bodman stated that Seitz had not properly bonded or grounded the freestall barn, and had violated the National Electrical Code (\u201cNEC\u201d). Bodman concluded that these violations proximately caused the cows on Winner\u2019s farm \u201cto be shocked with enough electrical current to cause them to reduce their intake of water, which in turn would cause the reduction in milk production.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>{\u00b6 22} In response, Seitz pointed out that the literature upon which Bodman had relied was 15 to 20 years old. Seitz contended that the court should use more recent research. Seitz also attached a 2005 research paper published in Transactions of the ASAE, a publication of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers. The study concluded that \u201cwhile behavioral modification may occur in a small percentage of animals at exposures of 1 to 2 mA (steady RMS), changes in health and production would not be expected.\u201d Reinemann, Stetson, Laughlin, LeMire, Water, Feed, and Milk Production Response of Dairy Cattle Exposed to Transient Currents, 48 Transactions of the ASAE, Vol. 48(1) 385, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 23} In December 2007, the trial court granted Seitz\u2019s motion in limine. The court concluded that Bodman was qualified to testify as an expert, but rejected his proposed opinion on the amount of voltage required to negatively affect milk production. The court noted that stray voltage and its effect on milk production is a controversial topic, and there is no apparent consensus among experts. However, the court gave \u201cgreater weight\u201d to the more recent literature, which states that stray voltage may not need to be remedied until a 2.0 volt threshold is reached and that even the application of 4 volts causes production problems in only a small percentage of cows. The court, therefore, found that Bodman\u2019s expert opinions were not based on objectively verifiable or widely accepted scientific principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 24} Following the liminal decision, Seitz filed a motion for summary judgment, incorporating the content of its motion in limine and arguing that the voltage measurements taken on the farm were harmless as a matter of law. In addition, the motion was supported by the testimony of defense expert Michael Wald. Winner subsequently moved to strike Wald\u2019s testimony, contending that Wald was not qualified to render any opinion on stray voltage and its effect on cows. Winner also replied to the summary-judgment motion and submitted additional scientific articles to support Bodman\u2019s testimony that the voltage was sufficient to affect milk production.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court overruled Winner\u2019s motion in limine and then rendered summary judgment on Seitz\u2019s behalf. The court concluded that without Bod-man\u2019s testimony, Winner could not present a case to the jury that would meet its burden of persuasion and proof. Winner appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment, setting forth three assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court erred when it granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment as their [sic] remained genuine issues of material fact to be decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 27} In this assignment of error, Winner contends first that exclusion of expert testimony had no bearing on the breach-of-contract claim for the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>repairing the electrical system installed by Seitz. Second, Winner contends that there were genuine issues of material fact, because the court\u2019s limitation of Bodman\u2019s testimony on the proximate-cause issue was incorrect. Winner also argues that expert testimony is not needed, because lay persons understand the fact that electricity injures, even at low levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA trial court may grant a moving party summary judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 56 if there are no genuine issues of material fact remaining to be litigated, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Five Rivers MetroParks </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 754, 760, 732 N.E.2d 422. \u201cWe review decisions granting summary judgment de novo, which means that we apply the same standards as the trial court.\u201d <em>GNFH, Inc. v. W. Am. Ins. Co., </em>172 Ohio App.3d 127, 2007-Ohio-2722, 873 N.E.2d 345, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 29} As a preliminary matter, we agree with Winner that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the breach-of-contract claim. The complaint alleged that Seitz was hired to install electrical wiring and had breached the contract by failing to ground the dairy barn and by defectively wiring the well pump. These actions were allegedly in violation of the NEC. A copy of the contract, in the amount of $38,459, was attached to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 30} Randy Winner, one of the owners of Four Star and Winner Brothers, testified that Seitz Electric had been hired to design and construct the electrical system for the new dairy barn. When Buschur Electric repaired the system in May 2004, various deficiencies and violations of the NEC were found, including the failure to ground the main service or backboard at the freestall barn and failure to ground the pump house. Buschur made repairs to the property and corrected the code violations. Winner\u2019s expert, Bodman, who was a professional engineer and well versed in electrical matters, testified that Seitz\u2019s electrical work was not bonded and grounded and did not conform to minimum standards required in the industry and community for electricians wiring a freestall barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe essential elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are the existence of a contract, performance by the plaintiff, breach by the defendant and resulting damage to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Flaim v. Med. College of Ohio, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1131, 2005-Ohio-1515, 2005 WL 736626, \u00b6 12. \u201cA contract to perform work imposes on the contractor the duty to perform in a workmanlike manner. * * * \u2018 \u201cWorkmanlike manner\u201d has been defined as the way work is customarily done by other contractors in the community.\u2019 * * * Where a contractor fails to perform in a workmanlike manner, the proper measure of damages is the cost to repair the damage to the condition contemplat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ed by the parties at the time of the contract.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>River Oaks Homes, Inc. v. Twin Vinyl, Inc., </em>Lake App. No. 2007-L-117, 2008-Ohio-4301, 2008 WL 3892260, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 32} Based on the factual materials submitted, there are genuine issues of material fact with regard to whether Seitz breached its contract with Winner by failing to perform the electrical work in a workmanlike manner. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the breach-of-contract claim and the breaeh-of-warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 33} The rest of Winner\u2019s argument regarding this assignment of error pertains to the admissibility of Bodman\u2019s voltage theory and will be addressed during our discussion of the second assignment of error. For reasons that will be explained below, we conclude that the trial court also erred in granting summary judgment on the negligence claims against Seitz. Accordingly, Winner\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe trial court erred when it granted defendant\u2019s motion in limine, which is incorporated into the trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 35} In this assignment of error, Winner contends that the trial court improperly invaded the jury\u2019s province by weighing existing scientific evidence and deciding which evidence would be more reliable. The trial court reviewed the competing stray-voltage theories and decided that a threshold level of 2.0 volts is required before milk production is negatively affected. The court, therefore, precluded Bodman from testifying to the contrary. Since none of the alleged stray voltage exceeded 1.0 volt, Winner would be unable to prove its claim for lost milk production.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c[A]dmission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Haines, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 393, 2006-Ohio-6711, 860 N.E.2d 91, \u00b6 50. We review evidentiary decisions for abuse of discretion, which means that the trial court must have acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unconscionably. Decisions may be unreasonable, however, if they lack a sound reasoning process. <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v.

The Ohio Supreme Court subsequently adopted this role for Ohio trial court judges. See <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 616, 687 N.E.2d 735, and <em>Terry v.

After the trial court rules on admissibility, its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Miller, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 616, 687 N.E.2d 735. Furthermore, although the trial court\u2019s discretion is not unlimited, appellate courts cannot substitute their judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Valentine v.

The trial court noted that stray voltage and its effect on milk production is a controversial topic, and there is no apparent consensus among experts. However, the court gave greater weight to the more recent literature, which states that stray voltage may not need to be remedied until a 2.0 volt threshold is reached, and that even the application of 4 volts causes production problems in only a small percentage of cows. In particular, the court was more persuaded by literature promulgated in 1991 by the USDA: the \u201cRedbook.\u201d Accordingly, the court found that Bodman\u2019s expert opinions were not based on objectively verifiable or widely accepted scientific principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 49} Winner notes that it provided the trial court with 38 publications and treatises that address the \u201clevel of concern\u201d for stray voltage, i.e., publications that show the level of some effect on cows and milk production at below one volt. Winner further notes that 14 of these articles are more recent than the 1991 USDA Redbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cStray voltage is a phenomenon in which voltage returning to the ground after powering an appliance is able to pass through an object not intended as a conductor.\u201d <em>Siewert v. N. States Power Co. </em>(Minn.App.2008), 757 N.W.2d 909, 913. The phenomenon has been explained as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cIn order to understand stray voltage or neutral-to-earth voltage, one must first understand the neutral-grounded network. All electricity leaving an electrical substation must return to that substation in order to complete a circuit. Unless that circuit is completed, electricity will not flow. The current leaves the substation on a high voltage line which eventually connects to some electrical \u2018appliance.\u2019 After exiting the \u2018appliance\u2019 that current must return to the substation. The neutral-grounded network provides the returning current two choices. Either it can return via the neutral line, which accounts for the second wire on our electrical poles, or it can return through the ground. These two pathways comprise the grounded-neutral network. Electricity flows through the path of lowest resistance. If there exists more resistance in the neutral line than in the ground, the current will flow through the ground to return to the substation. Neutral-to-earth voltage or stray voltage will occur when current moves from either the neutral line to the ground or from the ground to the neutral line. It uses a cow as a pathway if that animal happens to bridge the gap between the two. A cow\u2019s hooves provide an excellent contact to the earth while standing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>wet concrete or mud, while at the same time the cow is contacting the grounded-neutral system consisting of items such as metal stanchions, stalls, feeders, milkers, and waterers. The current simply uses the cow as a pathway in its eventual return to the substation. Apparently very slight voltages can affect cattle. Evidence [has] suggested anything greater than one volt can be catastrophic to a dairy farm.\u201d <em>Larson v. Williams Elec. Co-op., Inc. </em>(N.D.1995), 534 N.W.2d 1, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 52} Several states have addressed the issue of stray voltage and have adopted regulations requiring preventative measures. For example, Idaho has a detailed set of requirements adopted pursuant to Idaho\u2019s Stray Current and Voltage Remediation Act, which was enacted in 2005. See Idaho Code 61-803. The legislative findings accompanying Idaho\u2019s act state as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cThe legislature also finds that the potential impact of stray current or voltage on dairy cows is a matter of interest and concern to dairy producers with dairies situated near and served by a multi-grounded wye electrical distribution system, which is the type of distribution system used by utilities in this state. Scientific research has established a level of stray current or voltage, at or below which no effect on a dairy cow\u2019s behavior, health or milk production has been shown. To provide for the continued, safe and efficient availability of electricity while addressing complaints regarding stray current or voltage, it is necessary and appropriate to: establish a uniform preventive action level; establish uniform procedures and protocols for measurements of stray current or voltage; require, when necessary, that the sources of stray current or voltage be identified; require, when necessary, adequate remediation; and establish procedures for handling complaints.\u201d Idaho Code 61-801.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 54} Idaho\u2019s Stray Voltage and Remediation Act does not define the level below which current has no effect on milk production. However, Idaho\u2019s act and the regulations passed pursuant to the act define what is referred to as a \u201cpreventative action level\u201d (\u201cPAL\u201d). When the utility\u2019s share of the PAL exceeds 50% of the PAL, the utility is required to initiate remedial procedures within five days that reduce the voltage attributable to the utility\u2019s distribution system to 50 percent or less of the preventative action level. Idaho Code 61-804.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 55} The PAL is defined as \u201cstray current or voltage that is either:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(a) A steady-state, root mean square (rms), alternating current (AC) of 2.0 milliamp (mA) or more through a 500 ohm resistor connected between cow contact points, as measured by a true rms meter; or</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(b) A steady-state, rms, AC voltage of 1.0 volts or more, across (in parallel with) a 500 ohm resistor connected between cow contact points, as measured by a true rms meter.\u201d Idaho Code 61-802(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>{\u00b6 58} Idaho has also devised detailed administrative procedures to deal with these issues. See Idaho Adm.Code 31.61.02.010 through 31.61.02.092. These definitions and remediation requirements imply that stray current of 2.0 mA or more, or 1.0 volts or more, is capable of causing injury to cattle. If not, there would be no reason to require remediation, particularly within such a short time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 59} Michigan uses a similar preventive action level, defined as \u201ca steady state animal contact current that meets or exceeds 2 milliamperes RMS using a nominal 500 ohms resistor at 60 Hz from all sources, including off-premises and on-premises sources.\u201d Michigan Adm.Code R. 460.2701(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 60} In the present case, Bodman testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c[T]he .085 volts reportedly found in the Winner barn is sufficient to potentially subject at least some cows to upwards of 4+ milliamps (mA) and the majority of the cows to 2mA. My experience is that as little as 1 mA will adversely affect the majority of cows in a herd. My own experience on my farm with my dairy heifers is that as little as 0.080 mA is sufficient to significantly reduce if not stop water intake by dairy heifers. If they were lactating cows, the reduced water intake would significantly reduce milk production.\u201d Thus, the current was above what Michigan and Idaho have identified as preventative action levels and what Idaho has said requires very prompt remediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 62} In <em>Hoffmann v. Wisconsin Elec. Power Co., </em>262 Wis.2d 264, 2003 WI 64, 664 N.W.2d 55, the plaintiffs sued the Wisconsin Electric Power Company (\u201cWEPCO\u201d), alleging that the distribution system was causing excessive amounts of electrical current to flow through their farm and was damaging the health and productivity of the livestock. 262 Wis.2d 264, 2003 WI 64, 664 N.W.2d 55, \u00b6 7. In 1995, WEPCO tested the system and concluded that the current level was below the Wisconsin Public Service Commission\u2019s (\u201cPSC\u2019s\u201d) existing \u201clevel of concern.\u201d This level of concern has been defined as \u201cthe level above which corrective or mitigative action should be taken if production or behavioral problems exist, which is one milliampere in the \u2018cow contact\u2019 areas.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 5. Despite this fact, a jury found in favor of the plaintiffs. Id. at \u00b6 7. On appeal, the Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to be bound by the PSC\u2019s findings in the \u201ccow contact\u201d protocol as to harm caused by stray voltage. Id. at \u00b6 11-14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>court, therefore, concluded that WEPCO could be held liable even if there were no cow contact measurements that exceeded one milliampere. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">(\u00b6 63} In <em>Hoffmann, </em>the court also noted that the plaintiffs had presented the theory that nontraditional stray voltage was harming the herd and that \u201ctraditional stray voltage is not the only kind of electrical current that can harm animals.\u201d <em>Hoffmann, </em>262 Wis.2d 264, 2003 WI 64, 664 N.W.2d 55, \u00b6 14. The court concluded that the \u201centire evidentiary picture\u201d was sufficient to sustain the verdict, even though the PSC findings were inconclusive about the effect of nontraditional stray voltage on cows. Id. at \u00b622. This evidentiary picture included testimony from experts about the effect of ground current or nontraditional stray voltage. Id. at \u00b6 17. In addition, the court noted that:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cThe Hoffmann\u2019s [sic] expert witnesses also disputed studies introduced at trial by WEPCO\u2019s expert witnesses regarding the effect of electricity on cows. The Hoffmann\u2019s [sic] expert witnesses testified that there is a significant difference between controlled laboratory studies, where cows are exposed to electricity for only short periods of time, and constant, long-term exposure to electrical currents, which is what the Hoffmanns contended that their cows had experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 65} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cIn addition, the Hoffmanns themselves testified regarding their extensive efforts to address the problems with their dairy herd, which were largely to no avail. The Hoffmanns, with the assistance of their herd veterinarian and nutritionist, explored and exhausted possible causes of the poor health and reduced milk production of their cows, and ultimately concluded that electricity was the only source that had not been eliminated.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 18-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 67} In <em>Muth v. Wisconsin Elec. Power Co., </em>293 Wis.2d 361, 2006 WI App. 101, 715 N.W.2d 240, the plaintiffs sued WEPCO and were awarded damages, based on stray voltage that had allegedly affected their dairy herd. 293 Wis.2d 361, 2006 WI App. 101, 715 N.W.2d 240, at \u00b6 1-2. When the plaintiffs had asked WEPCO to investigate stray-voltage problems, the utility performed some testing and installed an isolator on the farm. However, WEPCO took the position that no other action was necessary because the level of stray voltage was less than one milliampere. Id. at \u00b6 7. In affirming the judgment for the plaintiffs, the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>appeals relied on <em>Hoffmann, </em>noting that \u201ca utility may be [held] liable for negligence for damages caused by stray voltage even when no measurements exceed one milliampere.\u201d <em>Muth </em>at \u00b6 11. The court went on to note that in any event, the record in the case provided evidence of both stray voltage in excess of one milliampere and defects in the utility\u2019s system and distribution. Id. at \u00b6 13. Accordingly, the court concluded that the jury could reasonably find that WEP-CO\u2019s negligence caused harm and damage to the plaintiffs. Id. at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 68} Subsequently, in <em>Gumz v. N. States Power Co., </em>305 Wis.2d 263, 2007 WI 135, 742 N.W.2d 271, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed a jury verdict for plaintiffs in a stray-voltage case. 305 Wis.2d 263, 2007 WI 135, 742 N.W.2d 271, \u00b6 1-4 and 21. As in the cases just discussed, the utility tested the plaintiffs\u2019 dairy farm and found voltage that was below the \u201clevel of concern.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15 and 17. In fact, the utility tested twice, in 1996 and 1999, and found on both occasions that voltage was below the level of concern. Id.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 69} The plaintiffs\u2019 expert testified that \u201cexposure to stray voltage had a substantial adverse effect on the herd\u2019s production.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19. In contrast, the defense expert concluded that the alleged damages were the result of a variety of factors, including poor herd management and nutrition. Id. at \u00b6 20. On appeal, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 70} On appeal, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected the defense contention that it could not be held liable for damages caused by its system without notice of a problem. Id. at \u00b6 74-77. The court observed that the utility\u2019s argument was inconsistent with prior cases, where \u201cutilities were found liable for damages caused by stray voltage, even though the utilities did not know that stray voltage from their systems was causing damage to the plaintiffs.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 78. One of the cases cited by the court during this discussion was <em>Allen v. Wisconsin Pub. Serv. Corp., </em>279 Wis.2d 488, 2005 WI App. 40, 694 N.W.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 71} <em>In Allen, </em>both the plaintiff and defense experts found current measuring less than one milliampere on the plaintiffs farm. 279 Wis.2d 488, 2005 WI App. 40, 694 N.W.2d 420, \u00b6 27. The jury determined that stray voltage from the utility\u2019s distribution system caused harm to the dairy farm and that the utility\u2019s negligence had caused the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 72} On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the jury verdict, finding, among other things, that the nuisance award was not excessive in light of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u201cexperience ultimately leading to finding the source of his herd\u2019s problems.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. The court observed that the plaintiff had endeavored for years to discover the source of his problems and had called the utility to his farm on multiple occasions to test for stray voltage, but had been told \u201che did not have a problem or that the problem was on his farm and not a result of WPS\u2019s [the utility\u2019s] electrical system.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the court concluded that the award was justified. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 73} In considering the plaintiffs cross appeal for treble damages, which could have been awarded if the utility\u2019s conduct had been wanton, willful, or reckless, the court of appeals commented that:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cWPS points to studies by the United States Department of Agriculture and by state agencies such as the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, which regulates WPS, that discuss an electric current\u2019s effect on dairy cattle. These sources agree that current below four milliamperes has no adverse affect on dairy cows. The USDA has determined that cows do not perceive electricity below one milliampere, and voltage at that level does not affect milk production. Both WPS\u2019s and Allen\u2019s experts found current measuring less than one milliampere on Allen\u2019s farm. WPS cannot be faulted for following plausible science when it concluded there was no problem. Consequently, Allen has not shown that WPS acted willfully, wantonly or recklessly. Thus the trial court did not err in denying Allen\u2019s request for treble damages.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 75} Notably, the court\u2019s comment that the science upon which WPS relied is \u201cplausible\u201d does not mean that it is the only science possible. The above authorities demonstrate that there is dispute about the extent of stray voltage required to adversely affect milk production and that recovery has been permitted in recent cases, even where the tested current is less than one milliampere. While the Wisconsin Public Service Commission takes one viewpoint, that is not the only possible conclusion, and even Wisconsin courts have refused to give preclusive effect to the agency\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 76} Accordingly, the trial court erred in its reasoning process and therefore abused its discretion when it weighed the evidence and gave preclusive effect to certain studies. \u201cA court should not focus on whether the expert opinion is correct or whether the testimony satisfies the proponent\u2019s burden of proof at trial. * * * Moreover, evidence should not be excluded merely because it is questionable or confusing, since the experts\u2019 opinions would be subject to cross-examination and the credibility of them conclusions left to the trier of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gilmore v. Village Green Mgt. Co., </em>178 Ohio App.3d 294, 2008-Ohio-4566. 897 N.E.2d 1142. 1146. \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>{\u00b6 77} Based on the preceding discussion, we conclude that the trial court erred in restricting Bodman\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, when Bodman\u2019s testimony is considered, genuine issues of material fact exist that preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cIt is fundamental that in order to establish a cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff must show (1) the existence of a duty, (2) a breach of duty, and (3) an injury proximately resulting therefrom.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Best Buy Co., Inc., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088, \u00b6 8. As we noted, Bodman testified that Seitz failed to properly ground or bond the freestall barn and thus violated the NEC. Bodman concluded that these violations proximately caused the cows on the Winner farm to be shocked with enough electrical current to cause them to reduce their intake of water, which in turn caused the reduction in milk production. Accordingly, there were genuine issues of material fact with regard to whether Seitz\u2019s alleged negligence proximately caused injury to Winner\u2019s dairy business.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 79} We should note that Seitz devotes a substantial portion, if not all, of its brief, to the argument that a lack of grounding did not cause the stray-voltage problem, and to disputing Bodman\u2019s substantive conclusions. However, these are arguments that bear on the weight or credibility to be given the evidence, not its admissibility. \u201cWhen reviewing a motion for summary judgment, a court must be careful not to weigh the evidence or judge the credibility of witnesses. * * * Instead, it must consider all of the evidence and reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidentiary materials in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cox v.

In this regard, Winner relies on a decision by the Iowa Supreme Court, which rejected the requirement of expert testimony in stray-voltage cases. See <em>Schlader v. Interstate Power Co. </em>(Iowa, 1999), 591 N.W.2d 10, 14. In <em>Schlader, </em>the Iowa Supreme Court stated as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cThe subject of stray voltage is certainly technical. But the nature of electricity and the results of contact with it by humans and animals is not beyond a common person\u2019s understanding.

Winner points out that this was Wald\u2019s first stray-voltage case and was Wald\u2019s first case involving levels of voltage that are harmful to animals. In addition, Winner notes that Wald had no direct knowledge or expertise about inappropriate levels of stray voltage and its affect on cows. Instead, Wald simply \u201csurfed\u201d the Internet and read articles to formulate his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cThe determination of the admissibility of expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial court. * * * Such decisions will not be disturbed absent abuse of discretion. * * * \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 suggests unreasonableness, arbitrariness, or unconscionability.\u201d <em>Valentine, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 42, 2006-Ohio-3561, 850 N.E.2d 683, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 87} In <em>Beard v.

We agree with the decisions in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cOur decision is consistent with the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Evid.R. 702(B) provides that a \u2018witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony.\u2019 Pursuant to this rule, a witness becomes qualified to testify as an expert by virtue of the fact that he or she has been exposed to and has absorbed information from sources that may not be admissible under the Rules of Evidence. Evid.R. 703 states that an expert witness may base his or her opinion on facts or data \u2018perceived by him or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u2019 However, we have acknowledged that information that would not be admissible at trial may serve as a basis for an expert\u2019s background knowledge without violating Evid.R. 703. * * * Moreover, Evid.R. 706, the rule that permits impeachment with statements from learned treatises, is based on the premise that experts are likely to rely on professional literature in forming their opinions.

So everything that you know has come from an article of some scientist or some researcher or some university official relating to stray voltage on cows?</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cA. Absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 96} Wald also stated that he was not qualified to answer whether stray voltage or direct current can create secondary problems that have a greater impact on the production of milk than the current itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 97} In declining to strike Wald\u2019s testimony, the trial court simply stated that the motion to strike was being overruled because Wald\u2019s testimony appeared \u201cto be supported by the literature, reasoning, methodology, and other materials that are scientifically valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 98} We conclude that the trial court erred in failing to consider whether Wald\u2019s opinion about the required levels of stray voltage was based wholly on the literature and whether Wald improperly acted as \u201ca conduit for the out-of-coui\u2019t statements of others.\u201d <em>Beard, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 237, 2005-Ohio-4787, 834 N.E.2d 323, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">{\u00b6 99} In <em>Beard, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court expressed concern over this type of situation when discussing the testimony of the defendant-appellant doctor, who had expressed a medical opinion that he had complied with the standard of care for deciding whether to operate on a patient with a low blood count. The Ohio Supreme Court concluded that the doctor\u2019s first statement in this context was proper because the doctor had said only that his medical opinion was consistent with medical literature, without citing any statements from the literature. Id. at \u00b6 28. However, the court then discussed a second statement of the doctor that was more problematic. In this regard, the court noted that:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cAppellant subsequently testified that, in his expert opinion, he had met the standard of care in taking Moss to surgery with a white-blood-cell count of 2,300. His counsel asked him to explain the basis for his opinion, and appellant replied:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">{\u00b6 101} \u201c \u2018A. That opinion is based on the fact that the medical and surgical literature states that patients who have benign familial neutropenia can be operated on safely with white blood cell counts greater than a thousand.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>{\u00b6 102} \u201cThis second reference is more problematic than the first because by answering \u2018the * * * literature states that * * *,\u2019 appellant was apparently offering a statement from the literature. However, appellant did not offer precise statements from the literature so that they might be considered independently to prove compliance with the standard of care in Moss\u2019s case. Instead, he merely referred to statements in the medical and surgical literature while explaining the basis for his previously articulated opinion that he had met the standard of care in Moss\u2019s case. Moreover, he clarified that he was referring, generally, to statements from \u2018various review articles in the medical as well as surgical literature,\u2019 that the literature provided only a partial basis for his opinion, and that his opinion was also based on his education, training, and experience. Pursuant to the Ohio Rules of Evidence, appellant is permitted to testify in this manner.\u201d <em>Beard, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 237, 2005-Ohio-4787, 834 N.E.2d 323, at \u00b6 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">{\u00b6 103} In contrast, Wald\u2019s report makes statements based specifically and solely on scientific literature. For example, the report states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cA review of the academic and industry literature on the subject of stray voltage at dairy farms revealed that while there has been significant research and testing on the effects of stray voltage, and specifically on milk production, not a single study has even suggested that the voltage levels documented at this barn (1 volt or less), could possibly cause a reduction in milk production.\u201d Wald\u2019s report then goes on to cite facts from three specific pieces of literature. Likewise, Wald\u2019s affidavit, submitted in support of the Seitz motion for summary judgment, appears to express opinions that are simply conduits for out-of-court statements of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 105} Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s reliance on Wald\u2019s testimony, at least regarding the effect of stray voltage on cows and the level of voltage required to cause damage to milk production, is not based on a sound reasoning process. The trial court, therefore, abused its discretion in relying on this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b6 106} Based on the preceding discussion, the third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 107} All of Winner\u2019s assignments of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b443-10\">Fain and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>William H.

According to the Wisconsin PSC, \"[t]he 'level of concern\u2019 is not a damage level.

The 'level of concern\u2019 is further broken down into two parts. The first part is a 1-milliAmp contribution from the utility, at which level mitigative action must be taken by that utility to reduce its contribution to below the 1-milliAmp level. The second part is a 1-milliAmp contribution from the farm system, at which level mitigative action should be voluntarily taken by the farmer.\u201d Id. This standard differs from those of Idaho and Michigan, and as was noted, the courts in Wisconsin do not consider themselves bound by this assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\">.
