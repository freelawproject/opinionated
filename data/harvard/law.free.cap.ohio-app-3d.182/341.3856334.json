Riverside Drive, in Franklin County, Ohio. On July 19, 2005, plaintiff-appellee, Linda S. Bruce, was traveling north on Riverside Drive when her vehicle collided with defendant-appellant Kim Junghun\u2019s vehicle traveling east on Hayden Run Road. Junghun was cited for failure to yield, as he had a flashing red light in his direction and Bruce had a flashing yellow light in hers. Bruce was seen at the emergency room and reported having right shoulder and back pain. Bruce followed up with her family doctor, who referred her to a board-certified orthopedic shoulder and elbow specialist, Joseph Mileti, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">{\u00b6 2} Dr. Mileti examined Bruce, who reported persistent pain in the front and side of her shoulder. Bruce was limited in the amount she could move her shoulder because of pain. Mileti ordered an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) test, which was performed on September 6, 2005. According to Mileti, the MRI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>showed a tendonopathy: a degenerative condition of the tendon in which the tendons are not absolutely normal in nature. It can be quite common and is usually asymptomatic, but it can be aggravated with an acute injury to the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 3} Mileti diagnosed Bruce with rotator-cuff tendonopathy and prescribed a course of anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. Bruce continued with physical therapy, and at the time of her last visit to Mileti in July 2006, she was still experiencing some pain. Based on Bruce\u2019s history of no shoulder pain prior to the accident and the development of pain after the accident, Mileti opined that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the cause of the inflammation was the car accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 4} The issue of liability was disposed of by means of a motion for partial summary judgment, and the case proceeded to trial with proximate cause and damages being the only issues for the jury. Junghun failed to appear for trial and did not participate in this appeal. His insurer, Allstate Indemnity Company, defended the case and initiated this appeal. These facts form the basis for Bruce\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 5} Prior to trial, Bruce identified her expert as Mileti. Mileti testified by means of a video deposition. Out of the hearing of the jury, Bruce objected to a portion of the cross-examination of Mileti, and the trial court sustained the objection striking a portion of the testimony. The trial court also allowed Bruce, a retired nurse, to testify as to her understanding of the nature of her injury. Counsel for Junghun objected to Bruce\u2019s testimony, contending that she was testifying as a medical expert when she was never identified as such. The trial court overruled the objection. These objections form the basis for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 6} The jury returned a unanimous verdict for Bruce, awarding her $56,125.92 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 7} On appeal, Junghun raises three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">I. The trial court erred in excluding Dr. Mileti\u2019s testimony regarding the possible causation of Plaintiffs injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">II. The trial court erred in permitting Plaintiff to testify as a medical expert on her own behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">III. The trial court erred in permitting the verdict to stand as the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">{\u00b6 8} Additionally, Bruce has filed a motion to dismiss this appeal. Bruce filed a motion to dismiss this appeal for the reason that Junghun did not appear at trial and could not be located by his counsel after trial and, therefore, could not have consented to the appeal filed in this action. Bruce argues that a nonparty, Allstate Indemnity Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d), directed that this appeal be taken, and that Allstate lacks standing as a party to pursue the appeal. Bruce claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Allstate must make a showing that Junghun elected not to appeal before the right-to-appeal provision in the policy is triggered. According to Bruce, the right-to-appeal provision in the policy does not become effective under circumstances such as these where the insured expresses no intent regarding appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 9} Allstate counters that it is required to defend any action against Junghun that is within the coverage of the policy. In addition, Allstate states that there is no limit to the duty to defend and that the duty extends to the appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 10} Under the \u201cGeneral Statement of Coverage\u201d provision, the contract of insurance provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">We will defend an insured person sued as a result of a covered accident involving an insured auto. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or suit if we believe it is proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 11} Under the section entitled \u201cOur Right to Appeal,\u201d the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">If an insured person or any other insurer elects not to appeal a judgment, we may do so. We will pay the reasonable costs and interest incidental to the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. CPS Holdings, Inc., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 306, 2007-Ohio-4917, 875 N.E.2d 31, at \u00b6 7, the Supreme Court of Ohio reiterated a number of contract principles applicable to insurance policies. When confronted with an issue of contractual interpretation, the role of a court is to give effect to the intent of the parties to the agreement. Id. Courts examine the insurance contract as a whole and presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the language used in the policy. Id. Courts look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the policy unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the contents of the policy. Id. When the language of a written contract is clear, a court may look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">{\u00b6 13} Bearing these principles in mind, we must examine the policy language at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">{\u00b6 14} The language of the policy requires Allstate to defend the insured person. The duty to defend has been held to be an integral and valuable part of the contract. It is a valuable right of the insurer to be able to control the defense of actions in which the insurer may be required to pay the judgment. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Apr. 25, 1984), 9th Dist. No. 11275, 1984 WL 6131. The duty to defend does not automatically cease when the trial court enters judgment. See <em>Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 28, 1990), 11th Dist. No. 89-L-14-177, 1990 WL 222993. The intent of the policy language is two-fold. It requires Allstate to defend, and it gives Allstate the right to pursue an appeal if it believes it is warranted. We do not read the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>contract as saying that Allstate must pursue an appeal if the insured wishes to do so. (It retains the right to settle.) Nor does the policy preclude an appeal if the insured has not explicitly elected not to appeal. Junghun\u2019s absence from the proceedings can be construed as an implied or constructive rejection of the right to appeal. Under that scenario, Allstate has reserved to itself the right to appeal a judgment. The motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 15} We turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> {\u00b6 16} In his first assignment of error, Junghun argues that the trial court committed reversible error in excluding the following testimony of Mileti:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">Q. Okay. Would it be fair, Dr. Mileti, to say that you cannot rule out the Plaintiffs age and level of activity as a reason for this aggravation of her right shoulder because of this degeneration that she had prior to the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">A. I certainly can\u2019t rule it out, but I can \u2014 the aggravation \u2014 there is two separate conditions. There is the chronic degenerative portion which you\u2019re talking about, which, yeah, you\u2019re right, it is a chronic condition. The accident did not cause her tendonopathy, but certainly cause' \u2014 well, I say certainly. I believe it caused the inflammation and the irritation and aggravation of that condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">Q. Okay. Would you expect frequent use of a right shoulder tendonopathy to have equal or similar symptoms to the ones that the Plaintiff was complaining about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">A. If that frequent use would have caused an irritation of the shoulder, certainly it could, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">{\u00b6 17} In sustaining the objection, the trial court stated: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to ask the doctor for an opinion, you have to phrase it appropriate [sic] with an opinion on cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">{\u00b6 18} Junghun argues that his inquiry was permissible on cross-examination to cast doubt on Mileti\u2019s credibility as it points to the possibility that the doctor may not have considered the frequency of Bruce\u2019s use of the injured shoulder. Junghun also states that excluding the testimony was highly prejudicial as it completely undercut the defense theory of alternative causation. Although case law supports appellant\u2019s position that cross-examination may use \u201cpossibility\u201d evidence to \u201cchip away\u201d the plaintiffs case, <em>Conti v. Topolosky </em>(June 17, 1975), 10th Dist. No. 74AP-515, 1975 WL 181450, the appellant made clear in his brief that was not the purpose for which he intended to use the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">{\u00b6 19} The admission or exclusion of evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 68, 723 N.E.2d 1019. Absent an abuse of discretion and material prejudice to appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>an appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling as to the admissibility of evidence, including expert scientific evidence. <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner </em>(1997), 522 U.S. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508; <em>State v. Martin </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 19 OBR 330, 483 N.E.2d 1157. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 20} The standard for the admissibility of expert testimony as it relates to proximate cause was set forth in <em>Stinson v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 633 N.E.2d 532, paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">The admissibility of expert testimony that an event is the proximate cause is contingent upon the expression of an opinion by the expert with respect to the causative event in terms of probability. An event is probable if there is a greater than fifty percent likelihood that it produced the occurrence at issue. Inasmuch as the expression of probability is a condition precedent to the admissibility of expert opinion regarding causation, it relates to the competence of the evidence and not its weight. Consequently, expert opinion regarding a causative event, including alternative causes, must be expressed in terms of probability irrespective of whether the proponent of the evidence bears the burden of persuasion with respect to the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 21} Taking the defense theory at face value, there was no abuse of discretion in striking the testimony because the defense was attempting to use the plaintiffs expert to express an opinion on an alternative-cause theory. Under Stinson, the opinion had to be expressed in terms of probability. Here, defense counsel phrased his question in terms of whether Bruce\u2019s age and activity level could be ruled out as the cause of the aggravation. The follow-up question and response were problematic as well because they presumed the frequent use to have caused an irritation of the shoulder. This called for speculation on the part of Mileti.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">{\u00b6 22} Junghun also points to the doctor\u2019s earlier testimony in which he agreed to express all of his opinions on the basis of a reasonable degree of medical probability. Despite the earlier testimony, the question as phrased by the defense was asking Mileti to give an opinion based on possibility, not probability, and could not be used as an expert opinion to support an alternative-causation theory. There was evidence in the record that Bruce was physically active before the accident and that prior to the accident, she had had no trauma, no injury, no problems, and no symptoms with her shoulder or any of her joints. Therefore, although the possibility that the doctor may have overlooked a potential cause of Bruce\u2019s injury was a permissible line of questioning for cross-examination, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>probative value of such testimony is sharply outweighed by the speculative nature of the testimony. The prejudicial effect of potentially misleading the jury outweighed any potential probative value. See Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>McWreath v. Ross, </em>179 Ohio App.3d 227, 2008-Ohio-5855, 901 N.E.2d 289, the plaintiff experienced neck pain after a 2005 automobile accident. He had been in two prior automobile accidents in 1990 and 1992. The case went to trial with liability established, and the remaining issues of proximate cause and damages were tried to a jury. In a videotaped deposition, the plaintiffs neck surgeon testified that the automobile accident was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs herniated disc that he surgically repaired. The surgeon had also removed two adjoining discs that had degenerated due to the \u201cwear and tear of life.\u201d The surgeon testified that the whiplash injury from plaintiffs automobile accident aggravated the preexisting processes in the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 24} On cross-examination, the defense asked if it were possible that the herniated disc was in the plaintiffs neck before the accident. Over objection, the surgeon testified that it was possible. In its case-in-chief, the defense presented no expert medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 25} The jury returned a zero verdict, and the trial court granted a new trial. The court of appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">Once a prima facie case has been demonstrated, and adverse party may attempt to negate its effect in various ways. She may cross-examine the expert of the other party; she may adduce testimony from another expert that contradicts the testimony of the expert for her adversary; further, she may adduce expert testimony that sets forth an alternative explanation for the circumstances at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Id. at \u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">{\u00b6 26} The defense did not present any medical evidence to contradict the plaintiffs expert, but relied upon cross-examination of the surgeon attempting to show that the plaintiffs disc herniation was caused by a preexisting degenerative condition of the disc and not by the accident. However, the only testimony the defense was able to elicit was that herniation of discs could occur due to degeneration as well as trauma and that it was possible that the disc herniation was the result of degeneration.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">{\u00b6 27} The court of appeals found that by asking whether the herniation could have been preexisting in terms of possibility instead of probability, the cross-examination failed to reveal any contradictions, repudiations, or inconsistencies in the surgeon\u2019s opinion that the herniated disc was caused by the accident. Moreover, the testimony did not even meet the standard of admissibility required for expert testimony setting forth an alternative explanation. Id. at \u00b6 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>{\u00b6 28} In this case, the defense sought to introduce evidence of an alternative causation for Bruce\u2019s shoulder injury by cross-examining Bruce\u2019s expert. The passage that was stricken did not meet the standard of admissibility for expert opinion. In order for the doctor to answer the question whether frequent use of a right shoulder tendonopathy could cause symptoms similar to those Bruce experienced, the doctor had to presume the frequent use caused an irritation to the shoulder. This begs the question of what caused the irritation or aggravation, and would likely lead to jury confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">{\u00b6 29} Having found no abuse of discretion, the first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 30} In the second assignment of error, appellant\u2019s counsel argues that the trial court committed reversible error in allowing Bruce to testify as a medical expert. Bruce was never identified as an expert or qualified as such. She was not asked for her diagnosis of herself or her medical opinion on direct examination. She did relate what she discussed with Mileti and, based on that discussion, she provided her understanding of what was wrong with her shoulder. Bruce related that she had \u201cclassic impingement syndrome,\u201d and over objection was allowed to explain to the jury some of the physiology of the shoulder and her understanding of what impingement was.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 31} Bruce did not testify as a medical expert, but rather as a lay witness providing an opinion. A retired nurse, Bruce\u2019s opinion was based upon her own experiences, observations, discussions with her treating physician, and the reports of her medical tests. The testimony was in accord with Evid.R. 701, which states, \u201cIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 32} Therefore, the second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 33} In his third assignment of error, Junghun claims that the jury verdict was excessive and not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">{\u00b6 34} A judgment supported by some competent, credible evidence will not be reversed by a reviewing court as against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. A reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court where there exists some competent, credible evidence supporting the judgment rendered by the trial court. <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614 N.E.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Here, the jury heard evidence of Bruce\u2019s medical expenses, the pain she experienced at the time of the accident and thereafter, and the limitations she had to put on her formerly active lifestyle because her range of motion is now limited by pain. There existed competent, credible evidence to support the jury award. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 36} Based on the foregoing, we deny the motion to dismiss, and overrule appellant\u2019s three assignments of error. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b385-7\">Brown, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b385-8\">McGrath, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b385-9\">Brown, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AxA\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 37} While I concur in the disposition of the second and third assignments of error, I write separately to address the first assignment of error, which raises the issue whether the trial court erred in excluding Mileti\u2019s testimony on cross-examination as to possible causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 38} Cross-examination can serve several purposes. It may show that a witness should not be believed. See <em>Dorsey v. Parke </em>(C.A.6, 1989), 872 F.2d 163, 167 (noting that a primary purpose of cross-examination is to challenge whether a witness was sincerely telling what he or she believed to be the truth). Cross-examination may also be used to allow the admission of \u201cfacts which support a theory contrary to the one advanced by [the opposing side].\u201d <em>McGowan v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(Apr. 15, 1982), 4th Dist. No. 443, 1982 WL 3422. Destructive cross-examination is designed to attack the credibility of the witness. On the other hand, constructive cross-examination is designed to secure concessions from the witness to be used to support or prove alternative theories or explanations for certain events.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">{\u00b6 39} While each type of cross-examination is an important tool, and is critical to leading a jury to the truth, how a party can use information elicited during cross-examination is a separate matter. For instance, evidence elicited during cross-examination may be admissible for impeaching the credibility of a witness but insufficient to support a questioner\u2019s theory of the case. Likewise, evidence elicited on cross-examination may, without more, provide a sufficient legal basis to support or prove an alternative theory or explanation. Proper jury instructions and arguments of counsel can fairly insure that juries do not use evidence for an improper purpose. See, e.g., <em>Barnett v. Sexten, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-871, 2006-Ohio-2271, 2006 WL 1230676, \u00b6 14 (\u201cWhere evidence is admitted for one purpose but inadmissible for other purposes, the risk that the evidence will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>used for its improper purpose can generally be cured by a limiting instruction explaining the proper use of such evidence\u201d). Thus, if requested, a proper jury instruction would highlight the distinction, noted above, by informing jurors that such testimony may be considered (1) only for impeachment purposes, (2) as admissible to prove an alternative theory or explanation for the circumstances at issue, or (3) as corroboration of an established or subsequently established competent alternative theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 40} If an expert witness concedes that the position advanced by the questioner is more likely than not to be true, then the answer may be used as substantive evidence. On the other hand, if the expert concedes only that the position could, but is not likely to occur, such evidence would be insufficient to support an argument that the position occurred. In the case of <em>Stinson v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 633 N.E.2d 532, the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed the competence of testimony in support of an alternative theory or explanation for the circumstances at issue regardless of whether such testimony was advanced by the plaintiff or defendant or elicited on direct or cross-examination of any witness. The ruling of <em>Stinson </em>has been cited as a basis for unduly restricting cross-examination of experts. I believe <em>Stinson </em>does not preclude or necessarily limit cross-examination when the purpose of the cross-examination is to attack the credibility of the testifying witness or to attack the testimony of another witness or other evidence. Such \u201cdestructive cross-examination\u201d is not necessarily limited by <em>Stinson, </em>as <em>Stinson </em>addresses only the threshold for the admissibility of constructive cross-examination to prove an alternative theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 41} The analysis, thus, first begins by determining whether the cross-examination is constructive or destructive. If the elicited testimony is constructive cross-examination to suppoi-t an alternative theory or explanation for circumstances at issue in the case, then the court should apply the standards set forth in <em>Stinson </em>and require a more-probable-than-not threshold before permitting admission. A secondary analysis would then be utilized to determine whether the cross-examination, even though incompetent under <em>Stinson, </em>is admissible to (1) impeach the witness\u2019 credibility, (2) impeach the testimony of another witness\u2019 credibility or other evidence, or (3) provide some corroboration to another expert\u2019s testimony that did establish the position to a reasonable degree of probability. The evidence elicited on cross-examination thus may be admissible, if relevant, for these limited purposes. A \u201cnot probable concession\u201d could support an argument that attacks or affects the credibility of an expert witness or adds some corroboration to a proponent\u2019s expert witness\u2019s contrary position.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 42} In the instant case, Mileti, the only testifying physician, conceded on cross-examination that paddling a kayak could be a cause of appellee\u2019s injury, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>further opined that it was not probable. Such testimony would be insufficient to argue to the jury that kayaking caused injury to appellee. The trial court properly excluded such testimony on the basis of being incompetent to support an alternative theory or explanation for appellee\u2019s injury. The next question to be addressed is whether the destructive cross-examination is admissible to (1) attack the credibility of the witness, (2) attack the credibility of another witness, or (3) provide corroboration to a competent, alternative explanation. Since appellant did not provide competent evidence for the alternative explanation in his case-in-chief, the concessions of Mileti are not relevant to corroborate such explanation, as none was advanced by appellant. Likewise, such testimony or concession was not inconsistent with other witnesses called by either party, since no other experts testified at trial. The only remaining issue for the court to address is whether the concessions, although \u201cnot probable,\u201d are relevant to attack the credibility of Mileti. The concession that kayaking could be a causative factor if appellee had experienced pain after kayaking could arguably be used by appellant to argue that Mileti did not consider all of the relevant factors and that the basis of his opinion may be flawed, thus affecting his credibility. Appellant could argue that the- jury should simply not believe Mileti\u2019s testimony. The jury should be able to know if the physician considered whether kayaking could, under certain circumstances, cause this type of injury, i.e., a denial might call into question his credibility, while a concession might call into question whether he has evaluated all the history. Thus, I conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining the objection to appellant\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 43} I find, however, the exclusion of the testimony at issue to be harmless under the facts of this case. Part of the excluded expert\u2019s testimony included counsel\u2019s question whether age and level of activity could be a cause of the degeneration appellee suffered prior to the accident. In response, the physician stated he could not rule it out. In his deposition, however, the physician admitted that degeneration occurs over time, and, therefore, the excluded testimony was nothing more than a rehash of what the physician had already testified about. The physician explained, in the objected-to answer, that the degeneration is a chronic condition and that the accident caused an irritation and aggravation of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 44} Further, the expert\u2019s concession on cross-examination was conditional upon appellee experiencing similar symptoms while kayaking, but there was no evidence in the record that appellee had experienced pain in her shoulder after kayaking. In the absence of such evidence, the testimony is not relevant as it does not make a fact more or less probable than it would have been without that evidence. Evid.R. 401. Because Mileti\u2019s opinion was conditional upon appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>having experienced similar symptoms while kayaking, a fact never established, the exclusion of the evidence was clearly harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">{\u00b6 45} Accordingly, I concur with the disposition of the first assignment of error on the basis that the exclusion of the subject testimony constituted harmless error.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b388-5\">McGrath, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AK2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 46} Being unable to agree with the majority opinion\u2019s or the concurring opinion\u2019s disposition of the first and second assignments of error, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 47} As to the first assignment of error, while I agree with the concurring opinion that error occurred, I disagree that the error was \u201charmless.\u201d At issue here is a one-doctor-witness personal-injury case. The defense did not call its own expert to prove an alternative cause and was cross-examining the plaintiffs doctor as to the soundness and credibility of his opinion of causation. Cross-examination is the accepted method to test the soundness of the expert\u2019s opinion and to require an answer as to why and how the expert came to the conclusion that the accident was the probable cause of plaintiffs injury over and above other possible causes. In the majority\u2019s view, once an expert espouses a probable cause, the defense may not even ask the witness if he considered and rejected other possible causes or even acknowledged that other possible causes exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 48} In this case, there is evidence in the form of testimony from the plaintiff, and to some extent, her doctor, that the plaintiff had been and continues to be a very physically active person engaging in physical conditioning, which includes rollerblading, kayaking, and weightlifting. Plaintiffs doctor even acknowledges these activities as strenuous and would not rule out kayaking as the type of activity which could aggravate the preexisting shoulder tendonopathy. Moreover, the excluded testimony reveals not only did the plaintiffs doctor not rule out the plaintiffs physical activity as being a possible aggravating factor, but ultimately he decided it was not the more probable cause, due to the plaintiffs own history of not reporting the activity as causing pain. Thus, we have a situation where Mileti\u2019s \u201cprobable\u201d causation opinion rests entirely on the medical history provided to him by the plaintiff. This raises an issue with respect to the strength and credibility of his opinion, which is linked 100 percent to the credibility of a heavily interested party in reporting symptoms. The jury did not get to consider any of this in weighing the strength of Mileti\u2019s ultimate opinion. All this in a case where the plaintiff is reporting a pain level of two on a ten scale, and evidently kayaking during some of the time period of physical therapy (i.e., kayaking in May and the final visit with Mileti being in July).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>{\u00b6 49} The only reason to exclude questions to a plaintiffs doctor on cross-examination as to how other activities were excluded as causes would be if there were no evidence in the case that the plaintiff engaged in those activities. But that is not the case here where plaintiff, her sister, and even Mileti testified to these very strenuous activities. The doctor was not made to tell the jury what was ruled out and why \u2014 only what was ruled in. So how does a jury weigh the strength and credibility of that opinion?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 50} Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s denial of the basic right of cross-examination to test the credibility of both the plaintiff and her doctor\u2019s opinion with respect to her claimed medical injury was not only error but error that was far from harmless. Where it turns out that the doctor\u2019s opinion on causation versus unrelated causative factors rests solely on the reporting history of the plaintiff to her doctor, then the jury must be able to weigh everyone\u2019s credibility. But here the jury did not get that chance and, thus, the defendant did not get a fair consideration of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 51} Both the majority opinion and the concurring opinion cite <em>Stinson v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 633 N.E.2d 532, as setting forth the law of Ohio governing this matter. However, a review of <em>Stinson </em>reveals that that case actually permitted testimony by a <em>defense medical expert to support an alternative theory of causation, </em>which was stated in something less than a \u201creasonable probability.\u201d In <em>Stinson, </em>the opinion included a discussion of three possible causes, including the plaintiffs expert\u2019s theory and the conclusion that the defense theory was the <em>more possible. </em>The Ohio Supreme Court reasoned that since the competing experts\u2019 opinions included the plaintiffs expert theory as to a \u201cpossible\u201d cause, it was proper to testify to having compared the two possibilities in finding one \u201cmore possible\u201d than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 52} In the case at bar, we have a situation in which the barred questions are asked <em>of only the plaintiff\u2019s expert, </em>which certainly includes the plaintiffs theory of causation within a reasonable degree of medical probability but is also the plaintiffs expert\u2019s explanation of how he arrived there. If one cannot question how the expert arrived at his conclusion, then it is difficult to see how one can test that conclusion through cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 53} Giving the aforesaid, I would conclude the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the defense cross-examination questions to be error, and because the jury was therefore unable to weigh the plaintiffs or her doctor\u2019s credibility against the opinion, I would further conclude that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 54} As to the second assignment of error, the plaintiffs medical expert (her treating physician who is a board-certified orthopedic surgeon) rendered an opinion that the only condition suffered by the plaintiff attributed to the accident in this case was an inflammation or aggravation of a preexisting shoulder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>situation known as rotator tendonopathy. The plaintiff had 20 physical therapy sessions and was released in a year. Plaintiffs doctor ruled out a rotator-cuff tear and, although he recognized that the plaintiff had some impingement-like symptoms, he did not conclude that she had a shoulder impingement or a condition known as bursitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 55} Plaintiff, who was an anesthesiology registered nurse for 20 years, testified as to her medical condition. The defense objected to the plaintiffs testifying as an expert, to which plaintiffs counsel argued: \u201cShe is a medical expert. She\u2019s got extensive training in that and she\u2019s certainly qualified to tell us what impingement syndrome is. She testified she had impingement syndrome symptoms, and I asked her what is that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 56} Therefore, plaintiff was offering herself as a medical expert in this case. Over objection, she testified that the accident caused her to suffer a classic impingement syndrome and went on to explain precisely and in great medical detail what that entailed. Plaintiff also added that she suffered from a bursitis condition and likewise described in great detail what that included.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 57} The trial court simply overruled the objection without explanation, did not rule on the plaintiffs qualification (or lack thereof), and allowed her to testify as an expert medical witness. Moreover, plaintiff not only testified in detail as if she were an orthopedically trained expert, but she also contradicted her own doctor, introduced an \u201cimpingement\u201d and a \u201cbursitis\u201d condition into the case, and said both conditions were supported by the MRI. Thus, plaintiff is testifying as an orthopedic and radiology expert medical witness though she was never listed as an expert on the plaintiffs witness list, would certainly not be qualified as to these specialties based only on being an anesthesiology registered nurse, and is the only medical support for additional \u201crelated\u201d conditions, neither of which is supported by her doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">(\u00b6 58} I am not unmindful of the fact that a plaintiff may testify as to his or her pain and suffering and medical treatments. However, he or she may not, simply because he or she is a plaintiff, become specialized medical experts able to testify to the diagnosis and causation in specific medical specialties. Without specific qualification of an expert medical witness, plaintiffs testimony is clearly in violation of Evid.R. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 59} This error also is not harmless error as it is unknown what made up the jury\u2019s thinking with respect to plaintiffs injury when the jury found the damages to be over $50,000 in a case involving less than $7,000 in special damages. For example, did the jury consider an impingement syndrome and a bursitis condition in addition to an aggravation of the tendonopathy? Were those two medical conditions included within the aggravation? None of this is supported by the plaintiffs doctor, yet it was in evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>{\u00b6 60} For the foregoing reasons, I would sustain appellant\u2019s first and second assignments or error, reverse the judgment of the trial court, and remand the matter to that court for a new trial, rendering appellant\u2019s third assignment of error moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
