This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 2} On August 8, 2006, Hopper filed a wrongful-death complaint against the city. In lieu of an answer, the city filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) on the basis of statutory immunity. The city argued that none of the exceptions to immunity listed in R.C. 2744.02(B) were applicable. The city contemporaneously moved for a protective order and to stay discovery pending the trial court\u2019s ruling on its motion to dismiss. On October 30, 2006, Hopper filed a brief in opposition to the city\u2019s motions. The trial court scheduled a case-management conference for May 1, 2007. On May 2, 2007, the trial court issued a journal entry asserting: \u201cCourt to rule on pending motions by 5-15-07.\u201d On June 12, 2008, the trial court denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss, as well as the motions for protective order and to stay discovery, without analysis. The city filed a timely appeal, raising one assignment of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The lower court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss because the city is immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">{\u00b6 3} The city argues that the trial court erred by denying its motion to dismiss on the basis of statutory immunity. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">{\u00b6 4} As an initial matter, this court acknowledges that we have jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s denial of the city\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds of statutory immunity. The Ohio Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">When a trial court denies a motion in which a political subdivision or its employee seeks immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744, that order denies the benefit of an alleged immunity and is therefore a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-13\"><em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">{\u00b6 5} This court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss. <em>Niepsuj v. Summa Health Sys., </em>9th Dist. Nos. 21557 and 21559, 2004-Ohio-115, 2003 WL 23153220, \u00b6 5. A trial court may grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) only if it appears beyond a doubt that the petitioner can prove no set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>facts that would entitle him to relief. <em>Garvey v. Clevidence, </em>9th Dist. No. 22143, 2004-Ohio-6536, 2004 WL 2806339, \u00b6 11. In considering a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss, the trial court must review only the complaint, accepting all factual allegations as true and making every reasonable inference in favor of the nonmoving party. Id. The trial court may not, however, rely upon any materials or evidence outside the complaint in considering a motion to dismiss. <em>State ex rel. Fuqua v. Alexander </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 206, 207, 680 N.E.2d 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 6} Hopper\u2019s complaint alleged that the city is liable for the wrongful death of his son, who drowned in a municipal pool, because the city negligently, willfully, wantonly, and recklessly (1) disregarded the safety of the public in the construction, care, maintenance, supervision, control, and security of the pool and surrounding grounds, (2) failed to adequately warn of known dangers at the pool by failing to post warning signs on the perimeter fence, and (3) failed to adequately secure the premises to prevent against unauthorized entry onto the premises. The complaint alleged that the incident occurred at the South Park Recreational Area premises located at 150 South Park Drive, Elyria, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 7} In determining whether a political subdivision such as the city of Elyria is immune from liability, this court must engage in a three-tier analysis pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744. <em>Cater v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 24, 28, 697 N.E.2d 610. This court is \u201cbound to apply the words of the law in effect at the time the alleged negligent acts occurred.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Canton City School Bd. of Edn., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 451, 2002-Ohio-6718, 780 N.E.2d 543, at \u00b6 17. Therefore, all citations of R.C. Chapter 2744 will refer to the version in effect as of June 8, 2005, the date the minor decedent drowned.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 8} The first tier of the analysis is the premise of general immunity under R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">[ejxcept as provided in division (B) of this section, a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">There is no dispute that the city is a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">{\u00b6 9} Government functions include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">The design, construction, reconstruction, renovation, repair, maintenance, and operation of any school athletic facility, school auditorium, or gymnasium or any recreational area or facility, including, but not limited to * * * [a] bath, swimming pool, pond, water park, wading pool, wave pool, water slide, or other type of aquatic facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(u)(iv). As the allegations in the complaint concern an act or omission of the city in connection with a governmental function, the city has general immunity from liability. This immunity, however, is not absolute. <em>Cater, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 28, 697 N.E.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 10} The second tier of the analysis involves the five exceptions set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B), any of which may abrogate the general immunity delineated in R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). The five exceptions include negligent operation of any motor vehicle by an employee, negligent acts by an employee with respect to proprietary functions, the political subdivision\u2019s negligent failure to maintain roads, employee negligence on the grounds of buildings and due to physical defects on the grounds of buildings used in connection with the performance of a governmental function, and when civil liability is expressly imposed by statute. R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) through (5). The parties do not assert that any exceptions to immunity in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) through (3) and (5) are applicable. Rather, the only exception to immunity that may be applicable in this case arises out of R.C. 2744.02(B)(4), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">Except as otherwise provided in section 3746.24 of the Revised Code, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function, including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but not including jails, places of juvenile detention, workhouses, or any other detention facility, as defined in section 2921.01 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">If this exception applies, immunity may be reinstated if one of the defenses pursuant to R.C. 2744.03 is applicable. This court need not reach the issue of whether any defenses are applicable because we conclude that the exception to immunity enunciated in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 11} The Ohio Supreme Court held that although the operation of an indoor municipal swimming pool constitutes a governmental function pursuant to R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(u), it is not subject to the exception to immunity set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4). <em>Cater, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 28, 697 N.E.2d 610. The high court reasoned that the types of buildings listed in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4), \u201ccoux*thouse[s] or office building[s] where government business is conducted,\u201d are distinguishable from recreation centers that house recreational activities. <em>Cater, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 31, 697 N.E.2d 610. Although <em>Cater </em>involved a drowning at an indoor pool, the high court expressed its assumptioxx that outdoor pools were by their very nature excluded from the ambit of the statutory exception to immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">Furthermore, if we applied former R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) to an indoor swimming pool, liability could be imposed upon the political subdivision. However, there would be no liability if the injury occurred at an outdoor municipal swimming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>pool, since the injury did not occur in a building. We do not believe that the General Assembly intended to insulate political subdivisions from liability based on this distinction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Id. at 31-32, 697 N.E.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 12} Hopper argues that <em>Cater </em>is not dispositive of the issue of the city\u2019s immunity because (1) the legislature has since amended R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) and (2) he believes that its reasoning has been called into question by <em>Hubbard, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 451, 2002-Ohio-6718, 780 N.E.2d 543. This court finds Hopper\u2019s arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 13} First, it is true that the version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) applicable to the instant matter is different from the version applied in <em>Cater. </em>The version applicable in <em>Cater </em>did not contain the phrase further requiring that the injury be \u201cdue to physical defects within or on the grounds of\u2019 the buildings. Otherwise, the provisions are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 14} Hopper argues that the amended version applicable to this case broadens the scope of the city\u2019s liability. In fact, it does just the opposite. R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) is an exception to general immunity. By requiring that the injury both be caused by employee negligence within or on the grounds of certain types of buildings and be due to physical defects within or on the grounds of those buildings, the legislature has narrowed the scope of a political subdivision\u2019s liability, not the scope of its immunity. Accordingly, the subsequent modification to R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) does not diminish the soundness of the reasoning in <em>Cater, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 24, 697 N.E.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">{\u00b6 15} Hopper further argues that the <em>Hubbard </em>case calls into question the reasoning in <em>Cater. </em>This court disagrees. First, the <em>Hubbard </em>court twice cites <em>Cater </em>in regard to the three-tiered analysis relevant to a determination of a political subdivision\u2019s immunity. <em>Hubbard, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 451, 2002-Ohio-6718, 780 N.E.2d 543, \u00b6 10, 12. Accordingly, it is clear that the Supreme Court was aware of its reasoning in <em>Cater. </em>Nevertheless, the <em>Hubbard </em>court did not overrule <em>Cater </em>or make any attempts to discuss or distinguish its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">{\u00b6 16} Second, <em>Hubbard </em>involved the sexual assault of two students by a teacher on school premises. That court concluded that the city school board was not immune from liability pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) simply because \u201cthe injuries claimed by plaintiffs were caused by negligence occurring on the grounds of a building used in connection with a government function.\u201d <em>Hubbard </em>at \u00b6 18. Unlike the statute at issue in the instant case, the applicable version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) in <em>Hubbard </em>did not contain the further requirement that the injury be \u201cdue to physical defects\u201d on the grounds. Although the high court noted that the legislature had attempted to amend the statute to add the physical-defects requirement pursuant to both H.B. 350 and H.B. 215, the court emphasized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>it had invalidated on constitutional grounds both versions of the statute. <em>Hubbard </em>at \u00b6 16. The holding in <em>Hubbard </em>simply makes clear that the high court will not engraft additional requirements on a statute in the absence of the legislature\u2019s intent to do so. Id. at \u00b6 17, stating, \u201cWe decline to rewrite the subsection to produce a different result than the words of the statute require.\u201d The <em>Hubbard </em>court did not revisit the distinction between buildings used for governmental purposes and recreational facilities. Accordingly, this court is not persuaded that <em>Hubbard </em>has diminished the authority of <em>Cater </em>in regard to the circumstances of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 17} Hopper cites <em>Thompson v. Bagley, </em>3d Dist. No. 11-04-12, 2005-Ohio-1921, 2005 WL 940872, in support of his argument that the reasoning in <em>Cater </em>is no longer sound. First, this court is not bound by a sister district\u2019s questioning of Ohio Supreme Court case law. Second, <em>Thompson </em>is not analogous to either <em>Cater </em>or the instant case. <em>Thompson </em>involved a child who drowned in a school pool during a physical education class. However, the <em>Thompson </em>court noted that the parties agreed that the child\u2019s \u201cdeath occurred in connection with a governmental function as provided for in 2744.01(C)(2)(c),\u201d id. at \u00b6 28, rather than as provided for in R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(u), as in <em>Cater </em>and the instant case. R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(c) states that the \u201cprovision of a system of public education\u201d is a governmental function. Accordingly, <em>Thompson </em>does not involve a recreation center or recreational activities. Rather, it involves an activity in an office building where government business is conducted, specifically, the business of educating children. Therefore, the analysis by the <em>Thompson </em>court does not implicate the reasoning in <em>Cater, </em>which distinguished recreational activities from government business and exempted recreational facilities from buildings of the type delineated in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 18} Pursuant to the authority of <em>Cater, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 24, 697 N.E.2d 610, an injury, death, or loss at the city\u2019s outdoor swimming pool does not fall within the exception to immunity enunciated in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4). Accordingly, the trial court erred by denying the city\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint for the reason that the city is immune from liability. The city\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 19} The city\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"A6O\">Moore, P.J., and Whitmore, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
