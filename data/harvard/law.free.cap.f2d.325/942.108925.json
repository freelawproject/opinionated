Jenkins and Randall C. Nuss<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were indicted for, among other things, knowingly and unlawfully taking and carrying away with intent to steal $17,870 from the Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank, Lawrence Park Office, Broomall, Pennsylvania. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"AAhW\">On January 4, 1960, Jenkins appeared with his counsel, Garfield W. Levy, Esq., before the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Directly after the selection of a jury, he changed his plea to the indictment from \u201cnot guilty\u201d to \u201cguilty\u201d. The Court then sentenced him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) to a term of 12 years with parole eligibility at the end of four years.</p>\n<p id=\"AZO\">On February 26, 1962, Jenkins filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate or correct sentence. The essence of his argument was that he had been illegaily \u201cinduced by the court to change his plea from \u2018not guilty\u2019 to \u2018guilty\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0o9\">On September 13, 1962, after <em>a </em>full hearing, the District Court denied t<em>h</em>e petition, albeit it ordered that the sentence provide for a term of nine years, instead of twelve, and that eligibility for parole start at the end of three years, instead of four. Jenkins had filed an appeal from the denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AqHj\">The only findings and conclusions that the District Court made were those uttered at the close of the hearing, when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Q\">\" I find as a fact no misrepresentation were made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASqR\">\u201cI find as a fact that no misrepresentations were made,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACUT\">\"I deny petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">Examination of the record discloses, additionally, that there is neither an opini\u00b0n nor a memorandum of decision con-taming findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"ASzD\">The record lacks any written order for final judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Any entry of final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>ment on the docket of the District Court Clerk is also absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Jenkins\u2019s motion to vacate sentence is not a proceeding in the original criminal prosecution but an independent civil suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And when the present motion was before the District Court in 1962, neither statute nor rule demanded that final judgment be set forth on a separate document,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as the 1963 amendment to Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure currently requires.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was then and is now indisputable, though, that the record in order to be appealable must contain some directive reflecting the final judg-. ment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-25\"> No form of words and no peculiar formal act are necessary to evince rendition of a final judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The test is whether the language of the directive embodies the essential elements of a final decision and clearly evidences the judge\u2019s intention that it shall be his final act in the case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-26\">Let us assume that the District Court Judge made a final order when, as appears in the transcript,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> he stated: \u201cI deny the petition.\u201d The clerk\u2019s entry on his docket relating to the transcript, however, merely states: \u201cOct. 1 Transcript 9/13/62 filed.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This notation simply discloses that a transcription of the hearing had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number> There is no notation of judgment, which does, in fact, constitute the entry of final judgment. In a motion attacking sentence under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment * * Only by a strict compliance with the statute may litigants avoid untimely and premature appeals. Accordingly, since scrutiny of the record reveals no order entered on the motion as from a final judgment, we are without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">That argument on this point is absent from the parties\u2019 appellate briefs is inconsequential.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As held by the Supreme Court: \u201cHowever, the mere consent of the parties to the Court\u2019s consideration and decision of the case cannot, by itself, confer jurisdiction on the Court.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Of course any final judgment herein that the District Court now enters should be drafted in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as amended January 21, 1963, effective July 1, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">As this ease must be remanded to the District Court, by reason of our lack of jurisdiction, two points should be borne in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-16\">First: It should be observed that the United States Code obligates the district court on hearing a motion to attack sentence to determine not only the issues but to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, unless the record conclusively shows that petitioner is entitled to no relief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition to helping the appellate court define the issues for review, this is an indispensable factor in deciding what the trial court had adjudicated on such a motion. In this case the District Court should give consideration whether its sketchy oral findings and conclusions adequately fulfilled this mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-17\">Second: It should be observed that the Government\u2019s brief suggests that \u201cwhile the Court had authority [in its-September 13, 1962 ruling] to set aside Appellant\u2019s sentence of January 4, 1960, and resentence Appellant, the Court had no authority or power to amend Appellant\u2019s sentence.\u201d Manifestly in 1962,. when the District Court amended Jenkins\u2019s 1960 sentence, the time period, providing for the reduction of a sentence through the exercise of discretion, had passed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And the statute pertaining to-remedies on motions attacking sentence<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> does not provide for an amendment of sentence. Rather, it restates and simplifies the ancient writ of error coram nobis, so that an erroneous sentence<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>vacated or set aside without resort to habeas corpus.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The instant appeal will be dismissed And the case remanded to the District Court for action consistent with this \u2022opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"APIY\">. On May 28, 1959, Nuss pleaded guilty. He received a sentence of ten years, but was eligible for parole after a term of twenty-one months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Am-\">. Jenkins was confined to Moyamensing Prison, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after arrest. On April 30, 1959, he escaped, but was recaptured on August 12, 1959, in Buffalo, New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A7C\">.

It should be observed that in the instant case, the clerk\u2019s office entered all material germane to the motion attacking sentence on the criminal docket initially used for the ease of United States v. Jenkins, et al., Criminal No. 19906. Since the motion is a civil action, Heflin v. United States, supra note 4, the clerk\u2019s office should have opened a civil docket thereon. Fed.R.Civ.P. 79(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-28\">This procedure was formalized by resolution of the Judicial Conference of the United States, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-29\">\u201cIt was brought to the attention of the Committee that the practice of docketing motions to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255 is not uniform among the districts and further that there is considerable variation in processing these motions when they are filed in <em>forma pauperis. </em>In many districts motions to vacate sentence are carried on the criminal docket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-30\">\u201cIt was the view of the Committee that motions to vacate sentence are civil proceedings under the law and court decisions and that these motions should therefore be docketed on the civil docket of the court, in order that the records of the court may be correct in terms of the statute and in regard to the nature of judicial responsibility for these matters. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference directed that the district courts be instructed to docket all such motions on the civil dockets.\u201d Report of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Proceedings, September 19-20, 1962, p. 42.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b997-9\">.
