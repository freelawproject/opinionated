There has been no compliance with the requirements for interlocutory appeal under either Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or under Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We therefore need not and do not consider whether either provision might be available. And the decision of the court below is not final for, \u201c[Ajnother order of absolute dismissal after expiration of the time allowed for amendment is required to make a final disposition of the cause.\u201d Cory Bros. &amp; Co., Ltd., v.
