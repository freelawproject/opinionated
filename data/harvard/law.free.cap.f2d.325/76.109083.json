Naviera Vacuba cross-claimed against Maher Stevedoring Co., Inc., whose employee, it alleged, created the unseaworthy condition. Judge Weinfeld, sitting without a jury, upheld Naviera Vacuba\u2019s cross-claim, on the theory that Maher had breached its obligation to carry on its stevedoring in a workmanlike manner, and gave it the right to recovery for damages paid to Calderone and counsel fees to the extent that it submitted proof of having paid them. 204 F.Supp. 783 (S.D.N.Y.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">On this appeal, Maher does not question the trial court\u2019s finding of liability, but challenges (1) the right of Naviera Vacuba as a nationalized Cuban company to sue in American courts and (2) the propriety and nature of the award of fees and disbursements to Naviera Vacuba\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The standing of foreign nations in our courts is a matter of comity, determined by the recognition accorded to them by the Executive Branch of the United States Government. See National City Bank v. Republic of China, 348 U.S. 356, 358, 75 S.Ct. 423, 99 L.Ed. 389 (1955); Land Oberoesterreich v. Gude, 109 F.2d 635 (2d Cir. 1940), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 670, 61 S.Ct. 30, 85 L.Ed. 431 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Since being nationalized by the Cuban Government, Cuban corporations have sued and have been sued in the United States courts. E. g., Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 307 F.2d 845 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. granted, 372 U.S. 905, 83 S.Ct. 717, 9 L.Ed.2d 715 (1963); Rich v. Naviera Vacuba S. A., 295 F.2d 24 (4th Cir. 1961). Generally, their standing has been unquestioned. Neverthelessi in the absence of a clear statement of policy by the Executive Branch, in P &amp; E Shipping Corp. v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior De Cuba, 307 F.2d 415 (1st Cir. 1962), the court <em>sua sponte </em>vacated a judgment in favor of a nationalized Cuban corporation and remanded for the district court to ascertain the status of the Cuban Government from the Department of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">Considerations of both international relations and judicial administration lead us to conclude that the onus is on the Department of State, or some other department of the Executive Branch, to bring to the attention of the courts its decision that permitting nationalized Cuban corporations to sue is contrary to the national interest. Since silence on the question may be highly desirable, it would not be wise for the courts unnecessarily to force the Government\u2019s hand. However, in this case we need not merely rely on the maintenance of the <em>status quo, </em>because the Executive Branch has made its wishes known. On the appeal from this court to the Supreme Court of Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, supra, the Department of Justice has urged that nationalized Cuban corporations have access to our' courts with the protection of the act of state doctrine. Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae, Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, supra. Moreover, in Rich v. Naviera Vacuba S. A., supra, the Department of Justice asserted that a nationalized Cuban defendant was entitled to the protection of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">We find no merit in Maher\u2019s complaint as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Although disclaiming liability under the policy, the insurance company in going forward with Naviera Vacuba\u2019s defense may merely have been desirous of protecting itself in the event the disclaimer was not sustained. Furthermore, we think that Judge Weinfeld\u2019s decision on the motion to amend the judgment and the amended judgment make it clear that Naviera Vacuba can recover from Maher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>only to the extent it actually pays the attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The amended judgment is affirmed, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees upon this appeal in the amount of $750 taxed against and to be paid by appellant to counsel for third-party plaintiff-appellee, without proof of prior payment thereof by third-party plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
