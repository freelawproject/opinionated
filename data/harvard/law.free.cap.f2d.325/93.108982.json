In support of the last finding the Commission relies on the rule in Modernistic Candies, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 145 F.2d 454 (7th Cir. 1944), Seymour Sales Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 403, 216 F.2d 633 (1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 928, 75 S.Ct. 340, 99 L.Ed. 727 (1955), and the specially concurring opinion in Calvine Cotton Mills, Inc., 51 FTC 294 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-21\">There was substantial evidence to support a finding that the device was used as a gaming device: customers who were approached to \u201ctake a chance\u201d would associate it with a lottery; and the device\u2019s use was the same as that of a punch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>board, if the explanatory note <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were not read. It was conceded that the tabs were \u201ca selling device,\u201d an \u201ceye catcher\u201d and were used \u201cin a substantial number of cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We think J. C. Martin Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 242 F.2d 530, decided by this court in 1957 is inapplicable. The decision there was that a practice similar to Gerson\u2019s was not a lottery, because the element of prize was missing. Nor are Wolf v. Federal Trade Commission, 135 F.2d 564 (7th Cir. 1943) , Globe Cardboard Novelty Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 192 F.2d 444 (3rd Cir. 1951), nor Colon v. Federal Trade Commission, 193 F.2d 179 (2d Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 823, 73 S.Ct. 22, 97 L.Ed. 641 (1952), close on the facts here in the absence of a valid, necessary finding that Gerson\u2019s device was a lottery or a game of chance. They are, however, authority for recognition of the \u201cpublic policy\u201d of the United States against marketing goods by taking advantage of the consumer\u2019s propensity to take a chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">We think this court\u2019s opinion in Modernistic Candies, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 145 F.2d 454 (7th Cir. 1944) , is the closest of the cases cited on the facts. There the \u201carticle sold [was] not complete in itself\u201d for a game of chance, but the merchant using it \u201cwould give a prize * * *' stick of candy or a candy bar\u201d to the children or <em>adults </em>using the innocent per se device. This court referred, in that case, to the power of the Commission to police and prohibit the use of devices in interstate commerce which designedly and deliberately aided and encouraged merchandising by gambling. It thought Modernistic\u2019s device \u201ctoo apparently allied\u201d with a practice contrary to public policy to qualify as a \u201cfair trade practice\u201d and denied petition to review. This court emphasized the special appeal of the device to the weakness of children desiring to \u201cget something for nothing.\u201d But this emphasis does not distinguish the device there from the one at bar: actually adults there were equally attracted to the device.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The Commission was justified in adopting the finding that the sales device was used as a gaming device \u201ccalculated to appeal to the public\u2019s gambling instincts.\u201d The Commission could as well have found with propriety, on Gerson\u2019s own argument that the element of chance was missing, that in any event, if the device were not used as a gaming device, Gerson, through his agents, held it out as such and thereby practiced a deception upon naive customers who were deluded into \u201ctaking a chance.\u201d It is our opinion that the complaint<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> could accommodate a conclusion, and there was substantial evidence upon which the Commission could conclude, upon either ground, that Gerson\u2019s sales practice was unfair and in violation of \u00a7 5(a) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">We have considered but find no merit in Gerson\u2019s challenge to the breadth of the order\u2019s restraint against the practice employing devices \u201cdesigned or intended to be used\u201d in selling \u201cby means of a game of chance * *</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">For the reasons given, the petition is denied and the Commission\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-12\">. 66 Stat. 632 (1952), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-13\">. The details of the practice are admittedly \u201cword for word, design for design\u201d after those used in J. C. Martin Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, 242 F.2d 530 (7th Cir. 1957). In fact, Gerson, although a resident of Brooklyn, New York, established his place of business in Chicago to take advantage of this court\u2019s decision in J. C. Martin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-15\">. \u201cHere\u2019s how it works. You may purchase from the list shown on the left where the merchandise is described or you may pull any one of the slips below on the back of which is printed the article and price. If not satisfied with the item you picked you are not obligated to buy it. * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b147-17\">. \u201cThe sale of merchandise by the aforesaid method also constitutes the sale of merchandise by means of a gaming device $ <em>i'fi </em>*</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-19\">\u201cThe use by respondent of the aforesaid sales plan in connection with the sale of his merchandise is a practice which is contrary to established public policy of the Government of the United States * * *.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b147-13\">SCHNACKENBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A2Um\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">Despite the evident purpose of petitioner to create a device not proscribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>by law, it is apparent that the over-all effect of the evidence establishes that he intended to incite the gambling instinct rather than the purchasing desire of a customer. This result he reached and hence Judge Kiley\u2019s disposition of this appeal is right.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
