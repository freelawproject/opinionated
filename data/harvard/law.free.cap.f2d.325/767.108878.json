The second sentencing of the appellant is questioned because the action taken was imposed in appellant\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The court below made a full and intelligent use of the scheme of the sentencing of .a person charged with a crime of which 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b) is a part. Under Rules 43 and 49, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the language of the statute itself, the court\u2019s right to review such sentences is extended from sixty days to six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">A close examination of the record discloses that the court below acted in strict conformity with the statute and Rules involved, and that the sentence imposed was justified by the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
