Defendant Edwards was accused of using \u201ca .38 calibre revolver,\u201d defendant Kaufman with using \u201ca .45 calibre automatic pistol,\u201d and defendant Conner with using \u201ca revolver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-21\">Appellants\u2019 brief is three pages in length and cites no cases. But two questions are raised:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-22\">1. Did the trial court err in denying appellant Kaufman\u2019s motion to reduce bail?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-23\">2. Does the evidence support the verdict of guilty as to defendant Edwards, in view of the lack of testimony that he personally carried a gun into, or while in, the bank at the time it was robbed?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-24\">Thus there is no question raised as to Kaufman\u2019s guilt or as to Edwards\u2019 participation in the robbery; the only question is whether there was proof Edwards had a gun in his hands. Nor is there any question but that both Kaufman and Conner held guns in their entry into the bank premises, and that they \u201ccovered\u201d bank employees with such guns and threatened them \u2014 clearly an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-25\">There likewise is no question but that Kaufman was the leader, the brains, the instigator of a well planned armed bank robbery wherein $42,600 was taken at the point of two guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-26\">The determination of what bail is proper to grant is peculiarly a matter of discretion with the trial court. Petition of Johnson (1952) (unreported in official reports), 72 S.Ct. 1028, 96 L.Ed. 1377; Connley v. United States of America, 9 Cir. 1930, 41 F.2d 49. The fixing of excessive bail is unconstitutional, and no matter what amount is set the exercise of discretion in fixing it is appeal-able. Stack v. Boyle, (1951) 342 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96 L.Ed. 3. The appeal time is within ten days (F.R.Cr.Proc. 37(a)). \u201cOrders fixing bail are reviewable, but not upon an appeal from a judgment of conviction.\u201d Hewitt v. United States of America, 8 Cir. 1940, 110 F.2d 1, 6, cert. den. 310 U.S. 641, 60 S.Ct. 1089, 84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>L.Ed. 1409. Appellant Kaufman\u2019s point is therefore not properly or timely raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Turning to Edwards\u2019 appeal, the crime charged against him (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a, d)) was an offense against the United States. One who aids or abets the commission of such an offense is punishable as a principal. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a)) Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States of America, (1949) 336 U.S. 613, 619n4, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919. As to robbery, see Norris v. United States of America, 5 Cir. 1946, 152 F.2d 808, cert. den. 328 U.S. 850, 66 S.Ct. 1118, 90 L.Ed. 623. As to bank robbery, see Dawes v. United States of America, 6 Cir. 1949, 177 F.2d 255; United States of America v. Simmons, 2 Cir. 1960, 281 F.2d 354; United States of America v. Pravato, 2 Cir. 1960, 282 F.2d 587, and particularly United States of America v. Bux, 3 Cir. 1958, 261 F.2d 807, which is directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Thus the guns held by Kaufman and Conner were as much held by Edwards as by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
