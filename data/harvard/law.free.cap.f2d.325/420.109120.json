Art. 7426 et seq., and to the defense based thereon. See Albertype Co. v. Gust Feist Co., 1909, 102 Tex. 219, 114 S.W. 791; Hughes Bros. Mfg. Co. v. Cicero Trust &amp; Savings Bank, 5 Cir., 1928, 24 F.2d 199, and 15 C.J.S. Commerce \u00a7 133b, as distinguished from 'cases involving the successful assertion of such defenses where the transactions were intrastate in character, Fuqua v. Pabst Brewing Co., 1896, 90 Tex. 298, 38 S.W. 29, 35 L.R.A. 241, and the line of cases fallowing it such as Segal v. McCall Co., 1916, 108 Tex. 55, 184 S.W. 188, and Kissel Motor Co. v. Walker, 5 Cir., 1921, 270 F. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-18\">The necessary findings and conclusions having ample support in fact and law, and no prejudicial error being otherwise disclosed, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
