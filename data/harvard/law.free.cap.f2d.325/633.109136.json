Richardson, Glenn Lovett, and appellant, Southwestern Petroleum Corporation, filed oil and gas lease offers involving public lands within the same New Mexico township. Mrs. Richardson and Lovett filed their offers simultaneously at 10:00 A.M. and Southwestern filed its offer at 1:47 P.M. All three offers ultimately included a 120-acre tract in section 10 and a separate 160-acre tract in section 11, and, in the case of Southwestern, an additional tract in section 14, the total amount of land in each final offer being less than 640 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">At a drawing to determine which of the simultaneous offers, Mrs. Richardson\u2019s or Lovett\u2019s, should be given priority, Mrs. Richardson\u2019s was drawn first. On October 22, 1957, the manager of the Santa Fe Land Office rejected Mrs. Richardson\u2019s offer for the land in section 11, but accepted it for the land in section 10, relying on 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.42(d), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-13\">\u201cEach offer * * * may not be for less than 640 acres except * * where the land is surrounded by lands not available for leasing under the act. * * * \u201d 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.-42(d), as amended, 22 Fed.Reg. 3072 (May 1, 1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">On November 1, 1957, two leases were issued, NM 036709 to Mrs. Richardson covering the land in section 10 and NM 036710 to Lovett covering the land in section 11, in consequence of which Southwestern\u2019s offer to lease was rejected on May 22, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">Southwestern appealed the rejection of its offer to the Director, Bureau of Land Management, who held that, of the three offers in question, only the offer of Southwestern covered \u201call lands available for leasing,\u201d and directed that the Richardson and Lovett leases be cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-16\">Mrs. Richardson and Gulf Oil Corporation, assignee of Lovett, appealed the Director\u2019s decision to the Secretary of the Interior, who reversed the decision with regard to Mrs. Richardson and remanded the case with direction to reinstate her lease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his opinion, the Secretary, construing 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.42 (d), held that the manager of the Land Office was correct both in rejecting Mrs. Richardson\u2019s offer for the land in section 11, since that land adjoined land available for leasing in section 14, and in accepting her offer for the land in section 10, since that land was isolated from land available for leasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">Southwestern then filed this action in the District Court seeking review of the Secretary\u2019s decision. After a hearing on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion and dismissed the suit. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-18\">Appellant here does not attack the validity of the regulation. Indeed, in Boesche v. Udall, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 344, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>303 F.2d 204 (1961), aff\u2019d 373 U.S. 472, 83 S.Ct. 1373, 10 L.Ed.2d 491 (1963), we sustained its validity under different circumstances. Rather, appellant maintains . that, in allowing the acceptance of part of an offer to lease while rejecting another part, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is erroneous. It is urged that the regulation requires <em>all </em>of the available land covered by the offer to be isolated, and that the inclusion of non-isolated land will cause the entire offer to be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In Wright v. Paine, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 100, 102, 289 F.2d 766, 768 (1961), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201cAppellees challenge the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, not the validity, of the regulation governing the procedures for leasing lands which have become available through relinquishment of a previous lease. His interpretation \u2018becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., 1945, 325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700. The \u2018courts can intervene only where legal rights are invaded or the law violated.\u2019 Chapman v. Sheridan-Wyoming Coal Co., 1950, 338 U.S. 621, 631, 70 S.Ct. 392, 397, 94 L.Ed. 393.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Cf. also McKenna v. Seaton, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 259 F.2d 780, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 835, 79 S.Ct. 57, 3 L.Ed.2d 71 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Thus, the question in this case is whether the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is reasonable. Essentially, the question is whether \u201cthe land\u201d referred to in the regulation, as applied to an offer designating separate tracts of land, means all the land in the offer or the land in each of the tracts of the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\"> It was for the Secretary, the promulgator of the rule, to determine which of the two possible interpretations was better in accord with the over-all leasing policy of which the regulation is a part. We cannot say that the Secretary\u2019s choice of interpretation was unreasonable and, absent such a finding, we cannot disturb his decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\">. With respect to Gulf Oil Corporation, the Secretary remanded the case to the Bureau of Land Management for further findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">. While the Secretary further contends that the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the action was proper because of the absence of the lessee, Mrs. Richardson, an indispensable party, we do not reach that question. See Miller v. Udall, 113 U.S. App.D.C. 339, 341, n. 2, 307 F.2d 676, 678, n. 2 (1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 967, 83 S.Ct. 550, 9 L.Ed.2d 538 (1963); Safarik v. Udall, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 74, 304 F.2d 944, 950, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 901, 83 S.Ct. 206, 9 L.Ed.2d 164 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
