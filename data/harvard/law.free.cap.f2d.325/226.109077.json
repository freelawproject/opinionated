Appellant was tried with a co-defendant indicted with him. On cross-examination during the trial before a jury the complaining witness in the robbery charge was asked by defense counsel could she tell the jury which of the \u201ctwo persons\u201d took her purse. She replied, \u201cI could not tell you which of the two took it. I can tell you the one that admitted taking it.\u201d At the bench the judge at the request of appellant\u2019s counsel said he would strike the volunteered part of the answer and tell the jury to disregard it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The examination then proceeded, and the matter was never referred to in open court. No objection was made to the instructions as given and no further request was addressed to the court regarding the matter, although it should have been clear to defense attorneys that the court had omitted to tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the jury to disregard the statement. The evidence of guilt was strong, including but not limited to identification of appellant by the complaining witness. Moreover the admission referred to was not attributed to this appellant. In light of all the circumstances the incident clearly is not of sufficient significance to justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-22\">. Though the court later in the trial held that certain statements of the defendants at the police station were inadmissible under the Mallory rule, Mallory v. U. S., 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479, no question under that rule is before us on the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
