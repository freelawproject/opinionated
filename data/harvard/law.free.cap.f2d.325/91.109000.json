The Employer is a water supply company which furnishes water for industrial use to companies engaged in the production of goods for commerce. The successful Employee was a pump mechanic whose duties included handling of telephone calls, special requests, emergencies, and the like during \u201coff-duty\u201d times. The jury verdict upon which the judgment appealed from is based is amply supported by the evidence. This applies equally to the issue of required availability during times after completion of the Employee\u2019s regular tour of duty and also to the total overtime implied by the dollar and cent verdict. We have carefully considered the other specifications of error and find all to be without merit. In the circumstances of this case and also the appeal, the attorney\u2019s fee allowed by the trial court is reasonably adequate compensation so no additional sum need be awarded for services on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
