At that trial the arresting officer testified concerning the search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-22\">At the second trial of the case in May 1963 objection was made for the first time to the admissibility of evidence seized by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-23\">The defendants failed to comply with Rule 41(e), which provides in part that the motion to suppress \u201cshall be made before trial or hearing unless opportunity therefor did not exist or the defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion, but the court in its discretion may entertain the motion at the trial or hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-24\">We find that the Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion at the trial. United States v. Milanovich, 303 F.2d 626 (4th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-25\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
