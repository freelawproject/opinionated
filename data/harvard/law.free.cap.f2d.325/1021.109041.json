The judgment was affirmed on appeal, 10 Cir., 255 F.2d 202. The trial court denied relief without a hearing on the grounds that the petition when examined in the light of the transcript of the proceedings on direct appeal presented no new grounds for granting relief. Out of an abundance of precaution an appeal in forma pauperis was granted and counsel was appointed. Counsel has filed a memorandum brief in which he states that the matters presented now under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 were conclusively resolved in the direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-22\">Upon consideration of the record and files in the ease, we agree with the trial court. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
