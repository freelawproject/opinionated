The Company contended that the arbitrator, in dealing with the question of reimbursement for time lost by the aggrieved employees, had exceeded his authority and had decided a question not submitted to him for determination, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>not directly covered by the terms of the collective agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">In denying the Company\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the question of allowance of back pay, the arbitrator said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-5\">\u201c * * * Back pay was not mentioned in the submission agreement, dated June 26 [1962], during the long hearing, or in the extensive briefs the parties filed. If the Arbitrator\u2019s recollection of his mental processes is correct, he awarded compensation on the principle that an employee improperly laid off is entitled to more than a naked answer to the question whether the collective bargaining agreement had been violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-6\">* * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-7\">\u201cAn arbitrator certainly should be sensitive whenever his authority is put into question \u2014 in utter good faith, as here. And he is indeed in a dilemma when one side charges that he has already exceeded it, and the other side \u2014 without directly defending the \u2018offending\u2019 portions of the Award \u2014 insists that he is utterly without power to correct his mistakes, no matter how serious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-8\">\u201cEven though the Company has presented a proposition meriting attention and regretting the Union\u2019s unwillingness to stipulate for its reconsideration, the said motion is, in the opinion of the Arbitrator, beyond his reach. One error in a case should be enough; he will not run the risk of committing another, and thus further complicate the relationship of the parties. The Company must be referred to some other tribunal to test the validity of the objectionable portions of the Award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">The Company reinstated the employees who were found by the arbitrator to have been improperly laid off, but did not pay them for time lost. The Union then brought this action under \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), to enforce the entire award. There was no dispute as to the pertinent facts. Each of the parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion of the Company, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-12\">\u201cIn the case at bar it cannot be successfully argued that the question of awarding back pay was specifically submitted for arbitration, as this point was never raised, subsequent to the filing of the submission agreement. Neither can it be successfully contended that the back pay naturally flows from the decision that the layoffs were improper because of a failure to follow the procedures delineated in the contract, for, as has already been shown, under these circumstances, some of the employees might not have been entitled to back pay, if they would have been laid off anyway. It seems clear that this question involves an interpretation of the contract, which is either silent, or at the most, ambiguous on this subject, and therefore should be submitted to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of the contract regarding disputes over the interpretation of the contract. Further, it cannot be implied that the arbitrator did consider this matter in his decision, as he has made it clear that this was not considered by him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-13\">\u201cFor the above-stated reasons, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is hereby denied, both without prejudice to further arbitration proceedings on the issues of liability for back pay, interpretation of the contract and any other related issues except the one specifically determined by the arbitrator that these layoffs were improper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">In granting the Company summary judgment, the trial court merely declined to enforce so much of the arbitrator\u2019s award as related to back pay, and did so without prejudice to further arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>proceedings to resolve that issue. While it may be doubted that the question was or is of sufficient importance to justify reviving or prolonging any part of the dispute between the parties, it is true, as the trial court said, that the back pay issue was not specifically or necessarily included in the subject matter submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">It is the law that \u201carbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582-583, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1353, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409. See, also, United Steelworkers of America v. American Manufacturing Co., 363 U.S. 564, 570-571, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403; Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., 370 U.S. 238, 241, 82 S.Ct. 1318, 8 L.Ed.2d 462. In our opinion, this does not mean that every arbitration award may be subjected to an exhaustive post-mortem in the hope of salvaging for further controversy some subsidiary question of no controlling practical consequence, if it was not specifically included in the problem as it was submitted to the arbitrator for determination. Whether the post-award back pay question raised by the Company in this case actually merits or requires that that portion of the award be not enforced may be questionable. See United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 598-599, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424. It was held in that case, however, that an order of the District Court compelling compliance with an arbitrator\u2019s award should be modified so that the amount due the aggrieved employees by way of back pay might be definitely determined by arbitration. In Selb Manufacturing Co. v. International Association of Machinists, 8 Cir., 305 F.2d 177, relied on by the Union in the instant case, there was no contention that the allowance of back pay made the award unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
