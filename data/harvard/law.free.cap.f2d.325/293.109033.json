What the Board is holding is that subsequent occurrences after an accomplished event may cause one to become a discriminator ab <em>initio. </em>The unsettling effect of such a rule is apparent on the facts of this case. Here we have a union, so far as the evidence shows, acting at all times without knowledge of the existence of a rival, obtaining recognition through a card check and negotiating an agreement, and then, on a charge filed eight weeks later, being ousted because after it had obtained its majority membership the employer did not allow another union that had been competing secretly to come in and compete openly. We see no great hardship on this particular union in view of its complete lack of diligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But even if there were hardship, the present rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>would suspend a Damoclesian sword over every instance where an employer innocently extended, and a union innocently accepted, legitimate accommodation to an organizational campaign. We do not think this admittedly highly unusual case should he permitted to make bad general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">A decree will be entered setting aside the order of the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-11\">. To the extent that the examiner\u2019s report, adopted by the Board, mentions other matters it is in some instances in- , compatible with the record, and in others inconsistent within itself. The argument made before us by counsel for the Board that the employer acted precipitately in order to head off some other union is not supported by either the Board\u2019s findings or the testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-16\">. The rival union in this case neither kept an eye on what the successful union was doing openly, nor, after the employer ignored its request did it pursue the matter. There was a considerable interval between the making of the request, the card check and actual recognition of the successful union, and the negotiating of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
