The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it appeared from the complaint and attached agreement that the appellant had not exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-19\">The collective bargaining agreement simply set out the administrative procedures to be followed in settling grievances. The complaint alleged that \u201cplaintiff has exhausted all of the administrative remedies provided for in said labor agreement or he has attempted to so comply.\u201d Appellee asserts that this allegation is to be ignored as \u201ca mere conclusion, wholly uninformative as to what he claimed to have done to comply or attempt to comply.\u201d Y/e think it was sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss, for \u201cthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his. claim.\u201d Conley v.
