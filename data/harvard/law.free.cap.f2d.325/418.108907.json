Under a certificate of mandatory release he received credit for 580 days of statutory good time allowance, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4161, and was released. The certificate of mandatory release, issued on December 6,1961, stated that he would be under the jurisdiction of the Parole Board, \u2022as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164, and \u25a0specified certain conditions, which the prisoner acceded to. One of these conditions was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">\u201c10. That I will not purchase, possess, use, consume, or administer narcotic drugs or marihuana in any form, or frequent places where such articles are unlawfully sold, dispensed, used, or given away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">On December 10, 1962 petitioner signed an affidavit admitting reversion to narcotics and he was returned to custody as a parole violator on December 18, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">In his petition for habeas corpus he claimed to be entitled to immediate release on the ground that his release must be regarded as absolute and that the terms of the certificate stating that he would be under the jurisdiction of the Parole Board, and the conditions imposed upon and acceded to by him, were void and of no effect. The argument is based on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237 (d) which provides in substance that upon conviction for offenses under the narcotics laws \u201cthe imposition or execution of sentence shall not be suspended, probation shall not be granted\u201d and that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202, relative to \u201crelease on parole after serving one-third of\u201d the term of imprisonment or after serving fifteen years of a life sentence, shall not apply. From this he would have us infer that his release became an absolute discharge. The difficulty with this argument is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164 specifically provides that \u201cA prisoner having served the term or terms for which he shall have been sentenced after June 29, 1932, less good time deductions, shall upon release be treated as if released on parole,\u201d subject to all the provisions of law relating to federal prisoners. Thus, so far as parole is concerned only 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 is made inapplicable to narcotics offenders. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4163 and 4164, which relate to mandatory release for good time, are not referred to in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) and these Sections remain in effect with respect to narcotics offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">The prisoner was properly paroled and, on violation of the conditions of his release, he was lawfully returned to custody, to serve the balance of the term for which he was sentenced. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">The order of Judge Palmieri dismissing the petition for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
