After a trial Judge Noonan found the Brooklyn solely at fault and dismissed on the merits the libel filed by the Brooklyn and her owner the Arundel Corporation, and they appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-28\">We think it not necessary to discuss the facts in detail. None of the findings are clearly erroneous. The Metropolitan No. 1 was the privileged vessel. There is no real inconsistency in the findings. None of the alleged statutory faults on the part of the Metropolitan No. 1 contributed in the slightest degree to the collision; and we agree there was no occasion for the Metropolitan No. 1 to sound a passing signal, and that the change of course of the Brooklyn was so unexpected and unpredictable that there was no time for the Metropolitan No. 1 to sound the danger signal or reverse her engines, which could have done no more than further complicate an impossible situation, caused solely by the fault of the Brooklyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
