(hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe employers\u201d) had not engaged in unfair labor practices and dismissing the complaint in its entirety. After the filing of a brief by the union, the Board moved that the case be remanded to it for further consideration and, no objection having been filed, the case was so remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-21\">In the original decision appealed from, the Board had found that certain employees of the employers had engaged in unprotected conduct when certain drivers refused to cross a picket line established by the Chemical Workers Union at the premises of Virginia-Carolina Chemical Corporation. These employees had been assigned to make deliveries to Virginia-Carolina but declined to cross the picket line, whereupon their services were terminated by the employers and new employees were hired. The Board held that the activity of the original employees was <em>unprotected, </em>and further found that the employers had not violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by discharging those employees, and that \u201cabnormally dangerous conditions,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 502 of the Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not prevail when the employees refused to perform their assigned work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>On remand the Board, <em>by </em>a three to two majority, found that the employees had in fact engaged in <em>protected </em>concerted activity when they refused to cross the picket line, but held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-4\">\u201cAlthough the Act accordingly prohibits any reprisal against the eight Redwing drivers for engaging in the protected activity of not crossing the V-C picket line, we also recognize that the Respondents had .a corresponding right which must be balanced against the right of the \u2022employees. That is, Respondents had a right to attempt to run their business despite the sympathetic activities of the drivers here involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">The Board further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-6\">\u201cWe have reexamined the record in this case, and find it clear that, insofar as Respondents may actually have \u2018discharged\u2019 the eight drivers, they did so entirely for the purpose of continuing their business operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">The Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-8\">\u201cIn view of * * * the absence of any evidence of union animus on the part of Respondents, we are convinced that Respondents terminated the services of the eight drivers not in reprisal for honoring the V-C picket line, but solely to continue their business dealings with V-C. Under these circumstances, and on these grounds alone, we reaffirm our original disposition of this case, and dismiss the complaint in its entirety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">While the Board, in its original order; had found that no \u201cabnormally dangerous conditions\u201d existed, it did not do so <em>in haec verba </em>in its supplemental order. It did, however, adhere to its original decision except insofar as the conduct of the discharged employees had been held to be unprotected. All members of the Board concurred in the result, although two members adhered to the position taken by them on the original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">We think it clear that there is adequate support in the record, considered as a whole, to support the findings of the Board and it follows accordingly, that the petition to set aside the order and supplemental order of the Board must be denied.

Rockaway News Supply Co., 197 F.2d 111 (2d Cir. 1952), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 345 U.S. 71, 73 S.Ct. 519 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-22\">.
