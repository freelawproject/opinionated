Cummings. The jury found the defendant operator \u201cguilty of negligence\u201d and plaintiff \u201cguilty of contributory negligence to a very minor degree.\u201d The jury awarded damages to the passenger. A verdict of \u201cno cause of action\u201d was returned in plaintiff\u2019s action. No objection was taken to the court\u2019s charge and no error therein is claimed on appeal. The sole error argued is that the credible evidence established that the accident was not the result of any negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">Plaintiff who sustained serious injuries is the victim of the principle of New York law that contributory negligence bars recovery. Unfortunately for him, there is no doctrine of comparative negligence. It undoubtedly seems unjust to him that his negligence \u201cto a very minor degree\u201d should deprive him of any recovery but this is the law. An appellate court cannot reappraise the evidence and change the \u201cvery minor\u201d contributory negligence to no negligence at all unless there be no evidence at all. A reading of the record discloses adequate evidence from which the jury could infer some contributory negligence. With all the facts before them and with the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, the jury concluded that there was contributory negligence. Upon the record, this court cannot find their verdict to have been contrary to the weight of the credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
