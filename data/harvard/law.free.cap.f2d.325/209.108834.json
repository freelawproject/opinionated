One of the defendant\u2019s own alibi witnesses testified concerning a purchase of non-tax-paid whiskey by one Ralph Wilson, and denied that the purchase was made from the defendant as charged by the government or that the defendant was present at the time. The witness referred to his conversation with Ralph Wilson wherein the latter stated that he and the defendant \u201cbuilt some time\u201d together at Green-ville. There was no objection to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">On cross-examination of this witness, government counsel asked: \u201cDidn\u2019t you just testify that Ralph told you that he and Colon [the defendant] were building time together.\u201d Before the question was answered, defense counsel interposed an objection and the Court ruled: \u201cThe objection is sustained. Gentlemen of the jury, you will not consider the last question propounded to the witness * * *. Erase that from your minds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\"> Ordinarily, the granting or refusing of a motion for mistrial is in the sound discretion of the trial judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we find no abuse of such discretion in this case. The evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. We do not think that this asserted error substantially affected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial or that it warrants a reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-25\">.
