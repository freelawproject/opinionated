Had his injury occurred in the District of Columbia his compensation would have been larger. By contract with Martin\u2019s union, McHugh was bound to \u201ccarry an excess compensation policy on his employees when they are working outside of the District of Columbia which shall give the employees * * * additional compensation in Maryland and Virginia equal to that of the District of Columbia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">Martin brought suit against McHugh in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for the amount of the excess compensation. McHugh filed a third-party complaint against Michigan Mutual Liability Company, contending that McHugh\u2019s contractual liability to Martin was covered by the insurance McHugh carried with Michigan Mutual. The District Court ruled against this contention and entered summary judgment for Martin and Michigan Mutual against McHugh. On appeal this court remanded the case to the District Court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\">\u201cWe think Michigan Mutual\u2019s \u2018Comprehensive General Liability Policy\u2019 and \u2018Contractual Liability Coverage Endorsement\u2019 are sufficiently ambiguous in respect to coverage to justify a trial in which the surrounding circumstances may be developed and the intentions of the parties determined.\u201d McHugh Construction Co. v. Martin, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 48, 49, 294 F.2d 244, 245 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-15\">Pursuant to this court\u2019s order the case came on for hearing in the District. Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and testimony was duly taken. The court made findings of fact and concluded, among other things, that the comprehensive general liability policy,, and specifically that part entitled \u201cContractual Liability Endorsement,\u201d in effect during the period in question \u201cdid not cover industrial accidents for which the third-party plaintiff was liable under workmen\u2019s compensation law nor did it cover for breach of union contracts such as occurred here.\u201d Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of Michigan Mutual against McHugh. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The determination made by the District Court rests upon substantial evidence and we find no reason in the record to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-16\">. In the meantime, McHugh settled with Martin, and the suit continued between McHugh and Michigan Mutual.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
