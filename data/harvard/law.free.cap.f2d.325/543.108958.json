Appellant was convicted by a jury of forgery and uttering a forged instrument. His codefendant, William Hara, turned state\u2019s evidence and testified against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-31\">Jurisdiction existed below (\u00a7\u00a7 470 and 680, Penal Code of Guam; \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 82, Guam Code of Civ.Proc.; 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424 (a)). Jurisdiction of the appeal lies here (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1294(4) Supp. III, 1958 Ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-32\">There are ten errors urged as requiring reversal. They may be classified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-33\">1. Error in admission of evidence (a) of the oral confession (point 2)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT6\">(b) of hearsay (point 8).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-37\">2. Insufficiency of the evidence (points 1, 7).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-38\">3. Error in instructions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-39\">(a) with respect to corroboration of accomplices\u2019 testimony (point 3)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-40\">(b) with respect to corroboration of oral confession (point 4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-41\">4. Lack of proper representation by counsel (point 5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-42\">5. Error in permitting the jury to deliberate in the law library (point 6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-43\">6. Error in refusing to grant a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-44\">We note that appellant\u2019s present counsel makes a drastic and vehement attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>on the conduct of appellant\u2019s previous counsel in the trial below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We next note that appellant\u2019s counsel on appeal has caused his client\u2019s case to be placed in jeopardy, and subject to dismissal, by reason of his failure to comply with the following rules of this court:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">(1) There exists no statement of jurisdiction in the court below. (Rule 18 (b))</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">(2) The official reports are not cited, a violation of Rule 18(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">(3) The \u201cgrounds urged at the trial for the admission or rejection of evidence\u201d are not \u201cquoted.\u201d (Rule 18(d))</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">(4) Neither the instructions objected to nor those refused are set forth in \u201ctotidem verbis.\u201d (Rule 18(d))</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">(5) The grounds of objection to such instructions, urged at the trial, are not set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">(6) No reference to the pages in the transcript where such material exists is made. (Rule 18(e))</p>\n<p id=\"b597-24\">(7) In support of point 5 above (appellant\u2019s point 6) appellant seeks to amplify the record before us by moving to include facts outside the record made below. This we cannot do, and that motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b597-26\">THE CONFESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b597-27\">Lieutenant Taitano, of the Guam Territorial Police Force, testified as to defendant\u2019s confessing the crime charged (Tr. vol. II, p. 38, line 26 to p. 47, line 17) <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This confession, as the trial court rules, corroborated the testimony of the accomplice, Hara; and the testimony and written statement of Hara (Def.Ex.II) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>corroborated the <em>facts </em>recited in the alleged oral conversation (whether admission or confession) between Taitano and appellant. Appellant cites valid law, i. e., that the confession must be voluntarily made (Lisenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219, 62 S.Ct. 280, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941)) and competent (Opper v. United States, 348 U.S. 84, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954)), and corroboration must exist as to the trustworthiness of the confession \u2014 not corroboration of the fact the confession was made. (Cash v. United States, D.C.Cir.1959, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 265 F.2d 346, cert. den. 359 U.S. 973, 79 S.Ct. 892, 3 L.Ed.2d 841.) But none of these cases cited reach the fact that corroboration did exist in the record before us \u2014 both of the so-called \u201cconfession\u201d to Taitano and of Hara\u2019s testimony,</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In reading appellant\u2019s brief, we find we first need to accurately define what \u201ccorroboration\u201d means. We know \u201cthat such corroborating evidence must connect or <em>tend to connect </em>the accused with the commission of the crime with which he is charged.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Ing. v. United States, 9 Cir. 1960, 278 F.2d 362, 367, See also 23 C.J.S. Criminal Law \u00a7 812(2), p. 100. The evidence must be more than a mere showing defendant had an opportunity to commit the cx-ime, or connect him with individuals known to have committed it, but must connect or <em>tend to connect </em>defendant with the commission of the crime itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Here in evidence was the check (plaintiff's Ex. 1); the issuer testified it would in the ordinary course of the maker\u2019s business physically come into the defendant\u2019s hands; defendant was the oxxly messenger or coux-ier handling checks; the testimony of the payee was he had not received it or endorsed it; the testimony of Hara was that he had exxdorsed the payee\u2019s name at the defendant\u2019s request and that the defendant had placed the second endorsement thereon and had cashed the check at the Bank of America; the testimony of a bank teller from the Bank of America was he had paid the check on the specified date; the testimony of Taitano was that both Hara and defendant had admitted to him that the defendant had cashed the check; the written, signed statement of Hara given to Officers Roberto and Manana was introduced by defendant (after calling Taitano as his own witness); the defendant introduced exemplars in his own handwriting of the forged signature \u201cJuan Ci-uz,\u201d which-the jury could compai'e with the \u201cJuan Cruz\u201d on the forged check.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The court ruled, both at the conclusion of the government\u2019s evidence and at the end of the case, that there existed sufficient corroborative evidence tendixxg to connect defendant with the forgery and uttering to make a case for the jury\u2019s determination. The check, with the testimony concerning it, was alone enough to corroborate the confession. In connection with the second of such rulings the trial judge aptly stated (Tr. vol. II, p. Ill, line 5 to line 26):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case, the Court obtained agreement that Mr. Hara is an accomplice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">\u201cMR. GROVER: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: That, therefore, his uncorroborated testimony is not sufficient upon which to convict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">\u201cMR. GROVER: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: The Court then considered that Mr. Taitano, Lieutenant Taitano testified that this defendant had admitted to him that he had endorsed the name, Juan Cruz, and had cashed this check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-13\">\u201cMR. GROVER: I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now that raises, of course, a sufficient corroboration to go to the jury at that time. Now since that time you have made Taitano your witness, you have introduced in evidence Hara\u2019s statement and we now, of course, have these signatures which the jury can compare to determine whether they are of any assistance to them. So at the conclusion of the, of your evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>it would seem to me that there would be a greater basis upon which the jury could find corroboration then [sic] when the Government rested yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201cMR. GROVER: I appreciate that, your Honor, but I had to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: So I will deny your motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Appellant raises the query in his brief (p. 14) (with reference to the oral confession and the testimony of the accomplice), can each corroborate the other? He makes no attempt to answer that question or to cite cases to support the alleged rule that they cannot, and we need not, because, as recited above, other corroborative evidence existed, amply sufficient in our opinion to make out a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">ERRORS IN INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"A7Tf\"> We comment elsewhere herein with respect to the failure of defendant to set forth verbatim in his brief (a) the instructions he claims are erroneous, (b) the instructions he claims should have been given, and (c) the grounds of objection urged at the trial. Thus there is a complete failure to follow the rules of this court, which alone means this court is under no obligation to consider the point urged. The appellant merely concludes \u201cthe instructions were inadequate.\u201d He does not state how or why. We have read the instructions given (Tr. vol. I, Document 17, pp. 4 to 20, inclusive) and find them completely adequate, in the absence of any objection at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">There was no objection. At the conclusion of the instructions the following took place: (Supp. Record, vol. I, p. 20, line 24 to p. 21, line 8).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">\u201cCounsel please come forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">\u201c(At the bench, out of hearing of the jury):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Government may take exceptions to my instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">\u201cMR. BAKER: Satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: The Government has no exceptions. The defense may take exception to any instruction given and offer any additional instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-18\">\u201cMR. GROVER: Well, right at the present moment I have none, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: The defense has no exceptions or recommendations. Very well, gentlemen, thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-20\">An additional instruction was given when, after some jury deliberation, the jury could not agree, and again both sides approved. (Tr. vol. I, Doc. 17, p. 23, line 14 to line 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-21\">This error alleged as to instructions is completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-22\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b599-23\">INADEQUATE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"ANoJ\">(Defendant\u2019s Points 5 and 10)</p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">These points (admittedly difficult from appellant\u2019s viewpoint) are likewise without merit. We have read the entire transcript. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s conduct of the trial was no brilliant example of trial tactics; yet the trial judge was unusually careful to aid him, both in the framing of questions and in the latitude of his rulings favoring the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-24\">We take judicial notice that the bar of Guam does not compare in size with that of many other communities, and, without in any way reflecting upon the capabilities of its many outstanding attorneys, realize that in any community there are lawyers and lawyers \u2014 some more able than others.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-25\">We also note that this was retained, not appointed, counsel. The trial judge, in a difficult position in view of counsel\u2019s apparent inexperience, conducted the trial in a fair and impartial manner, aiding the defendant\u2019s counsel in many ways. Every lawyer tries his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>cases differently \u2014 it is not unknown for the smartest of attorneys to play the fool before a jury in an attempt to thus gain its sympathy for his client. This is frequently done when no other defense is available. Whether this was or was not the trial stategy of this case we do not, and need not, know.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">JURY'S DELIBERATION IN LAW LIBRARY</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The jury deliberated in the law library located in Guam\u2019s temporary court house. No charge is raised that any member of the jury consulted a law book.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant urges, however, that this is not important; the jury had an opportunity to do so and they should have been instructed not to use law books, if they were required to use that space for their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">We agree. They should have been so instructed. This would have been a wise precaution. Defendant could have asked for such an instruction. He did not. No such instruction was requested or rejected. No case is cited to support appellant\u2019s point. We find harmless error under the circumstances of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">FAILURE TO DISMISS</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">From what has been heretofore stated, we find no error existed in failure to dismiss, either at the close of the government\u2019s evidence or the close of the case. (Tr. vol. II, pp. 48-49, 111)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">HEARSAY EVIDENCE, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">Again, appellant\u2019s counsel on appeal fails to follow this court\u2019s rules in his attempt to raise this point. (Rule 18(d)) We have carefully examined his argument and the one case he cites (Brief, pp. 33 and 34). There was no foundation laid at the trial by a proper or any objection for the points now raised. The case cited is not in point. We hold no reversible error existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">FAILURE TO GRANT A NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">This is actually a rehash of appellant\u2019s other points. No cases are cited. None need be cited here to ho\u2019d no error existed in the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-18\">Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\">. In appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s language: There was \u201clack of preparation, failure to appreciate the issues of the case, * * * failure to interpose proper objections, the introduction of improper evidence and lack of knowledge of trial procedures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-12\">. On direct he testified (Tr. vol. II, p. 41, line 2 to p. 42, line 20):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">\u201cA. Mr. Palacios stated that he endorsed the check as Juan Cruz and the other name that appears on the back of the check, Jose D. Cruz, was endorsed by William Hara, a resident of Sinajana; that he took the check to the Bank of America and cashed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-14\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Baker) Hid Palacios say anything about anybody encouraging Hara to make the endorsement, Jose D. Cruz, upon the back of the chock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: That question is objectionable. That is leading the witness. You are on very sensitive ground here when we deal with oral statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-17\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Baker) What did Palacios say concerning the circumstances surrounding the signature of, signature, Jose D. Ci'uz, appearing upon the back of the check ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-18\">\u201cA. He say that he asked Hara if he can help him out and Hara says \u2018It all depends if I can do it.\u2019 At this time Palacios say that if he can sign the back of the check and Hara did sign Jose D. Cruz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-19\">\u201cQ. Did Palacios tell you why he did this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-20\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-28\">\u201cQ. And what reason did he give you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-29\">\u201cA. He say that he was behind in car payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-30\">\u201cQ. And at the time you questioned Palacios, if you know, where was he employed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-31\">\u201cA. He was employed as a public safety patrolman for the Government of Guam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-32\">\u201cQ. Now in connection with this statement made by Palacios, were any promises of leniency or reward made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-33\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-34\">\u201cQ. Were any threats or force used toward him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-35\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-36\">\u201cQ. Is the person you described as Palacios in this room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-37\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-38\">\u201cQ. Will you point to him, if you are ablo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-39\">\u201cA. The one in the red shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-40\">\u201cMR. BAKER: May the record show the witness indicated the defendant, Palacios.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-41\">\u201cTHE COURT: The record will so show.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-43\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Baker) Did Palacios make a written statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-44\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-45\">\u201cQ. Did he state any reason why he did not wish to give a written statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-46\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-47\">\u201cQ. What was that reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-48\">\u201cA. He said he wanted to see his lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b599-26\">.
