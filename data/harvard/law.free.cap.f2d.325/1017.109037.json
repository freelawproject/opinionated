The lower court fully examined the facts of this joint act on the part of the Union and Ethyl in firing these nine men. The District Judge entered exhaustive findings of fact from which it clearly appears that his decision of this question involves deciding between the credibility of various witnesses and between divergent claims. A thorough study of the record and briefs convinces us that his findings were amply supported by credible evidence, and that this appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
