An appeal lies here (28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1291). The action below relies for jurisdiction upon diversity (28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1332). Defendant\u2019s answer claims the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000. Plaintiff urges it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-24\">Plaintiff set forth an action at law for deceit against the two defendant insurance companies, alleging they had defrauded him out of the benefits under his sickness and accident policies by representing to him that his condition was neither sickness nor accident and would not come within the policy coverage, thereby for a small amount of money obtaining his release from all future liability under these policies, although at the time both companies knew his condition was within the policy coverage, and that he would inevitably become entitled to large payments thereunder. Plaintiff claimed as damages not only the expected benefits from these policies which were less than $10,000, but also exemplary damages, making the total amount of damages claimed against both companies the sum of $100,000 (Tr. I, pp. 1, 2,11, 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-26\">The answers of both defendants admitted the contracts and the obtaining of releases, but denied the fraud and the amount in controversy (Tr. I, pp. 3-9).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>The facts disclose that after some discussion about plaintiff\u2019s claim between the two companies, claims agents for each company visited plaintiff (Tr. II, pp. 73, 74, 76, 77, 80). Each of these claims agents told plaintiff the same story \u2014 that his condition was neither sickness nor accident and was not within the policy coverage, but, to help him out, each would pay a small sum ($150 and $250, respectively) for a release. He took the money and signed the releases, which released future as well as past benefits. Nothing was said about future disability (Tr. II, pp. 12-21, 78, Ex. 10, 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The defendants admitted that the claims agents were acting within the course and scope of their employment and were not menial employees and, at the time they obtained the releases, knew plaintiff\u2019s condition was a sickness within the coverage of their policies (Tr. I, p. 27, Tr. II, pp. 72, 74, 76, 77).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Here the judge dismissed because in his opinion it appeared from the proof that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the jurisdictional amount. <em>In </em>such a ease, where the complaint asserts a claim in the jurisdictional amount, the action should not be dismissed unless the proof not only shows that the plaintiff cannot recover that amount, but also shows this with such certainty as to indicate a lack of good faith on the part of the plaintiff in bringing the action in the federal court. St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co. (1938) 303 U.S. 283, 289, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845; McDonald v. Patton, 4th Cir., 240 F.2d 424, 426; Matthiesen v. Northwestern Mutual Insurance Company, 5 Cir. 1961, 286 F.2d 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\"> Appellees urge that the claim made by plaintiff for exemplary or punitive damages cannot be made in good faith. If made in good faith, punitive damages may be included in computing: the amount necessary for federal jurisdiction. Young v. Main, 8 Cir. 1934, 72 F.2d 646. However, if under the applicable state law it wo\u00fcld be <em>legally impossible </em>to recover actual <em>and </em>exemplary damages, the addition of such exemplary damages to the claim will not create a sufficient good faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">In a diversity case, we are required to follow the state law of Oregon. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins (1938) 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Defendants say the law of Oregon prevents recovery of exemplary ox punitive damages for fraud except where the fraud is aggravated, \u201cas where it is gross, malicious, or wanton,\u201d (Cays v. McDaniel, et al., (1955) 204 Or. 449 at 457-458, 283 P.2d 658, 661-662) and citing in support of that theory Perez v. Central Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. of Omaha, (1958) 215 Or. 107, 372 P.2d 1066; Ridgeway v. McGuire, (1945) 176 Or. 428, 158 P.2d 893. We do not find them based on a factual situation similar to the peculiar ones here alleged to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">We accept defendant\u2019s position as correctly stating the law of Oregon. It was expressed somewhat more broadly in Fisher v. Carlin, 219 Or. 159 at 162, 346 P.2d 641, 643 (a later case, 1959), where Chief Justice McAllister said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">\u201cTo justify punitive damages, the jury must be satisfied that the injury was done maliciously or willfully and wantonly or committed with bad motive or recklessly so as to imply a disregard of social obligations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Appellant relies largely on Equitable Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Lee, 9 Cir. 1962, 310 F.2d 262, but again, we do not find the factual situation in that case similar to this. No question of menial employment, without power to represent the corporations, is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">This is not a suit on the policies. This is a claim for fraud and deceit \u2014 that \u201cdefendants by their agents and employees falsely represented to plaintiff that his condition was neither accident nor sickness and would not come within either policy\u201d (amended complaint, par. II); that said statements \u201cwere false, were known to be false when made, were [meant] to defraud plaintiff of his rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>under the aforesaid policies.\u201d (Amended complaint, par. III)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\">Plaintiff asserts that under Oregon Law fraud (a) may be \u201cinnocent\u201d and support an action for rescission but not damages; (b) may be negligent or in-\u00bb tentional, which would support an action for damages; or (c) may be \u201cgross fraud,\u201d or \u201cfraud with malice,\u201d which will support an action for damages, both compensatory and exemplary.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">In support of his position that he has a factual question present whether exemplary damages are properly available under Oregon law, appellant refers us (a) to Exhibit 12, which indicated Dr. Johnson\u2019s opinion was that plaintiff\u2019s condition arose from \u201csickness,\u201d not \u201cinjury,\u201d which opinion was known to defendants; (b) to Exhibit 15, a letter from one insurance company written after each had interviewed Dr. Johnson, telling appellant he \u201cmay have suffered an eye <em>injury\u201d; </em>(c) to the following excerpts from the testimony produced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">\u201cQ. At the time of your discussion obtaining the release from Mr. Davenport, did you have in your possession the report that is now in your hands, Exhibit 12?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">\u201cQ. Did you at the time of discussing the matter, obtaining the release from Mr. Davenport, <em>know his condition, detoxhed retina, came within your policy coverage as sickness? </em>[Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-9\">\u201cQ. What did you advise Mr. Davenport with regard to coverage under the policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-10\">\u201cA. I advised him that there was no actual coverage under the illness provision or under the accident provisions of the policy * -\u00bb * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-11\">(La France, Claims Representative for Mutual, Tr. II, pp. 76, 78.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-12\">\u201cQ. Did he (Landgraf \u2014 Continental) say anything about the coverage of the policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-13\">\u201cA. The policy didn\u2019t cover me, under the conditions. It was neither sickness nor accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-14\">(Davenport, Tr. II, p. 18.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-15\">\u201cQ. Before taking Mr. Davenport\u2019s release, did you have a conversation with Dr. Johnson concerning Mr. Davenport\u2019s eye condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-16\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-17\">\u201cQ. You heard Dr. Johnson\u2019s testimony yesterday as to what he told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-18\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-19\">\u201cQ. Was that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-20\">\u201cA. Essentially, yes, I would agree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-21\">\u201cQ. And that you had that information before you went to discuss the release with Mr. Davenport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-22\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-23\">\u201cQ. <em>Did you at that time know that that condition was sickness under the coverage of your policy?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-24\">\u201cA. Yes. [Emphasis supplied]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-25\">(Landgraf, Claims Manager for Continental, Tr. II, pp. 73-74.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-26\">In interpreting the \u201cgross fraud\u201d essential for an award of punitive damages under the law of Alabama, the Supreme Court of Alabama said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-27\">\u201c[G]ross fraud * * * [is] defined * * * as \u2018representations made with a knowledge of their falseness (or so recklessly made as to amount to the same thing), and with the purpose of injuring the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d Southern Building &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Dinsmore (1932), 225 Ala. 550, 552, 144 So. 21, 23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-29\">In interpreting plaintiff\u2019s -rights under such law, the Supreme Court of the United States said it was unnecessary to use the term \u201cgross\u201d to describe the fraud; nor need the \u201cpunitive and actual damages * * * bear a definite math<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>ematical relationship [to each other].\u201d Considering the nature of the Alabama suit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201cthese general principles of Alabama law, we are unable to say that under petitioner\u2019s complaint evidence could not be introduced at a trial justifying a jury verdict for actuaUnd punitive damages exceeding\u201d the jurisdictional minimum. Bell v. Preferred Life Soc., (1943) 320 U.S. 238, 241-243, 64 S.Ct. 5, 6-7, 88 L.Ed. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">We come to the same conclusion as to the instant action. We cannot say it is apparent \u201cto a legal certainty\u201d that appellant could not recover an amount in excess of the jurisdictional amount, if he can prove his case of \u201cgross fraud.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Because plaintiff has not claimed malice or gross fraud in so many words is of no consequence, for \u201ca complaint filed in the federal court should not be dismissed for want of jurisdiction because of a mere technical defect such as would make it subject to a special motion to clarify.\u201d Bell v. Preferred Life Soc., (1943) 320 U.S. 238 at 242, 64 S.Ct. 5 at 7, 88 L.Ed. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">This court has recently used the precise language cited above (Fisher v. Carlin, supra) in a case involving Oregon law with respect to punitive damages, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-11\">\u201cwhere there is evidence that the injury was done maliciously or wilfully and wantonly or committed with bad motive or recklessly so as to imply a disregard of social obligations, punitive damages are justified.\u201d Reynolds Metals Co. v. Lampert, 9 Cir. 1963, 316 F.2d 272, 275.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzC\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed, and the action remanded for trial. We express no opinion, of course, as to whether plaintiff can or cannot establish the truth of his allegations as to fraud to the ultimate satisfaction of the trier of facts, but he should have the opportunity to try to establish the merits of his action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-12\">. The plaintiff alleged fraudulent misrepresentations by defendants\u2019 representatives as to the actual value of an insurance policy, where its maximum potential value was only \u00a71,000. Punitive damages were prayed for and were required to establish jurisdiction, inasmuch as any recovery under the policy would be below the jurisdictional amount required for diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-13\">. In Fisher v. Carlin, supra, \u00a7250 actual damages and \u00a72,750 punitive damages were upheld, citing Kingsley v. United Rys. Co., 66 Or. 50, 58, 133 P.2d 785; Perry v. Thomas, 197 Or. 374, 393, 253 P.2d 299; Genova v. Johnson, 213 Or. 47, 321 P.2d 1050. Fisher held specifically that where there exists substantial evidence that the injury falls into the class of gross negligence, \u201cthe issue was for the jury.\u201d And generally, see Martin v. Cambas, 134 Or. 257, 293 P. 601 (1930), a false arrest case; Pelton v. General Motors Acc. Corp., 139 Or. 198, 7 P.2d 263, 9 P.2d 128 (1932), an unlawful possession of auto case.
