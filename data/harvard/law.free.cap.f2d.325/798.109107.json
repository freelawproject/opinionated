The cases' were consolidated for trial. The jury returned special verdicts in favor of the United States and judgments were entered accordingly. The taxpayers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">La Barge Pipe and Steel Company, not one of the taxpayers here, began business in St. Louis in 1953 as Pierre L. La Barge, Jr.\u2019s sole proprietorship. It was engaged in the warehousing and distribution of tubular products and piping materials. It made sales to, among others, the water well drilling industry and the gas and oil pipe line industry. The business v/as incorporated in March 1956 with La Barge the owner of over 99% of Pipe and Steel\u2019s outstanding shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In September 1956 the taxpayer La Barge Water Well Supply Company was incorporated in Missouri. It was to hold itself out as a specialist and take over and increase sales to the water well drilling industry. In May 1957 the taxpayer La Barge Pipe Line Supply Company was incorporated in Missouri to hold itself out as a specialist and handle sales to the gas and oil pipe line industry. Pipe and Steel transferred property to each taxpayer in return for stock. La Barge was president of Pipe and Steel and of both taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The three corporations filed separate income tax returns. Each claimed the $25,000 surtax exemption provided for by \u00a7 11(c) of the 1954 Code. The Internal Revenue Service disallowed this exemption to Water Well for its fiscal years ended March 31, 1958, 1959, and 1960, and to Pipe Line Supply for its fiscal years ended March 31, 1958 and 1960.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This was on the ground that the exemption was not available because of the prohibition of \u00a7 1551.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">The only part of \u00a7 1551 which is significant here is its provision that the exemption shall be disallowed \u201cunless such transferee corporation shall establish by the clear preponderance of the evidence that the securing of such exemption * * was not a major purpose of such transfer\u201d. No issue is raised as to the satis-' faction of all other conditions of the statute' including the required control by Pipe and Steel. Further, the taxpayers concede that there is no question here as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">The issues before us are: (a) Were the taxpayers deprived of a fair trial by the district judge\u2019s comments in the presence of the jury relative to the effect of the dissolution of Pipe Line Supply? (b) Were the taxpayers deprived of a fair trial by other statements made by the court in the presence of the jury? (c) Were the instructions and the special verdict forms erroneously prejudicial? We discuss these in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">1. The court\u2019s comments as to Pipe Line Supply\u2019s dissolution. The complaint in Pipe Line Supply\u2019s action was filed April 9, 1962. Articles of dissolution of the corporation were filed, under V.A. M.S. \u00a7 351.470, with the Missouri Secretary of State one week later on April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>16. La Barge testified that the corporation was dissolved because \u201cWe just didn\u2019t seem to be making enough progress in the industry to warrant continuance of the operation\u201d. Y.A.M.S. \u00a7 351.-565 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-4\">\u201cThe dissolution of a corporation * * * by the issuance of a certificate of dissolution by the secretary of state * * * shall not take away or impair any remedy available to or against such corporation * * * for any right or claim existing, or any liability incurred, prior to such dissolution if suit or other proceeding thereon is commenced within two years after the date of such dissolution. Any such suit or proceeding by or against the corporation may be prosecuted or defended by the corporation in its corporate name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-26\">The cross-examination of Mr. La Barge led to testimony and remarks of counsel and the trial judge which indicated initial misunderstanding as to the facts and significance of the dissolution and its date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>The taxpayers argue that the court emphasized in the presence of the jury an incorrect situation relating to Pipe Line Supply\u2019s dissolution, that it cast aspersions when it demanded to know how a dissolved company could be a party to a lawsuit, that the complaint was in fact filed before dissolution was effected and not afterward, that, under \u00a7 351.565, the suit could properly be maintained in Pipe Line Supply\u2019s name anyway, and that the court\u2019s comments were not only incorrect as a matter of Missouri law but constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">We do not agree. This court has often observed, see Goldstein v. United States, 63 F.2d 609, 613 (8 Cir. 1933), that it is difficult for an appellate court on a cold record to reproduce accurately for itself the warm vig'or and atmosphere of the jury trial. But we cannot equate the court\u2019s remark as to counsel\u2019s statements not being true with an accusation of outright falsehood. The court, the witness and counsel were all, for the moment, in error as to the dates and the result of the dissolution but this was clarified after the noon recess. The court then advised the jury of its own error, the jury\u2019s nonconcern with the dissolution, and its desire not to be understood as having accused the taxpayer\u2019s counsel of lying. Of course, errors and statements of this type by a judge can, in a proper case, constitute error which is not subject to correction by apology or directions to the jury if the atmosphere of a fair trial is to be retained. The situation before us, however, is not of that category. Everyone, including the court, suddenly found himself in factual confusion over a matter which the court mistakenly thought was jurisdictional and for its immediate concern. The trial court readily recognized its error and premature conclusion. In our opinion it sufficiently clarified the matter with the jury in a way which left no prejudice in their minds and which was not inconsistent with substantial justice. The error was harmless within the scope of Rule 61, F.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">2. Other statements by the court before the jury. The taxpayers also complain that the district court, in its questioning of witnesses, in its running comments upon testimony, and in its characterization of it, overstepped the bounds of judicial propriety and deprived the taxpayers of the fair trial which was due them.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Much of this material is set forth in footnote 3. We have carefully examined the entire record and, specifically, the other portions to which our attention has been called by the taxpayers. They need not be quoted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">This trial judge is experienced and able. He obviously readily grasped the issues and was anxious to get on with the litigation. Each judge has his own manner and his own idea of proper judicial activity or inactivity in a lawsuit. One is relaxed and content to let counsel present evidence in his own way and unmolested. Another is less patient and prefers a tight rein. As an appellate court we certainly cannot dictate a trial judge\u2019s every move. Our responsibility is only to see that the court has not stepped into the area of unfairness and prejudice. We have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">\u201cAn appellate court should be slow to reverse a case for the alleged misconduct of the trial court, unless it appears that the conduct complained of Avas intended or calculated to disparage the defendant in the eyes of the jury and to prevent the jury from exercising an impartial judgment upon the merits.\u201d Goldstein v. United States, supra, p. 613 of 63 F.2d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-6\">\u201cWhile we find that the comments of the trial judge and his participation in the questioning of the defendant and his Avitnesses exceeded the bounds of judicial propriety, we must nevertheless also conclude that such activities, prejudiced the defendant before a new trial may be ordered on such grounds.\u201d Woodring v. United States, 311 F.2d 417, 420 (8 Cir. 1963), cert. denied 373 U.S. 913, 83 S.Ct. 1304, 10 L.Ed.2d 414.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Goldstein and Woodring were criminal cases; their standard h\u00e1s equal pertinency for civil causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">We understand the concern of counsel, but apart from the subsidiary question whether appropriate objections Avere noted, we are com\u00fanced, and we so hold, that the trial court\u2019s questions and comments did not constitute reversible error. In reviewing the record we observe, incidentally, that it contains instances of corresponding restraints and comments to government counsel. We find this record less extreme and objectionable than the situations described in Hickey v. United States, 208 F.2d 269, 274-75 (3 Cir. 1953), cert. denied 347 U.S. 919, 74 S.Ct. 519, 98 L.Ed. 1074; American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Napoli, 166 F.2d 24, 27 (5 Cir. 1948); and Knapp v. Kinsey, 232 F.2d 458, 465-67 (6 Cir. 1956), cert. denied 352 U.S. 892, 77 S.Ct. 131, 1 L.Ed. 2d 86, pressed upon us by the taxpayers, and those in our own cases of Agee v. Lofton, 287 F.2d 709 (8 Cir. 1961); Myers v. George, 271 F.2d 168, 83 A.L.R.2d 1121 (8 Cir. 1959); and Berry v. United States, 283 F.2d 465, 466-67 (8 Cir. 1960), cert denied 364 U.S. 934, 81 S. Ct. 380, 5 L.Ed.2d 366, where new trials were granted. Compare Throckmorton v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry., 179 F.2d 165, 169-70 (8 Cir. 1950), cert. denied 339 U.S. 944, 70 S.Ct. 797, 94 L.Ed. 1359; Illinois Terminal R. R. v. Creek, 207 F.2d 475, 480 (8 Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">3. The instructions and special verdict forms. Section 1551 concerns itself, among others, with-two factors: (1) whether the taxpayer corporation was \u201ccreated for the purpose of acquiring\u201d the property transferred to it, and (2) whether securing the surtax exemption was \u201ca major purpose of such transfer\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">The first of these was clearly satisfied as to both taxpayers. It is claimed, however, that the trial court misinterpreted and misapplied the statute in its instructions to the jury and in the special verdict forms in that it related loss of the surtax exemption not to \u201ca major purpose of such <em>transfer\u201d </em>but to \u201ca major purpose of [the taxpayers\u2019] <em>formation\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), and in that the court imposed for the jury a standard of \u201ctrue separateness\u201d as between the taxpayers and their parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">There is something to be said in support of this argument. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>did instruct that under \u00a7 1551, \u201cif a corporation is formed and a major purpose of its formation was obtaining this exemption then the Commissioner has the right to disallow the exemption\u201d It observed that the Commissioner had determined that a major purpose for which the taxpayers \u201cwere formed was to obtain the advantages under the law of the $25,-000 surtax exemption\u201d It posed the questions whether, each was incorporated to secure additional customers and whether the tax saving occasioned by incorporation \u201cwas not a major purpose of such incorporation\u201d, even though tax benefit \u201cfor such incorporation\u201d resulted. It instructed that it was not necessary that the exemption be \u201cthe sole or principal purpose of the formation\u201d and that it was sufficient if it was \u201ca major purpose that prompted its formation\u201d. It mentioned, as to each taxpayer, seven items which the jury might consider in deciding whether the surtax exemption was \u201ca major purpose for the formation\u201d. It stated that the burden of proof was on the taxpayers with respect to the exemption not being \u201ca major purpose for the formation\u201d. The special verdict submitted in each case was the question, \u201cWas obtaining the surtax exemption a major purpose of the formation of the\u201d taxpayer? It is thus apparent that on their face these portions of the instructions and the verdict forms are directed toward purpose of the corporations\u2019 formation rather than toward purpose of subsequent transfers of property to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Nevertheless, this point also must be ruled against the taxpayers. In the first place, although the taxpayers made other objections to the instructions, we find nothing in the record in the nature of objections directed specifically to this claim of misplaced emphasis as to purpose and thus nothing which meets the requirements of Rule 51, F.R.Civ.P. We note, secondly, that the taxpayers themselves, in the objections they did make, twice referred to purpose .at the time of formation. As a consequence, they are not now in a comfortable position to complain. Solomon Dehydrating Co. v. Guyton, 294 F.2d 439, 445 (8 Cir. 1961), cert. denied 368 U.S. 929, 82 S.Ct. 366, 7 L.Ed.2d 192. Thirdly, the court in its instructions did not restrict its comments to formation purpose. It observed as to each taxpayer that \u201cthe securing of the surtax exemption may constitute a major purpose of the transfer, notwithstanding that such formation was effected for a valid business purpose\u201d. Finally, there could have been no jury confusion here for there is no contention that the purpose of the transfer of assets to each taxpayer was different from the purpose of its formation. These were newly created corporations and the transfers took place promptly upon organization. If the formation purpose and the transfer purpose were different, taxpayers\u2019 point might have significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The import of \u00a7 1551 is clear. We think the statute is to be broadly approached. This is recognized by the Regulations, \u00a7 1.1551-1 (e), .which provide that \u201call circumstances relevant to the transfer shall be considered\u201d. We see nothing to indicate that the Regulations are not valid in this respect. It of course would have been preferable for the instructions and the verdict forms to have been directed to transfer purpose rather than formation purpose. Indeed, this court once said, \u201cEven in criminal cases, it is held as a general rule that where the law governing a case is expressed in a statute the court in its charge should use the language of the statute\u201d. Terminal R. R. Ass\u2019n v. Howell, 165 F.2d 135, 140 (8 Cir. 1948). But, after all, the standard is whether the instructions as a whole substantially apprised the jury of the meaning of the statute and whether they fairly and fully presented the issues to the jury. McDonnell v. Timmerman, 269 F.2d 54, 62 (8 Cir. 1959); Mounds Park Hospital v. Von Eye, 245 F.2d 756, 764, 70 A.L.R.2d 335 (8 Cir. 1957); Hansen v. Barrett, 186 F.Supp. 527, 532 (D.Minn.1960). We think this standard has been met here and without prejudice to the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1551.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-9\">\u201cIf any corporation transfers, on or after January 1, 1951, all or part of its property (other than money) to another corporation which was created for the purpose of acquiring such property * * * and if after such transfer the transferor corporation or its stockholders,' or both are in control of such transferee corporation during' any part of the taxable year of such transferee corporation, then such transferee corporation shall not for such taxable year * * * be allowed * * * the $25,000 exemption from surtax provided in section 11(c) * * * unless such transferee corporation shall establish by the clear preponderance of the evidence that the securing of such exemption * * * was not a major purpose of such transfer.

It has to do merely with the mechanics of the matter, which is a matter before the court. It will be taken up at some later time if under the law it need be taken up. That testimony, insofar as you are concerned, is of no interest to you. The attorney for the defendant seems to think I accused him of lying in</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">tbis matter. I don\u2019t think I did. If I did, I didn\u2019t moan that. I meant to say that he was mistaken, I thought, but none of that has anything to do with the problem with which you people are confronted. It isn\u2019t a matter that you will be instructed on; it isn\u2019t a matter that has anything whatever to do with the merits of the lawsuit. It is a matter that deals entirely with the law, it\u2019s a matter before the court, and so you can give no concern whatever to what may have been said in that respect insofar as the problems with which you are dealing are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">\u201cEither one of you want to add anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">\u201cMr. Bray: Excuse me, your Honor, just one thing.
