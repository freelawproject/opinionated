The decisive question before us arises from that issue. In this court defendant conceded that the verdict can be justified only upon a finding that the accident never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-26\">The fundamental issue rendered important the circumstances surrounding plaintiff\u2019s report of the occurrence to the defendant. There were discrepancies in plaintiff\u2019s testimony about the mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>orandum lie made after the occurrence, and in his identification of the cab and -driver. A report of defendant showed \"that the cab driver\u2019s name was unknown to plaintiff when he called deifendant to report the occurrence. There was testimony that neither alleged Checker driver reported the occurrence. In answer to a discovery interrogatory defendant indicated that the cab specified by plaintiff had not suffered damages the &gt;day of the occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">In view of these circumstances, we think the district court properly denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Before the trial plaintiff, pursuant to Rule 34,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> moved for the production of documents relating to, among other things, personnel and payroll records of \u201cLewis Danco\u201d; reports of accidents on February 12, 1957; and \u201ctrip sheets\u201d .and repair bills on \u201cTaxi Cab Nos. 4093 nnd 4673\u201d for damages on that date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion was supported by a sworn statement that Checker had denied the happening of the occurrence. The district court denied the motion with respect to the records pertaining to the driver. 'Though it allowed the motion with re.spect to an important part of the re:mainder of the documents sought, defendant produced none of the documents, 'but merely answered, as if to interrogatories, with its own interpretation -of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">We agree with plaintiff that the -district court\u2019s limitation of the motion \u2014worsened by defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the district court\u2019s order\u2014 was prejudicially erroneous. Plaintiff was entitled under Rule 34 to have the documents produced for his inspection, and it was not enough for defendant to submit merely its own interpretation of the documents. In view of our conclusion, we need not pass on the question of the propriety of the court\u2019s quashing of a subpoena duces tecum directing defendant to produce employment records of the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">Rules 26 to 37, the discovery-deposition provisions of the Federal Rules, were intended to insure \u201cproper litigation\u201d, Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507, 67 S.Ct. 385, 392, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947), by making the \u201ctrial less a game of blindman\u2019s buff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable extent.\u201d United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S.Ct. 983, 986, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1958). Accordingly, these provisions authorize either party to \u201ccompel the other to disgorge whatever facts he has in his possession.\u201d Hickman v. Taylor, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-20\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion was not given the \u201cbroad and liberal treatment\u201d to which it was entitled. Hickman v. Taylor, supra. The limitation by the district court and defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the order as given had the effect of keeping the jury in the dark about the fundamental issue of occurrence. As a result, the only evidence plaintiff was able to produce of the occurrence to the jury was his own testimony. All other evidence, or information which might lead to evidence, was under the control of the defendant, with the exception of the interpretation of the documents which defendant furnished plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>It is within the discretion of the district court to place bounds on the extent of discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think, however, that we should interfere with the district court\u2019s ruling, both because its limitation was improvident and it affected plaintiff\u2019s substantial rights. Roebling v. Anderson, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 237, 257 F.2d 615, 619 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We now dispose of several points raised by defendant in support of the judgment: We distinguish Sue v. Chicago Transit Authority, 279 F.2d 416 (7th Cir. 1960), since there the information in documents sought was already known and no showing of prejudice was made. Plaintiff\u2019s motion in the case at bar, indicating by facts the issue of occurrence, was a sufficient showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d under Rule 34. Defendant did not contend below, except as to certain \u201ctrip sheets,\u201d that plaintiff was precluded from inspection of the documents because he did not show they existed. The documents were records kept in the ordinary course of defendant\u2019s business and presumably existed. McDowell Associates, Inc. v. Pennsylvania RR. Co., 20 F.R.D. 219 (S.D.N.Y.1957). Had the issue of existence been raised, plaintiff could have made proof of existence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">There is no basis for the inference that Rule 34 was being improperly used here on a \u201cfishing expedition,\u201d to \u201cdiscover what exists\u201d rather than to \u201cforce the production of items that do exist.\u201d Tobin v. WKRZ, Inc., 12 F.R.D. 200, 201 (W.D.Pa.1952). And in Fisher v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 246 F.2d 344, 350 (7th Cir. 1957), \u201cit was obvious, when the order was entered, that it could not be complied with\u201d because the automobile sought for inspection had been sold. Here defendant\u2019s business records are presumably under its \u201cpossession, custody, or control.\u201d United Mercantile Agencies v. Silver Fleet Motor Express, Inc., 1 F.R.D. 709 (W.D.Ky.1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">For the reversible error in denying plaintiff the motion to produce essential relevant documents and records in defendant\u2019s possession \u2014 aggravated by defendant\u2019s failure to produce documents according to the court\u2019s order \u2014 the case must be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">During the trial the jury unfortunately was informed that some of the plaintiff\u2019s bills had been paid under workmen\u2019s compensation and were not paid by him. Also the jury was informed that plaintiff had reported his \u201caccident\u201d to his own insurer before reporting to defendant. It is unnecessary to place the blame for these events. Neither circumstance had a place in the case and on retrial extra care should be used to exclude them.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\"> The court erroneously quashed the deposition of plaintiff\u2019s Dr. Gould, a Missouri osteopath who treated plaintiff from the date of the alleged incident to the trial. On April 29, 1960, in his Missouri office, he testified from memory alone, and refused, on defendant\u2019s demand, to produce his records of treatment of plaintiff. Since the doctor testified from memory alone, defendant was not entitled to have the records produced at the taking of the deposition. Echert v. United States, 188 F.2d 336, 343, 26 A.L.R.2d 752 (8th Cir.1951). The opportunity given by the district court to bring the doctor from Missouri with his records did not cure the error. The error should not be repeated in the retrial. If defendant wishes to obtain Dr. Gould\u2019s records, it has the opportunity to do so by appropriate procedures on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">For the reasons given, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-8\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 34 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK4u\">\u201cUpon motion of any party showing good cause therefor * * * and subject to the provisions of Rule 30(b), the court * * * may (1) order any party to produce and permit the inspection * * * by or on behalf of the moving party, of any designated documents * * * which constitute or contain evidence relating to any of the matters within the scope of the examination permitted by Rule 26(b) and which are in his possession, custody, or control * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-22\">. There was a previous motion under Rule 34 which was withdrawn. Both motions were identical, except that the first motion designated the driver\u2019s name as \u201cLouis Danko\u201d and the cab numbers as \u201c4003 and 4673.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b908-6\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">. The \u201cproper method\u201d to rebut plaintiff\u2019s sworn motion was for defendant to file an affidavit denying existence. Tobin v. WKRZ, Inc., 12 F.R.D. 200, 202 (W.D. Pa.1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
