Sells and Settimo were tried by the court without a jury. One count was dismissed at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case; a verdict of not guilty was returned on the two remaining counts as to Settimo; and guilty as to Sells on one count (eight). Sells appeals. In substance, the charge against Sells was the knowing submission of a false statement in an FHA credit application form to a bank for the purpose of obtaining a loan, insured by FHA, for a home owner, James Caines. The falsity consisted of a statement that the proceeds of the loan ($3,500) were to be used for specified home improvements whereas in fact Sells knew that some of the proceeds were not to be so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-24\">Appellant\u2019s main argument on appeal is that Settimo\u2019s acquittal and Sells\u2019 conviction are factually inconsistent and that Settimo\u2019s acquittal stands as a bar to Sells\u2019 conviction. In support of this argument, appellant relies upon United States v. Maybury, 274 F.2d 899 (2 Cir. 1960). In. Maybury there was a single defendant and a two-count indictment, (1) forging, and (2) uttering, a check known to have been forged. The trial judge had acquitted the defendant of the forgery but convicted on the uttering count. This court held (three separate opinions) that a conviction of uttering with knowledge of the forged signature was factually inconsistent with acquittal of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-25\">Here no such problem is presented. Although Sells and Settimo were both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>salesmen and both participated in the Caines transaction, the proof against each was not identical. Caines testified that Sells, when Settimo was not present, told him that with respect to the money obtained, \u201cYou can eat it up and drink it up if you want to.\u201d The writing on the credit application and on two M &amp; S Construction Corporation contracts was Sells\u2019. Furthermore, according to FBI Agent Scuderi\u2019s testimony, Sells admitted that information on Caines\u2019 credit application regarding Caines\u2019 employment was false. Despite the questionable quality of Caines\u2019 testimony which often bordered on the incoherent, there was a sufficient difference in the proof adduced against Sells and Settimo to justify the difference in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
