The $21 million verdict awarded, according to plaintiff, barely compensates her for the lasting effects of the sexual harassment she endured as an employee of defendant, DaimlerChrysler, by whom she is still employed and earning almost $100,000 a year. She contended during her trial that defendant\u2019s failure to deal adequately with sexual harassment in her plant led to a permanent change in her \u201cbrain chemistry\u201d and a relapse into substance abuse and depression, and that these conditions will soon lead to her untimely and excruciating death.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">The foundation for this theory of recovery was laid by the expert opinion testimony of a social worker who had a longstanding relationship with plaintiffs counsel. This witness not only lacked any training, education, or experience in medicine, but also testified falsely about his credentials. Nevertheless, plaintiff asked the jury to treat this witness\u2019s testimony as a \u201cprognosis,\u201d and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>compensate plaintiff for the loss of her health and, eventually, her life. Plaintiffs counsel evoked images of physical abuse and torture, compared his client to survivors of the Holocaust, and argued that defendant DaimlerChrysler thought of itself as \u201cGod Almighty,\u201d exempt from the legal norms that govern others. Thus, in defendant\u2019s view, the verdict was the product of inflammatory rhetoric, unscientific \u201cexpert\u201d testimony, fraud on the court, and attorney misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">We granted leave to appeal in order to determine whether the verdict was a legitimate estimate of plaintiffs losses, as plaintiff contends, or whether it was, as defendant argues, an unjust, excessive award procured through systematic misconduct by plaintiffs trial counsel and supported by dubious evidence. The majority and the dissent agree on one fundamental fact: the verdict rendered in this case is excessive and cannot be affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>A careful review of the record reveals that plaintiffs trial counsel engaged in a sustained and deliberate effort to divert the jury\u2019s attention from the facts and the law. In their stead, counsel interposed misleading argument, prejudice-baiting rhetoric, and pleas for punitive damages. This rhetoric had its intended result: the jury\u2019s verdict unmistakably reflects passion rather than reason and prejudice rather than impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">We conclude that the trial court lacked any justification for denying defendant\u2019s postverdict motion for a new trial under MCR 2.611. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. We reverse, and we remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">It is undisputed that plaintiff, Linda Gilbert, has long waged a losing battle with substance abuse. Her personal struggles were thoroughly documented in medical records that plaintiff introduced at trial in order to establish damages. According to those records, Ms. Gilbert began drinking at fourteen and began using cocaine at twenty years of age. Most of her adult life has since been marked by excessive drinking. At one point during her employment with defendant, she reported to her substance abuse counselors that she was consuming a pint to one-fifth gallon of alcohol a day. Her cocaine use also continued during her employment with defendant, as documented by records from St. John Hospital and Sacred Heart Rehabilitation Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Ms. Gilbert sought professional assistance on a number of occasions and has been treated on both an inpatient and outpatient basis for substance abuse. On the basis of the testimony at trial, however, it appears that none of these treatments has been entirely successful. Indeed, the foundation of plaintiffs claim for $140 million in damages was the assertion that plaintiffs substance abuse would continue until it resulted in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Plaintiffs work life contrasts markedly with her personal difficulties. In the mid-eighties, plaintiff began an apprenticeship to train for a career as a millwright. By 1990, plaintiff had become a journeyman millwright and was hired two years later by the Chrysler Corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff was the first female millwright to work at Chrysler\u2019s Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit. To our knowledge, plaintiff continues to work for defendant and, according to her attorney, earns \u201cnearly $100,000 per year\u201d with overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Plaintiff initiated the present sexual harassment action against defendant on March 25, 1994, complaining that a hostile work environment existed in defendant\u2019s Jefferson North plant. At that time, plaintiff had reported two specific instances of harassment through defendant\u2019s formal discrimination reporting procedure. The first incident took place on May 22, 1993, a little over a year after plaintiff began working for defendant. Plaintiff reported that she found a lewd cartoon taped to her toolbox. It depicted a woman in a bar engaged in an \u201carm-wrestling\u201d match with a man\u2019s penis. Plaintiffs name was written above the woman in the car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>toon, and the name of a coworker was written on the man whose penis was being wrestled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">After receiving plaintiffs oral report of this cartoon, plaintiffs supervisor and area coordinator apologized to plaintiff, stated that defendant \u201cdid not condone such action\u201d and that they would address the problem by speaking with employees in the area and distributing copies of defendant\u2019s written policy against sexual harassment. Defendant\u2019s internal memo notes that an employee in Chrysler\u2019s human resources department and several other employees spoke with the workers in plaintiffs area and distributed the company\u2019s sexual harassment guidelines following plaintiffs report.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The second reported incident took place on June 5, 1993, when plaintiff found a Polaroid photograph of a penis on her toolbox. She informed her supervisor about the picture. Defendant\u2019s internal memo concerning the complaint indicates that its supervisory employees apologized to plaintiff and reassured her that \u201c[Chrysler did] not approve of such action, and that [Chrysler was] doing everything possible to prevent such harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">On the basis of these two incidents, plaintiff initiated a lawsuit against defendant alleging breach of contract, violations of the Michigan Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq., </em>and negligence in addressing plaintiffs concerns about sexual harassment in the workplace.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>After filing her lawsuit, plaintiff formally reported to management several other incidents of harassment that occurred while the suit was pending. Plaintiff reported that, on October 10, 1994, she found a vulgar cartoon entitled \u201cHighway Signs You Should Know\u201d taped to her locker;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> she also reported that she had found an article by \u201cDr. Ruth\u201d taped to her locker one week earlier.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response, Maya Baker, a human resources facilitator for defendant, personally patrolled plaintiffs work area on occasion and also asked union leaders to share with union members that the responsible party could be terminated. Next, plaintiff reported that on March 12, 1995, she found a lewd and misogynistic \u201cpoem\u201d on a bulletin board in a work area adjacent to hers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant investigated these latter two incidents and, being unable to determine the responsible party, removed the bulletin board.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Finally, on September 2, 1997, plaintiff formally reported that a coworker made references to his \u201cbig meat\u201d in front of her. In response to plaintiffs complaint about her coworker\u2019s apparent reference to his genitals, defendant reprimanded the responsible employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">These are the only sexual harassment incidents that plaintiff made known to defendant through the formal procedures established by defendant for such matters. However, plaintiff contends that defendant had actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>notice of other incidents because of her description of those incidents during her deposition testimony given after the commencement of this suit and that defendant had \u201cconstructive notice\u201d of other incidents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Before trial, defendant moved to exclude \u201cevidence regarding incidents that were never reported.\u201d After hearing argument on this motion, the court denied defendant\u2019s request and admitted testimony and evidence on these unreported incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">At trial, plaintiff offered the testimony of social worker Carol Katz and of certified social worker and substance abuse counselor Steven Hnat. Mr. Hnat had counseled plaintiff regarding her substance abuse problems before the initiation of her lawsuit against Daim-lerChrysler. He therefore testified as both a fact witness and an expert witness. His testimony proved to be the linchpin of plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Mr. Hnat opined that the harassment experienced by plaintiff had caused irreversible changes in her brain chemistry, causing her to relapse into alcoholism and to develop \u201cmajor depressive disorder.\u201d He testified that he had reviewed medical records prepared by other health professionals and, in his opinion, those records read \u201clike a preview of [plaintiffs] death certificate.\u201d He further opined that plaintiffs body was beginning to \u201cdecompensat[e],\u201d and that she was \u201cclearly dying.\u201d Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Hnat\u2019s theory was that plaintiff would develop a fatal case of pancreatitis, a disease that Mr. Hnat testified was \u201cthe most painful way to die.\u201d In the end, he told the jury that plaintiff was likely to die relatively soon because of \u201cmedical complications,\u201d and that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t bet on her living very long.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Thus, plaintiffs theory of the case, as introduced through Mr. Hnat, was that the sexual harassment plaintiff encountered at Chrysler caused a permanent change in her brain chemistry that produced a relapse into alcohol abuse and the onset of depression. These conditions, in turn, would lead inexorably to plaintiffs untimely and excruciating death.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">After a six-week trial and 1-1/2 days of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of $21 million in favor of plaintiff. With prejudgment interest, a judgment for more than $30 million was entered for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">On October 29, 1999, defendant moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), a new trial, remit-titur, an evidentiary hearing, and relief from judgment. The motion argued, among other things, that plaintiffs counsel and Mr. Hnat had perpetrated fraud on the court through misrepresentations about Mr. Hnat\u2019s relationship with plaintiffs counsel and about his academic credentials. Mr. Hnat testified at trial that he received a master\u2019s degree in \u201cpsychobiology\u201d from the. University of Michigan, and that, as an undergraduate, he won the prestigious Pillsbury Prize in psychology. These claims were duplicated on a version of Mr. Hnat\u2019s resume that was introduced as a trial exhibit. In fact, both statements were shown after trial to be false. Nevertheless, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motions on May 1,2000. The Court of Appeals affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>On April 8, 2003, we granted defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">On appeal to this Court, defendant asserts four major claims of error. First, DaimlerChrysler argues that plaintiff failed to state a claim of sexual harassment under the Michigan Civil Rights Act (CRA) because she did not show that defendant\u2019s response to the six reported incidents of sexual harassment was inadequate. Second, defendant argues that it is entitled to a new trial because of the persistent and blatant misconduct of plaintiffs trial counsel. Third, defendant maintains that the trial court committed error requiring reversal by admitting the opinion testimony of a social worker on medical issues and that this error was exacerbated by plaintiffs use of that testimony to inflame the jury. Finally, DaimlerChrysler argues that the $21 million verdict received by plaintiff is so excessive and so clearly punitive that it is entitled to remit-titur.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">A trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial under MCR 2.611 is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The determination that a trial court abused its discretion \u201cinvolves far more than a difference in judicial opinion.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, a court abuses its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>discretion \u201cwhen \u2018an unprejudiced person\u2019 considering \u2018the facts upon which the trial court acted, [would] say that there was no justification or excuse for the ruling made.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">B. DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Defendant moved for postjudgment relief on a number of grounds. One of the grounds was that the verdict was the product of prejudice and passion. According to defendant, plaintiffs counsel had repeatedly equated plaintiffs experiences to those of the victims of the Holocaust, and thereby associated defendant\u2019s new German co-owners with the Nazis who perpetrated that horror. This argument, according to defendant, was bolstered by the expert testimony of a social worker who suggested to the jury that sexual harassment had altered plaintiffs \u201cbrain chemistry\u201d and would lead to her untimely and agonizing death. Defendant argued that the excessiveness of the verdict\u2014a $21 million award\u2014palpably reflected the passion and prejudice that plaintiff sought to instill in the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The trial court had the discretion to grant this request for a new trial under MCR 2.611(A)(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-8\">A new trial may be granted to all or some of the parties, on all or some of the issues, whenever their substantial rights are materially affected, for any of the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-9\">(a) Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or prevailing party, or an order of the court or abuse of discretion which denied the moving party a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-10\">(b) Misconduct of the jury or of the prevailing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>(c) Excessive or inadequate damages appearing to have been influenced by passion or prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-4\">(d) A verdict clearly or grossly inadequate or excessive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">(e) A verdict or decision against the great weight of the evidence or contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">(f) Material evidence, newly discovered, which could not with reasonable diligence have been discovered and produced at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-7\">(g) Error of law occurring in the proceedings, or mistake of fact by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">An objective review of the proceedings below leads to the conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant a new trial under MCR 2.611(A)(1)(c). The jury verdict is so excessive and so clearly the product of passion and prejudice that there can be no justification for the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">1. AN \u201cEXCESSIVE\u201d VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">In order to grant relief under MCR 2.611(A)(1)(c), it is first necessary to determine whether the verdict is \u201cexcessive.\u201d Because subsection c does not define this term, it must be given its \u201cplain and ordinary meaning[].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cExcessive\u201d is defined as \u201cgoing beyond the usual, necessary, or proper limit or degree; characterized by excess.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the context of compensatory damages, the determination whether damages exceed the \u201cnecessary or proper limit\u201d is no simple task. \u201c[T]he authority to measure damages,\u201d as we stated in <em>Kelly v Builder\u2019s Square, </em>\u201cinheres in the jury\u2019s role as trier of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the amount required to compensate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>party for pain and suffering is imprecise, that calculation typically belongs to the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The difficulty of reviewing damage awards, however, does not undermine the judicial obligation to do so under MCR 2.611. A reviewing court is therefore faced with the task of ensuring that a verdict is not \u201cexcessive\u201d without concomitantly usurping the jury\u2019s authority to determine the amount necessary to compensate an injured party. Given the impossibility of using a simple algorithm for this task, judicial review of compensatory awards must rely on the fundamental principle behind compensatory damages\u2014that of recompensing the injured party for losses proven in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">This, in effect, is the rationale behind three of the four factors that a majority of this Court endorsed in <em>Palenkas v Beaumont</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>Palenkas </em>majority stressed that appellate review of jury verdicts must be based on <em>objective </em>factors and firmly grounded in the record.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, judicial review of purportedly excessive jury verdicts should focus on the following objective factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">whether the verdict was the result of improper methods, prejudice, passion, partiality, sympathy, corruption, or mistake of law or fact; [2] whether the verdict was within the limits of what reasonable minds would deem just compensation for the injury sustained; [and 3] whether the amount actually awarded is comparable to awards in similar cases within the state and in other jurisdictions.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>When a verdict is procured through improper methods of advocacy, misleading argument, or other factors that confound the jury\u2019s quantification of a party\u2019s injuries, that amount is inherently unreliable and unlikely to be a fair estimate of the injured party\u2019s losses. Likewise, when a verdict is unsupported by the record or entirely inconsistent with verdicts rendered in similar cases, a reviewing court may fairly conclude that the verdict exceeds the amount required to compensate the injured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-3\">When analyzing a verdict according to the <em>Palenkas </em>factors, courts must be mindful of the fact that punitive damages are available in Michigan <em>only </em>when expressly authorized by the Legislature.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Here, the Civil Rights Act does not authorize punitive damages\u2014and, moreover, permits compensation only for \u201cinjury or loss caused by each violation of this act, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, the court has a statutory obligation under the CRA to ensure, through consideration of the objective factors described by <em>Palenkas, </em>that this damage award serves the ends articulated by the Legislature.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>We turn first to the question \u201cwhether the verdict was the result of improper methods, prejudice, passion, partiality, sympathy, corruption, or mistake of law or fact... ,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As shown in greater detail in Part 11(B)(2), we have concluded that this verdict was the product of misleading argument, inflammatory rhetoric, and the improper admission of expert opinion testimony utterly lacking in scientific support.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The first <em>Palenkas </em>factor listed above therefore provides strong support for the conclusion that this verdict is \u201cexcessive,\u201d as that term is used in MCR 2.611(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The second <em>Palenkas </em>factor addresses \u201cwhether the verdict was within the limits of what reasonable minds would deem just compensation for the injury sustained .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This inquiry into the reasonableness of the verdict concerns, in essence, whether the verdict is supported by the record. Here, it is apparent that the jury verdict is unsupported by the evidence in one sense. The jury awarded plaintiff $1 million in trust for future medical expenses and \u201closs of future earning capacity,\u201d despite the fact that plaintiff failed to demonstrate any economic harm in the present, much less a \u201closs of future earning capacity.\u201d In fact, according to her counsel, plaintiff continues to earn almost $100,000 a year with overtime pay as an employee of defendant. Similarly, there was no evidence regarding the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>medical treatment that plaintiff may have to undergo in the future or the likely cost of that treatment. The jury\u2019s estimation of plaintiffs future economic loss was without support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">The remainder of the verdict\u2014$20 million\u2014was intended to compensate plaintiff for emotional distress, \u201cphysical pain and suffering,\u201d and the aggravation of her substance abuse. There may be some cases in which it is possible to determine objectively that a compensatory award is or is not supported by the record. But this determination is extremely problematic where damages for emotional distress are at issue. In such cases, comparison with damage awards in comparable cases in this jurisdiction and beyond\u2014the final <em>Palenkas </em>factor \u2014becomes most relevant. While the resultant analysis is certainly imperfect, other damage awards may provide a range of what constitutes reasonable compensation for the type of injury suffered by a plaintiff. With this range in mind, the reviewing court may determine whether the verdict appears to be \u201cwithin the limits of what reasonable minds would deem just compensation for the injury sustained .. . ,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Turning finally to the third <em>Palenkas </em>factor, the $21 million verdict awarded in this case is far beyond the range of what other juries have determined to be reasonable compensation for injuries similar to\u2014and much worse than\u2014those suffered by plaintiff. To our knowledge, plaintiffs $21 million verdict is the largest amount ever awarded for a single-plaintiff sexual harassment claim in the United States. It is seventy times larger than the maximum award permitted under title VII, the federal civil rights act.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Indeed, plaintiff has not cited a <em>single </em>compensatory verdict in an employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>ment discrimination action from any court within the United States that arguably rivals the amount awarded to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In responding to defendant\u2019s argument that the $21 million verdict is \u201cthe largest single-plaintiff sexual harassment award upheld on appeal anywhere in the entire country,\u201d plaintiff has argued to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">Defendant\u2019s \u201cother sexual harassment\u201d case analysis is far from honest. Looking only at automobile companies, and ignoring every other case of sexual harassment in any other field of employment in the Country, the largest recovery is a $34,000,000 settlement by Mitsubishi in June of 1998.. .. While Daimler Chrysler may believe that sexual harassment of women is acceptable and insignificant, other automobile manufacturers recognize their responsibilities and the gravity of injury by agreeing to high seven and eight figure settlements to avoid the higher measure of full redress available to a victim like Linda Gilbert who recovers for all losses at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Plaintiffs attack on defendant\u2019s \u201cdishonesty\u201d here omits a crucial fact: Mitsubishi\u2019s $34 million settlement was in a <em>class action.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em>\u2019 </em>We are unaware, therefore, of any single-plaintiff employment discrimination verdict involving a nonpunitive award that even arguably approaches the amount awarded to plaintiff, and plaintiff has identified none.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Plaintiff argues that this discrepancy between her verdict and every other sexual harassment verdict in the United States simply reflects the jury\u2019s recognition that defendant\u2019s conduct was much, much worse than that of any other defendant in a sexual harassment case. While we have no doubt that plaintiff encountered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>truly ugly conduct at Chrysler given the evidence and testimony adduced at trial, we cannot accept the argument that plaintiffs was the <em>worst </em>case of sexual harassment in the history of the country that has resulted in a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\">A survey of verdicts rendered in other sexual harassment suits reveals that plaintiffs who endure sexual harassment in its most aggressive form\u2014unwanted touching and persistent, predatory sexual advances\u2014 uniformly have received far less in compensatory damages than the amount awarded to plaintiff. For example, in <em>Griffin v City of Opa-locka, </em>a party who alleged that she was sexually harassed during a four-month period and was raped by her manager was awarded $2 million.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> And in <em>Grow v WA Thomas Co, </em>the plaintiff alleged that she was subjected to \u201csexually explicit comments and unwanted kissing and groping\u201d over several years and recovered $192,684.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Indeed, the only plaintiffs who have recovered sexual harassment verdicts that are even arguably comparable to that rendered in this case are those who recovered <em>punitive </em>damages.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Even among cases in which a plaintiff recovered punitive damages for sexual harassment, our research discloses no case in which a party recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ered a punitive award that approached or exceeded $21 million that was upheld on appeal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">On the basis of three of the factors articulated by this Court in <em>Palenkas, </em>we conclude that the verdict in this case is \u201cexcessive\u201d as that term is used in MCR 2.611. Not only does the verdict exceed verdicts in similar cases by leaps and bounds, but, as shown in this opinion, it was awarded by a jury inflamed by hyperbolic rhetoric, prejudice-baiting argument, and unscientific expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">2. PASSION AND PREJUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Having determined that the verdict is excessive, we also conclude excessiveness may be attributed to the effect of plaintiffs efforts to cause the jury to act on passion and prejudice. An objective review of the record leads to an unavoidable conclusion: plaintiffs counsel engaged in a systematic effort to divert the jury from its true task\u2014that of appropriately compensating the plaintiff for any losses suffered as a result of defendant\u2019s violation of the CRA\u2014and instead sought to inflame passion and to incite the jury to punish the defendant even while disclaiming that he was seeking punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Plaintiffs counsel deliberately tried to provoke the jury by supplanting law, fact, and reason with prejudice, misleading arguments, and repeated <em>ad hominem </em>attacks against defendant based on its corporate status. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Given the undeniable role of this inflammatory rhetoric, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">One of counsel\u2019s tactics in this vein was his repeated attempts to equate plaintiff with the victims of the Holocaust. This association began during the testimony of plaintiffs expert, Steven Hnat, when Mr. Hnat testified that plaintiffs psychological state was akin to that of concentration camp survivors. Plaintiffs counsel further developed this theme during his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">Never again. Never again. That is a line now used by the sabreurs [sic; sabras] in Israel, the land of Israel, to mean that the unspeakable horrors that were perpetrated on the people of Israel, on the Jews, must never be forgotten and must never happen again. Never again. Never again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Counsel also exhorted the jury to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">provide full and complete justice and thereby, as I indicated at the start of this trial, raise the roof of this courthouse so that justice will ring loud and clear. No more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">As those young [sabras] said in the land of Israel, no more. We will not let this stand. We will not allow this to pass. We will not allow you, you, an equal with all of us in this, the great equalizer, to crush the health and the dreams of a woman who simply had the American dream.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Even the final sentence of plaintiffs closing argument referenced the Holocaust theme: \u201cLet\u2019s bury this prejudice once and for all so that we may appropriately say, never again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>This recurring rhetorical theme was especially virulent given the context of plaintiffs trial. In 1998, Chrysler had merged with Daimler Benz AG, a German automobile manufacturer. The merger was highly publicized\u2014particularly in metropolitan Detroit, where plaintiffs trial was held. And if any of the jurors had failed to hear about the merger through media outlets, they were privy to the news once plaintiffs counsel pointed out during his closing argument that Chrysler was under German ownership:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">Daimler-Chrysler may be powerful, but, my God, they are going to have to recognize, hopefully today by your verdict, that not only must they face justice in this case, they must obey the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">We are a nation of laws, not powerful individuals. We are a nation of laws ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-7\">And, I can assure that verdict will be heard from the floor of that plant on Jefferson to the board room in Auburn Hills or Stuttgart. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-8\">Once they hear in Auburn Hills and in Germany about Linda ... it will stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Continuing on this theme, counsel argued that the jury now had a chance to acquaint Chrysler\u2019s German owners with a distinctly <em>American </em>brand of justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">[You must] ring that bell of justice even if you have to have it rung across the oceans of this land to their board rooms, wherever they may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-11\">Chrysler must take notice that it is responsible, under the Constitution and laws of this state, and that we are ringing the bell of justice so that she can walk a little taller and stand a little prouder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">Thus, counsel\u2019s closing argument had a clear rhetorical aim of making defendant\u2019s German ownership a critical issue in the minds of the jurors. By associating plaintiff with those who had endured inhuman treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>ment in concentration camps, counsel likened defendant DaimlerChrysler\u2014which, as the jury was informed, was partially under German ownership\u2014with the Nazis. This argument was an attempt to incite the jury to heap upon the <em>defendant </em>the moral outrage that is now reserved for the Nazis and those who assisted them in carrying out the Holocaust. It was, in other words, a naked appeal to passion and prejudice and an attempt to divert the jury from the facts and the law relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\">Besides associating defendant with one of the most destructive and inhumane forces in modern history, counsel attempted artfully to convince the jury that defendant itself had <em>physically </em>harmed plaintiff, when there was no record of physical injury in the record. In describing plaintiffs refusal to quit her position as a millwright, counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-4\">She stayed. She was not going to give up. <em>You could kick her. You could torture her. </em>You could harass her. You could put her in hospitals, but she was going to claw. She was going to hold on. She was going to do whatever was necessary to not lose that last shred of humanity that made her pull\u2014that constitutes the soul, the thread, that will live on forever after she is gone. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Plaintiffs counsel also equated plaintiff with a dog that had been kicked, beaten, and physically abused on a daily basis. Although counsel was quick to point out that he was not saying that plaintiff was <em>actually </em>a dog, he failed to mention that there was absolutely no evidence that plaintiff had been physically abused in any way by any employee of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Plaintiffs counsel also played on prejudice against corporations, arguing that DaimlerChrysler thought that it did not have to obey the law simply because of its corporate status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>You [defendant] are not God Almighty sitting on the mountain. You are not Zeus ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">We will hold you to the same standard we will hold to anyone else, because their attitude speaks volume [sic] of their belief that they are above being held to the same standard as a lowly woman millwright would be held to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Later, plaintiffs counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">[Apparently ... when you enter the confines of a multi, a very, very successful business over on Jefferson, that the laws of civility don\u2019t apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">That they are... permitted under the laws and the Constitution of this state to be less civil and less respectful of civil rights... . They think, they must think that it is okay with you that this type of thing went on day after day. That it was okay to treat a woman the way Linda was treated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">That it was okay with you that they tried to take away a woman\u2019s livelihood, the first and only female millwright ever employed at that plant. That it is okay to humiliate and degrade a woman as she tries to earn and do her best[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Equally telling is counsel\u2019s argument that \u201c[plaintiff was] discriminated against twice, because she is not Lee Iacocca. She is just a millwright.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">There was no evidence presented at trial suggesting that anyone employed by defendant thought incorporation relieved it of the obligation to follow the law. Nor was there evidence that anyone in the management of DaimlerChrysler approved of sexual harassment or would have responded differently had a corporate officer been the subject of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">These arguments were little more than pleas for the jury to consider defendant\u2019s corporate status rather than its true liability under the CRA. However justifiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>counsel\u2019s moral indignation over the treatment plaintiff encountered while working for DaimlerChrysler, that indignation does not and cannot justify rhetoric that attempts to inflame passion and prejudice and that intentionally subverts the jury\u2019s fact-finding role.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Finally, plaintiffs counsel attempted to inject passion and prejudice into the adjudication of this matter by deliberately and repeatedly using language that calls for punitive rather than compensatory damages. A number of these pleas for punitive damages have already been cited. One request for punitive damages was particularly overt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-5\">You must consider the days, the minutes, the hours, and the weeks that she went through for seven years, and for as long as God gives her on this plant [sic], God help her, and allows her to maintain on this plant [sic], despite the disease that she is suffering from, the diseases that she will suffer from, and that will kill her, you must consider that, and so that your verdict reflect the enormity of the wrong, the intolerable nature of the injury, the extent of the humiliation, the torture, the extent of the outrage perpetrated upon, I can suggest, and you can go back in your jury room, and you determine whether this is right. That is should be more, that it should be less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">But I suggest to you that you award as full and complete justice for the seven years of past and for the future, whatever it holds, $140,000,000.00. You can break that any way you want....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">[T]he hopes and dreams of all free Americans exist in Linda the way they do in all of us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-8\">And to destroy those, and to subject anyone to the type of indignity and injustice and intolerable acts that this woman has been subjected to for the past seven years, that figure reflects a symbol, if you will, since you can\u2019t adequately compensate her for every....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>This soliloquy stopped briefly only when defense counsel objected to this use of punitive damages rhetoric and the court gave a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The verdict rendered by the jury, however, showed that the damage had been done\u2014that counsel\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric had its intended effect. Instead of awarding plaintiff an amount that fully and fairly compensated her, the jury returned a verdict that responded to plaintiffs request that they \u201csend a message\u201d to Chrysler.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Counsel\u2019s persistent and deliberate efforts to incite passion and prejudice distinguish this case from those in which inflammatory remarks were fleeting and unintentional.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Plaintiffs counsel has been admonished in two published Court of Appeals opinions since this trial for precisely the same sort of hyperbolic and vitriolic argument he made on behalf of Linda Gilbert.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Overreaching, prejudice-baiting rhetoric appears to be a calculated, routine feature of counsel\u2019s trial strategy. This deliberate use of improper argument, coupled with the astonishingly excessive verdict rendered against defendant, precludes us from concluding that counsel\u2019s misconduct was \u201cinnocuous\u201d and \u201cunintended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">In fact, plaintiffs counsel\u2019s behavior during trial is remarkably similar to what necessitated a new trial in <em>Reetz v Kinsman Marine Transit Co.</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiff in <em>Reetz </em>was injured when he fell into an open hatch while working as a deckhand. The vessel on which the plaintiff sustained his injuries was owned by Kinsman Marine Transit Company, and George Steinbrenner, III, served as chairman of the board for Kinsman\u2019s parent company. Reetz\u2019s counsel made Kinsman\u2019s corporate status an issue at trial, arguing that Kinsman \u201ccared nothing about Reetz\u2019s welfare ... .\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Further, Reetz\u2019s counsel made \u201crepeated references\u201d to Mr. Steinbren-ner, despite the fact that Mr. Steinbrenner had no personal involvement in the case.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We concluded in <em>Reetz </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">[t]he effect of these comments was to create in the minds of the jurors an image of Kinsman as an unfeeling, powerful corporation controlled by a ruthless millionaire. Even a juror who harbored no prejudice against corporations or millionaires might have been swayed by these inflammatory remarks to alter his view of the evidence.[<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>On the basis of counsel\u2019s <em>ad hominem </em>attacks against the defendant and his numerous references to multimillion dollar verdicts in other cases, we concluded that the jury had been incurably tainted and a new trial was necessary.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The parallel to arguments made by plaintiffs counsel in this case is striking. Here, however, the anticorporate rhetoric was even less subtle than that supporting a new trial in <em>Reetz.</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And instead of referring to other multimillion dollar verdicts, counsel repeatedly utilized language calling for punitive damages.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">\u201c[t]he record in the instant case shows a deliberate course of conduct on the part of counsel for plaintiff aimed at preventing defendant from having a fair and impartial trial. We think the course of misconduct was so persistently followed that a charge of the Court in an effort to obviate the prejudice would have been useless.\u201d[<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">When faced with defendant\u2019s motion for postjudgment relief under MCR 2.611, the trial court had no reason to deny relief and every reason to grant it. In making its ruling on defendant\u2019s posttrial motions, the trial court clearly ignored the prominence of prejudicial rhetoric in plaintiffs closing argument and the effect that this rhetoric had on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The trial court\u2019s failure to grant a new trial was, therefore, an abuse of discretion. We reverse the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>ment of the Court of Appeals and remand this action to the circuit court for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">C. MRE 702 &amp; THE EXPERT OPINION TESTIMONY OF STEVEN HNAT</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">In order to provide guidance for the new trial, we address the controversy surrounding the expert testimony and the erroneous standard propounded by the Court of Appeals concerning the gate keeping role required by MRE 702. We now clarify that MRE 702 requires the trial court to ensure that each aspect of an expert witness\u2019s proffered testimony\u2014including the data underlying the expert\u2019s theories and the methodology by which the expert draws conclusions from that data\u2014is reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">1. THE COURT\u2019S GATEKEEPER ROLE UNDER MRE 702</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">MRE 702, as it existed at the time of trial,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-8\">If the trial court determines that recognized scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In both its former and current incarnations,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> MRE 702 has imposed an obligation on the trial court to ensure that any expert testimony admitted at trial is reliable.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> While the exercise of this gatekeeper role is within a court\u2019s discretion, a trial judge may neither \u201cabandon\u201d this obligation nor \u201cperform the function inadequately.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Indeed, the obligation imposed by MRE 702 is reinforced by MRE 104(a), which provides that \u201c[preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness... <em>shall </em>be determined by the court. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The requirements of MRE 104(a) extended to the application of MRE 702 because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>admission of expert testimony under this rule hinges on preliminary questions concerning qualification. For example, reference in MRE 702 to \u201cscientific\u201d evidence \u201cimplies a grounding in the methods and procedures of science,\u201d and the rule\u2019s reference to \u201cknowledge\u201d \u201cconnotes more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> As such, MRE 104 requires the trial court to address these preconditions before admitting expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">It is well-established that the proponent of evidence \u201cbears the burden of establishing relevance and admissibility.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> At the time this case was tried, the proponent of expert opinion evidence bore the burden of establishing admissibility according to the <em>Davis-Frye </em>\u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> MRE 702 has since been amended explicitly to incorporate Daubert\u2019s standards of reliability. But this modification of MRE 702 changes only the factors that a court may consider in determining whether expert opinion evidence is admissible. It has not altered the court\u2019s fundamental duty of ensuring that <em>all </em>expert opinion testimony\u2014regardless of whether the testimony is based on \u201cnovel\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> science\u2014is reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Thus, properly understood, the court\u2019s gatekeeper role is the same under <em>Davis-Frye </em>and <em>Daubert.</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Regardless of which test the court applies, the court may admit evidence only once it ensures, pursuant to MRE 702, that expert testimony meets that rule\u2019s standard of reliability. In other words, both tests require courts to exclude junk science; <em>Daubert </em>simply allows courts to consider more than just \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d in determining whether expert testimony must be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">This gatekeeper role applies to <em>all stages </em>of expert analysis. MRE 702 mandates a searching inquiry, not just of the data underlying expert testimony, but also of the manner in which the expert interprets and extrapolates from those data. Thus, it is insufficient for the proponent of expert opinion merely to show that the opinion rests on data viewed as legitimate in the context of a particular area of expertise (such as medicine). The proponent must also show that any opinion based on those data expresses conclusions reached through reliable principles and methodology.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Careful vetting of all aspects of expert testimony is especially important when an expert provides testimony about causation.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court\u2019s caveat in <em>Joiner </em>is persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>[N]othing in either <em>Daubert </em>or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence which is connected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert. A court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.[<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">When a court focuses its MRE 702 inquiry on the data underlying expert opinion and neglects to evaluate the extent to which an expert extrapolates from those data in a manner consistent with <em>Davis-Frye </em>(or now <em>Daub-ert), </em>it runs the risk of overlooking a yawning \u201canalytical gap\u201d between that data and the opinion expressed by an expert.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> As a result, ostensibly legitimate data may serve as a Trojan horse that facilitates the surreptitious advance of junk science and spurious, unreliable opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">2. MR. HNAT\u2019S MEDICAL OPINION TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals seem unaware of the core gatekeeper principles described above. As a result, the faux \u201cmedical\u201d opinion of an individual who lacked any medical education, experience, training, skill, or knowledge became the linchpin of plaintiffs case and unmistakably affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Plaintiffs theory at trial was that the sexual harassment she encountered as defendant\u2019s employee had produced a permanent change in her \u201cbrain chemistry,\u201d that this neurological change led to an increase in substance abuse and that, in the end, defendant\u2019s failure to curb sexual harassment in plaintiffs workplace would cause her to die the most painful death imaginable because of the metabolic physiological phe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>nomena he described.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The theory was presented through the testimony of Mr. Hnat, a social worker, and was based on his analysis of medical records from various hospitals and clinics where plaintiff was treated for substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Mr. Hnat testified that he was a certified social worker with experience in substance abuse treatment.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> He also testified that he had received a master\u2019s degree in psychobiology, although it was revealed after trial that this testimony was patently false.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Apparently influenced by Mr. Hnat\u2019s claim to have expertise in psychobiology, the trial court permitted plaintiff to introduce medical records through Mr. Hnat\u2019s testimony. Before the admission of records from Sacred Heart Rehabilitation Center, defense counsel raised the following objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-4\">Your Honor, I object to their admission. Certainly, with regard to this witness, he is not a medical doctor to review all of these other records and testify about them. He is a social worker and he is competent to testify about his own records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-5\">It is just not appropriate. The foundation hasn\u2019t been laid for the introduction of those records, certainly not pursuant to this individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that Mr. Hnat was unqualified to articulate an opinion based on records compiled when plaintiff sought treatment for substance abuse. However, the record in this case reveals that, irrespective of whether the medical records detailing plaintiffs substance abuse treatment were admissible, Mr. Hnat was asked to interpret those records and thereby render an opinion that he was wholly unqualified to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">For example, the following exchange took place during plaintiffs direct examination of Mr. Hnat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number><em>Q. </em>Will [plaintiff] be able to work in light of what you know about her condition as recently as yesterday? Will she continue to be physically able to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\"><em>A. </em>No. <em>Her medical complications at this point have progressed to the point where she is going to be physically unable to work fairly soon.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-6\">She is going to have increasing hospitalizations most likely to deal with the cirrhosis, the pancreatitis, she may need transplants at some point, she may need any range of radical medical intervention. So her ability to work physically is severely impaired at this point even though right now she is functioning okay. There is going to be increasing problems associated with this medical condition. It\u2019s unavoidable. People have those severe complications must work [sic],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">Q. Do you have any idea what was the cause of her problems as they exist in this lady as late as yesterday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\"><em>A. </em>Alcoholism, major depression precipitated by work stresses, and sexual harassment. That is the bottom line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-9\">Q. What do you mean that is the bottom line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\"><em>A. </em>I mean that is what happened here, <em>that is what is killing this person, probably has killed her as far as you can tell at this point. 1 wouldn\u2019t bet on her living very long. </em>She might, if she gets treatment. There\u2019s a chance. If she doesn\u2019t get treatment, she\u2019ll die fairly soon. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">The impact of Mr. Hnat\u2019s \u201cmedical opinion\u201d on the verdict rendered in this case could not have been more pronounced. Especially noteworthy is the fact that, during closing arguments, plaintiffs counsel encouraged the jury to treat Mr. Hnat\u2019s opinion as an actual medical prognosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-12\">You heard testimony, and I don\u2019t think Mr. Hnat was being glib when he testified about the fact that although he is not an omniscient, he is not a sooth sayer, he has read her death certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-13\">Her death certificate, her death will come sooner or later, none of us can know for sure. You will consider this in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>a haze of alcohol. She will die either in a violent event if she drives, or she will die of the effects of alcohol on her body. She will have chronic hepatitis, in other words, a disease of the liver, cirrhosis, if you will. She will have dehydration as Mr. Hnat testified to.

She will have chronic pancreatitis. One of the most painful diseases known to medical science, inflammation of her pancreas. And she has suffered all of these during hospitalizations, as Mr. Hnat has testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-4\">She will suffer severe abdominal pain, and she will die. And she will not live out her life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">At one point during closing arguments, plaintiffs counsel even told the jury that plaintiff had to leave the courtroom for a portion of his closing argument because the \u201cprognosis that she has for her life\u201d was too grim for her to hear.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">As these excerpts reveal, Mr. Hnat unquestionably used the content of plaintiffs treatment records to render an opinion that required <em>medical </em>expertise. He speculated about plaintiffs impending physical inability to work, testified about the type of medical complications that plaintiff would soon experience, predicted the cause of her death, and gave testimony concerning plaintiffs life expectancy. Mr. Hnat expressed his \u201copinion\u201d on physiological disease, cause of death, and plaintiffs lifespan. Yet there was no evidence or showing that Mr. Hnat was qualified by training, experience, or knowledge to render such opinions or interpret medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>records that would arguably support such a diagnosis or prognosis. There was, in other words, no evidence that Mr. Hnat was qualified to testify that defendant\u2019s actions concerning workplace harassment <em>caused </em>neurological and physiological changes in plaintiff and shortened her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Plaintiffs arguments in support of Mr. Hnat\u2019s testimony and the Court of Appeals\u2019 acceptance of those arguments can be based only on a misinterpretation of MEE 702. Plaintiff argued, for example, that Mr. Hnat was qualified to interpret plaintiffs medical records because he is a \u201ctreater.\u201d In order for Mr. Hnat to provide an admissible opinion interpreting medical records for purposes other than those related to the expertise of social workers, plaintiff bore the burden of showing that Mr. Hnat was qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education in <em>medicine. </em>Given the absence of such evidence, plaintiff failed to carry the burden of establishing the admissibility of Mr. Hnat\u2019s medical opinions, regardless of the admissibility of the records that ostensibly informed this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Likewise, we reject the Court of Appeals\u2019 argument that \u201cthe \u2018mere fact\u2019 that Mr. Hnat \u2018is not a medical practitioner does not render him unqualified as an expert witness\u2019 \u201d because \u201c[a]ny limitations in\u201d Mr. Hnat\u2019s \u201cqualifications are relevant to the weight, not the admissibility, of his testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals\u2019 observation that one need not be a medical practitioner to testify as an expert is little more than a truism. And we do not disagree with the proposition that, in some circumstances, an expert\u2019s qualifications pertain to weight rather than to the admissibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>expert\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> That is not to say, however, that <em>any </em>issue of qualification relates to weight rather than admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">As shown, MRE 702 establishes preconditions for the admission of expert opinion. Such testimony must be rooted in \u201crecognized <em>scientific, </em>technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d and must assist the trier of fact. The burden is on the party <em>offering </em>the expert to satisfy the preconditions established by MRE 702.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Where the subject of the proffered testimony is far beyond the scope of an individual\u2019s expertise\u2014for example, where a party offers an expert in economics to testify about biochemistry\u2014that testimony is <em>inadmissible </em>under MRE 702. In such cases, it would be inaccurate to say that the expert\u2019s lack of expertise or experience merely relates to the weight of her testimony. An expert who lacks \u201cknowledge\u201d in the field at issue cannot \u201cassist the trier of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Here, according to plaintiffs counsel, Mr. Hnat gave plaintiff a \u201cprognosis\u201d on the basis of his interpretation of records from medical and treatment facilities. The medical \u201cprognosis\u201d of a social worker who has no training in medicine and lacks any demonstrated ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>to interpret medical records meaningfully is of little assistance to the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We also reject the Court of Appeals\u2019 assertion that Mr. Hnat\u2019s medical testimony on the physiological effects of alcoholism and depression was admissible because these effects are \u201ccommon knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> As the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan has aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-5\">[Ejxpert testimony is not admissible unless it will be helpful to the fact finder. Such testimony is unhelpful when it is unreliable or irrelevant, as the [Supreme] Court observed in Daubert,.. . <em>and also when it merely deals with a proposition that is not beyond the ken of common knowledge[</em><footnotemark>66</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">To justify the admission of an expert opinion on the basis of the belief that <em>no </em>expertise is necessary to render such an opinion is to fail to give any effect to MRE 702, and, indeed, to turn that rule on its head. The previous MRE 702 allowed expert opinion testimony only \u201c[i]f the trial court determines that recognized scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue . . . .\u201d Thus, the Court of Appeals panel\u2019s rationalization that Mr. Hnat\u2019s expert opinion testimony was harmlessly admitted because it was based on \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d is inconsistent with the requirements of MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Unless information requiring expert interpretation actually goes through the crucible of analysis by a qualified expert, it is of little assistance to the jury and therefore inadmissible under MRE 702. We direct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>trial judge on retrial to ensure that expert opinion testimony meets the purpose expressed in MRE 702\u2014 that of assisting the trier of fact through the introduction of reliable \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">D. THE SUFFICIENCY OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM UNDER THE CRA</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">We turn finally to defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by admitting evidence regarding incidents of sexual harassment of which defendant was never properly notified. Defendant moved in limine to exclude incidents that plaintiff reported for the first time at her deposition. The court denied that motion, concluding that the jury could consider each incident in order to determine whether defendant had actual or constructive notice that plaintiff was subjected to a hostile environment. The Court of Appeals employed a similar logic in concluding that each incident was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">While the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude those incidents,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> this ruling has resulted in substantial confusion. We now clarify the legal justification for the trial court\u2019s decision in order to minimize confusion during retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Under the Civil Rights Act, an employer may be liable for an employee\u2019s sexual harassment when the employer has notice of the harassment and fails to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>appropriate corrective action.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> In <em>Chambers, </em>we held that \u201cnotice of sexual harassment is adequate if, by an objective standard, the totality of the circumstances were such that a reasonable employer would have been aware of a substantial probability that sexual harassment was occurring.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">When a plaintiff describes an incident of sexual harassment for the first time at her deposition, evidence pertaining to that incident may be admissible under two rationales. First, such evidence may be admissible in order to establish the nature and extent of the hostile environment to which the plaintiff was subjected and the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s response upon being notified about sexual harassment. Second, that evidence may be admissible under a \u201cconstructive notice\u201d theory when a plaintiff contends that sexual harassment was so pervasive that her employer <em>should </em>have known of the need for corrective measures.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">In this case, plaintiff gave actual notice to defendant through defendant\u2019s formal reporting procedures before initiating this lawsuit. Any incidents that she described for the first time at her deposition were admissible in order to establish an element of her hostile environment claim\u2014that \u201cthe unwelcome sexual conduct or communication was intended to or in fact did substantially interfere with the employee\u2019s employment or created <em>an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, </em>\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark>\u2014and to establish the inadequacy of defendant\u2019s response to that hostile environment. Therefore, the circuit court did not err by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of any incident that plaintiff described for the first time at her deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial under MCR 2.611. Once the jury issued its verdict, it should have been apparent to the trial court that the persistent and calculated efforts of plaintiffs trial counsel to thwart the jury\u2019s fact-finding role had borne fruit. The jury\u2019s deliberations had been palpably affected and this wrought substantial harm to defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. This case is remanded to the Wayne Circuit Court for a new trial to be held consistently with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b881-6\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor and Markman, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\"> We differ not, as the dissent suggests, because we believe that the plaintiff has failed to make out a case of sexual harassment worthy of <em>a </em>verdict. We differ instead because we believe that <em>this </em>verdict is excessive and because we have concluded that the record supporting this verdict is the result of plaintiffs counsel\u2019s repeated invitation to the jury to exercise its collective prejudices in preference to fairly compensating plaintiff on the evidence presented. For all of the reasons detailed in this majority opinion, we conclude that the repeated, explicit and inappropriate references to the Holocaust, defendant\u2019s German national origin, and defendant\u2019s status as a corporation cannot be tolerated in Michigan courts any more than in our society at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The people have declared in our Constitution that \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d shall not be denied on the basis of national origin. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2. See, also, the Michigan Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq. </em>The observance of this fundamental principle cannot stop at the door of the courthouse. Indeed, it is within the courthouse that we ought be most concerned that the merits of a party\u2019s cause, not its alienage or status, should remain the exclusive focus of a jury\u2019s deliberations. Thus, while we hold no brief for the inadequacies of defendant\u2019s counsel that the dissent has taken pains to note, defendant was entitled to a trial free of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>naked appeals to entice the jury to consider its passions and prejudice rather than the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\"> Chrysler was a corporate predecessor of defendant DaimlerChrysler.

This case is about male employees sexually harassing a female employee and an employer that did very little to try to make it stop. This case is <em>not </em>about plaintiffs counsel\u2019s \u201croutine\u201d behavior, contrary to the assertions of the majority. <em>Ante </em>at 776-777. Whatever plaintiffs counsel may have done in past cases is irrelevant to <em>this particular case. </em>In this case, an objective review of the evidence indicates that plaintiff overwhelmingly provided facts to prove that she was sexually harassed and that defendant conducted an inadequate investigation into this harassment. Defendant\u2019s inadequacies in the work place continued in the courtroom as it selected a trial strategy intended to \u201cblame the victim\u201d for the harassment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>occurred. Defendant\u2019s repeated errors in judgment should not now be redressed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The majority remands this matter for a new trial because it asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The majority claims that \u201cit should have been apparent to the trial court that the persistent and calculated efforts of plaintiffs trial counsel to thwart the jury\u2019s fact-finding role had borne fruit.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 793.1 disagree and believe there was substantial admissible evidence for the jury to hold defendant liable. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">I. EVIDENCE OF HARASSMENT AND THE CONDUCT OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The majority states that \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict unmistakably reflects passion rather than reason and prejudice rather than impartiality.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 755. I disagree. The standard for reviewing defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, MCR 2.611, is the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Brown v Arnold, </em>303 Mich 616, 627; 6 NW2d 914 (1942). An abuse of discretion occurs \u201conly when the result is so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.\u201d <em>Alken-Ziegler, Inc v Waterbury Headers Corp, </em>461 Mich 219, 227; 600 NW2d 638 (1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). While the majority clearly disagrees with the verdict, there was ample testimony from numerous witnesses to support the jury\u2019s verdict that plaintiff, the first and only female millwright for a lengthy period at defendant\u2019s plant, was the victim of sexual harassment and that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>did not engage in an adequate investigation or remedial action to stop this harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-3\">An employee in defendant\u2019s human resources department testified that the investigation into plaintiffs sexual harassment claims was inadequate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Another employee in defendant\u2019s human resources department testified that without being given a name he would not even know where to begin a sexual harassment investigation. Yet another employee in the human resources department testified that she told plaintiff she would provide her with the name and number of a union representative who might be helpful, but the name and number were never provided to plaintiff because the employee never saw plaintiff again.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s corporate representative at trial, who was also one of plaintiffs supervisors, conveyed to the jury that defendant\u2019s investigation essentially consisted of passing out defendant\u2019s sexual harassment policy and asking the men if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>they harassed plaintiff or knew who did.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial representative said he approached some of the men as a <em>group </em>and asked if they knew who was sexually harassing plaintiff. He also said he hoped someone else would do the investigating and that he did not feel it was his responsibility to investigate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>later testified that asking the men if they knew who was responsible for the incidents was inadequate. He further stated that he did not know of any other investigation that was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-3\">An employee who worked for defendant for thirty-one years testified that he had never seen anyone treated like plaintiff. He stated, \u201cShe was relentlessly pounded with derogatory statements, with no help when she was given a job, and there were several people involved on the same job. She would not get a lot of cooperation. She was just basically resented that she was a woman, making a man\u2019s wage.\u201d The employee also testified that plaintiff was subjected to physical danger by not getting the cooperation she needed, and that other millwrights received, when doing her work. Although millwrights commonly work in pairs, she was often forced to work alone. He testified that this abusive conduct occurred nearly every day, was devastating to plaintiff, and was readily apparent to plaintiffs supervisors. He also testified that supervisors made offensive comments as well. This employee drove plaintiff home from work for a period and testified she cried at least one hundred times on the way home from work. \u201cShe never knew what to expect on any given day that she went into work ....\u201d He also testified that the stench of urine from a chair in an area set off for plaintiff made it evident that someone had urinated on it. Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>employee stated that he did not observe any of defendant\u2019s employees try to stop the harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Plaintiff testified that when she went to work each day she \u201cnever knew what to expect.\u201d She said abusive comments were essentially an everyday occurrence, and she said she was isolated and ostracized at work. Plaintiff stated that the conduct made her afraid and angry and that she had problems sleeping. She also experienced headaches, stomach problems, and problems associated with her asthma. Plaintiff said she felt hopeless and attempted suicide because she could not get any cooperation or help from defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Regarding her suicide attempt, plaintiff said \u201cthat\u2019s what I did and I regret it, but I just felt pushed to that point where I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d Plaintiff said she felt torn up inside and that the harassment was an assault to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>person. Plaintiff said she began drinking \u201cto escape\u201d and help dull her feelings. Plaintiff testified that the abusive comments were still being made at the time of the trial, but she was not going to quit over the harassment; she refused to be driven out of her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">I believe even this limited testimony indicates that there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and I disagree that the verdict was the result of plaintiffs counsel\u2019s inflaming the jury with \u201chyperbolic rhetoric, prejudice-baiting argument, and unscientific expert testimony.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 770. Plaintiffs counsel vigorously pursued this case; however, defense counsel\u2019s approach was no less vigorous.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Although defense counsel\u2019s strategy ultimately proved to be ineffective, and although the majority certainly disagrees with the verdict, it does not necessarily mean that plaintiffs counsel behaved inappropriately. A thorough review of defense counsel\u2019s conduct during trial illustrates that defense counsel\u2019s strategy was inadequate and, at times, disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">For example, defense counsel tried to characterize some of the men alleged to have engaged in the harassment as \u201cornery\u201d and she referred to one as \u201cbasically a good guy.\u201d She tried to characterize their comments as \u201cshop talk\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or \u201ca slip of the tongue,\u201d and their conduct as \u201chorseplay.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She repeatedly questioned plaintiff about whether she reported harassing incidents to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>supervisors while plaintiff continually testified that the supervisors were standing right next to her during the incidents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When plaintiff testified that a coworker was snidely telling other employees to watch what they were saying or it would be labeled sexual harassment, defense counsel tried to characterize the coworker as being helpful by merely instructing other people about what is appropriate. Regarding an article about men and sperm left near plaintiffs soda can, defense counsel attempted to minimize the incident because the article was in a scientific magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Defense counsel questioned plaintiff about plaintiffs alleged failures to keep abreast of defendant\u2019s investigations. Defense counsel also repeatedly alluded to the fact that plaintiff knew who was harassing her, even though plaintiff repeatedly said she did not know for certain and she did not want to falsely accuse someone. Defense counsel argued, \u201cShe [plaintiff] thought it was more important to protect whoever it was that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>responsible.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Regarding plaintiff, defense counsel argued, \u201cThere is absolutely nothing wrong with her.\u201d Consistent with the strategy that plaintiff was responsible for the continued mistreatment, defense counsel asked witnesses if plaintiff was a \u201ctomboy\u201d and she also questioned whether plaintiff had \u201cput herself in a position of being in a profession that has historically been dominated by me[n].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">During closing argument, defense counsel brought up private incidents relating to plaintiff that occurred over twenty years ago, even though plaintiff did not begin working with defendant until 1992. She argued the only problem plaintiffs coworkers had with plaintiff related to her alcoholism. \u201cThey never had a problem with Ms. Gilbert as a female.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s theme was to blame the victim. This was demonstrated in a statement she made indicating that plaintiffs \u201cmedical records also reflect that she has a tendency to blame everyone else for her problems, rather than look directly at her problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The majority criticizes the conduct of plaintiffs counsel; however, a thorough review of the trial transcripts and lengthy closing argument finds sparse objections made by defense counsel and no impropriety justifying a new trial. Regarding statements made by plaintiffs counsel during closing argument, he first stated that plaintiff thanked the jury for allowing her to exercise her right as an American citizen to have her day in court. Plaintiffs theme during closing argument was that plaintiff had great fortitude to withstand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>harassment. Plaintiff had repeatedly testified that she was not a quitter, she had every right to work at the plant, and she was not going to let them run her out. Plaintiffs counsel referenced the strength of those who were affected by the Holocaust. He also referenced Prometheus and Zeus, and stated that the myth of the eagle pecking at Prometheus\u2019s liver for all eternity reminded him of plaintiffs ordeal. He compared plaintiff to Rosa Parks and Arthur Ashe, as well as a dog that was kicked and abused every day. He even referred to plaintiff as a pioneer. When reviewing the closing argument in context, it is obvious that plaintiffs counsel was arguing that plaintiff was courageous and determined. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, plaintiffs counsel was no more likening plaintiff to the Holocaust victims than he was likening her to a figure in Greek mythology being pecked by a bird.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Plaintiffs counsel also <em>appropriately </em>stated that defendant should be judged just as any <em>individual </em>would be judged. And he stated that the jury could not punish defendant; it could only compensate plaintiff for the harm suffered. While plaintiffs counsel did refer to \u201ctorture\u201d and \u201cbeating plaintiff down,\u201d the jury heard weeks of testimony and was aware that no evidence of physical abuse was introduced. Defense counsel obviously did not think the phrases were inflammatory because there was no objection raised. To suggest, as the majority does, that the jury was somehow influenced or confused by these random phrases during closing arguments is insulting to the jurors\u2019 intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The majority\u2019s blanket statements about plaintiffs counsel belie the truth of the record. Plaintiffs counsel no more played on the prejudices of the jury because defendant was a German company than he played on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>the prejudices of the jury because he hoped the jury liked dogs, tennis players, or well-known pioneers such as Lewis and Clark. While plaintiffs counsel\u2019s comments are highlighted by the majority, the references were miniscule in the context of the entire trial. The majority hopes that by merely stating that these references were \u201cnaked appeals to entice the jury to consider its passions and prejudice,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 755 n 1, it can magically transform the events that occurred at trial. However, a review of the whole record reveals that the majority\u2019s approach misstates the events at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">The majority states, \u201cOverreaching, prejudice-baiting rhetoric appears to be a calculated, routine feature of counsel\u2019s trial strategy.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 776-777.1 do not know if that statement is accurate. But what I do know is that it is not an accurate statement <em>in this case. </em>No matter what plaintiffs counsel\u2019s <em>routine </em>may be, this Court should focus only on the facts before us. An impartial review of those facts indicates the behavior of plaintiffs counsel does not warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">II. EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">I agree with the majority that \u201cMRE 702 has imposed an obligation on the trial court to ensure that any expert testimony admitted at trial is reliable.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 780. However, I disagree that the trial court erred in failing to conduct its gatekeeper role in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Stephen Hnat, a fact and expert witness called by plaintiff, testified that he is a clinical social worker, which means he is licensed to perform psychotherapy \u2014both group therapy and individual therapy\u2014 primarily for people who have substance abuse disorders, or depressive or emotional disorders. He has worked as a clinical social worker since 1981. Among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>other positions, Mr. Hnat served as staff therapist and the director of cocaine treatment for Ford Hospital-Maplegrove.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">During his testimony, Mr. Hnat clarified that he is not a doctor and that he did not complete his Ph.D. Unlike the majority, I do not find any evidence that Mr. Hnat\u2019s misstatement that he possessed a master\u2019s degree was intentional. Mr. Hnat entered a doctorate program that he did not complete. It is not unreasonable that, twenty years later, he was unclear about whether he had completed the required paperwork to be awarded his master\u2019s degree. I also do not find that, in light of Mr. Hnat\u2019s other credentials, the misstatement affected the jury verdict. Mr. Hnat detailed a lengthy career that included consulting with the Michigan Department of Transportation, as well as the Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Tigers, Detroit Lions, and the University of Michigan Athletic Department. Mr. Hnat also served as a consultant to the National Institute of Drug Abuse and served on the President\u2019s Task Force for a Drug-Free Workplace. He also conducted research over the years and authored an award-winning video used by numerous corporations. Further, he served as an instructor at the Michigan Judicial Institute and as an adjunct professor at the University of Detroit Mercy. During direct examination, plaintiffs counsel and Mr. Hnat were forthcoming about their past working relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Mr. Hnat first treated plaintiff in 1992. He testified that there is a withdrawal period when an alcoholic stops drinking. The withdrawal period depends on the person and how much the person drank, but \u201cif you stop using alcohol very quickly, your body can be, the brain is overstimulated and you can develop some serious life-threatening complications at that time.\u201d Mr. Hnat also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Alcoholism is, you know, is a progressive disease which ultimately is fatal and it\u2019s fatal in a number of different ways unless it\u2019s arrested hut then it\u2019s not fatal but the way that alcoholics or people with addiction generally die are associated with overdoses, accidents because of the effect of the drug and the functioning of the environment. More often than not it\u2019s a very slow and painful process as the body begins to break down because of the toxic effects of the chemical, so in the case of alcoholics, the process of dying usually involves the development of some very painful medical complications such as pancreatitis or hepatitis or cirrhosis.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">He further explained that alcoholism \u201ccontinues to capture more of the brain\u2019s functions so that the person is, you know, the brain, it becomes more and more focused on getting and using the drug.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Unlike the majority, I do not find this testimony \u201cutterly lacking in scientific support.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 766. In short, Mr. Hnat\u2019s testimony was that plaintiff was an alcoholic. Stress related to the sexual harassment she suffered while employed by defendant caused plaintiff to start drinking again and suffer from depression, which also exacerbated her drinking.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As an alcoholic suffering from depression, plaintiff may die from a disease common to alcoholics. Mr. Hnat testified that \u201cfor the person who has alcoholism, that kind of stress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>[from sexual harassment] produces an additional risk not only of emotional distress but of triggering a process of compulsive drug seeking. That the person will, they feel bad, and that sort of natural connection of the brain is I feel bad. I feel like drinking.\u201d Medical records signed by various medical professionals indicate that plaintiff suffered \u201cextreme stress in her work environment due to sexual harassment.\u201d I do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Mr. Hnat\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">III. REMITTITUR</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The jury found that plaintiff had been subjected to sexual harassment in violation of the Michigan Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq., </em>and that defendant did not adequately investigate and take prompt and appropriate remedial action. The jury awarded $20 million for mental anguish, physical pain and suffering, fright and shock, denial of social pleasures and enjoyments, embarrassment, humiliation, mortification, shame, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, outrage, disability including the loss or impairment of plaintiffs psychological well-being, and the increase in plaintiffs disease of substance abuse arising from an aggravation of a preexisting condition. The jury also awarded $1 million in a trust fund for plaintiff to use for <em>future medical </em>expenses; contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, when the jury verdict was read, the jury did not state that this amount was for future earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">As stated, I believe that the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff was amply supported by testimony offered at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>trial. I also disagree with the majority\u2019s statement that \u201cwe cannot accept the argument that plaintiffs was the <em>worst </em>case of sexual harassment in the history of the country that has resulted in a verdict.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 769. Plaintiff does not have to prove that her case was the worst case of sexual harassment in the history of the country to support the verdict. However, the verdict must be properly supported by the evidence and reviewed to determine</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\">whether the verdict was the result of improper methods, prejudice, passion, partiality, sympathy, corruption, or mistake of law or fact; [2] whether the verdict was within the limits of what reasonable minds would deem just compensation for the injury sustained; [3] whether the amount actually awarded is comparable to awards in similar cases within the state and in other jurisdictions. <em>[Palenkas v Beaumont Hosp, </em>432 Mich 527, 532; 443 NW2d 354 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">On the basis of the evidence introduced at trial and awards in other sexual harassment cases, as detailed by the majority, I believe that the jury award in this case is too great. See <em>id. </em>at 538-540; <em>Precopio v Detroit, </em>415 Mich 457, 479; 330 NW2d 802 (1982). While defendant\u2019s conduct was reprehensible and plaintiffs suffering indisputable, a review of jury awards in other sexual harassment cases indicates that the jury\u2019s award in this case was inappropriate. While a review of other awards cannot serve as an exact indicator and circumstances may certainly justify higher awards than those granted by other juries, the disparity between this award and others involving a single plaintiff indicates that it is not analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">I stress, however, that I do not believe the matter should be remanded for remittitur on the basis of any misconduct on the part of plaintiffs counsel. The excessively large verdict in plaintiffs favor is attributable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>solely to the conduct of defendant and defense counsel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In an ironic exchange during the trial, plaintiffs counsel actually predicted the outcome of the case after defense counsel requested a jury instruction regarding plaintiffs lack of mitigation. Defense counsel stated that plaintiff was causing her own medical problems and \u201ccould have ameliorated the later incidents [of sexual harassment] which could have harmed her.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel stated that defense counsel\u2019s argument that plaintiff is responsible for her damages</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-4\">is going to pump up the damages in this case when they start blaming [plaintiff]. So, I want the record to reflect I am acceding to this on behalf of my client because it is my firm belief that this would increase the amount of damages that is awarded to my client, rather than decrease them.... And I just want to make a record. If we get an astronomical verdict and the Defendant comes back and asks for a remittur [sic], Judge, I want the record to reflect that the Defendant is requesting an instruction that I think would have the effect of further angering the jury and increasing the damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">While I find plaintiffs counsel\u2019s prescience impressive, the excessively high verdict cannot be allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>stand merely because plaintiffs counsel made a record of defense counsel\u2019s woeful error in strategy. Therefore, I would remand this matter to the trial court for remitti-tur.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><em>m </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Defendant\u2019s trial strategy was to question, and minimize, the harassment experienced by plaintiff and blame plaintiff for not being more active in seeking to stop the harassment. This strategy was chosen by defendant and rejected by the jury. Conduct by plaintiffs counsel that is now classified as unacceptable was frequently not objected to by defendant. I do not believe that this Court should now step in to help defendant correct its errors in judgment. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b897-6\">Weaver and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"anr-dedup-0\">Q.
