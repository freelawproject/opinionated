The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, concluding that the RUA bars plaintiffs cause of action against defendant. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that defendant is not exempt from liability for injuries that occurred to plaintiff while riding an ATV on the mowed portion of defendant\u2019s backyard because the RUA only pertains to injuries that occur on \u201clarge tracts of undeveloped land.\u201d Because there is nothing in the RUA that indicates that it pertains only to \u201clarge tracts of undeveloped land,\u201d we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order of summary disposition in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">I. PACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Plaintiff injured her back while riding as a passenger on defendant\u2019s ATV, which was being driven by defendant\u2019s brother on defendant\u2019s property in the village of Dimondale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When defendant\u2019s brother drove over an uneven area of defendant\u2019s lawn, plaintiff was bounced on the ATV, causing her to suffer injuries to her lower back. Defendant\u2019s property is an eleven-acre lot that is zoned residential. Although portions of the lot are wooded, plaintiff was injured while riding on the mowed portion of defendant\u2019s backyard. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the basis that the RUA bars plaintiffs cause of action against defendant. However, on the basis of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wymer v Holmes, </em>429 Mich 66, 79; 412 NW2d 213 (1987), that the RUA only applies to \u201clarge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tracts of undeveloped land,\u201d the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for continued proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After this Court directed the parties to present oral argument on whether to grant the application or take other action permitted by MCR 7.302(G)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and having heard such argument, we granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">II. STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">At issue in this case is the proper interpretation of MCL 324.73301(1). The proper interpretation of a statutory provision is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Morales v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>469 Mich 487, 490; 672 NW2d 849 (2003). Likewise, a trial court\u2019s ruling on a summary disposition motion is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Schmalfeldt v North Pointe Ins Co, </em>469 Mich 422, 426; 670 NW2d 651 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The RUA, MCL 324.73301(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, a cause of action shall not arise for injuries to a person who is on the land of another without paying to the owner, tenant, or lessee of the land a valuable consideration for the purpose of fishing, hunting, trapping, camping, hiking, sightseeing, motorcycling, snowmobiling, or any other outdoor recreational use or trail use, with or without permission, against the owner, tenant, or lessee of the land unless the injuries were caused by the gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct of the owner, tenant, or lessee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>In <em>Wymer, </em>the plaintiffs decedent suffered injuries while swimming on the defendants\u2019 property. This Court held that the defendants could be held liable for the plaintiffs injuries because \u201cthe [RUA] was intended to apply to large tracts of undeveloped land suitable for outdoor recreational uses. Urban, suburban, and subdivided lands were not intended to be covered by the RUA.\u201d <em>Wymer, supra </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Defendant contends that our decision in <em>Wymer </em>should be overruled because it is inconsistent with the plain language of the RUA. We agree. \u201c[0]ur primary task in construing a statute, is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). \u201cThe words of a statute provide \u2018the most reliable evidence of its intent....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v Turkette, </em>452 US 576, 593; 101 S Ct 2524; 69 L Ed 2d 246 (1981). Although the <em>Wymer </em>Court noted that its task was to ascertain the legislative intent, it failed to recognize that the language of the statute is the best source for determining legislative intent. Instead, <em>Wymer </em>found it \u201creasonable to assume that the Michigan statute has the similar general purpose of similar acts in other jurisdictions ... .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Wymer, supra </em>at 77. That purpose being to \u201c \u2018open[] up and mak[e] available vast areas of vacant but private lands to the use of the general public\u201d in order to \u201cpromot[e] tourism.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, quoting <em>Thomas v Consumers Power Co, </em>58 Mich App 486, 495-496; 228 NW2d 786 (1975). If that were the Legislature\u2019s purpose, it could have used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>words \u201cvacant or undeveloped land of another,\u201d rather than the words \u201cthe lands of another.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Before <em>Wymer, </em>in <em>Winiecki v Wolf, </em>147 Mich App 742, 745; 383 NW2d 119 (1985), in which the plaintiff was injured while playing with \u201cland skis\u201d in the defendants\u2019 backyard, the Court of Appeals concluded that the EUA precluded the plaintiffs action against the defendants, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">[The RUA], as the trial court has already observed, is clear and unambiguous. Plaintiff was a person on the lands of another, without paying a consideration, for the purpose of an outdoor recreational use. The statute offers nothing on its face excluding from its application the backyard of residential property. If the Legislature did not intend the statute to apply to parcels of land this size, it was within its power to insert words limiting the statute\u2019s application, e.g., to lands in their natural state. As we, however, are constrained to apply the statute as written, we cannot say that the trial court erred in relieving defendants of liability based on the recreational use statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">This understanding of the RUA is truer to the language of the RUA than is the <em>Wymer </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of the RUA. There is absolutely no indication in the language of the RUA that the Legislature intended its application to be limited to vacant or undeveloped lands. As the Court of Appeals in the instant case stated, \u201c[ajlthough nothing in the statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>indicates that the statute is not applicable to the backyards of residential property such as defendant\u2019s, the statute has been construed to apply \u2018to large tracts of undeveloped land suitable for outdoor recreational uses,\u2019 not to \u2018[u]rban, suburban, and subdivided lands Slip op at 2 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because this construction is, as the Court of Appeals itself recognized, not supported by the statutory language, we are compelled to abandon this construction and overrule Wym<em>er.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The RUA makes no distinction between large tracts of land and small tracts of land, undeveloped land and developed land, vacant land and occupied land, land suitable for outdoor recreational uses and land not suitable for outdoor recreational uses, urban or suburban land and rural land, or subdivided land and unsubdivided land.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To introduce such distinctions into the act is to engage in what is essentially legislative decision-making. The RUA simply states that an owner of land is not liable to a person who injures himself on the owner\u2019s land if that person has not paid for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>of the land and that person was using the land for a specified purpose,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> unless the injuries were caused by the owner\u2019s gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct. The statute contains no limitation on the type of land involved, but rather applies to specified activities that occur \u201con the land of another . ...\u201d MCL 324.73301(1). That is, the act limits its application to specified activities, but it does not limit its application to any particular type of land. Therefore, an owner is not liable to a nonpaying outdoor recreational user of his land, unless the user\u2019s injuries are caused by the owner\u2019s gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>The dissent mischaracterizes our opinion by stating that our \u201cinterpretation eliminates the liability of a landowner, tenant, or lessee when a person who does not pay consideration and who participates in <em>any </em>outdoor recreational activity is injured .. <em>.Post </em>at 673 (emphasis in original). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the RUA does not apply to <em>any </em>outdoor recreational activity. Rather, it only applies to \u201cfishing, hunting, trapping, camping, hiking, sightseeing, motorcycling, snowmobiling, or any other outdoor recreational use ... .\u201d MCL 324.73301(1). Under the statutory construction doctrine known as ejusdem generis, where a general term follows a series of specific terms, the general term is interpreted \u201cto include only things of the same kind, class, character, or nature as those specifically enumerated.\u201d <em>Huggett v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>464 Mich 711, 718-719; 629 NW2d 915 (2001). Therefore, the language \u201cother outdoor recreational use\u201d must be interpreted to include only those outdoor recreational uses \u201cof the same kind, class, character, or nature,\u201d id, as \u201cfishing, hunting, trapping, camping, hiking, sightseeing, motorcycling, [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>snowmobiling ...MCL 324.73301(1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While the dissent apparently believes that jump-roping and playing hopscotch, pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey, shuffleboard, and horseshoes are of the \u201csame kind, class, character, or nature\u201d as \u201cfishing, hunting, trapping, camping, hiking, sightseeing, motorcycling, and snowmobiling ...\u201d <em>post </em>at 675 n 2, we see no need to address these or any other activities that are not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In this case, plaintiff was injured \u201con the land of another without paying to the owner... a valuable consideration for the purpose of.. . an[] . . . outdoor recreational use . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff does not contest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the fact that riding an ATV on another\u2019s land is \\an outdoor recreational use of another\u2019s land within the meaning of the RUA. There is no evidence that plaintiffs \u201cinjuries were caused by the gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct of the owner ... .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Thus, pursuant to the RUA, defendant owner cannot be held liable for these injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><em>rV. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The RUA exempts an owner of land from liability for injuries suffered by a person while that person is using the owner\u2019s land for specified purposes if that person has not paid the owner a valuable consideration for such use, unless the injuries were caused by the owner\u2019s gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct. This exemption applies to the owners of large tracts of land and small tracts of land, undeveloped land and developed land, vacant land and occupied land, land suitable for outdoor recreational uses and land not suitable for outdoor recreational uses, urban or suburban land and rural land, and subdivided land and unsubdivided land. Plaintiff injured herself while using defendant\u2019s land for a specified purpose (riding an ATV) without having paid defendant a valuable consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>for this use, and her injuries were not caused by defendant\u2019s gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct. Thus, pursuant to the RUA, defendant cannot be held liable for plaintiffs injuries. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order of summary disposition in favor of defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b760-6\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Taylor, and Young, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\"> An \u201catv\u201d is defined as a \u201c3- or 4-wheeled vehicle designed for off-road use that has low-pressure tires, has a seat designed to he straddled by the rider, and is powered by a 50cc to 500cc gasoline engine or an engine of comparable size using other fuels.\u201d MCL 324.81101(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-10\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued September 17, 2002 (Docket No. 230494).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-11\"> 469 Mich 872 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\"> 469 Mich 942 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\"> It is impossible for us to determine whether these other acts are indeed \u201csimilar\u201d to Michigan\u2019s act in any particular respect because <em>Wymer </em>failed to cite any of these \u201csimilar acts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b754-9\"> Immediately before <em>Wymer, supra, </em>stated that the purpose of the rua is to make available to the public \u201cvast areas of vacant but private lands,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 78, it asserted that the purpose of the rua is \u201cto encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability toward persons entering thereon for such purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77.

However, as we recently explained in <em>People v Hawkins, </em>468 Mich 488, 507-510; 668 NW2d 602 (2003), neither \u201clegislative acquiescence\u201d nor the \u201creenactment doctrine\u201d may \u201cbe utilized to subordinate the plain language of a statute.\u201d \u201cLegislative acquiescence\u201d has been repeatedly rejected by this Court because \u201cMichigan courts [must] determine the Legislature\u2019s intent from its <em>words, </em>not from its silence.\u201d <em>Donajkowski v Alpena Power Co, </em>460 Mich 243, 261; 596 NW2d 574 (1999). Although, where statutory language is ambiguous, the reenactment doctrine may be a more useful tool of construction, \u201c[i]n the absence of a clear indication that the Legislature intended to either adopt or repudiate this Court\u2019s prior construction, there is no reason to subordinate our primary principle of construction\u2014to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent by first examining the statute\u2019s language\u2014to the reenactment rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The dissent concludes that the fact that the Legislature amended \u00a7 73301(2) of the RUA to apply to \u201cland of any size, including, but not limited to, urban, suburban, subdivided, and rural land,\u201d but did not similarly amend \u00a7 73301(1) is a \u201cclear indication\u201d of its intentions. <em>Post </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>676. The dissent is correct that the amendment of \u00a7 73301(2) represents a clear indication of intentions.

Therefore, we reject the dissent\u2019s view that the word \u201cland\u201d in \u00a7 73301(1) means only \u201clarge, undeveloped tracts of land.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 675.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> The dissent uses the doctrine of ejusdem generis to conclude that the rua only applies to \u201clarge undeveloped tracts of land.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 675.

In other words, plaintiff argues that the RUA only applies to individuals who enter upon land with the specific intent of using the land for a specified purpose; it does not apply to individuals who enter the land for some other purpose, such as a social visit, and who, incidentally to this purpose, subsequently use the land for a specified purpose. We disagree. Plaintiff, like the Court in <em>Wymer, </em>is adding words to the act that simply are not there. The RUA states that an owner of land is not hable for injuries to a person who is \u201con the [owner\u2019s] land\u201d \u201cfor the purpose of\u201d a specified activity. Nothing in the act\u2019s language limits its application to individuals who <em>enter </em>the land for the purpose of a specified activity.

Moreover, even if plaintiffs allegations are accented as true, i.e., that defendant knew of the dangers of operating an ATV with a passenger on it, and of driving the ATV over the uneven area of his backyard, and yet failed to warn plaintiff of these dangers, these allegations still do not support plaintiffs contention that her injuries were caused by defendant\u2019s gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b760-7\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATqN\"><em>(dissenting). </em>Today, the majority holds that the Recreational Land Use Act (RUA), MCL 324.73301(1), applies to outdoor recreational activities on all types of land.

We noted that the RUA listed activities that ordinarily can be accommodated on land that is difficult to defend from trespassers and difficult to make safe for people invited to participate in recreational activities. \u201cThe commonality among all these enumerated uses is that they generally require large tracts of open, vacant land in a relatively natural state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The current majority now states that there \u201cis absolutely no indication in the language of the RUA that the Legislature intended its application to be limited to vacant or undeveloped lands.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 666. The majority\u2019s interpretation eliminates the liability of a landowner, tenant, or lessee when a person who does not pay consideration and who participates in <em>any </em>outdoor recreational activity is injured, unless the landowner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>tenant, or lessee was grossly negligent or engaged in willful and wanton misconduct. A person participating in an outdoor recreational activity on the land of another is now essentially treated as a trespasser. Our citizens will be surprised to learn that when their children go to their friends\u2019 homes and jump rope or play hopscotch, the landowner is now only liable for acts of gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">II. THE LEGISLATURE\u2019S INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">While the majority contends that its decision is dictated by the words used by the Legislature, the majority conveniently discounts and ignores facts that are contrary to its opinion. Notably, the RUA is found in the <em>Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, </em>MCL 324.101 <em>et seq., </em>the purpose of which is \u201cto protect the environment and natural resources of the state ... .\u201d 1994 PA 451. Other sections of the act deal with forest and mineral resource development, MCL 324.701 <em>et seq.; </em>use of water in mining low-grade iron ore, MCL 324.3501 <em>et seq.; </em>sand dune protection and management, MCL 324.35301 <em>et seq.; </em>and state forest recreation, MCL 324.83101 <em>et seq., </em>to name just a few. It is highly unlikely that an <em>urban residential </em>backyard was among the state\u2019s natural resources considered in the RUA.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Further, the doctrine of ejusdem generis also supports the conclusion reached in <em>Wymer </em>and confirms the folly of the majority\u2019s interpretation. This Court explained the doctrine in <em>Sands Appliance Servs, Inc v Wilson, </em>463 Mich 231, 242; 615 NW2d 241 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">\u201c[Ejusdem generis] is a rule whereby in a statute in which general words follow a designation of particular subjects, the meaning of the general words will ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>be presumed to be and construed as restricted by the particular designation and as including only things of the same kind, class, character or nature as those specifically enumerated.\u201d <em>[Quoting People v Brown, </em>406 Mich 215, 221; 277 NW2d 155 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The RUA refers to \u201cfishing, hunting, trapping, camping, hiking, sightseeing, motorcycling, snowmobiling, or any other outdoor recreational use or trail use. .. .\u201d MCL 324.73301(1). The activities described in the statute are all activities that take place on large, undeveloped tracts of land. With the exception of house hunting, bargain hunting, and the occasional actions of Elmer Fudd in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, hunting is an activity that is actually <em>prohibited </em>in urban and suburban neighborhoods. When the Legislature wrote about snowmobiling, it is doubtful that it was referring to riding a snowmobile back and forth in a residential backyard like a duck at a carnival shooting game. The fact that the Legislature listed activities that can only be accomplished on large, undeveloped tracts of land indicates that it did not intend for the statute to cover residential <em>lawns </em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Finally, in support of its conclusion that \u00a7 73301(1) applies to all land, the majority states that the Legislature \u201ccould have used the words \u2018vacant or undeveloped land of another\u2019 \u201d in \u00a7 73301(1) if the RUA was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>meant to apply to vast areas of land. <em>Ante </em>at 665-666. This, however, ignores the fact that the Legislature has shown in \u00a7 73301(2) that it knows how to use clear wording when it wants the statute to apply to <em>all </em>land. In \u00a7 73301(2) of the statute, the Legislature used the phrasing \u201cland of any size including, but not limited to, urban, suburban, subdivided, and rural land.\u201d The majority even admits that this is a \u201cclear indication\u201d of the Legislature\u2019s intent for \u00a7 73301(2) to apply to land of any size. <em>Ante </em>at 669 n 11. If the Legislature meant for <em>both </em>subsections of the statute to apply to <em>all </em>land of any size, then it would not have chosen to use different phrasing to mean the exact same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">III. THE REENACTMENT RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Under the reenactment rule, \u201c [i]f a legislature reenacts a statute without modifying a high court\u2019s practical construction of that statute, that construction is implicitly adopted.\u201d <em>People v Hawkins, </em>468 Mich 488, 519; 668 NW2d 602 (2003) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), citing 28 Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction (2000 rev), Contemporaneous Construction, \u00a7 49.09, pp 103-112. The Legislature \u201cis presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it [reenacts] a statute without change . . . .\u201d <em>Lorillard, a Div of Loew\u2019s The-atres, Inc v Pons, </em>434 US 575, 580; 98 S Ct 866; 55 L Ed 2d 40 (1978). \u201cThe reenactment rule differs from the legislative-acquiescence doctrine in that the former canon provides \u2018prima facie evidence of legislative intent\u2019 by the adoption, without modification, of a statutory provision that had already received judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>Hawkins, supra </em>at 488, quoting Singer at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The majority chooses to dismiss the Legislature\u2019s amendments of the RUA because they are not a \u201cclear indication\u201d of the Legislature\u2019s intent. But the actions of the Legislature could not be much clearer. After this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wymer, </em>the Legislature <em>twice </em>amended the RUA, yet the Legislature did not address the alleged \u201cerror\u201d in <em>Wymer. </em>Notably, the Legislature amended \u00a7 73301(2) of the statute to indicate that it applied to \u201cland of any size, including, but not limited to, urban, suburban, subdivided, and rural land.\u201d The Legislature did <em>not </em>incorporate this same language in \u00a7 73301(1). If this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wymer </em>were incorrect, the Legislature could have resolved this \u201cerror\u201d by adding the same language to subsection 1 as it did to subsection 2. In amending the statute, the Legislature stated that subsection 2 applied to \u201cland of any size .. ..\u201d Because the Legislature did not make a similar amendment of subsection 1, the Legislature\u2019s manifest intent that <em>Wymer </em>was correctly decided could not be clearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Plaintiffs injury occurred while at defendant\u2019s home, which is located in a residential subdivision. Plaintiff was injured while on defendant\u2019s <em>lawn-, </em>a lawn that defendant had mowed that very day. While the majority asserts that the RUA bars plaintiffs claim, the practical import of the majority\u2019s tortuous reasoning is that <em>any </em>outdoor recreational activity that occurs on <em>any </em>parcel of land will fall within the purview of the statute. On the basis of the words chosen by the Legislature, as well as its actions in amending the statute, I do not believe that our Legislature intended for the RUA to cover activities such as those that routinely take place at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>children\u2019s outdoor birthday parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the majority may believe that a statute found in the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act was meant to cover a spirited game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey, I have more faith in the wisdom of our Legislature and more respect for the actions it has taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals because plaintiffs claim is not barred by the Recreational Land Use Act.</p>\n<judges id=\"b766-7\">KELLY, J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\"> <em>Wymer </em>interpreted a former version of the rua, but the difference is not relevant to the issue or outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> The majority improperly characterizes my use of the doctrine of ejusdem generis. Because the majority ignores the Legislature\u2019s intent, I use the doctrine to examine the types of <em>activities </em>the Legislature meant to include when it used the phrase \u201cany other outdoor recreational use.\u201d A proper use of ejusdem generis leads to the conclusion that the activities covered by the statute are only those engaged in on large, open tracts of land, consistent with <em>Wymer\u2019s </em>interpretation of the statute. While I do not believe that the Legislature meant to include activities such as a rousing game of shuffleboard or horseshoes, the majority\u2019s strained reading of the statute now covers activities such as those.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\"> Following today\u2019s decision, people invited to such a party, or to a neighborhood barbecue, should be forewarned to \u201cbe sure to bring a dish (consideration) to pass.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
