The Court of Appeals affirmed the jury\u2019s $226,000 verdict in favor of plaintiff, holding that the dramshop act did not preclude plaintiffs premises liability cause of action, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>that the bar\u2019s knowledge of plaintiffs intoxication was relevant regarding whether the bar breached its duty to protect plaintiff against the ice and snow in its parking lot. Although we agree in part with the Court of Appeals and hold that the dramshop act does not preclude such a cause of action, we reject the holding by the Court of Appeals that the bar\u2019s knowledge of plaintiffs intoxication has any relevance. <em>Lugo v Ameritech Corp, Inc, </em>464 Mich 512, 520; 629 NW2d 384 (2001). Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, vacate the jury verdict, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On March 6,1996, during a blizzard, plaintiff entered defendant\u2019s bar and consumed nine alcoholic drinks in approximately three hours. After leaving the bar, plaintiff, who was visibly intoxicated and had a blood alcohol content of 0.25 percent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sustained injuries when he slipped and fell on ice and snow that had accumulated in defendant\u2019s parking lot during the blizzard. Accordingly, plaintiff filed a premises liability cause of action against defendant, claiming that defendant breached its duty of care by failing to warn plaintiff of the ice and snow in defendant\u2019s parking lot and failing to remove such ice and snow within a reasonable time after it had accumulated in defendant\u2019s parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Over defense objection to an instruction on M Civ JI 19.03, the trial court delivered both the \u201cDuty Of Possessor Of Land, Premises, Or Place Of Business To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Invitee\u201d instruction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the \u201cDuty Of Possessor Of Land, Premises, Or Place Of Business To A Business Invitee Regarding Natural Accumulation Of Ice And Snow\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While finding plaintiff fifty percent comparatively negligent, the jury returned a $226,000 verdict in plaintiffs favor. Because plaintiff believed that the jury\u2019s failure to award noneconomic damages was against the great weight of the evidence, he filed a motion for additur or for a new trial, which motion the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Defendant appealed, raising the issues of instructional error and error in the calculation of damages. Plaintiff cross-appealed, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion for additur or for a new trial. In its first opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court denying plaintiffs motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>for additur or for a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, on defendant\u2019s motion for rehearing, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court in all respects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Defendant sought leave to appeal in this Court, arguing that a premises liability cause of action that is alleged to be grounded in the consumption of alcohol is a dramshop action in another guise and, thus, because of the exclusivity provision of the dramshop act, plaintiff should be precluded from pursuing any other cause of action, including a premises liability action.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Statutory interpretation is an issue of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>G C Timmis &amp; Co v Guardian Alarm Co, </em>468 Mich 416, 419; 662 NW2d 710 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Defendant argues that plaintiffs premises liability cause of action is precluded by the exclusivity provision of the dramshop act, MCL 436.1801(10), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">This section [MCL 436.1801] provides the exclusive remedy for money damages against a licensee arising out of the selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Moreover, because the act also provides that \u201c[t]he alleged visibly intoxicated person shall not have a cause of action pursuant to this section..MCL 436.1801(9), defendant argues that plaintiff, as the alleged visibly intoxicated person, has no cause of action at all under the dramshop act.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Plaintiff does not contest that, if his cause of action, in fact, did arise from defendant\u2019s unlawful \u201cselling, giving, or furnishing\u201d of alcohol, he would be barred from bringing this cause of action by the dramshop act. However, plaintiff instead asserts that the act does not preclude a premises liability action filed by a visibly intoxicated person against the dramshop that unlawfully served alcohol to that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We agree with plaintiff. Here, plaintiffs action arises from injuries he sustained after he slipped and fell in defendant\u2019s icy and snow-covered parking lot. That is, plaintiffs action is based on the claim that defendant did not sufficiently protect him as an invitee from a dangerous condition on the premises, specifically defendant\u2019s icy and snow-covered parking lot. Accordingly, this is not an action arising from the unlawful \u201cselling, giving, or furnishing\u201d of alcohol. MCL 436.1801(3). Rather, it is an ordinary premises liability action. This is made evident by considering that, had plaintiff not been served any alcohol at all by defendant, but still sustained the same injuries, plaintiff would not be precluded from asserting a premises liability action for such injuries on the basis of his invitee status.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Because we hold that the dramshop act does not preclude plaintiffs premises liability cause of action, we next consider the relevancy of plaintiffs intoxication and defendant\u2019s knowledge of such intoxication. Generally, a premises possessor owes a duty of care to an invitee to exercise reasonable care to protect the invitee from an unreasonable risk of harm caused by a dangerous condition on the land. <em>Bertrand v Alan Ford, Inc, </em>449 Mich 606, 609; 537 NW2d 185 (1995). This duty generally does not encompass a duty to protect an invitee from \u201copen and obvious\u201d dangers. <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 516. However, if there are \u201cspecial aspects\u201d of a condition that make even an \u201copen and obvious\u201d danger \u201cunreasonably dangerous,\u201d the premises possessor maintains a duty to undertake reasonable precautions to protect invitees from such danger. <em>Id. </em>at 517.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>determine whether a condition is \u201copen and obvious,\u201d or whether there are \u201cspecial aspects\u201d that render even an \u201copen and obvious\u201d condition \u201cunreasonably dangerous,\u201d the fact-finder must utilize an objective standard, i.e., a reasonably prudent person standard. <em>Id. </em>That is, in a premises liability action, the fact-finder must consider the \u201ccondition of the premises,\u201d not the condition of the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 518 n 2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A visibly intoxicated person is held to the same standard of reasonable conduct as a sober person.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">Defendant\u2019s service of alcohol was implicated only as it related to defendant\u2019s knowledge of plaintiffs condition as relevant to whether defendant\u2019s conduct in failing to inspect or clear the parking lot and failing to warn plaintiff was reasonable. [November 30, 2001, slip op at 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Rather, defendant\u2019s knowledge that plaintiff was intoxicated does not affect the legal duties it owes to plaintiff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>That is, although defendant served plaintiff alcohol and was apparently aware that plaintiff was intoxicated, defendant does not owe plaintiff any heightened duty of care. Rather, in determining whether defendant breached its duty, the fact-finder must decide only whether a reasonably prudent person would have slipped and fallen on the ice and snow in defendant\u2019s parking lot, or whether that reasonably prudent person should have been warned by defendant of the dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">If plaintiffs extent of intoxication were considered in determining defendant\u2019s duty of care to plaintiff, such consideration, in our judgment, would circumvent the dramshop act\u2019s prohibition against permitting a visibly intoxicated person from collecting monetary damages arising from defendant\u2019s unlawful \u201cselling, giving, or furnishing\u201d of alcohol to such plaintiff. MCL 436.1801(9X10). The dramshop act protects dramshop owners by prohibiting a visibly intoxicated person from recovering damages that have arisen from the dram-shop unlawfully \u201cselling, giving, or furnishing\u201d alcohol to such person. In our judgment, the statutory protection would be nullified if dramshop owners, in premises liability actions, were held to a higher duty of care because they unlawfully sold alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person. Accordingly, a dramshop owner, as with any other property owner, has a duty toward the reasonably prudent invitee; he does not, however, have a heightened duty in the case of the visibly intoxicated invitee. Concomitantly, there is no diminished standard of reasonable conduct on the part of a visibly intoxicated invitee in comparison with any other invitee.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Defendant raises one last argument concerning the jury instructions. The \u201cNote on Use\u201d of M Civ JI 19.05 states that \u201cthis instruction [pertaining to the obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tions of a premises possessor to dimmish the hazards arising from the accumulation of ice and snow] should be used where applicable instead of the more general M Civ JI 19.03 [pertaining to the obligations of a premises possessor to warn of open and obvious dangers] ....\u201d By-virtue of the \u201cinstead of\u201d language, defendant argues that \u00a7 19.03 and \u00a7 19.05 are mutually exclusive and that the trial court erred in giving \u00a7 19.03. Defendant argues that \u00a7 19.05 applies in a single specific situation\u2014where there is an accumulation of ice and snow\u2014and that in such a situation, the trial court should only have instructed on \u00a7 19.05. We disagree. Under <em>Lugo, </em>a premises possessor has a duty to \u201cprotect\u201d an invitee from dangers that are either not \u201copen and obvious,\u201d or, although \u201copen and obvious,\u201d contain \u201cspecial aspects\u201d that make such dangers \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 516-517. Because the duty to \u201cprotect,\u201d as that term was used in <em>Lugo, </em>is broader and more general than either the duty to \u201cwarn,\u201d \u00a7 19.03, or the duty to \u201cdiminish\u201d a hazard caused by ice and snow, \u00a7 19.05, we believe that the duty to \u201cprotect\u201d encompasses both the duty to \u201cwarn\u201d and the duty to \u201cdiminish\u201d in these instructions. Accordingly, to the extent that the \u201cNote on Use\u201d of \u00a7 19.05 implies that \u00a7 19.03 and \u00a7 19.05 are mutually exclusive, such an implication is unwarranted under <em>Lugo, </em>and the trial court did not err on this ground in delivering both instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">However, we believe that \u00a7 19.03 is an inaccurate instruction. Under <em>Lugo, </em>a premises possessor must protect an invitee against an \u201copen and obvious\u201d danger only if such danger contains \u201cspecial aspects\u201d that make it \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 517. Because \u201cspecial aspects\u201d are not defined with regard to whether a premises possessor should expect that an invitee will not \u201cdiscover the danger\u201d or will not \u201cprotect against it,\u201d \u00a7 19.03, but rather by whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>otherwise \u201copen and obvious\u201d danger is \u201ceffectively unavoidable\u201d or \u201cimpose[s] an unreasonably high risk of severe harm\u201d to an invitee, <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 518, we believe that \u00a7 19.03 sets forth an inaccurate statement of premises liability law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We further believe that \u00a7 19.05 sets forth an inaccurate instruction. Under <em>Lugo, </em>a premises possessor must protect an invitee against an \u201copen and obvious\u201d danger only if such danger contains \u201cspecial aspects\u201d that make it \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 517. Thus, in the context of an accumulation of snow and ice, <em>Lugo </em>means that, when such an accumulation is \u201copen and obvious,\u201d a premises possessor must \u201ctake reasonable measures within a reasonable period of time after the accumulation of snow and ice to diminish the hazard of injury to [plaintiff]\u201d only if there is some \u201cspecial aspect\u201d that makes such accumulation \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 19.05 ignores <em>Lugo's </em>\u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d requirement by imposing an absolute duty on a premises possessor irrespective of whether the accumulation of snow and ice creates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u201cspecial aspects\u201d making such accumulation \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such an absolute duty does not exist under <em>Lugo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\"><em>W. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We agree in part with the Court of Appeals and hold that the dramshop act does not preclude plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>premises liability cause of action because plaintiffs injuries arose from something other than defendant unlawfully \u201cselling, giving, or furnishing\u201d alcohol to plaintiff.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, we also hold that a dramshop\u2019s knowledge of an invitee\u2019s intoxication is irrelevant in determining whether that dramshop has breached its duty of care toward such invitee, and that there is no diminished standard of conduct on the part of a visibly intoxicated invitee. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate the jury verdict, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b422-4\">Corrigan, C.

Consistent with her opinion in <em>Lugo, </em>we are hard-pressed to understand how Justice Weaver could now conclude that a homeowner or other premises possessor has a duty of care to diminish a hazard caused by the accumulation of ice and snow, even if such hazard is open and obvious. In other words, Justice Weaver criticizes the majority in <em>Lugo </em>for fading to accord the \u201copenness and obviousness\u201d of a hazard <em>exclusive </em>consideration, whde in the instant case, she criticizes the majority for according the \u201copenness and obviousness\u201d of a hazard <em>excessive </em>consideration.

Until today, the precise application and scope of the majority\u2019s \u201cspecial aspects\u201d analysis was unclear.

Unfortunately, the majority opinion today ends that debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Today\u2019s decision is simply the latest installment in the majority\u2019s systematic dismantling of the Restatement of Torts approach. The majority effectively states that the Restatement approach is dead because <em>Lugo, </em>and only <em>Lugo, </em>is the law in Michigan. In revising M Civ JI 19.03, the majority signals the death knell to the protections previously afforded the citizens of this state and, as a practical matter, overrules decades of well-reasoned precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">I remain committed to the view that the majority\u2019s singular approach is wrong and inconsistent with Michigan\u2019s premises liability jurisprudence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because <em>Lugo, </em>and its \u201cspecial aspects\u201d analysis, is not the only relevant inquiry in such cases, I fail to see the wisdom of revising M Civ JI 19.03 and 19.05 to only reflect the current majority\u2019s <em>Lugo </em>standard. I remain committed to the view that under Michigan law, other inquiries are relevant, if not required, in open and obvious danger cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">I. M CIV JI 19.03</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">I agree with the majority that a premises possessor is generally not required to protect an invitee from open and obvious dangers. This is the approach advanced by 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343A, an approach which \u201chas been key to Michigan\u2019s open and obvious danger law. .. .\u201d <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 528 (CAVANAGH, J., concurring); see also <em>Bertrand v Alan Ford, Inc, </em>449 Mich 606, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>609; 537 NW2d 185 (1995); <em>Perkoviq v Delcor HomesLake Shore Pointe, Ltd, </em>466 Mich 11, 16; 643 NW2d 212 (2002). As noted by the Restatement, however, there are exceptions to this general rule, and these exceptions cannot be conveniently summarized by a \u201cspecial aspects\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The applicable Restatement sections provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u00a7 343. Dangerous conditions known to or discoverable by possessor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">(a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">(b) <em>should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">(c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger. [2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343, pp 215-216 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">\u00a7 343A. Known or obvious dangers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">(1) A possessor of land is not liable to his invitees for physical harm caused to them by any activity or condition on the land whose danger is known or obvious to them, <em>unless the possessor should anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-12\">(2) In determining whether the possessor should anticipate harm from a known or obvious danger, the fact that the invitee is entitled to make use of public land, or of the facilities of a public utility, is a factor of importance indicating that the harm should be anticipated. <em>[Id. </em>at \u00a7 343A, p 218 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">Comment f to \u00a7 343A is particularly enlightening and states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-14\">There are, however, cases in which the possessor of land can and should anticipate that the dangerous condition will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>cause physical harm to the invitee notwithstanding its known or obvious danger. In such cases the possessor is not relieved of the duty of reasonable care which he owes to the invitee for his protection. <em>This duty may require him to warn the invitee, or to take other reasonable steps to protect him, against the known or obvious condition or activity, if the possessor has reason to expect that the invitee will nevertheless suffer physical harm.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">Such reason to expect harm to the visitor from known or obvious dangers may arise, for example, where the possessor has reason to expect that the invitee\u2019s attention may be distracted, so that he will not discover what is obvious, or will forget what he has discovered, <em>or fail to protect himself against it. [Id. </em>2d, \u00a7 343A comment 1(f), p 220 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">It is within this context that the proposed revisions to M Civ JI 19.03 must be examined. The instruction provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">A possessor of [land/premises/a place of business] has a duty to maintain the [land/premises/place of business] in a reasonably safe condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">A possessor has a duty to exercise ordinary care to protect an invitee from unreasonable risks of injury that were known to the possessor or that should have been known in the exercise of ordinary care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">*(A <em>possessor must warn the invitee of dangers that are known or that should have been known to the possessor unless those dangers are open and obvious. However, a possessor must warn an invitee of an open and obvious danger if the possessor should expect that an invitee will not discover the danger or will not protect [himself/herself] against it.) </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">On the bases of the Restatement and Michigan law, I believe M Civ JI 19.03 to be an accurate instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">For example, in <em>Riddle v McLouth Steel Products Corp, </em>440 Mich 85; 485 NW2d 676 (1992), this Court made it clear that the open and obvious doctrine is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>an absolute bar to liability. In <em>Riddle, </em>this Court noted that \u201cwhere the dangers are known to the invitee or are so <em>obvious </em>that the invitee might reasonably be expected to discover them, an invitor owes no duty to protect or warn the invitee <em>unless </em>he should anticipate the harm despite knowledge of it on behalf of the invitee.\u201d <em>Riddle, supra </em>at 96 (emphasis added). As the Minnesota Supreme Court has noted, \u00a7 343A\u2019s \u201cunless\u201d clause is a \u201ccrucial qualifier to the general rule\u201d of the Restatement. <em>Sutherland v Barton, </em>570 NW2d 1, 7 (Minn, 1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[i]f the conditions are known or obvious to the invitee, the premises owner may nonetheless be required to exercise reasonable care to protect the invitee from the danger.\u201d <em>Riddle, supra </em>at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">It becomes obvious that the \u201cspecial aspects\u201d of a particular condition may be <em>a </em>critical question in determining whether liability should be imposed upon a possessor in open and obvious danger cases. The majority concludes that under its \u201cspecial aspects\u201d analysis, \u201cthe fact-finder must consider the \u2018condition of the premises,\u2019 not the condition of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 329. Although this may be a relevant inquiry, the condition\u2019s \u201cspecial aspects\u201d are by no means disposi-tive. Additionally, solely focusing on a condition\u2019s \u201cspecial aspects\u201d reads the \u201cunless\u201d clause out of Michigan premises liability law.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Rather, the \u201cspecial aspects\u201d endeavor must be made <em>within </em>the framework set forth by the Restatement as adopted by this Court. Thus, under Michigan practice, other inquiries are required in making a liability determination and a court\u2019s analysis simply does not end with the condition\u2019s \u201cspecial aspects.\u201d Stated differently, \u201cThe liability of an owner or occupier should not be determined solely by the condition of the premises, natural or artificial, but rather by the occupier\u2019s conduct in relation to those conditions\u2014that is, considering all of the circumstances, was due care exercised.\u201d Littlejohn, Torts [1974 Annual survey of Michigan law], 21 Wayne L R 665, 677-678 (1975). M Civ JI 19.03 recognizes this point of law and, therefore, remains an accurate instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Consider the following hypothetical example, an elaboration of the facts presented in <em>Sidorowicz v Chicken Shack, Inc, </em>469 Mich 919; 673 NW2d 106 (2003). During remodeling, a particular restaurant has a six-foot hole in its floor. The restaurant owner decides it would be beneficial to remain open during remodeling. The owner conspicuously places large signs at the entrance and throughout the restaurant indicating the presence of the hole. The owner further places a giant red flag in the center of the hole. Patrons can easily avoid the hole by traveling down one of two alternate aisles. A blind person enters the restaurant to grab a bite to eat. The owner <em>knows </em>that the invitee is blind. The invitee is wearing sunglasses, carries a white cane, has a sign around his neck that reads, \u201cI am blind,\u201d and even orally states to the owner, \u201cI am blind and cannot see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The hole is properly considered a dangerous condition on the land. Further, the condition would arguably be considered open and obvious to a reasonably prudent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, no \u201cspecial aspects\u201d exist in this situation because the \u201caverage\u201d person could easily avoid the dangerous condition by taking an alternative route. Under the majority\u2019s approach, the analysis ends at this point and the restaurant owner can never be held liable for failing to warn the blind invitee or for failing to take other actions to protect this person. This is true even though the owner <em>knows </em>with near absolute certainty that the invitee will be unable to protect himself and will suffer physical injury. The prior decisions from this Court, M Civ JI 19.03, the Restatement, and common sense suggest that the owner may be held liable in this instance despite the \u201cobviousness\u201d of the dangerous condition. This point of law appears to have eluded the majority and I would necessarily have to hold myself liable if I did not warn its members of their obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In its assessment of the above hypothetical example, the majority states, \u201cBy imposing an obligation upon a homeowner or other premises possessor, not merely to make his or her premises reasonably safe under <em>ordinary </em>circumstances, but also under <em>every conceivable </em>circumstance, Justice CAVANAGH in his concurrence/dissent,... would impose a substantially increased legal burden upon such persons.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 329 n 10 (emphasis added). I am troubled by this assertion because, unlike the majority, I do not believe that a blind person entering a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>restaurant is an extraordinary or uncommon event. Moreover, I question the wisdom of any rule of law that only applies under so-called \u201cordinary\u201d or idyllic circumstances. The Restatement approach seeks to protect those who cannot protect themselves, including the more than forty-three million Americans with disabilities. Apparently, the majority\u2019s oversimplified <em>Lugo </em>approach takes a different view.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In sum, I am troubled by the majority\u2019s overreliance on <em>Lugo\u2019s </em>\u201cspecial aspects\u201d analysis. By focusing solely on this analysis, the majority repudiates the Restatement approach and, at the very least, unwisely eliminates the \u201cunless\u201d clause from Michigan jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">II. MCIVJI 19.05</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">I share in the concerns expressed by Justice WEAVER and likewise disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to revise M Civ JI 19.05 to solely reflect its <em>Lugo </em>standard. In <em>Quinlivan v The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, Inc, </em>395 Mich 244, 261; 235 NW2d 732 (1975), this Court stated, \u201cWhile the invitor is not an absolute insurer of the safety of the invitee, the invitor has a duty to exercise reasonable care to diminish the hazards of ice and snow accumulation.\u201d Such a duty requires \u201cthat reasonable measures be taken within a reasonable time after an accumulation____\u201d <em>Id. </em>M Civ JI 19.05 accurately reflects the rule announced in <em>Quinlivan </em>and followed in this state for nearly thirty years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In qualifying M Civ JI 19.05 with its <em>Lugo </em>standard, the majority has added uncertainty to Michigan premises liability law. In response to the dissent, the majority claims that <em>Quinlivan </em>\u201cmust be understood in light of this Court\u2019s subsequent decisions in <em>Bertrand </em>and <em>Lugo\" Ante </em>at 333 n 13. However, neither <em>Bertrand </em>nor <em>Lugo </em>involved the accumulation of ice and snow. Further, today\u2019s opinion, taken to its logical conclusion, could be read to imply that any accumulations of ice and snow are necessarily open and obvious dangers. Yet, in <em>Quinlivan </em>this Court specifically rejected \u201cthe prominently cited notion that ice and snow hazards are obvious to all and therefore may not give rise to liability.\u201d <em>Quinlivan, </em>supra at 261. Thus, the majority creates unnecessary tension with <em>Quinlivan </em>where none had existed before.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Additionally, even if the majority opinion is read narrowly, i.e., that the <em>Lugo </em>qualification only applies where it is first determined that the accumulation is open and obvious, today\u2019s approach significantly alters the duty traditionally imposed upon possessors of land. Nothing in <em>Quinlivan </em>suggests that an invitor must diminish the hazards of ice and snow <em>only if </em>the accumulation involves \u201cspecial aspects\u201d or is \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d I share in the concerns set forth by Justice WEAVER regarding this line of reasoning. Because M Civ JI 19.05 accurately reflects <em>Quinlivan </em>and <em>Quinlivan </em>remains the law, I must respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to revise this instruction in light of <em>Lugo.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b431-5\">KELLY, J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> I appreciate the majority graciously granting me permission to espouse my view of the law and allowing me to \u201creargue\u201d the ramifications of overreliance on <em>Lugo\u2019s </em>errant approach.

Almost thirty years ago, this Court in <em>Quinlivan v The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, Inc, </em>395 Mich 244, 260-261; 235 NW2d 732 (1975), recognized that although snow and ice accumulations are obvious, the \u201crigorous duty\u201d owed by invitors to protect invitees from unreasonable harm justified the imposition of a uniform duty on invitors regarding accumulations of snow and ice. <em>Quin-livan, </em>therefore, held that premises possessors owed a duty to invitees to take \u201creasonable measures. . . within a reasonable time after an accumulation of ice and snow to diminish the hazard of injury to the invitee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">However, in this case the majority holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">[W]hen such an accumulation is \u201copen and obvious,\u201d a premises possessor must \u201ctake reasonable measures within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>a reasonable period of time after the accumulation of snow and ice to diminish the hazard of injury to [plaintiff]\u201d only if there is some \u201cspecial aspect\u201d that makes such accumulation \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d <em>[Ante </em>at 332.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">With this, the majority overrules <em>Quinlivan. </em>The majority says that it is \u201cunprepared to hold that, absent any special aspects, and absent consideration of the open and obvious nature of a hazard, a homeowner or other premises possessor owes an absolute duty to an invitee to diminish the hazards attendant to the accumulation of ice and snow.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 333 n 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">While <em>Quinlivan </em>clarified a premises possessor\u2019s duty regarding all snow and ice accumulations, the majority confuses this area of premises liability law by holding that some kinds of snow and ice are more dangerous than others. Now, in cases involving snow and ice, it must first be established that the accumulation was open and obvious. Most such accumulations will, by the very nature of an accumulation, be open and obvious.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, most snow and ice cases will then be subjected to <em>Lugo\u2019s </em>special aspect test. Now, unless there are \u201cspecial aspects\u201d to an accumulation of snow and ice creating a risk of \u201csevere harm,\u201d a premises possessor owes no duty to take reasonable measures within a reasonable time to protect invitees from the danger. One can readily anticipate nuanced debate and inconsistent conclusions regarding whether an accumulation of snow was heavy or light, wet or dry, hard-packed or fluffy, etc. and just how those varied conditions affected the unreasonableness or severity of harm posed by a given accumulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>In Michigan, where accumulations of snow and ice abound, every citizen\u2019s duty with respect to all accumulations of snow and ice should be unambiguous. Changes by this Court regarding that duty should be well-reasoned and obvious. <em>Lugo </em>did not involve an accumulation of snow and ice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority should not extend <em>Lugo\u2019s </em>\u201cspecial aspect\u201d test to this context and should not overrule <em>Quinlivctn </em>and leave to the fact-finder the confusing task of distinguishing between differing types of snow and ice accumulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Therefore, I dissent from the majority extending the <em>Lugo </em>\u201cspecial aspects\u201d test to accumulations of snow and ice. I concur only in the decision of the majority in vacating the jury verdict for plaintiff because, under the facts of this case, the licensee\u2019s knowledge of plaintiffs intoxication is irrelevant to whether the bar breached its common-law duty of care to plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> In <em>Bertrand v Alan Ford, Inc, </em>449 Mich 606; 537 NW2d 185 (1995), a majority articulated a \u201cspecial aspect\u201d test for evaluating whether a danger was unreasonably dangerous so as to avoid the application of the open and obvious danger doctrine. In <em>Lugo v Ameritech Corp, Inc, </em>464 Mich 512; 629 NW2d 384 (2001), a majority transformed the \u201cspecial aspect\u201d test by introducing a new standard that focuses on the severity of possible harm to define what \u201cspecial aspects\u201d might create an unreasonable risk of harm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-6\"> Because the majority fails to explain the nature of a premises possessor\u2019s duty regarding accumulations of snow and ice that are not open and obvious, we must await the inevitable black ice case to fully understand and assess the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Quinlivan.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\"> The majority incorrectly suggests that my position in this case is inconsistent with my position in <em>Lugo. </em>In <em>Lugo </em>at 546 (Weaver, J., concurring), I said that the <em>Lugo </em>majority was wrong to change the law and should have remained true to well-established articulations of the open and obvious doctrine. Today, I again reject the majority\u2019s decision to change the law, this time regarding accumulations of snow and ice, because I would affirm <em>Quinlivan\u2019s </em>articulation of duty in snow and ice cases. As I explained in <em>Bertrand, supra </em>at 625 (Weaver, J., concurring and dissenting), under <em>Quinlivan, </em>snow and ice accumulation cases were essentially exceptions to the open and obvious doctrine. I would continue to distinguish snow and ice cases from other premises defects and encourage the majority to stop destabilizing the law of premises liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\"> Because I continue to disagree with the evolution of the \u201cspecial aspects\u201d test, I would not amend M Civ JI 19.03 to incorporate it. See <em>Bertrand, supra </em>at 625-626 (Weaver J., concurring and dissenting), and <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 544 (Weaver J., concurring). Similarly, for the reasons stated above, I would not amend M Civ JI 19.05 regarding the duty of premises possessors to take reasonable measures within a reasonable time regarding accumulations of snow and ice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
