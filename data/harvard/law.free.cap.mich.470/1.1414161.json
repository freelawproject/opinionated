Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, MCL 750.317, and failure to stop at the scene of an accident in which he was involved and that resulted in serious injury, MCL 257.617. Defendant appealed these convictions, contending that the prosecutor im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>properly elicited testimony regarding his <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence. However, pursuant to its decision in <em>People v Schollaert, </em>194 Mich App 158, 164-165; 486 NW2d 312 (1992), the Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions. We conclude that defendant forfeited the claim of error by not objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding defendant\u2019s pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On the afternoon of February 10, 1999, defendant and the victim, Harold VanDorn, met in a bar and decided to continue drinking together for the rest of the evening. By 10:00 P.M., both men were intoxicated. After visiting a fast-food restaurant and before reaching their next destination, the two men had a disagreement. They exchanged punches, which prompted VanDorn to leave the truck and start walking in the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Defendant drove away a short distance, but then made a U-turn and accelerated in VanDorn\u2019s direction. By the time defendant reached VanDorn, the truck was traveling at approximately forty-five miles an hour. At that point, defendant steered across the centerline at VanDorn, striking and killing him. The police arrested defendant one-half mile from the scene after a preliminary breath test indicated that defendant had a blood alcohol level of 0.207 grams per 210 liters of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Defendant was prosecuted for murder. He did not testify, but his attorney offered two explanations for the accident: first, the truck\u2019s brakes and steering were defective; and second, defendant blacked out immediately before striking VanDorn. To rebut these explanations, the prosecutor called several mechanics who examined the truck\u2019s brakes and concluded they were not defective. To further rebut these explanations, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>prosecutor, during his case-in-chief, elicited the following testimony of the arresting officer, Officer Cacicedo:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\"><em>Q. </em>At any point in time that evening, did the defendant indicate to you that he had lost control of the truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\"><em>Q. </em>Did he ever indicate to you that there was any mechanical defect with the truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\"><em>Q. </em>Did he ever indicate to you that he blacked out that evening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\"><em>Q. </em>Did he ever indicate to you that he couldn\u2019t remember things that happened that evening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Defendant never objected to this testimony, nor did the prosecutor make any further comment at trial concerning this testimony. Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of an accident involving serious injury. The court imposed concurrent prison terms of twenty to fifty years for murder and two to five years for leaving the scene of a serious accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">Defendant appealed, contending that his convictions must be reversed because the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination by impermissibly eliciting testimony regarding his <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence. However, pursuant to <em>Schollaert, supra </em>at 164-165,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and stated, \u201cThe challenged testimony did not concern silence during custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>dial interrogation or silence in reliance on <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Therefore, defendant\u2019s silence was not constitutionally protected.\u201d Unpublished opinion per curium, issued July 20, 2001 (Docket No. 223059). This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 467 Mich 896 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">II. STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Unpreserved claims of constitutional error are reviewed for \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 764; 597 NW2d 130 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">I\u00dc. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">A. FORFEITED ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Defendant asks us to review a claim of error that he did not preserve at trial. We thus apply the principles articulated in <em>Carines, supra </em>at 763:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">To avoid forfeiture under the plain error rule, three requirements must be met: 1) error must have occurred, 2) the error was plain, i.e., clear or obvious, 3) and the plain error affected substantial rights. The third requirement generally requires a showing of prejudice, i.e., that the error affected the outcome of the lower court proceedings. It is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.... Reversal is warranted only when the plain, forfeited error resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or when an error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings independent of the defendant\u2019s innocence. [Citations and internal quotation marks omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Accordingly, in order for defendant to avoid forfeiture, he must show that the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding his pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence affected his substantial rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>That is, he must show that the prosecutor\u2019s questions affected the outcome of the lower court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s evidence against defendant included two eyewitnesses. The first, John Dalling, testified that defendant slowly drove past the victim, made a sharp U-turn in the middle of the road, crossed two lanes while accelerating toward the victim, hit the victim, and then drove on. He stated, \u201cit\u2019s like he got in position and pretty much just went straight at him, across both lanes and went into the middle turning lane and hit him head on.\u201d When asked if defendant\u2019s truck picked up speed after he made the U-turn, Dalling stated, \u201cYes, it did. It was like if he just gunned it.\u201d According to Dalling, after defendant hit the victim, he made another U-turn and slowly drove past the victim\u2019s body. Dalling further testified that he did not notice any problems with the truck, i.e., it was not veering in and out of lanes. He also testified that he did not hear any brakes or tires squeal before defendant struck the victim. Nor did he see any brake lights come on before defendant struck the victim. According to Dalling, defendant did not make any attempt to swerve away from the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">A second eyewitness, Matt Walsh, was driving toward defendant\u2019s truck, in light traffic with clear visibility, when he noticed defendant\u2019s headlights veer sharply and he saw the victim go over defendant\u2019s hood. Walsh stopped his truck in front of the victim and got out to help. Walsh saw defendant\u2019s truck return to pass the victim slowly and then drive away.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Further, the prosecutor introduced two expert witnesses who testified that defendant\u2019s truck was mechanically sound. Specifically, one expert witness concluded that the steering and braking mechanisms were worn, but in working condition. Neither of the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tor\u2019s expert witnesses found mechanical difficulties in the truck that would have caused defendant to lose control of the vehicle or swerve uncontrollably, or that would have prevented defendant from stopping the truck. Indeed, even defendant\u2019s expert witness conceded that, when he drove the vehicle, it always stopped when the brakes were applied and it did not deviate course from one lane to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Given this evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding defendant\u2019s <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence, even if error, did not affect the outcome of the lower court proceedings. In other words, defendant would have been found guilty independent of the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding defendant\u2019s pre-<em>Miranda </em>silence. Therefore, because defendant has not met his burden of establishing that the alleged error affected the outcome of the lower court proceedings, he is unable to avoid forfeiture.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He has forfeited his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of error by not objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding his pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">ra CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Because defendant failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding defendant\u2019s <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence and these questions did not affect the outcome of the lower court proceedings, defendant has forfeited his claim of error. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-7\">Corrigan, C.J., and Cavanagh, Kelly, Taylor, and YOUNG, JJ., concurred with MArkMAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-11\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-15\"> The prosecutor elicited similar testimony from Officers Hillman and Siladke, both of whom assisted in the stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-16\"> We have no occasion to consider the decision reached by the Court of Appeals in <em>Schollaert </em>in light of our disposition of this case under <em>Cannes.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\"> Because we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not affect the outcome of the lower court proceedings, it is unnecessary to determine if the prosecutor\u2019s questions were permissible and \u201cit is an undisputed principle of judicial review that questions of constitutionality should not be decided if the case may he disposed of on other grounds.\u201d <em>J &amp; J Constr Co v Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, </em>468 Mich 722, 734; 664 NW2d 728 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In response to the partial concurrence and partial dissent, we can only state that it is not to \u201cevade\u201d a constitutional issue for this Court, after full consideration of the arguments, to reach the conclusion that a matter may adequately be resolved by means other than constitutional analysis. Indeed, it is incumbent on a court of law to do exactly this. While it would he convenient if the decisions of this Court were always defined by the terms of our grant orders, in the real world, in which arguments are sometimes unanticipated and in which briefs and oral arguments often shed new light upon the issues presented by a case, no responsible court can decide cases in such a constricted manner. No such court can be oblivious to the fact that its initial estimation of the issues presented by a case may have been imperfect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b96-12\"> Because the admission of evidence regarding defendant\u2019s preMiranda silence did not affect the outcome of the lower court proceedings, i.e., defendant was not prejudiced, defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is also without merit. <em>People v Pickens, </em>446 Mich 298, 338; 521 NW2d 797 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b96-8\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur in the result because it is true that the alleged error was harmless given that other evidence establishing defendant\u2019s guilt was substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">However, the majority unwisely evades the question whether a defendant\u2019s postarrest, pr <em>e-Miranda </em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>silence is admissible in a prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">I write separately because I disagree with the majority\u2019s choice to evade and fail to decide the substantive issue that this Court specifically ordered to be briefed and argued in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">In October 2002, this Court granted leave to appeal, specifically limiting the grant to whether defendant\u2019s postarrest, pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence was admissible and whether defendant was denied the effective assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>of counsel because trial counsel failed to object to the admission of testimony relating to defendant\u2019s silence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In April of 2003 this Court heard oral argument in the case. The Court failed to issue a decision by July 31, 2003, and ordered that the case be set for reargument and resubmission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties again argued this case in October 2003, addressing the same questions\u2014 whether it was error for the prosecutor to have introduced defendant\u2019s postarrest, pre-Miranda silence and whether defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to object to the evidence of defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The majority now chooses to dodge the substantive issue \u2014 whether the defendant\u2019s silence was admissible in the prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief \u2014 by skipping over the first two factors in <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 763; 597 NW2d 130 (1999), whether error occurred and whether the error was plain, and moving directly to whether any hypothetical error would be harmless.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In declining to address whether error occurred, the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ity leaves unanswered the question whether a defendant\u2019s postarrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence is admissible in the prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The majority justifies its refusal to decide the substantive issue by referencing a principle of judicial review that \u201cquestions of constitutionality should not be decided if the case may be disposed of on other grounds.\u201d <em>J &amp; J Constr Co v Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, </em>468 Mich 722, 734; 664 NW2d 728 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">But that general principle does not apply here. The phrase used by the majority is a convenient and often-used shorthand for the principle that \u201c[c]onsiderations of propriety, as well as long-established practice, demand that we refrain from passing upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress [or the Legislature] unless obliged to do so in the proper performance of our judicial function, when the question is raised by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it.\u201d <em>Ashwander v Tennessee Valley Auth, </em>297 US 288, 341; 56 S Ct 466; 80 L Ed 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">One of the earliest applications of this rule in Michigan was in 1874, when this Court said \u201cany consideration of the constitutional question might have been waived, upon the ground that a legislative act should not be declared unconstitutional unless the point is presented in such a form as to render its decision imperative . ...\u201d <em>Weimer v Bunbury, </em>30 Mich 201, 218 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The reasons behind such judicial restraint include the delicacy and finality of judicial review of legislative acts, separation of powers concerns raised by ruling on the acts of the other two branches of government, and the need to show respect for the other two branches of government. See <em>Rescue Army v Muni Court of Los Angeles, </em>331 US 549, 571; 67 S Ct 1409; 91 L Ed 1666 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>(1947), and Kloppenberg, <em>Avoiding serious constitutional doubts: The supreme court\u2019s construction of statutes raising free speech concerns, </em>30 UC Davis L R 1, 13-14 (Fall, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">These concerns are not implicated here, because the constitutionality of an act of the Legislature or the Governor is not at issue. In deciding whether the defendant\u2019s postarrest, pre-Miranda silence was admissible in the prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief, the Court would not be ruling on the validity of a legislative or executive decree, but on a lower court\u2019s decision whether to admit certain testimony. See Kloppenberg, <em>Avoiding constitutional questions, </em>35 B C L R 1003, 1054 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Evading the twice-argued question, and not resolving this substantive issue, leaves the lower courts without guidance from this Court. That drawback is illustrated by the fact that in May 2003 this Court ordered that <em>People v Maxon </em>be held in abeyance for this case. <em>People v Maxon, </em>662 NW2d 753 (2003). In <em>Maxon </em>the question is whether defendant\u2019s prearrest, pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence was admissible during the prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief. By refusing to decide the issue now, the Court merely postpones the issue until another term.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">This case has been in this Court for 1 1/2 years. The Court granted leave to appeal in the case, heard oral argument, and held the case over for reargument and resubmission. The majority now affirms the decision of the Court of Appeals on the ground of harmless error. The majority could have simply denied leave in October 2003. By avoiding the substantive issue the majority has wasted the time and resources of the parties and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The issue whether the prosecutor\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s postarrest, pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence was error is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>squarely before the Court. This case has been briefed, argued, and reargued. The parties and the people deserve a clear answer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-13\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\"> The October 30, 2003, order granting leave read: \u201cOn order of the Court, the delayed application for leave to appeal from the July 20, 2001 decision of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is granted, limited to Issue I in the defendant\u2019s application.\u201d 654 NW2d 328 (2002).
