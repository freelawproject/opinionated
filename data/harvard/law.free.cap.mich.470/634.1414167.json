Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision and remand for consideration of defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Defendant was charged with first-degree felony murder,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (felony firearm),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and armed robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court appointed counsel for defendant, but following defendant\u2019s preliminary examination, counsel withdrew because of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The trial court provided defendant with a replacement court-appointed attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>During the prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant became unhappy with his attorney\u2019s cross-examination of two prosecution witnesses. Defendant informed the court that he wished to represent himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">I do not wish to adjourn the proceeding, because I know this has been going on all along. But I would like to represent myself, in proper person....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">[O]nly if this Court would agree orally, and a written consent, please, that [two prosecution witnesses] may be brought back to court, and allow me to recross-examine [them].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The trial court explained to defendant the risks he faced in defending himself, including defendant\u2019s lack of familiarity with the Michigan rules of criminal procedure. Defendant answered that he understood the risks involved. He stated that he wished to \u201cconfront [his accusers] and question them\u201d as was his \u201cright by the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The trial court again asked defendant whether he wished to represent himself; again, defendant answered, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d The trial court advised defendant that he would not later be permitted to appeal a conviction on the basis of his own ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant answered, \u201cYes I read that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The trial court then asked defendant, \u201cAre you making this request knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily?\u201d Defendant answered, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d The trial court informed defendant that he would not be permitted to disrupt the courtroom, and that if he did, his attorney would be brought back to represent defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Defendant answered, \u201cYes ma\u2019am. I would not disrespect this Court, or do anything that\u2019s unconduct of a gentleman [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The trial court then advised defendant of the sentence he would face if convicted. Defendant said that he understood. Defendant again stated that he wished to reexamine two excused prosecution witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\"><em>The </em>Defendant: Ma\u2019am, is it also on the record, and it will probably be written down, that I will have an opportunity to recross-examine the prosecution\u2019s first two witnesses ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\"><em>The Court: </em>No, we\u2019re not bringing in those other witnesses, we\u2019re continuing with the trial. It\u2019s the Court\u2019s opinion that you had proper representation.... You can still have [your court-appointed attorney] if you want, or you can continue and represent yourself, but you are taking serious risks. ... Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Defendant insisted that at his preliminary examination one of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses had testified that he was \u201conly fifty percent sure\u201d that defendant was the perpetrator. Defendant was dissatisfied with his attorney because he did not cross-examine the witness on this alleged testimony. The prosecutor objected to defendant\u2019s characterization of the witness\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">And there is nothing in that exam transcript [preliminary examination] that indicates that [the witness is] only fifty percent sure. What [defendant\u2019s saying he\u2019s taking out of context. And if [defendant] reads the whole thing, I think he\u2019ll understand why [defendant\u2019s attorney] didn\u2019t elaborate with further questioning of the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Defendant requested time to read the written preliminary examination testimony. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>No. I\u2019m going to ask you one more time. Do you want to represent yourself? Because we\u2019re bringing in the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Your Honor, with all due respect....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\"><em>The Court: </em>I asked you one question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\"><em>The Court-. </em>Answer my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\"><em>The Court-. </em>All right. Let\u2019s bring in the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The trial court once again informed defendant that if he disrupted the proceedings, his court-appointed attorney would be brought back to represent him. Defendant stated that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Defendant\u2019s court-appointed attorney remained as standby counsel. He advised defendant throughout the trial, took part in sidebar discussions, helped defendant prepare his closing argument, and argued to the court regarding jury instructions and the form of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Defendant was ultimately convicted<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and appealed by right. In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial. The majority held that defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was not unequivocal because defendant might not have elected self-representation had the trial court allowed him to read the preliminary examination transcript. The majority opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-12\">[The trial court\u2019s] cursory handling of defendant\u2019s request violated defendant\u2019s right to have the proceeding conducted so as to ensure \u201cthat he knows what he is doing- and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d [Slip Op. at 1 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The Court of Appeals dissent would have held that the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request to read the preliminary examination transcript occurred after the court had already concluded the waiver of counsel procedure, and related solely to how the trial would proceed from that point forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The inquiry regarding waivers of Sixth Amendment rights mirrors the inquiry of whether a defendant has validly waived his Fifth Amendment rights: In each instance, the question is whether the defendant gave a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver. See <em>Patterson v Illinois, </em>487 US 285, 297-298; 108 S Ct 2389; 101 L Ed 2d 261 (1988) (waiver of Sixth Amendment rights is not more difficult to effectuate than waiver of Fifth Amendment rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Accordingly, we adopt the standard of review that has been used for trial court decisions regarding waivers of Fifth Amendment rights, finding it equally applicable to decisions regarding waivers of Sixth Amendment rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">\u201cAlthough engaging in a de novo review of the entire record.. . , this Court does not disturb a trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding a knowing and intelligent waiver of [Sixth Amendment] rights \u2018unless that ruling is found to be clearly erroneous.\u2019 <em>[People v Burrell, </em>417 Mich 439, 448; 339 NW2d 403 (1983).] Credibility is crucial in determining a defendant\u2019s level of comprehension, and the trial judge is in the best position to make this assessment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">Although we review for clear error the trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s knowing and intelligent waiver of [Sixth Amendment] rights,... the meaning of \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d is a question of law. We review questions of law de novo. <em>[People v Daoud, </em>462 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Mich 621, 629-630; 614 NW2d 152 (2000), quoting <em>People v Cheatham, </em>453 Mich 1, 30; 551 NW2d 335 (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Thus, the reviewing court is not free to simply substitute its view for that of the trial court, but must be careful to respect the trial court\u2019s role in determining factual issues and issues of credibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">III. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">A. THE SIXTH AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHT TO SELF-REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The Sixth Amendment safeguards the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process for an accused who faces incarceration. <em>Maine v Moulton, </em>474 US 159, 170; 106 S Ct 477; 88 L Ed 2d 481 (1985). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Gideon v Wainwright, </em>372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963). The United States Supreme Court has stated that courts should \u201c \u2018indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458, 464; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938), quoting <em>Aetna Ins Co v Kennedy, </em>301 US 389, 393; 57 S Ct 809; 81 L Ed 1177 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">The United States Constitution does not, however, force a lawyer upon a defendant; a criminal defendant may choose to waive representation and represent himself. <em>Iowa v Tovar, </em>541 US_; 124 S Ct 1379, 1387; 158 L Ed 2d 209 (2004). \u201cWaiver of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>counsel.. . must be a \u2018knowing, intelligent ac[t] done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1383, quoting <em>Brady v United States, </em>397 US 742, 748; 90 S Ct 1463; 25 L Ed 2d 747 (1970). A waiver is sufficient if the defendant \u201cknows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d <em>Adams v United States ex rel McCann, </em>317 US 269, 279; 63 S Ct 236; 87 L Ed 268 (1942); <em>Godinez v Moran, </em>509 US 389, 401 n 12; 113 S Ct 2680; 125 L Ed 2d 321 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">B. THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL UNDER MICHIGAN LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The right of self-representation under Michigan law is secured by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 13<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and by statute, MCL 763.1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 367-368, this Court held that a trial court must make three findings before granting a defendant\u2019s waiver request. First, the waiver request must be unequivocal. Second, the trial court must be satisfied that the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. To this end, the trial court should inform the defendant of potential risks. Third, the trial court must be satisfied that the defendant will not disrupt, unduly inconvenience, and burden the court or the administration of court business.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Consistent with <em>Anderson, </em>MCR 6.005(D)(1) governs procedures concerning.a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to an attorney. It prohibits a court from granting a defendant\u2019s waiver request without first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>minimum sentence required by law, and the risk involved in self-representation .... [MCR 6.005(D)(1).]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>advising the defendant of the charge, the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense, any mandatory</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>C. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">1. DEFENDANT\u2019S WAIVER WAS UNEQUIVOCAL</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Initially, defendant conditioned his waiver of the right to counsel on the trial court\u2019s granting of his request to recall for cross-examination two excused witnesses. A defendant who elects to proceed in propria persona after proceedings are underway, however, is not entitled to retry the case. The decision whether to recall a witness is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. MRE 611(a); <em>People v Fedderson, </em>327 Mich 213, 220; 41 NW2d 527 (1950); <em>Potts v Shepard Marine Constr Co, </em>151 Mich App 19, 26; 391 NW2d 357 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">In this case, during the waiver of counsel proceeding, the trial court explicitly informed defendant that he would not be permitted to recall any excused witnesses. The court told him, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not bringing in those other witnesses, we\u2019re continuing with the trial.\u201d The court had previously and repeatedly asked defendant if he still wished to represent himself given this ruling. Defendant unequivocally answered, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">We believe the record reflects that the trial court exercised admirable patience in dealing with a defendant who wished to represent himself according to his own rules. The court advised defendant very clearly that he would not be permitted to recall the excused witnesses, regardless of what they had said during their preliminary examination testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The dissent may well be correct that defendant was \u201clistening\u201d without \u201chearing\u201d what the court was saying. <em>Post </em>at 657. Defendant\u2019s subjective under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>standing, however, can only be gleaned by reference to what he said on the record. The record shows that after the court ruled that his insistence on being allowed to recall excused witnesses would not be indulged, defendant answered affirmatively that he, nevertheless, wished to invoke his right of self-representation. Defendant\u2019s unrealistic \u201chopes of introducing evidence\u201d in contravention of the court\u2019s explicit ruling do not render invalid defendant\u2019s unequivocal invocation of his right to self-representation. <em>Post </em>at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The Court of Appeals misread the colloquy between the trial court and defendant. The record reveals that defendant was dissatisfied with the trial court\u2019s ruling that he could not recall an excused witness. Defendant argued with that ruling by claiming his attorney did not adequately cross-examine the excused witness on the basis of the witness\u2019s preliminary examination testimony. Whatever was contained in the preliminary examination transcript, however, was irrelevant at that point because the trial court had already ruled that the witnesses could not be recalled by defendant. The trial court was not required to permit defendant to read transcript testimony when the content was immaterial and the jury was assembled and waiting. Therefore, the Court of Appeals incorrectly held that the trial court erred in refusing to honor defendant\u2019s request to read the preliminary examination transcript. The requirement under <em>Anderson </em>that a defendant unequivocally assert his right to waive counsel was therefore satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">2. DEFENDANT\u2019S WAIVER WAS KNOWING, INTELLIGENT, AND VOLUNTARY</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">As indicated from the portions of the record quoted above, the trial court methodically complied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>remainder of the requirements <em>of Anderson. </em>Defendant was fully apprised of the risks he faced by choosing to represent himself and he knowingly and voluntarily chose to accept them. He may not now be heard to complain about his choice. In <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 725, we quoted with approval language ultimately from <em>People v Morton, </em>175 Mich App 1, 8-9; 437 NW2d 284 (1989), that applies equally here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201c \u2018To permit a defendant in a criminal case to indulge in the charade of insisting on a right to act as his own attorney and then on appeal to use the very permission to defend himself in pro per as a basis for reversal of conviction and a grant of another trial is to make a mockeiy of the criminal justice system and the constitutional rights sought to be protected.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The trial court determined on the record that defendant\u2019s motion to proceed in propria persona was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. The trial court complied with the <em>Anderson </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">3. MCR 6.005 REQUIREMENTS WERE SATISFIED</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Contrary to the dissent, we believe the trial court followed the letter, and not just the spirit, of MCR 6.005(D). The trial court advised defendant of \u201cthe charge, the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense, [and] any mandatory minimum sentence required by law\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\"><em>The Court: </em>And let me first inform you, then, and I have to do this on the record, what the max\u2014the minimum and maximum sentences are, so that if you are found guilty, you know what\u2019s ahead of you. For the homicide felony murder, the maximum is life. For the armed robbery, the sentence is life or any term of years, unless aggravated assault or serious injury is involved, and then it\u2019s not less than two years. And for the felony firearm, that\u2019s two years, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>would be... in addition to, and preceding, before, any term of imprisonment imposed for the felony or attempted felony conviction. Do you understand all that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\"><em>The </em>Defendant: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Mr. Williams, I want you to fully understand that if you are found guilty of homicide felony murder which alleges that you did, while in the perpetration attempted perpetration of a robbery, murder one Jerry Jones, that is a mandatory life sentence. Life is the minimum and life is the maximum. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\"><em>The </em>Defendant: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The court further explicitly complied with MCR 6.005(D)(1) by advising defendant of \u201cthe risk involved in self-representation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Now, sir, as I mentioned before, there are great risks that you are taking on in representing yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Well, your Honor. I know ya\u2019 all could possibly get me smother attorney, but it would be another court-appointed attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\"><em>The Court: </em>No, that\u2019s not an option. We\u2019re in the middle of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-13\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Well, good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">The trial court complied with the requirement of MCR 6.005(D)(2) by providing defendant his court-appointed attorney as an advisor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-15\"><em>The Court: </em>He\u2019s going to be here during the trial so that you can ask him any questions and he can give you any counsel that you might need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-16\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Thank you, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-17\">The record reflects that the trial court conscientiously complied with <em>every </em>requirement of MCR 6.005(D), exceeding the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>quired under <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 706. We do not agree with the dissent that 6.005(D) requires that a court \u201cindicate whether it believe[s] defendant\u2019s request [is] contingent on other factors.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 657. The trial court satisfied all of the waiver-of-counsel procedure required under MCR 6.005(D) and did not err in granting defendant\u2019s request to waive counsel and allowing defendant to proceed in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Although defendant appeared to condition his initial waiver of counsel on the trial court\u2019s agreement to allow him to recall and cross-examine two excused witnesses, he subsequently made an intelligent, knowing, and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel after the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s request to recall and cross-examine the witnesses. Defendant is not entitled to a new trial. We reverse the Court of Appeals decision and remand to the Court of Appeals to consider defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<judges id=\"b735-6\">Weaver, Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Corrigan, C.

In <em>People v Anderson, </em>398 Mich 361, 367-368; 247 NW2d 857 (1976), this Court held that basic requirements must be satisfied before a defendant\u2019s request to waive counsel and proceed in propria persona may be granted. Michigan law additionally requires a trial court to follow the mandates of MCR 6.005(D) before granting such a request. Here, the Court of Appeals found that the trial court provided the disclosures required by MCR 6.005(D). However, the panel ultimately concluded that defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was not unequivocal, fully knowing, intelligent, and voluntary as required by <em>Anderson. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Because I agree with the Court of Appeals assessment of the proceedings, I must respectfully dissent from today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">I.

Concomitantly, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel also implies a \u201ccorrelative right to dispense with a lawyer\u2019s help.\u201d <em>Adams v United States, </em>317 US 269, 279; 63 S Ct 236; 87 L Ed 268 (1942). Under Michigan law, the right to self-representation is expressly protected by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 13 and by statute, MCL 763.1. At times, however, the right to counsel and the right to self-representation may appear to be at odds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">In order to preserve the delicate balance between these two rights, the United States Supreme Court has held that any waiver of the right to counsel must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>304 US 458, 464; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938). Moreover, the waiver must be made with \u201csufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances\u201d and the defendant \u201cmust be warned specifically of the hazards ahead.\u201d <em>Iowa v Tovar, </em>541 US _; 124 S Ct 1379; 158 L Ed 2d 209 (2004). Finally, a court must \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against waiver ... .\u201d <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">This Court has likewise determined that specific requirements must be satisfied and express disclosures must be made before a trial court may grant a defendant\u2019s request to waive counsel. First, the defendant\u2019s request to waive the right to counsel must be unequivocal. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 367. \u201cSecond, once the defendant has unequivocally declared his desire to proceed <em>pro se </em>the trial court must determine whether defendant is asserting his right knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. . .. The trial court must make the <em>pro se </em>defendant aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368. Third, the trial court must determine that the defendant will not disrupt or unduly inconvenience the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Fourth, the trial court must give the necessary disclosures set forth under MCR 6.005(D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 722-723.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Thus, in order to determine whether the instant defendant \u201ckn[e]w what he [was] doing and his choice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>[was] made with eyes open,\u201d <em>Adams, supra </em>at 279, a thorough examination of the trial court proceedings is required. Indeed, the existence of a valid waiver \u201cmust depend in each case upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case....\u201d <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 370; see also <em>People v McKinley, </em>383 Mich 529, 536; 176 NW2d 406 (1970). Because the majority\u2019s recitation of the facts and proceedings omits large portions of the exchange between defendant and the trial court, I find it necessary to fill in the blanks left by the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">II. TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">During its case-in-chief, the prosecution called Flo-rian Mager as a witness. At the end of defense counsel\u2019s recross-examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\"><em>Mr. Cook (defense counsel): </em>I have no further questions of this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Thank you, sir. You can step down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\"><em>Mr. King (prosecutor): </em>The People call as their next witness, your Honor, Tracey Jo Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. If there are any people in the . ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-12\"><em>Mr. Cook: </em>(Interposing) Your Honor, there is one more question that I would ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-13\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. Sir, can you come back to the stand? .. . You\u2019re still under oath to tell the truth, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-14\"><em>The Deputy: </em>Mr. Williams? Mr. Williams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-15\"><em>Mr. Cook: </em>No, your Honor, no more questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-16\"><em>The Court: </em>Thank you, sir. You can step down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-17\">(Witness excused)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>Mr. King: </em>Once again, your Honor, the People call, as their next witness, Tracey Jo Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">Your Honor, may this witness be excused? He is working at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\"><em>The </em>Court: Any objection? Mr. Cook, any objection to ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\"><em>Mr. Cook: </em>(Interposing) I\u2019m sorry, your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Any objection to this witness being excused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\"><em>Mr. Cook: </em>No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes. Wait.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\"><em>The Court: </em>He\u2019s excused. Mr. Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\"><em>The Deputy: </em>Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Could we get a recess for five minutes, please, your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-14\"><em>The Deputy: </em>No, you don\u2019t talk to your Honor, you talk to your attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-15\"><em>Mr. Cook: </em>Your Honor, may I have just a few minutes with my client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-16\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. We\u2019ll excuse the jury for a few minutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">For nearly one half-hour, the trial court was in recess. Once the parties reconvened, the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-18\"><em>The Court: </em>Are we ready to bring in the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-19\"><em>Mr. King: </em>Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-20\"><em>Mr. Cook: </em>Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-21\"><em>The Court: </em>Back on the record on case number 4026\u2014 hold off\u2014the People versus Rodney Williams, out of the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-22\">Mr. Williams, I\u2019m going to inform you, right now, that if you act up, again, you are going to be taken out of the courtroom. And I didn\u2019t want to say that in front of the jury, but that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-23\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-24\">The prosecutor called the next witness, Tracey Jo Williams. After defense counsel\u2019s second recross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>examination, the trial court instructed Ms. Williams to step down and the court broke for lunch. The parties reconvened after the break and the following occurred outside the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\"><em>Mr. Cook: </em>For the record, your Honor, my name is Donald Cook, appearing on behalf of Mr. Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">Your Honor, I believe he wants to address the Court. And I think we probably need to get it out of the way before we have the jury here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. Out of the presence of the jury, What would you like to say, Mr. Williams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Good morning [sic], your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">Your Honor, due to circumstances, I would like to terminate my representation of my attorney, Mr. Donald A. Cook, due to the fact that Mr. Cook has failed to represent me, appropriately. He has allowed the prosecution witnesses to testify. And he has failed to ask them pertinent questions that\u2019s pertaining to my life. Also, he has allowed the first witness to be excused from this courtroom. And I am entitled, I hope, to a proper, fair representation, and also a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">And, also, if the Court deems proper, with all honor and due respect, I would like to have\u2014I do not wish to adjourn this proceeding, because I know this has been going on all along. But I would like to represent myself, in proper person. <em>And, also, if...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-12\"><em>The Deputy: </em>(Interposing) Quiet in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-13\"><em>The Defendant: </em>(Continuing) \u2014 <em>if, only if this Court would agree orally, and a written consent, please, that Mr. Florian Mager be brought back to court, and allow me to recross-examine him, as well as Ms. Tracey Jo Williams. </em>This is for my life. And I accept and I appreciate all that Mr. Donald Cook has done, but these records have facts here, statements that cannot be denied, reports from the Detroit police officers, a Mr. Jerry Jones, making statements, himself, and Mr. Florian Mager, that have not been brought out. And I can do that. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The trial court then gave defense counsel an opportunity to place comments on the record. Defense counsel indicated that he appropriately cross-examined the witnesses in question and that he believed those witnesses had been excused. The trial court then informed defendant that the court must abide by the rules of evidence and that certain things that defendant believed may be introduced may not actually be admissible. At this point, the trial court asked defendant if he realized the risk he was taking by representing himself. The prosecutor then weighed in, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\"><em>Mr. King: </em>I was just going to indicate, your Honor, that the People would strenuously object to this, especially in this stage of the proceedings. I agree with Mr. Cook that he\u2019s done all that he can do in this case. And you can only play with the hand that you\u2019re dealt. And Mr. Cook has represented Mr. Williams, I think, in the best possible light that someone can represent someone. He hasn\u2019t done anything\u2014or left anything out, that I can see, at least at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The trial court attempted to further inform defendant of the great risks involved with self-representation. For example, the trial court noted that another attorney would not be appointed, defendant could not later claim he was ineffective as his own counsel, defendant had not attended law school, and defendant was not trained in the rules of evidence. Further, the trial court warned that if defendant disrupted the proceedings, Mr. Cook would take over defendant\u2019s representation. The trial court also posed the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Are you making this request knowinging [sic], intelligently, and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The trial court also informed defendant of the charges against him and the possible penalties he faced. Despite this exchange, the following colloquy then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\"><em>The </em>Court:... Do you understand all that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Ma\u2019am, is it also on the record, and it will probably [be] written down, that I will have an opportunity to recross-examine the prosecutor\u2019s first two witnesses, Florian Mager and \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\"><em>The Court: </em>(Interposing) No, we\u2019re not bringing in those other witnesses, we\u2019re continuing with the trial. It\u2019s the Court\u2019s opinion that you had proper representation. Mr. Cook is an excellent attorney. And we are not starting the trial over, we are continuing with the trial. You can still have Mr. Cook, if you want, or you can continue and represent yourself....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s best efforts, defendant continued to articulate his reasons for wanting to recall the first witness. Apparently, defendant remained under the impression that the first witness\u2019s preliminary examination testimony conflicted with his trial testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\"><em>The Defendant: </em>But the jury have heard Mr. Mager only state that at the lineup he was not sure. That\u2019s one not sure. And if, at the preliminary exam, if Mr. Mager is not sure, again, then this man has no\u2014he\u2019s not sure if it was me, or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">The prosecutor then indicated that if defendant was permitted to look at the preliminary examination, his concerns would disappear. While the majority includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>some portions of this exchange, I believe that the proceedings at this particular stage should be viewed in more detail.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\"><em>Mr. King: </em>And I only stand, your Honor, not to entertain the defendant, but that is a gross misrepresentation of the preliminary examination transcript.... What he\u2019s saying he\u2019s taking out of context. And if he reads the whole thing,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">I think he\u2019ll understand why Mr. Cook didn\u2019t elaborate with further questioning of the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. I\u2019m going to .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\"><em>The Defendant: </em>(Interposing) May I read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\"><em>The Court: </em>No. I\u2019m going to ask you one more time. Do you want to represent yourself? Because we\u2019re bringing in the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Your Honor, with all due respect...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\"><em>The Court: </em>(Interposing) I asked you one question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Your Honor, this is my life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you want to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-14\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Your Honor? Please. I\u2019m pleadin\u2019 with you, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-15\"><em>The Court: </em>Answer my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-16\"><em>The Defendant: </em>What\u2019s a little minute in my life? Please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-17\"><em>The Court: </em>Answer my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-18\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-19\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. Let\u2019s bring in the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-20\">After this colloquy, defendant nevertheless attempted to recall the second witness because he was under the impression that the witness had not been excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-21\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b743-22\">In <em>Adkins, </em>this Court concluded that proper compliance with waiver of counsel procedures requires that the trial court \u201cengage, <em>on the record, </em>in a methodical assessment of the wisdom of self-representation by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>defendant.\u201d <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 721 (emphasis added). Moreover, this Court abides by the general principle that a trial court \u201c \u2018 \u201cshould indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver....\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 464. \u201cThe right to counsel, as guarantor of a fair trial, is a fundamental right that should not be deemed waived unless the record clearly and unequivocally evidences such waiver, a record that must be made by the trial judge\u2019s diligent inquiry into the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 740-741 (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Because the record indicates that defendant did not unequivocally, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his right to counsel, defendant\u2019s attempted waiver was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">A. DEPENDANT\u2019S WAIVER WAS NOT UNEQUIVOCAL</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">While the trial court followed the spirit of MCR 6.005(D) and asked defendant if his waiver was made \u201cknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily,\u201d the trial court did not make an express finding on the record that defendant unequivocally waived his constitutional right to counsel. In <em>Adkins, </em>this Court held that trial courts must substantially comply with the requirements of <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 721-722, directs a trial court to indicate on the record whether the attempted waiver is unequivocal. Even under a substantial compliance analysis, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>the trial court in this case wholly failed to indicate whether it believed defendant\u2019s request was contingent on other factors\u2014namely, recalling the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and examining the preliminary examination transcripts\u2014or whether the request was unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">In any event, the record more than adequately demonstrates that defendant\u2019s choice was not unequivocal. The majority states that \u201cinitially, defendant conditioned his waiver of the right to counsel on the trial court\u2019s granting of his request to recross-examine two excused witnesses.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 643. An evenhanded reading of the trial transcripts, however, reveals that despite the trial court\u2019s best efforts, defendant\u2019s waiver was conditional throughout the proceeding. The trial court informed defendant that he would not be able to recall the excused witnesses and then repeatedly asked defendant if he wished to represent himself. In spite of this line of questioning, defendant still expressed his desire to recall the witnesses and review the preliminary examination transcript. As such, a balanced evaluation of the record indicates that although defendant was listening to the trial court, defendant was not hearing what the trial court had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">This Court has previously noted that \u201cthe effectiveness of an attempted waiver does not depend on what the court says, but rather, what the defendant understands.\u201d <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 723. Under the circumstances of this case, it is clear that defendant did not fully comprehend the trial court\u2019s warnings and defendant wavered in his request throughout the proceeding. When the record is objectively viewed, one is left with the distinct impression that defendant eventually surrendered to the trial court\u2019s questioning in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>hopes of introducing evidence that he believed favorable to his case. Thus, defendant\u2019s attempted waiver was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Further, I am puzzled by the majority\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s \u201cunrealistic\u201d hopes did not render defendant\u2019s attempted waiver invalid. <em>Ante </em>at 644. The majority acknowledges that defendant was not truly hearing what the trial court was saying. Further, the majority appropriately notes that defendant\u2019s understanding \u201ccan only be gleaned by reference to what he said on the record.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 644. Upon its review of the record, the majority effortlessly concludes that defendant\u2019s hopes were \u201cunrealistic.\u201d However, defendant nevertheless harbored these hopes and the trial court should have similarly recognized that these \u201cunrealistic\u201d hopes were preventing defendant from hearing what the trial court was saying. <em>Adkins </em>could not be more clear that the effectiveness of the attempted waiver depends on what the defendant understands.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Finally, although the trial court may not have been under any obligation to permit defendant to view the transcripts or recall the witnesses, the trial court erred when it failed to recognize that defendant\u2019s attempted waiver was equivocal. The overarching rule of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Adkins, </em>as well as the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson, </em>is that if there is any doubt about the unequivocal nature of a defendant\u2019s attempted waiver of counsel, then the trial court should deny the defendant\u2019s request and defendant should proceed with counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>B. DEFENDANT\u2019S WAIVER WAS NOT KNOWING, INTELLIGENT, AND VOLUNTARY</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">For essentially the same reasons as detailed above, I cannot lightly assume defendant possessed the requisite state of mind under the facts of this case. Specifically, the record evidences that defendant\u2019s attempted waiver was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Even though the trial court followed the spirit of <em>Anderson </em>and its progeny, the record indicates defendant was fixated on his ability to recall the excused witnesses and view the preliminary examination transcripts. As the hearing was drawing to a close and the trial court was understandably losing its patience, defendant kept pleading for his life. Nevertheless, the trial court continued its questioning and defendant eventually answered affirmatively to the question repeatedly posed. When the record is reviewed fairly, I believe it is apparent defendant\u2019s waiver was not knowing, intelligent, or voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In sum, I agree with the Court of Appeals assessment of the proceedings. Defendant\u2019s attempted waiver was conditional throughout the proceedings. Further, despite the trial court\u2019s best efforts, it was evident that defendant did not fully understand the nature of the trial court\u2019s admonishments. Thus, defendant\u2019s attempted waiver was not unequivocal, knowing, intelli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>gent, and voluntary. I would, therefore, affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b748-6\">KELLY, J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> \u201cThere can be no blinking the fact that the right of an accused to conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this Court\u2019s decisions holding that the Constitution requires that no accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Faretta, supra </em>at 832. \u201cThis Court, however, has found that a defendant has either a right to counsel or a right to proceed in propria persona, but not both. . . . Consequently, there is unavoidable tension created between two constitutional rights when a defendant chooses self-representation.\u201d <em>People v Adkins (After Remand), </em>452 Mich 702, 720; 551 NW2d 108 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\"> MCR 6.005(D) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">The court may not permit the defendant to make an initial waiver of the right to be represented by a lawyer without first</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">(1) advising the defendant of the charge, the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense, any mandatory minimum sentence required by law, and the risk involved in self-representation, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aci-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>(2) offering the defendant the opportunity to consult with a retained lawyer or, if the defendant is indigent, the opportunity to consult with an appointed lawyer.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\"> In <em>Adkins, </em>I agreed that \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the requirements of <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D) adequately protects a defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 737-738 (Cavanagh, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). However, I remain committed to the view that strict compliance with these requirements better protects a defendant\u2019s rights, as well as ensures that an appellate parachute is not created. <em>People v Dennany, </em>445 Mich 412, 456-458; 519 NW2d 128 (1994) (Cavanagh, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\"> It has often been said that \u201c[a]n indigent defendant, entitled to the appointment of a lawyer at public expense, is not entitled to choose his lawyer.

Here, the trial court found that defense counsel provided proper representation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Moreover, defendant did not assert a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
