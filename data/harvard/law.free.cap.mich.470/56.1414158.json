The issue before the Court is whether the prosecutor must establish that a defendant assisted in <em>obtaining </em>or <em>retaining </em>possession of a firearm, the test that was set forth in <em>People v Johnson, </em>411 Mich 50, 54; 303 NW2d 442 (1981), in order to convict the defendant of felony-firearm under an aiding and abetting theory. We overrule <em>Johnson </em>because the test that it created is narrower than the test set forth in the language of the aiding and abetting statute. We conclude that under the statute, the proper standard for establishing felony-firearm under an aid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ing and abetting theory is whether the defendant\u2019s words or deeds \u201cprocure[d], counseled], aid[ed], or abet[ted]\u201d another to carry or have in his possession a firearm during the commission or attempted commission of a felony-firearm offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applying that standard, we hold that there was sufficient evidence in each case to support the felony-firearm convictions, and we affirm both defendants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AtF\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The charges against defendant Clarence D. Moore stem from a shooting in Flint on August 8, 1997. That night, Moore and his friend, DeJuan Boylston, argued with Jacky Hamilton and his brother, Johnny Hamilton. Shortly thereafter, Moore and Boylston approached the Hamilton brothers while they were fishing at a lake. Boylston was carrying a gun, and Moore told the two brothers that they had better start swimming out into the lake. Boylston then recognized Johnny Hamilton from basketball games in the neighborhood. This recognition prompted Boylston to retreat, telling Moore that he did not want a problem with the Hamiltons. According to Johnny Hamilton, after Boylston declined to shoot the brothers, Moore attempted to grab the gun from Boylston. During this time, Moore made derogatory statements to Boylston to encourage him to shoot the victims. He questioned Boylston\u2019s sense of masculinity and threatened that he would not associate with Boylston if Boylston did not shoot the Hamiltons. After walking about halfway up the hill, Boylston turned and fired, hitting Jacky, who later died from the gunshot wound</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Following a jury trial, defendant Moore was convicted of murder in the first degree,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> assault with intent to murder,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and felony-firearm<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on an aiding and abetting theory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed Moore\u2019s convictions on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The charges against defendant Erwin Harris stem from a robbery that took place in Washtenaw County on September 28, 1998. Harris drove Eugene Mays to a gasoline station. Mays had a sawed-off shotgun in the vehicle. Harris first entered the store on the pretense of asking for directions. After leaving the store, he reentered moments later followed by Mays, who was wielding the shotgun. While Mays pointed the gun at the clerk, Harris approached a customer from behind and proceeded to remove the customer\u2019s wallet and other items from his pockets. The clerk refused to give Mays any money and pushed a button that locked the cash register. Although Harris repeatedly directed Mays to \u201cpop,\u201d or shoot, the clerk after he locked the register, the two men left the store without physically harming either the clerk or the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Defendant Harris was convicted by a jury on two counts of armed robbery,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> two counts of felony-firearm<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on an aiding and abetting theory,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>fleeing and eluding the police.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Harris appealed his convictions for the armed robbery of the customer and for the two counts of felony-firearm. In an unpublished, divided decision, the Court of Appeals upheld Harris\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Both Moore and Harris sought leave to appeal in this Court. Each defendant argued that his conviction(s) for felony-firearm under an aiding and abetting theory should be reversed because he did not assist in either obtaining or retaining possession of the firearm, citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson. </em>This Court granted leave to appeal in both cases and ordered that the cases be argued and submitted to the Court together. In each of these cases, the order granting leave to appeal limited the issues to \u201cwhether there is sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of violating MCL 750.227b and whether the decision in <em>People v Johnson, </em>411 Mich 50 (1981), should be overruled or modified.\u201d <em>People v Harris, </em>467 Mich 896 (2002); <em>People v Moore, </em>467 Mich 897 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Resolution of these cases requires interpretation of the felony-firearm statute and the aiding and abetting statute. Statutory interpretation is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Robertson v Daimler-Chrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732, 739; 641 NW2d 567 (2002). If the statutory language is certain and unambiguous, that language is given its ordinary and generally accepted meaning. <em>Piper v Pettibone Corp, </em>450 Mich 565; 542 NW2d 269 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"ako-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>a</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The felony-firearm statute, MCL 750.227b(l), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">A person who carries or has in his or her possession a firearm when he or she commits or attempts to commit a felony ... is guilty of a felony, and shall be imprisoned for 2 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The felony-firearm statute applies whenever a person carries or has a firearm in his possession when committing or attempting to commit a felony. The evident purpose of the statute is to enhance the penalty for the carrying or possession of firearms during the commission of a felony and thus to deter the use of guns. <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>406 Mich 374, 391; 280 NW2d 793 (1979), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>People v Robideau, </em>419 Mich 458; 355 NW2d 592 (1984). The important rationale behind the felony-firearm statute is demonstrated in its unique and severe punishment scheme. Conviction for felony-firearm results in automatic imprisonment, which may not be suspended. The guilty person is also ineligible for probation or parole during the mandatory prison sentence. The felony-firearm prison term must be served before and consecutively to any term of imprisonment for the underlying felony. A second conviction of felony-firearm requires a flat five year sentence, while a third or subsequent conviction requires a flat ten year sentence. MCL 750.227b(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The aiding and abetting statute, MCL 767.39, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">Every person concerned in the commission of an offense, whether he directly commits the act constituting the offense or procures, counsels, aids, or abets in its commission may hereafter be prosecuted, indicted, tried and on conviction shall be punished as if he had directly committed such offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The purpose of the aiding and abetting statute is \u201cto abolish the common law distinction between accessories before the fact and principals so that one who counsels, aids or abets in the commission of an offense may be tried and convicted as if he had directly committed the offense.\u201d <em>People v Palmer, </em>392 Mich 370, 378; 220 NW2d 393 (1974), citing <em>People v Gould, </em>384 Mich 71, 77; 179 NW2d 617 (1970). The phrase \u201caids or abets\u201d is used to describe any type of assistance given to the perpetrator of a crime by words or deeds that are intended to encourage, support, or incite the commission of that crime. <em>Palmer, </em>p 378.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">Aiding and abetting means to assist the perpetrator of a crime. An aider and abettor is one who is present at the crime scene and by word or deed gives active encouragement to the perpetrator of the crime, or by his conduct makes clear that he is ready to assist the perpetrator if such assistance is needed. [21 Am Jur 2d, Criminal Law, \u00a7 206, p 273.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Each defendant argues that his conviction(s) for felony-firearm on an aiding and abetting theory should be reversed because he did not assist in either <em>obtaining </em>or <em>retaining </em>possession of the firearm, citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In <em>Johnson, </em>this Court resolved a division in the Court of Appeals over whether a person who does not actually possess a firearm could be convicted under the felony-firearm statute as an aider and abettor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>Johnson </em>consisted of two separate cases in which each defendant was convicted of felony-firearm on a theory of aiding and abetting. In the first case, defendant Johnson and an accomplice robbed a bar in Detroit. The accomplice held the gun while Johnson took money from the cash register. They then split the money after leaving the bar. In the second case, defendant Tavolacci brought the victim, an undercover narcotics officer, to a pool hall under the pretense of making a drug deal. The defendant\u2019s two accomplices then took the officer to a remote field and attempted to shoot him. The defendant stayed at the pool hall while the attempted murder took place. <em>Johnson </em>resolved the division at the Court of Appeals by concluding that a defendant may be guilty of felony-firearm even if the defendant did not personally possess a firearm during the commission of a felony if the defendant is shown to have aided and abetted another who had such possession. The Court remanded both cases to the respective trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In remanding, the Court added the restriction that to obtain a conviction for aiding and abetting the crime of carrying or possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony, it must be shown that the defendant assisted in <em>obtaining </em>or <em>retaining </em>the possession of the firearm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">To convict one of aiding and abetting the commission of a separately charged crime of carrying or having a firearm in one\u2019s possession during the commission of a felony, it must be established that the defendant procured, coun-selled, aided, or abetted and <em>so assisted in obtaining the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>proscribed possession, or in retaining such possession otherwise obtained. </em>See <em>People v Doemer, </em>35 Mich. App 149; 192 NW2d 330 (1971); <em>People v Francis, </em>71 Cal 2d 66; 450 P2d 591, 75 Cal Rptr 199 (1969).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">In neither of the instant cases does the record show that the defendant assisted the accomplice to obtain or retain possession of the firearm which the accomplice possessed during the commission of the felony. <em>[People v Johnson, supra, </em>at 54 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Under the standard set forth in <em>Johnson, </em>each defendant\u2019s conviction would be reversed because neither defendant specifically aided the principal in \u201cobtaining\u201d or \u201cretaining\u201d the firearm for immediate or eventual possession by the principal during the commission or attempted commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Moore\u2019s accomplice was carrying the gun during the offense. There was no evidence introduced showing that Moore assisted Boylston in either obtaining or retaining possession of the gun. Similarly, Harris\u2019s accomplice was in possession of the weapon at all times, and there is no indication in the record that Harris assisted Mays in obtaining or retaining possession of the gun. The reasoning of the dissent in <em>Harris </em>clearly applies to both defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">There is no proof that Harris carried or loaded the firearm for Mays, that he purchased the firearm and gave it to Mays, or even that he reminded Mays to bring the firearm into the store with him. If Harris did help Mays obtain or retain the firearm before he entered the store, the record is simply silent on the matter. [Unpublished dissenting opinion, issued July 27, 2001, p 4 (Docket No. 222468).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Thus, under <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>holding at 54 that \u201cit must be established that the defendant procured, counselled, aided, or abetted and so assisted in obtaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>proscribed possession, or in retaining such possession otherwise obtained,\u201d both defendants\u2019 convictions of felony-firearm under an aiding and abetting theory would be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">A close examination of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>reveals that this holding was overly narrow because it unnecessarily restricted the scope of the class of persons who can be convicted of felony-firearm on an aiding and abetting theory. The Court relied on two drug possession cases, <em>People v Francis </em>and <em>People v Doemer,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in reasoning that to convict one of felony-firearm under an aiding and abetting theory, \u201cit must be established that the defendant procured, counselled, aided, or abetted and so assisted in obtaining the proscribed possession, or in retaining such possession otherwise obtained.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The <em>Johnson </em>Court\u2019s holding takes the language of the <em>Francis </em>opinion out of context. The <em>Francis </em>court concluded that \u201c[t]he record [did] not show that Francis aided or encouraged [his accomplice] in obtaining or retaining possession of marijuana.\u201d <em>Francis </em>at 72. The actual test that the <em>Francis </em>court articulated for aiding and abetting is much broader than the test set forth in the language quoted in <em>Johnson. </em>The <em>Francis </em>court stated that \u201c \u2018[i]n order to hold the accused as an aider and abettor the test is <em>whether the accused in any way, directly or indirectly, aided the perpetrator by acts or encouraged him by words or gestures.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Francis </em>at 72, quoting <em>People v Villa, </em>156 Cal App 2d 128, 134; 318 P2d 828 (1957) (emphasis added). Thus, the language relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>on by the <em>Johnson </em>Court is not the actual test set forth in <em>Francis </em>for aiding and abetting possessory crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Nothing in the language of Michigan\u2019s felony-firearm statute supports <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>narrow application of aiding and abetting principles to the commission of felony-firearm. In fact, the plain language of the statute suggests otherwise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>People v Mitchell, </em>456 Mich 693, 698; 575 NW2d 283 (1998), this Court noted that the list of four exceptions<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to the statute was exclusive and that the Legislature intended \u201cto provide for an additional felony charge and sentence whenever a person possessing a firearm committed a felony other than those four explicitly enumerated in the felony-firearm statute.\u201d The felony-firearm statute makes no mention of a narrower standard or an exception for those who aid and abet felony-firearm; therefore, aiding and abetting felony-firearm should be no different from aiding and abetting the commission of any other offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Similarly, nothing in the aiding and abetting statute suggests that it should apply differently to a possessory offense than to any other crime. The general rule is that, to convict a defendant of aiding and abetting a crime, a prosecutor must establish that \u201c(1) the crime charged was committed by the defendant or some other person; (2) the defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of the crime; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>and (3) the defendant intended the commission of the crime or had knowledge that the principal intended its commission at the time that [the defendant] gave aid and encouragement.\u201d <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 768; 597 NW2d 130 (1999). The aiding and abetting statute neither expressly nor impliedly limits the persons or crimes encompassed by its terms. The language of the statute applies to \u201cevery person\u201d who commits \u201can offense.\u201d <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>holding, that to convict one of felony-firearm under an aiding and abetting theory it must be established that the defendant assisted in either obtaining or retaining possession of the firearm, is not based on the language of the aiding and abetting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We do not disagree with <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>holding that a felony-firearm conviction is proper if a defendant aided the principal in \u201cobtaining\u201d or \u201cretaining\u201d the firearm while intending that the principal possess or carry the firearm during the commission or attempted commission of a felony, which possession or carrying by the principal occurs. But a defendant also can assist in the commission of a felony-firearm violation in other ways. All that is required to prove aiding and abetting felony-firearm is that the defendant aided and abetted another in carrying or having in his possession a firearm while that other commits or attempts to commit a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Adherence to the <em>Johnson </em>standard has resulted in numerous cases where the intent behind the statutes\u2014to deter the use of firearms during the commission of felonies and to punish one who assists in the commission of an offense as if he had directly committed such offense\u2014has not only been unrealized, but has been subverted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The language of our statutes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>Johnson </em>Court\u2019s misreading of <em>Francis, </em>and appellate cases following <em>Johnson </em>that are incompatible with the statutes all command that this Court overrule the narrow <em>Johnson </em>standard. For these reasons, we overrule <em>Johnson </em>and hold that aiding and abetting the commission of felony-firearm is no different from aiding and abetting the commission of any other felony.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>hi</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Having overruled the narrow standard for aiding and abetting set forth in <em>Johnson, </em>we now apply general aiding and abetting principles to the facts of the cases before us. Under the aiding and abetting statute, MCL 767.39, the correct test for aiding and abetting felony-firearm in Michigan is whether the defendant \u201cprocures, counsels, aids, or abets in [another carrying or having possession of a firearm during the commission or attempted commission of a felony].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The prosecutors must do more than demonstrate that defendants aided the commission or attempted commission of the underlying crimes (here murder and robbery). Rather, the prosecutors must demonstrate that defendants specifically aided the commission of felony-firearm.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Establishing that a defendant has aided and abetted a felony-firearm offense requires proof that a violation of the felony-firearm statute was committed by the defendant or some other person, that the defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted in the commission of the felony-firearm violation, and that the defendant intended the commission of the felony-firearm violation or had knowledge that the principal intended its commission at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that the defendant gave aid and encouragement. <em>Carines, supra, </em>at 768. In determining whether a defendant assisted in the commission of the crime, the amount of advice, aid, or encouragement is not material if it had the effect of inducing the commission of the crime. <em>People v Smock, </em>399 Mich 282, 285; 249 NW2d 59 (1976). It must be determined on a case-by-case basis whether the defendant \u201c \u2018performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted,\u2019 \u201d <em>Carines, supra </em>at 768, quoting <em>People v Turner, </em>213 Mich App 558, 568; 540 NW2d 728 (1995), in the carrying or possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In each of the cases now before us, the prosecutor established that a violation of the felony-firearm statute was committed and that the defendant intentionally aided or abetted that violation. The defendant in each case aided or abetted felony-firearm by actively urging, inciting, encouraging, or motivating the principal to use the weapon that was in the principal\u2019s possession. Implicit in the <em>use </em>of a firearm is the <em>possession </em>of that firearm. Thus, when a defendant specifically encourages another possessing a gun during the commission of a felony to use that gun, he aids and abets the carrying or possessing of that gun just as surely as if he aided or abetted the principal in obtaining or retaining the gun. Moreover, the defendant in <em>Harris </em>encouraged and assisted the principal\u2019s possession of the firearm by specifically relying on that possession to intimidate his own robbery victim and by specifically ensuring that the principal would be able to successfully enter and exit the scene of the crime while carrying the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>PEOPLE V MOORE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In this case, defendant Moore procured, counseled, aided, or abetted the possession of a firearm during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>commission of a felony\u2014the murder of Jacky Hamilton. Although Moore did not \u201cobtain or retain\u201d the gun that killed the victim, nor did he pull the trigger, his words and actions incited Boylston to use the firearm that was in his possession to do exactly that. Moore provoked Boylston to shoot at the victims by attempting to grab the gun away from him and by telling him to \u201cgive me the gun; I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> When Boylston first refused to shoot and turned to walk away from the victims, Moore attacked his sense of masculinity and threatened to dissociate himself from Boylston if he did not shoot the two men. It is clear that Moore\u2019s words and deeds were intended to encourage Boylston to use the gun against the two victims during the commission of a felony. In so provoking and inciting a hesitant Boylston to use the gun that he was carrying, Moore necessarily induced Boylston to possess that gun. Thus, applying the general aiding and abetting standard to the facts of this case, we hold that there was sufficient evidence in the record to establish that defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted in the commission of the felony-firearm violation. Accordingly, we affirm Moore\u2019s felony-firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\n<em>PEOPLE V HARRIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Defendant Harris drove his accomplice, Mays, to the gasoline station. Harris first entered the store and \u201ccased\u201d its interior on the pretense of asking for direc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>tions. He left the store and then promptly reentered, followed by Mays, who was carrying a gun. Although Mays clearly had actual possession of the firearm at all times, Harris specifically used his confederate\u2019s possession of that firearm to intimidate and rob a store customer. Harris also encouraged Mays to \u201cpop,\u201d or shoot, the store clerk when the clerk locked the register and refused to hand over any money. When the attempt to rob the store proved unsuccessful, defendant drove away with his accomplice and the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Harris\u2019s words and deeds, viewed in their entirety, demonstrated his intent to procure, counsel, aid, or abet the possession of a firearm during the commission of the armed robberies. He first \u201ccased\u201d the store, thereby ensuring that Mays could succeed in entering it while carrying a gun. He then relied on May\u2019s possession of the firearm to facilitate his own robbery of the customer. Finally, Harris expressly encouraged Mays to use the firearm in his possession to shoot the clerk after the clerk refused to give the men any money. Thus, Harris specifically aided and abetted the commission of felony-firearm. Accordingly, we affirm Harris\u2019s felony-firearm convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Because we have overruled <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>narrow test for aiding and abetting a felony-firearm in Michigan, we must also note that the pertinent criminal jury instructions for that crime are now invalid. The instructions for felony-firearm under an aiding and abetting theory directly, CJI2d 11.35(6), and indirectly, CJI2d 11.36(6), currently state \u201cthat the defendant intentionally helped the person who possessed the firearm get or keep it.\u201d The new instructions should not include any of the limiting language of <em>Johnson. </em>Just as our new test is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>longer limited to obtaining or retaining the firearm, our jury instructions should likewise not be limited to the language of getting or keeping that firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">There is no foundation in the language of either the aiding and abetting statute or the felony-firearm statute to support this Court\u2019s narrow ruling in <em>Johnson. </em>To the extent that <em>Johnson </em>required a defendant to assist in either obtaining or retaining possession in order to be convicted of felony-firearm under an aiding and abetting theory, that decision is overruled. Following MCL 767.39, the appropriate test for aiding and abetting felony-firearm in Michigan is whether the defendant \u201cprocures, counsels, aids, or abets in [the commission of a felony-firearm offense].\u201d Applying this standard, we hold that there was sufficient evidence in each case to support the felony-firearm convictions, and we affirm both defendants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-6\">Corrigan, C.J., and Young and Markman, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-10\"> MCL 750.227b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\"> MCL 767.39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"an-dedup-0\"> Id</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\"> MCL 750.316.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\"> MCL 750.83.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b148-9\"> MCL 750.227b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b148-10\"> MCL 767.39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b148-11\"> MCL 750.529.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b148-12\"> MCL 750.227b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b148-13\"> MCL 767.39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b149-9\"> MCL 750.479a(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\"> Contrast <em>People v Tavolacci, </em>88 Mich App 470, 475; 276 NW2d 919 (1979), rev\u2019d <em>People v Johnson, supra </em>(\u201c[O]ne may be convicted as an aider and abettor to the felony-firearm offense.\u201d), with <em>People v Bridges, </em>98 Mich App 436, 439; 296 NW2d 275 (1980), rev\u2019d 411 Mich 969 (1981) (A person who does not actually possess a firearm may not be convicted under the statute as an aider and abettor.), <em>People v Powell, 90 </em>Mich App 273, 275; 282 NW2d 803 (1979) (\u201c[T]he language of the felony-firearm statute clearly contemplates \u2018personal\u2019 possession of a firearm by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>defendant.\u201d), and <em>People v Johnson, </em>85 Mich App 654, 658; 272 NW2d 605 (1978), rev\u2019d 411 Mich 50 (1981) (\u201cWe interpret the felony-firearm statute to require that a defendant <em>personally </em>carry or have in his possession a firearm in order to be guilty thereunder.

Therefore, the majority sees fit to overrule <em>Johnson. </em>This conclusory claim, however, is not supported by a reasoned analysis grounded in the statutory language of MCL 750.227b(1) and 767.39.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>i. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">A fundamental flaw in the analysis offered by the majority is that it does not distinguish between a defendant\u2019s actions in aiding or abetting the predicate felony and aiding or abetting felony-firearm possession. The majority correctly states that \u201cthe proper standard for establishing felony-firearm under an aiding and abetting theory is whether the defendant\u2019s words or deeds \u2018procure[d], counseled], aid[ed], or abet[ted]\u2019 another to carry or have in his possession a firearm during the commission or attempted commission of a felony-firearm offense.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 58-59. However, the majority then errs because it does not use this standard in its analysis. The majority finds there was sufficient evidence to convict defendants of felony-firearm possession because they aided or abetted in the commission of a crime. But it does not matter that the defendant procured, counseled, aided, or abetted <em>the commission of a crime. </em>What matters is that the defendant, procured, counseled, aided, or abetted <em>felony-firearm possession. </em>This analytical error permeates the opinion and results in convictions that violate the plain language, as well as the intent, of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>There is a difference between aiding or abetting the <em>use </em>of a firearm and aiding or abetting the <em>carrying or possession </em>of a firearm, yet the majority\u2019s analysis is devoid of this distinction. The majority admits that it was not established at trial that defendants Harris and Moore aided or abetted their respective accomplices in obtaining or retaining a firearm. The majority explicitly states, \u201cUnder the standard set forth in <em>Johnson, </em>each defendant\u2019s conviction would be reversed because neither defendant specifically aided the principal in \u2018obtaining\u2019 or \u2018retaining\u2019 the firearm for immediate or eventual possession by the principal during the commission or attempted commission of a felony.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 65. However, the majority\u2019s analysis does not describe what defendants Harris and Moore did, other than encourage their respective accomplice to <em>use </em>the firearm, to support convictions of felony-firearm possession under an aiding or abetting theory. The majority admits, \u201cThe defendant in each case aided or abetted felony-firearm by actively urging, inciting, encouraging, or motivating the principal to <em>use </em>the weapon that was in the principal\u2019s possession.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 71 (emphasis added). Procuring, counseling, aiding, or abetting the <em>use </em>of a firearm in a predicate felony is not the same as procuring, counseling, aiding, or abetting the <em>carrying </em>or <em>possession </em>of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Regarding defendant Moore, the majority states that Moore incited his accomplice to possess and use the firearm by attempting to grab the gun away from him and attacking the accomplice\u2019s masculinity. \u201cIt is clear that Moore\u2019s words and deeds were intended to encourage Boylston [the accomplice] to <em>use </em>the gun against the two victims during the commission of a felony.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 72 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>I agree that defendant Moore\u2019s attacks on the accomplice\u2019s masculinity encouraged the accomplice to <em>use </em>the firearm. But the majority\u2019s argument that Moore encouraged <em>possession </em>by unsuccessfully trying to take the firearm away is nonsensical. The accomplice already possessed the firearm, and Moore tried to take it away. Moore\u2019s actions did not encourage his accomplice\u2019s possession; Moore was actually encouraging just the opposite. Arguing that Moore\u2019s actions, which sought to divest his accomplice of possession of the firearm, actually <em>encouraged </em>possession defies logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Regarding defendant Harris, the majority states, \u201cHarris expressly encouraged Mays [the accomplice] to <em>use </em>the firearm in his possession to shoot the clerk after the clerk refused to give the men any money.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 73 (emphasis added). The majority also states that Harris \u201crelied on May\u2019s possession of the firearm to facilitate his own robbery of the customer.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 73. As with defendant Moore, the majority adequately explains how defendant Harris encouraged the <em>use </em>of the firearm, yet nowhere in the opinion is it explained how either defendant aided or abetted the <em>carrying </em>or <em>possession </em>of the firearms. In both of these cases what is really being encouraged is the <em>use </em>of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, I am not suggesting we treat a possessory offense differently from any other crime. Nor am I suggesting that we treat aiding or abetting felony-firearm possession differently from any other crime. I am merely applying basic rules of statutory construction and, once again, giving effect to the words used by the Legislature. See <em>Coleman v Gurwin, </em>443 Mich 59, 65; 503 NW2d 435 (1993). The difference between possession and use is not a trivial one, and the fact that the Legislature chose to state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>MCL 750.227b(l) applies only to a \u201cperson who carries or has in his or her possession a firearm when he or she commits or attempts to commit a felony\u201d should not be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">While a defendant can aid or abet felony-firearm possession by physically assisting an accomplice in obtaining or retaining a firearm, there are also other ways to aid or abet an accomplice beyond physical assistance and <em>Johnson </em>does not preclude convictions for nonphysical assistance. A defendant can offer verbal encouragement to an accomplice <em>before </em>the accomplice has possession of the firearm or <em>while </em>the accomplice has possession of the firearm. But to meet the statutory standards, the verbal encouragement must relate to obtaining or retaining possession, not just the use. And while a person must indeed possess a firearm in order to use it, it does not mean that a defendant who encourages the use of a firearm that is already in the possession of an accomplice also encourages possession. Interpreting the statutory language in this manner would essentially make the felony-firearm possession statute a strict liability statute for anyone who commits or participates in a crime with an accomplice who possesses a firearm. A fair reading of the statutory language does not support the majority\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">II. THE REENACTMENT RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The majority also ignores the fact that the Legislature reenacted the felony-firearm possession statute <em>after </em>the <em>Johnson </em>decision, yet the Legislature did not address the alleged \u201cerror\u201d in <em>Johnson. </em>Under the reenactment rule, \u201c[i]f a legislature reenacts a statute without modifying a high court\u2019s practical construction of that statute, that construction is implicitly adopted.\u201d <em>People v Hawkins, </em>468 Mich 488, 519; 668 NW2d 602 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>(2003) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), citing 28 Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction (2000 rev), Contemporaneous Construction, \u00a7 49.09, pp 103-112. The Legislature \u201cis presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it [reenacts] a statute without change . ...\u201d <em>Lorillard, a Div of Loew\u2019s Theatres, Inc v Pons, </em>434 US 575, 580; 98 S Ct 866; 55 L Ed 2d 40 (1978). \u201cThe reenactment rule differs from the legislative-acquiescence doctrine in that the former canon provides \u2018prima facie evidence of legislative intent\u2019 by the adoption, without modification, of a statutory provision that had already received judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>Hawkins, supra </em>at 488, quoting Singer at 107. In overruling <em>Johnson, </em>the majority reaches its desired result by ignoring the actions and intent of our Legislature, as well as the plain language of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">in. IMPROPERLY OVERRULING <em>JOHNSON</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Finally, I must address the majority\u2019s stated <em>hesitancy </em>to overrule <em>Johnson, </em>which was a unanimous opinion of this Court. The majority\u2019s zeal in overruling <em>Johnson </em>cannot, under any definition, be considered <em>hesitancy. </em>Its fervor results in an opinion that <em>admits </em>that the defendants cannot be convicted without overruling <em>Johnson. </em>The majority then offers a justification for overruling <em>Johnson </em>that does not comport with the statutory language used in MCL 750.227b(l) and 767.39. Further, the majority provides no sound example of how a person can aid or abet felony-firearm possession other than assisting in obtaining or retaining the possession of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">While the majority has liberally peppered its opinion with the word \u201cpossession,\u201d merely claiming that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>fendants aided or abetted the possession of a firearm does not make it so. Besides the copious use of the word \u201cpossession,\u201d the majority only supports its decision to overrule <em>Johnson </em>with conclusory statements that <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>test was too \u201cnarrow.\u201d However, the statutory language and the actions of our Legislature belie this erroneous conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent and would reverse the defendants\u2019 convictions for felony-firearm possession because the convictions violate the statutory language of MCL 750.227b(l) and MCL 767.39.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-8\">KELLY, J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\"> MCL 750.227b(l) relates to the carrying or possessing of a firearm when committing or attempting to commit a felony, and states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>A person who carries or has in his or her possession a firearm when he or she commits or attempts to commit a felony, except a violation of section 223, section 227, 227a or 230, is guilty of a felony, and shall be imprisoned for 2 years ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak0\">MCL 767.39 relates to the abolition of the distinction between an accessory and a principal, and states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">Every person concerned in the commission of an offense, whether he directly commits the act constituting the offense or procures, counsels, aids, or abets in its commission may hereafter be prosecuted, indicted, tried and on conviction shall he punished as if he had directly committed such offense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b168-9\">TAYLOR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APd\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I agree with part I of Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s dissent.
