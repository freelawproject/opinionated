We affirm the Court of Appeals decision that Wolverine must obtain local consent but that such consent need not be obtained before the application is submitted to the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Wolverine is an interstate common carrier that constructs, operates, and maintains pipelines used for transporting petroleum products. It planned to construct a twenty-six-mile liquid petroleum pipeline along the Interstate-96 (1-96) corridor, within the right-of-way of the interstate highway. Although the land is under the control and jurisdiction of the state\u2019s Department of Transportation, several miles of the highway are within the city limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">In December 2001, Wolverine, before commencing any work on the project, filed an application with the PSC for approval of its plan. The mayor and the city, as well as Ingham County Commissioner Lisa Dedden, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>were allowed to intervene in the PSC proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The application was treated as a contested case and a hearing was held. The city <em>moved to </em>dismiss the application, arguing that the PSC had no jurisdiction because Wolverine\u2019s application lacked the requisite consent from the city. The PSC denied the motion and authorized the project, finding that the city\u2019s consent was not required to accompany the application. With regard to the reasonableness of the project, the PSC determined that there were no equal protection violations in the route selection and found the project necessary and safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The city appealed to the Court of Appeals. The Court reviewed the plain language of MCL 247.183 and determined that the statute did require local consent before construction began, but not before the applicant sought PSC approval. 257 Mich App 1,16; 666 NW2d 298 (2003). Both sides sought leave to appeal. Wolverine and the PSC asserted that no local approval is required, and the city argued that approval is required during the application stage. This Court granted leave to appeal on both applications. 469 Mich 904 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We review de novo a question of statutory construction. In construing a statute, we are required to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. That intent is clear if the statutory language is unambiguous, and the statute must then be enforced as written. <em>Weakland v Toledo Engineering Co, </em>467 Mich 344, 347; 656 NW2d 175 (2003). We use the same rules of construction both for statutes and for administrative regulations. <em>Soap &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Detergent Ass\u2019n v Natural Resources Comm, </em>415 Mich 728, 756-757; 330 NW2d 346 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The statute that controls this case is MCL 247.183, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">(1) Telegraph, telephone, power, and other public utility companies, cable television companies, and municipalities may enter upon, construct, and maintain telegraph, telephone, or power lines, pipe lines, wires, cables, poles, conduits, sewers or similar structures upon, over, across, or under any public road, bridge, street, or public place, including, subject to subsection (2), longitudinally within limited access highway rights of way, and across or under any of the waters in this state, with all necessary erections and fixtures for that purpose. A telegraph, telephone, power, and other public utility company, cable television company, and municipality, before any of this work is commenced, shall first obtain the consent of the governing body of the city, village, or township through or along which these lines and poles are to be constructed and maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">(2) A utility as defined in 23 C.F.R. 645.105(m) may enter upon, construct, and maintain utility lines and structures longitudinally within limited access highway rights of way in accordance with standards approved by the state transportation commission that conform to governing federal laws and regulations. The standards shall require that the lines and structures be underground and be placed in a manner that will not increase highway maintenance costs for the state transportation department. The standards may provide for the imposition of a reasonable charge for longitudinal use of limited access highway rights of way. The imposition of a reasonable charge is a governmental function, offsetting a portion of the capital and maintenance expense of the limited access highway, and is not a proprietary function. The charge shall be calculated to reflect a 1-time installation permit fee that shall not exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>$1,000.00 per mile of longitudinal use of limited access highway rights of way with a minimum fee of $5,000.00 per permit. All revenue received under this subsection shall be used for capital and maintenance expenses incurred for limited access highways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Wolverine does not here dispute that it is both a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d as that phrase is used in subsection 1 of the statute, as well as a subsection 2 \u201cutility as defined in 23 C.F.R 645.105[.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Definitionally, both subsections are applicable to Wolverine unless something in the statute excludes Wolverine from the reach of one subsection or the other. Wolverine argues that such exclusionary language is found in subsection 1, which, paraphrased, states that any covered utility, including those subject to subsection 2, may use a public road longitudinally within the limited access highway right-of-way if it has local permission before work commences. The company\u2019s construction of this passage is that the quoted phrase serves to remove subsection 2 utilities from subsection 1 rules and thus such utilities must only comply with the requirements of subsection 2. In support of this, Wolverine primarily contends that this reading is the only proper construction because otherwise the language \u201csubject to subsection (2)\u201d would be left without meaning. Because such constructions are to be avoided, and because Wolverine believes its reading gives the phrase meaning, it urges us to adopt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>reading.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline to do so, as did the Court of Appeals before us, because we think the reading urged by the city also gives meaning to and more accurately reflects the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We note that <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001 ed), defines \u201csubject\u201d when used as an adjective in six ways. The most applicable is the fourth definition, \u201cdependent upon something (usu. fol. by <em>to): His consent is subject to your approval. \u201d </em>This definition, in essence, gives to the word \u201csubject\u201d the meaning, \u201cdependent upon.\u201d When used as it is here and in other places in the Legislature\u2019s work, it is clear that the subsections work together,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see, e.g., MCL 15.443, 18.1237, and 168.677. That is, both subsections are applicable because the relevant words in subsection 1, the \u201csubject to\u201d words, do not mean that the requirements of subsection 1 do not apply to those utilities that are covered also by subsection 2. Further, because the Legislature expressly (and uniquely) used the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201cincluding\u201d before the \u201csubject to\u201d phrase, the implication is even stronger that the two subsections are to be read in combination. Thus, subsection 1 means the project cannot go forward without local approval and, not at all incompatibly, subsection 2 means it cannot go forward unless it meets certain construction standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We are aware, and, indeed, Wolverine forcefully argues, that this reading of the statute may facilitate frivolous and potentially crippling resistance from local governments along the route of a utility project. Such an argument, however, misunderstands the role of the courts. Our task, under the Constitution, is the important, but yet limited, duty to read and interpret what the Legislature has actually made the law. We have observed many times in the past that our Legislature is free to make policy choices that, especially in controversial matters, some observers will inevitably think unwise. This dispute over the wisdom of a law, however, cannot give warrant to a court to overrule the people\u2019s Legislature. See <em>Oakland Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Michigan Prop &amp; Cas Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>456 Mich 590, 612-613; 575 NW2d 751 (1998). We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals decision that subsection 1 as well as subsection 2 control and Wolverine is required by MCL 247.183 to get local consent before constructing its pipeline longitudinally in the right-of-way of 1-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Because we find that Wolverine is required to obtain local consent for its project, we must also address the question of when that consent must be obtained. The Court of Appeals found that local consent only has to be secured before work is commenced. Thus, at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the permit from the PSC was sought, proof of local consent did not need to accompany the application. We agree with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We begin our analysis with the statute that unambiguously requires local consent \u201cbefore any of this work is commenced....\u201d MCL 247.183. We note also that the PSC\u2019s applicable rule, 1999 AC, R 460.17601(2) (d), indicates that applications for new construction of utility facilities \u201cshall set forth, or by attached exhibits show, ... [t]he municipality from which the appropriate franchise or consent has been obtained, if required, together with a true copy of the franchise or consent.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The PSC rule only requires utilities to provide proof of local consent if such is required to be obtained <em>at the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>time the application is made, </em>and the statute here does not require it. Thus, we agree with the PSC and the Court of Appeals that proof of local consent need not be filed with the application for this project. Although local consent was not filed with the application, the statute and the rules have been complied with and the PSC proceeded well within its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Concerning the dissent, we offer the following observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">(1) The justices in this majority do not necessarily disagree with the dissent that MCL 247.183, as we construe it here, may be \u201ccumbersome.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 185. Nor, by this opinion, does any justice in this majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>suggest that, had they been in the Legislature, they would have cast a vote in support of MCL 247.183 as it is interpreted here. Nor are the justices in this majority oblivious to the practical difficulties that our interpretation of the law may impose upon utilities such as Wolverine Pipe Line Company. Rather, what we decide today is merely that the language of MCL 247.183 compels a particular result, and the justices of this majority do not believe themselves empowered to reach a different result by substituting their own policy preferences for those of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">(2) Rather than interpreting the language of MCL 247.183, the dissent prefers to divine what it characterizes as the Legislature\u2019s \u201ctrue intent.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 173. This \u201ctrue intent\u201d is not one to be gleaned from the words actually enacted into law by the Legislature, but through reliance on various random facts and circumstances that the dissent selectively picks out from the universe of potentially available facts and circumstances. In contrast, rather than engaging in legislative mind-reading to discern the \u201ctrue intent\u201d of the law, we believe that the best measure of the Legislature\u2019s intent is simply the words that it has chosen to enact into law. Among other salutary consequences, this approach to reading the law allows a court to assess not merely the intentions of one or two highlighted members of the Legislature, but the intentions of the <em>entire </em>Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">(3) The dissent avoids the difficult task of having to read the actual language of the law and determine its best interpretation by peremptorily concluding that MCL 247.183 is \u201cambiguous.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 174. A finding of ambiguity, of course, enables an appellate judge to bypass traditional approaches to interpretation and either substitute presumptive \u201c \u2018rule[s] of policy,\u2019 \u201d see <em>Klapp v United Ins, </em>468 Mich 459, 474; 663 NW2d 447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(2003), quoting 5 Corbin, Contracts (rev ed, 1998), \u00a7 24.27, p 306, or else to engage in a largely subjective and perambulatory reading of \u201clegislative history.\u201d However, as <em>Klapp, </em>relying on the treatises of both Corbin and Williston, concluded, a finding of ambiguity is to be reached only after \u201call other conventional means of [ ] interpretation\u201d have been applied and found wanting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Klapp, supra </em>at 474. Where the majority applies these conventional rules and concludes that the language of MCL 247.183 can be reasonably understood, the dissent, without demonstrating the flaws of the majority\u2019s analysis except to assert that its opinion is not in accord with the \u201ctrue intent\u201d of the Legislature, opines that an \u201cambiguity\u201d exists. An analysis, such as that of the dissent, that is in conflict with the actual language of the law and predicated on some supposed \u201ctrue intent\u201d is necessarily a result-oriented analysis. In other words, it is not a legal analysis at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">(4) In peremptorily reaching its conclusion that MCL 247.183 is \u201cambiguous,\u201d the dissent entirely misstates the standard for discerning ambiguity. The dissent would hasten findings of \u201cambiguity\u201d by courts by predicating these findings on the basis of whether \u201creasonable minds can differ regarding\u201d the meaning of a statute. <em>Post </em>at 174. Especially in the context of the types of cases and controversies considered by this Court\u2014those in which the parties have been the most determined and persistent, the most persuaded by the merits of their own respective arguments\u2014it is extraordinarily difficult to conclude that reasonable minds cannot differ on the correct outcome. That is not, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>has never been, the standard either for resolving cases or for ascertaining the existence of an ambiguity in the law. The law is not ambiguous whenever a dissenting (and presumably reasonable) justice would interpret such law in a manner contrary to a majority. Where a majority finds the law to mean one thing and a dissenter finds it to mean another, neither may have concluded that the law is \u201cambiguous,\u201d and their disagreement by itself does not transform that which is unambiguous into that which is ambiguous. Rather, a provision of the law is ambiguous only if it \u201cirreconcilably conflict[s]\u201d with another provision, <em>id. </em>at 467, or when it is <em>equally </em>susceptible to more than a single meaning. In lieu of the traditional approach to discerning \u201cambiguity\u201d\u2014one in which only a few provisions are truly ambiguous and in which a diligent application of the rules of interpretation will normally yield a \u201cbetter,\u201d albeit perhaps imperfect, interpretation of the law\u2014the dissent would create a judicial regime in which courts would be quick to declare ambiguity and quick therefore to resolve cases and controversies on the basis of something other than the words of the law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the dissent implies that the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Yellow Transportation, Inc, v Michigan, </em>537 US 36; 123 S Ct 371; 154 L Ed 2d 377 (2002), should be read to compel the adoption of his view of how we determine if a statute is ambiguous. We believe this is a misreading of <em>Yellow Transportation. </em>The United States Supreme Court established no rule in <em>Yellow Transportation </em>for determining or resolving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>statutory ambiguity. Moreover, even if the Court had fixed upon a method it chooses to use to determine if a statute is ambiguous, it could not be understood to have superceded the rules that state courts may use in a like undertaking. The United States courts, of whatever sort, when they rule, are of course always respectfully reviewed by state court judges but such holdings are only binding in a narrow range of cases such as, classically, in the construction and meaning of the United States Constitution. Statutory construction techniques are not of this genre. With that distraction clarified, <em>Yellow Transportation </em>should be understood as a narrow holding that stands for the simple proposition that if a federal administrative agency has given a defensible construction to a federal statute that it applied, then all state courts must follow that construction even if alternative constructions are also reasonable. We deal with no such situation in this case, and thus <em>Yellow Transportation </em>is inapposite in all particulars to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">(5) The dissent wrongly asserts that \u201cthe majority fails to construe subsection 1 in light of subsection <em>2 Post </em>at 177. Rather, we assert that \u201csubsection 1 means the project cannot go forward without local approval and, not at all incompatibly, subsection 2 means it cannot go forward unless it meets certain construction standards,\u201d p 161, and further assert that the \u201cincluding, subject to subsection (2)\u201d language in subsection 1 makes \u201cthe implication ... even stronger that the two subsections are to be read in combination.\u201d P 161. It is the dissent that misapprehends the relationship between subsections 1 and 2 by attempting to read these provisions in isolation and concluding that when read in this manner they compel different results and thus are \u201cambiguous.\u201d However, the subsections of MCL 247.183, as with all other provisions of law, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>to be read discretely, but as part of a whole. The dissent errs in first reading these subsections \u201calone\u201d and then asserting that it is reading these subsections \u201ctogether\u201d when it merely combines its \u201calone\u201d interpretations. <em>Post </em>at 177. Rather, to read the law as a whole, it must, in fact, be read as a whole. The interpretative process does not, as the dissent does, remove words and provisions from their context, infuse these words and provisions with meanings that are independent of such context, and then reimport these context-free meanings back into the law. The law is not properly read as a whole when its words and provisions are isolated and given meanings that are independent of the rest of its provisions. This is especially true when, as here, one of these provisions <em>expressly cross-references </em>the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">(6) Therefore, even if the existence of a reasonable disagreement <em>were </em>the standard for identifying ambiguity\u2014which it is not\u2014the dissent\u2019s interpretation of MCL 247.183 is simply not a reasonable one when subsections 1 and 2 are read together, as opposed to being read discretely. It cannot correctly be said that these subsections \u201capply to different entities,\u201d <em>post </em>at 178, when subsection 1 expressly observes that its provisions are made \u201csubject to subsection (2).\u201d Contrary to the mandate of this Court, the dissent fails to \u201cgive effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute surplusage,\u201d <em>State Farm &amp; Cas Co v Old Republic Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002), by essentially ignoring the term \u201cincluding subject to subsection (2)\u201d in its interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">(7) The dissent further asserts that MCL 267.183 is ambiguous because \u201capplication of the statute to the facts has rendered the correct application of the statute uncertain.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 176. It is hard to know what this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>means. While any interpretation of the law is in some sense \u201cfact specific,\u201d the dissent fails to identify <em>why </em>the interpretation of this statute, any more than any other statute, is rendered ambiguous by the instant facts. This majority\u2019s view of the law is that, <em>whenever </em>a public utility constructs a pipeline or other utility project longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way, MCL 247.183 requires that the utility must both obtain the consent of the local governing body (subsection 1) <em>and </em>construct the pipeline in accordance with state and federal standards (subsection 2). Is it the dissent\u2019s view that its interpretation pertains in some instances but not in others? If not, what is the relevance of the dissent\u2019s observation that its interpretation is \u201cfact specific\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">(8) Moreover, even if MCL 247.183 were truly ambiguous, the dissent\u2019s analysis of what it views as the relevant legislative history is altogether unpersuasive. In <em>In re Certified Question (Kenneth Henes v Continental Biomass </em>Ind, <em>Inc), </em>468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003), this Court emphasized that not all legislative history is of equal value, which \u201cresults in varying degrees of quality and utility of legislative history.\u201d There, we stated that examples of \u201cthe highest quality of legislative history that relates to an action of the Legislature from which a court may draw reasonable inferences about the Legislature\u2019s intent with respect to an ambiguous statutory provision\u201d are \u201cactions of the Legislature intended to repudiate the judicial construction of a statute\u201d or \u201cactions of the Legislature in considering various alternatives in language in statutory provisions before settling on the language actually enacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is noteworthy that the dissent fails to rely on legislative history of either type. Instead, the dissent largely relies on the least persuasive form of legislative history\u2014staff analyses\u2014which we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>found are of \u201cconsiderably diminished quality,\u201d and thus \u201care entitled to little judicial consideration in resolving ambiguous statutory provisions . . . <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">(9) Even examining this legislative history on the dissent\u2019s own terms, we are perplexed about how it supports the dissent\u2019s position. For example, the dissent cites the fact that \u201cSB 1008 was passed without a single \u2018nay\u2019 vote in either the House or Senate....\u201d <em>Post </em>at 183. How does this fact, this bit of legislative history, support the dissent\u2019s understanding of the law, i.e., that the Legislature did not intend that utilities must obtain local consent before constructing utility projects in longitudinal highway rights-of-way? How does this demonstrate anything more than that the Legislature unanimously approved the statute being considered today?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Similarly, we believe that the dissent misapprehends the \u201cchanges\u201d in which \u201cthe Department of Transportation and the major state utilities concurred\u201d when SB 1008 was passed. <em>Post </em>at 184. The dissent suggests that the \u201cchanges\u201d concerned the overall effect the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>would have on utility projects constructed in limited access highway rights-of-way. However, when read in context, it appears that the \u201cchanges\u201d concerned only the \u201cminor amendments\u201d made by the House of Representatives to SB 1008 concerning the fee structure for such projects. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In fact, when we look at the most valuable type of legislative history available to us, that is, the actual change in statutory language made by the Legislature in 1994, we find support for our view, rather than the dissent\u2019s. Regardless of the vote count, the change that was enacted turned <em>\u201cexcept </em>longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way\u201d to <em>\u201cincluding, </em>subject to subsection (2), longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way.\u201d We find this legislative action to he a strong indication that the \u201ctrue intent\u201d of the drafters was to <em>include </em>such projects in both subsections, rather than <em>exclude </em>them from subsection 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Finally, while we agree with the dissent that the 1994 amendments were intended to \u201celiminate the ability of the state to deny access to these locations for construction of utility services,\u201d the dissent relies on this statement to support its proposition that \u201c [i]f the [1994] amendment were meant to remove the state\u2019s power to deny access to these locations, it certainly could not have meant to grant this power to local entities .. . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 185. Perhaps, the dissent\u2019s assertion is correct, but it is hardly self-evident. There is nothing that logically impels the conclusion that authority is to be denied the locality if it is to be denied the state. While the dissent, and perhaps some justices in this majority, might question the wisdom of a policy that treats the state and localities differently in terms of the approval required for utility pipeline construction, it is hardly inconceivable that a Legislature com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>mitted to local control or to the principle of subsidiarity might adopt exactly such a policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">(10) The dissent states that \u201c[wjhile the statute does not clearly indicate whether the Legislature intended to require federally defined utilities to obtain local consent, it appears that this lack of clarity is the result of a <em>clerical error </em>and the intent was not to reverse the 1989 elimination of local control.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 183 (emphasis added). What precisely <em>is </em>this supposed \u201cclerical error\u201d? What is the dissent\u2019s basis for assuming such a \u201cclerical error\u201d occurred? What is the evidence in support of the existence of such a \u201cclerical error\u201d? Is the dissent justifying its conclusion that MCL 267.183 is \u201cambiguous\u201d on the basis of a \u201cclerical error\u201d? Or is the dissent, instead, asserting that the legislative history of MCL 267.183 not only can be considered, but that this history can supersede its very language?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">(11) In the end, the essence of the dissent\u2019s analysis is its (perhaps understandable) frustrated assertion that \u201cI cannot believe that the Legislature intended to subject federally defined public utilities to local consent requirements.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 185. This constitutes less a legal conclusion than a statement of discontent with the fact that the Legislature either had a different perspective on pipeline approval than the dissent or it failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>effectively to communicate what the dissent alone knows to be its \u201ctrue intent.\u201d In either case, there is no warrant for this Court replacing the words of the Legislature with those of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We conclude that the plain language of MCL 247.183 requires Wolverine to obtain local consent before beginning construction of its project.

The majority, apparently frustrated with my refusal to follow its lead and use a dictionary while turning a blind eye to reality, has issued a lengthy response to this dissent. While the majority asserts that I substitute my own policy preferences for those of the Legislature, I think it is necessary to note the following in regard to the majority\u2019s approach: \u201cA method of statutory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed, and hence unconstrained, increases the risk that the judge\u2019s own policy preferences will affect the decisional process.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Bedroc Ltd, LLC v United States, </em>541 US_,_; 124 S Ct 1587, 1598; 158 L Ed 2d 338 (2004) (Stevens, J., <em>dissenting).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">This case requires us to examine MCL 247.183 to determine whether defendant Wolverine Pipe Line Company (Wolverine) must obtain permission from plaintiff city of Lansing to construct a gas pipeline longitudinally in the right-of-way of an interstate highway within the city limits. The majority finds no ambiguity in the statute and, thus, holds that Wolverine must obtain local consent before constructing the pipeline. I, on the other hand, believe that the statute is ambiguous and turn to the legislative history accompanying the statute to discern the Legislature\u2019s true intent. A review of the legislative history indicates that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to create a streamlined permit system that would not require consent from each municipality a pipeline crosses. On the bases of the history of the statute itself and of the legislative history recorded when the statute was enacted, I would hold that Wolverine is not obligated to obtain local consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">I agree with the majority that this case involves principles of statutory construction and that in construing a statute, we are required to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. I also agree that legislative intent must be gleaned from the statutory text if the language is unambiguous. However, when a statute is ambiguous, judicial construction is necessary to determine its meaning. <em>In re MCI, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">A statute is ambiguous when reasonable minds can differ regarding its meaning. <em>Id. </em>My dissent in <em>Yellow Freight Sys, Inc v Michigan, </em>464 Mich 21, 38; 627 NW2d 236 (2001) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), rev\u2019d 537 US 36; 123 S Ct 37; 151L Ed 2d 377 (2002), vacated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>remanded 468 Mich 862; 659 NW2d 229 (2003), on remand 257 Mich App 602; 669 NW2d 553 (2003), outlined the generally accepted method for making an ambiguity determination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">[W]hen there can be reasonable disagreement over a statute\u2019s meaning, see <em>People v </em>Adair, 452 Mich 473, 479; 550 NW2d 505 (1996), or, as others have put it, when a statute is capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses, that statute is ambiguous.

[464 Mich 38.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In this case, application of the statute to the facts has rendered the correct application of the statute uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">MCL 247.183, in pertinent part, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">(1) . .. public utility companies ... may enter upon, construct, and maintain ... pipe lines . .. upon, over, across, or under any public road, bridge, street or public place, including, subject to subsection (2), longitudinally within limited access highway rights of way, and across or under any of the waters of this state, with all necessary erections and fixtures for that purpose. A. .. public utility company ... , before any of this work is commenced, shall first obtain the consent of the governing body of the city . . . through or along which these lines and poles are to be constructed and maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">(2) A utility as defined in 23 C.F.R. 645.105[] may enter upon, construct, and maintain utility lines and structures longitudinally within limited access highway rights of way in accordance with standards approved by the state transportation commission that conform to governing federal laws and regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The majority\u2019s statutory analysis begins and ends with the dictionary definition of \u201csubject to.\u201d The majority concludes that \u201csubject to\u201d does \u201cnot mean that the requirements of subsection 1 do not apply to those utilities that are covered also by subsection 2.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 160. While the majority uses a double negative to hedge, I think the more direct statement to be gleaned from the inclusion of \u201csubject to\u201d in subsection 1 and its conspicuous absence from subsection 2 is that subsection 2 utilities may not be \u201csubject to\u201d the requirements of subsection 1. Because subsection 2 utilities are a specific group of federally defined utilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that are subject to regulations beyond those imposed on the broad general utilities in subsection 1,1 think it\u2019is fair to say that the Legislature may have intended to create a regulatory scheme specific to the more-regulated entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Thus, it is unclear whether the requirement in subsection 1, that public utility companies must obtain local consent, applies to a utility, as defined in subsection 2. When reading subsection 1 alone it appears that all public utilities must obtain local consent before constructing pipelines in any public place. When reading subsection 2 alone, however, it appears that federally defined utilities may construct pipelines longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way as long as they comply with the applicable state standards. When the two sections are read together, it is unclear whether subsection 2 utilities must comply with the local consent requirement in subsection 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u201cIt is a well-established rule of statutory construction that provisions of a statute must be construed in light of the other provisions of the statute to carry out the apparent purpose of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201, 209; 501 NW2d 76 (1993). Here, the majority fails to construe subsection 1 in light of subsection 2 and, thus, concludes that the statute is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">I cannot agree that the meaning of MCL 247.183 is clear and unambiguous. A statute is ambiguous if there can be reasonable disagreement over the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>In re MCI, supra </em>at 411. The meaning of this statute is subject to reasonable disagreement. There is a reasonable argument that subsection 2 imposes requirements, in addition to those imposed by subsection 1, on utilities that meet the definition of utility in 23 CFR 645.105, and that are looking to construct lines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-Way. Under this reading of the statute, subsection 2 utilities would be required to obtain local consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">However, there is also a reasonable argument that subsections 1 and 2 apply to different entities and that subsection 2 entities are excepted from the requirements of subsection 1. Because there are at least two reasonable interpretations of MCL 247.183, the statute is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">When a statute is ambiguous, judicial construction is appropriate. <em>In re MCI, supra </em>at 411. As previously stated, it is a maxim of statutory construction that \u201cprovisions of a statute must be construed in light of the other provisions of the statute.. . .\u201d <em>Farrington, supra </em>at 209. In construing subsection 1 in light of subsection 2, I find that the Legislature intended to create a special process for federally defined utilities that wish to construct pipelines longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The statutory and legislative history further supports the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend for federally defined utilities, such as Wolverine, to have to obtain local consent before constructing pipelines longitudinally in limited access highway rights-of-way. When the statute governing construction and maintenance of pipelines was originally enacted in 1925, it did not address longitudinal rights-of-way.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Until 1988, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>longitudinal use of interstate highway rights-of-way required a permit from the Federal Highway Administration. In 1988, the federal regulations were amended to allow use of longitudinal rights-of-way in accordance with federal regulations if such use was permitted by the state. See 23 CFR 645.105.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The Michigan statute was amended in 1989 to reflect this change. 1989 PA 215. The phrase \u201cexcept longitudinally within limited access rights of way\u201d was added to subsection 1, and the Legislature also added subsection 2 to the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Essentially, MCL 247.183(1) provided that certain entities were authorized to construct pipelines upon, over, across, or under any public place, <em>except </em>within limited access highway rights-of-way. In other words, according to subsection 1, Michigan generally did not allow longitudinal use of limited access highway rights-of-way. While general use was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>prohibited by subsection 1, subsection 2 allowed federally defined utilities to obtain a permit to use the rights-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">In 1994, the statute was amended again. 1994 PA 306. The focus of the 1994 amendments was ensuring that it was feasible for utilities to construct in limited access highway rights-of-way. To this end, the fees that could be charged for longitudinal use of limited access highway rights-of-way were adjusted and the nature of the permit system was altered by changing the phraseology of subsection 1. In pertinent part, Senate Bill 1008 looked like this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Sec. 13. (1) Telegraph, telephone, power, and other public utility companies, and cable television companies, and municipalities are- authorized to MAY enter upon, construct and maintain telegraph, telephone, or power lines, pipe lines, wires, cables, poles, conduits, sewers and like OR SIMILAR structures upon, over, across, or under any public road, bridge, street, or public place, except INCLUDING, SUBJECT TO SUBSECTION (2), longitudinally within limited access highway rights of way....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Notably, the word \u201cexcept\u201d was replaced with the phrase \u201cincluding, subject to subsection (2).\u201d In other words, the 1994 statutory amendment changed Michigan from a state that generally did not allow entities to use limited access highway rights-of-way, at least not without a permit, to a state that generally does allow use of limited access highway rights-of-way, even though that use is subject to the requirements contained in subsection 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Before the 1994 amendments, subsection 1 permitted pipeline construction in public areas, but prohibited construction within limited access highway rights-of-way. Subsection 1 also required local consent. Subsection 2, on the other hand, allowed the state Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>of Transportation to issue permits to federally defined utilities to construct pipelines within limited access highway rights-of-way. After the 1994 amendments, subsection 1 still permits construction in public areas, but it also provides that entities may construct pipelines longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way. The second sentence of subsection 1 still requires utilities to obtain local consent. Subsection 2 now states that a utility may construct within limited access highway rights-of-way if the utility pays a fee and conforms to state standards that comport with the federal standards; it no longer requires a state permit from the Department of Transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">While the history of the statute and the amendments themselves provide some insight into the Legislature\u2019s intent, the legislative analyses and the documents contained in the House and Senate committee files provide even more insight. I recognize that this Court has held that <em>\u201ca </em>legislative analysis is a feeble indicator of legislative intent and is therefore a generally unpersuasive tool of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Frank WLynch &amp; Co v Flex Technologies, Inc, </em>463 Mich 578, 587; 624 NW2d 180 (2001). However, this Court more recently recognized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">the benefit of using legislative history when a statute is ambiguous and construction of an ambiguous provision becomes necessary. <em>Stajos v City of Lansing, </em>221 Mich App 223; 561 NW2d 116 (1997); <em>People v Hall, </em>391 Mich 175; 215 NW2d 166 (1974); <em>Liquor Control Comm v Fraternal Order of Eagles, Aerie No 629, </em>286 Mich 32; 281 NW 427 (1938).... Examples of legitimate legislative history include ... actions of the Legislature in considering various alternatives in language in statutory provisions before settling on the language actually enacted. See, e.g, <em>Miles ex rel Kamferbeek v Fortney, </em>223 Mich 552, 558; 194 NW 605 (1923).... By comparing alternative legislative drafts, a court may be able to discern the intended meaning for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>language actually enacted. <em>[In re Certified Question (Kenneth Henes Special Projects Procurement, Marketing and Consulting Corp v Continental Biomass Industries, Inc), </em>468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The \u201cvarious alternatives in language\u201d examined by the Court in <em>Miles </em>were statutory amendments made over a twenty-six-year period. In that case, this Court found it telling that the Legislature eliminated words in 1917 that were added in 1909 and remained through the 1915 amendment. The amendments were to the general election law, which at the time of the election in question required election inspectors to indorse all ballots \u201cin ink or with indelible pencil.\u201d <em>Miles, supra </em>at 553. This Court concluded that the Legislature\u2019s deletion of the words \u201cor with lead\u201d signified legislative intent to remove the possibility of signature with lead pencils. <em>Id. </em>at 558, 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Although the Legislature added and then removed a specific term in <em>Miles, </em>that was not the case here. <em>In this case, </em>the Legislature did not eliminate the possibility of constructing pipelines longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way; rather, it subjected such construction to the requirements of subsection 2 only.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">It is clear from both the text of the statute and the legislative analysis of the 1989 amendment that the 1989 amendment was intended to eliminate local control. Subsection 1 of the 1989 amendment prohibited construction within limited access highway rights-of-way. Thus, the local consent requirements of subsection 1 clearly did not apply to the prohibited actions. See also Senate Legislative Analysis, HB 4767, October 11,1989 (\u201cThe bill would amend Public Act 365 of 1925 ... to authorize the Department of Transportation, rather than local governing bodies, to permit the longitudinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>construction of utility lines ... within limited access highway rights-of-way.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">However, the 1989 amendment of MCL 247.183 is not the language at issue because the most recent amendment of the statute was the 1994 amendment. While the statute does not clearly indicate whether the Legislature intended to require federally defined utilities to obtain local consent, it appears that this lack of clarity is the result of a clerical error and the intent was not to reverse the 1989 elimination of local control. The legislative analysis accompanying the 1994 amendment suggests that the purpose of the amendment was simply to ensure that it was feasible for utilities to use limited access highway rights-of-way. This was accomplished by adjusting the fees for longitudinal use of limited access highway rights-of-way and ensuring that the state standards prevent an increase in highway maintenance costs. See Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 1008, August 3, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The House and Senate journals provide further support for the notion that the Legislature did not intend the amendment to impose a requirement that federally defined utilities obtain local consent. The journals indicate that SB 1008 was passed without a single \u201cnay\u201d vote in either the House or Senate and the only amendments of the proposed bill were to subsection 2, which deals with the fees to be charged for longitudinal use of limited access highway rights-of-way. 1994 Journal of the Senate 1558,1578; 1994 Journal of the House 1639, 1978-1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In addition to the journals, the standing committee records from the Senate Technology and Energy Committee and the discussions regarding the bill on the Senate floor also provide support for the notion that the Legislature did not intend to subject federally defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>utilities to the local consent requirement. The Senate Committee on Technology and Energy held a committee hearing on March 23, 1994. Included in the committee records are the Senate Legislative Analysis, an analysis of the Senate Majority Policy Office, and written testimony of General Telephone and Electronics and the Michigan Department of Transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The analysis from the Senate Majority Policy Office states, \u201cSenate Bill 1008 would amend current law to permit a utility to enter and construct utility services along the longitudinal axis of a limited access highway using standards adopted by the State Transportation Commission. The amendatory language would also eliminate the ability of the state to deny access to these locations for construction of utility services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Senate Bill 1008, which resulted in the 1994 amendments of the act, was introduced by Senator Hoffman. SB 1008 was introduced on February 8, 1994, and sent on to the House of Representatives on April 26, 1994. On June 12, 1994, the bill returned from the House to the Senate with minor amendments and Senator Hoffman explained the bill on the Senate Floor before a vote. He explained that the House of Representatives made two amendments to the bill concerning the fee structure for constructing in limited access highway rights-of-way. He conveyed that the Department of Transportation and the major state utilities concurred in the changes and he urged the Senate members to concur as well.

After reviewing the language used in the statute and the legislative history, I cannot believe that the Legislature intended to subject federally defined public utilities to local consent requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Because I believe that the statute is ambiguous and the true legislative intent was not to require local consent when federally defined utilities wish to construct pipelines longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-5\">KELLY, J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\"> In fact, the majority made the same argument in <em>Yellow Freight </em>that they assert here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">The dissent contends that the statute is ambiguous, asserting that this is demonstrated by \u201cthe several interpretations of its wording advanced by the parties.\u201d If the parties\u2019 conflicting interpretations were the measure of a statute\u2019s ambiguity, then almost every statute litigated would be deemed ambiguous.

The standards shall conform to governing federal laws and regulations and may provide for the imposition of a reasonable charge for longitudinal use of limited access highway rights of way.
