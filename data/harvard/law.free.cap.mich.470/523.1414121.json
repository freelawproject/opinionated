In <em>United States v Leon, </em>468 US 897; 104 S Ct 3405; 82 L Ed 2d 677 (1984), the United States Supreme Court interpreted US Const, Am IV and adopted a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule as a remedy for unreasonable searches and seizures. Under <em>Leon, </em>the exclusionary rule does not bar the admission of evidence seized in reasonable, good-faith reliance on a search warrant ultimately found to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>been defective. The exclusionary rule in Michigan is a judicially created remedy that is not based on the text of our constitutional search and seizure provision, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11. Indeed, records of the 1961 Constitutional Convention evidence an intent on behalf of the people of Michigan to retreat from the judge-made exclusionary rule consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment in <em>Leon. </em>We therefore adopt the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in Michigan. The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct. That purpose would not be furthered by excluding evidence that the police recovered in objective, good-faith reliance on a search warrant. We thus reverse the circuit court\u2019s ruling suppressing the evidence seized pursuant to the defective warrant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">I. UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On September 23, 2001, twelve days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, police officers observed defendant collecting money on a street corner. He was wearing a shirt with the word \u201cFireman\u201d written on it and holding a fireman\u2019s boot. He also carried a firefighter\u2019s helmet and jacket. Defendant told a police officer that he was collecting money for the firefighters in New York, but denied being a firefighter himself. The officers confiscated $238 from defendant along with the firefighter paraphernalia, but did not immediately arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Thereafter, the officers successfully sought a search warrant for defendant\u2019s home. The warrant listed the address as \u201c29440 Hazelwood, Inkster\u201d and authorized the police to seize the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Police/Fire scanner(s) or radios, fire, EMS, Police equipment. Any and all emergency equipment, bank accounts, currency, donation type cans or containers, any and all other illegal contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The search uncovered more firefighter paraphernalia, a firearm, and marijuana. The prosecutor charged defendant with being a felon in possession of a firearm, MCL 750.224f; possession of a firearm during the attempt or commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b; two counts of possession of marijuana, MCL 333.7403(2)(d); and larceny by false pretenses, MCL 750.218.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence, asserting both federal and state grounds, US Const, Am IV; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, which the circuit court granted. The court ruled that the search warrant affidavit did not connect the place to be searched with defendant and did not state the date that the police observed defendant soliciting money. The court thus concluded that the affidavit did not establish probable cause for the issuance of a warrant and dismissed the felon in possession, felony-firearm, and marijuana possession charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The Court of Appeals denied the prosecutor\u2019s delayed application for leave to appeal. Thereafter, we granted leave to appeal, limited to the issue whether this Court should adopt a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Whether Michigan should recognize a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule is a question of law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>this Court reviews de novo. <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>468 Mich 636, 641; 664 NW2d 159 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">A. THE FEDERAL GOOD-FAITH EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In <em>Weeks v United States, </em>232 US 383; 34 S Ct 341; 58 L Ed 2d 652 (1914), the United States Supreme Court held that, in a federal prosecution, the Fourth Amendment barred the use of evidence obtained pursuant to an illegal search or seizure. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">If letters and private documents can thus be [illegally] seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution. <em>[Id. </em>at 393.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In <em>Mapp v Ohio, </em>367 US 643; 81 S Ct 1684; 6 L Ed 2d 1081 (1961), the United States Supreme Court extended the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule to the states. The Court reasoned that because the Fourth Amendment right is enforceable against the states by virtue of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the same sanction, i.e., the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence, must apply to state prosecutions as well as to federal prosecutions. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">In <em>Leon, </em>the Supreme Court adopted a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. In that case, the Court rejected the notion that \u201cthe exclusionary rule is a necessary corollary of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Leon, supra </em>at 905-906. The Court stated that the exclusionary rule is not derived from the text of the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The Fourth Amendment contains no provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands, and an examination of its origin and purposes makes clear that the use of fruits of a past unlawful search or seizure \u201c[works] no new Fourth Amendment wrong.\u201d <em>United States v Calandra, </em>414 US 338, 354 [94 S Ct 613; 38 L Ed 2d 561] (1974). The wrong condemned by the Amendment is \u201cfully accomplished\u201d by the unlawful search or seizure itself, <em>ibid., </em>and the exclusionary rule is neither intended nor able to \u201ccure the invasion of the defendant\u2019s rights which he has already suffered.\u201d <em>Stone v Powell </em>[428 US 465, 540; 96 S Ct 3037; 49 L Ed 2d 1067 (1976)] (WHITE, J., dissenting). The rule thus operates as \u201ca judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u201d <em>United States v Calandra, supra </em>at 348. <em>[Id. </em>at 906.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The Court clarified that whether the exclusion of evidence is an appropriate sanction in a particular case is a separate issue from whether police misconduct violated a person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The Court further stated that whether invocation of the \u201cjudicially created remedy\u201d is appropriate involves weighing the costs and benefits in each particular case. <em>Id. </em>at 906-907. The primary benefit of the exclusionary rule is that it deters official misconduct by removing incentives to engage in unreasonable searches and seizures. The costs, however, include preventing the use in the prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief of trustworthy evidence obtained in reliance on a search warrant subsequently found to be defective. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The Court expressed concern that rigid adherence to the exclusionary rule, particularly when law enforcement officers act in good faith or when their transgressions are minor, \u201coffends basic concepts of the criminal justice system\u201d and breeds contempt for the law and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>administration of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 907-908. Thus, the Court recognized the potential for the exclusionary rule to impede the truth-seeking function of the judiciary, resulting in guilty parties either evading punishment altogether or receiving favorable plea bargains. The Court concluded that \u201cthe marginal or nonexistent benefits produced by suppressing evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant cannot justify the substantial costs of exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Central to the Court\u2019s reasoning was the exclusionary rule\u2019s purpose of deterring police misconduct. The Court opined that no deterrence occurs when police reasonably rely on a warrant later found to be deficient. <em>Id. </em>at 916-919.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">In short, where the officer\u2019s conduct is objectively reasonable, \u201cexcluding the evidence will not further the ends of the exclusionary rule in any appreciable way; for it is painfully apparent that... the officer is acting as a reasonable officer would and should act in similar circumstances. Excluding the evidence can in no way affect his future conduct unless it is to make him less willing to do his duty.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 919-920, quoting <em>Stone, supra </em>at 539-540 (White, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The Court stated that this is particularly true when a law enforcement officer acts within the scope of, and in objective, good-faith reliance on, a search warrant obtained from a judge or magistrate. Excluding the evidence recovered in such cases would have no deterrent effect on the officer. <em>Id. </em>at 920-921.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The Court rejected the notion that a purpose of the exclusionary rule is to rectify the errors of judges and magistrates. It stated that no evidence exists that judges and magistrates are inclined to ignore the Fourth Amendment or that the extreme sanction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>exclusion is necessary for \u201clawlessness\u201d among judges and magistrates. <em>Id. </em>at 916. The Court could discern no basis for believing that exclusion of evidence would have a significant deterrent effect on an issuing judge or magistrate because they are not \u201cadjuncts to the law enforcement team.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The Court concluded that the exclusionary rule should be employed on a case-by-case basis and only where exclusion would further the purpose of deterring police misconduct. The Court emphasized, however, that a police officer\u2019s reliance on a magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination and on the technical sufficiency of a warrant must be objectively reasonable. Evidence should also be suppressed if the issuing magistrate or judge is misled by information in the affidavit that the affiant either knew was false or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth. Further, the Court stated that the good-faith exception does not apply where the magistrate wholly abandons his judicial role or where an officer relies on a warrant based on an affidavit \u201c \u2018so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 923, quoting <em>Brown v Illinois, </em>422 US 590, 610; 95 S Ct 2254; 45 L Ed 2d 416 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">B. THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE IN MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Five years after the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Weeks, </em>this Court decided <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>Marxhausen, </em>204 Mich 559; 171 NW 557 (1919). In <em>Marxhausen, </em>this Court examined the language of Michigan\u2019s then-existing search and seizure provision, Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">The person, houses, papers and possessions of every person shall be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">This Court stated that the above provision was \u201cin effect the same provision found in the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Marxhausen, supra </em>at 562. This Court then reviewed federal case law, including <em>Weeks, </em>and concluded that Michigan would follow the federal exclusionary rule. <em>Id. </em>at 568-574. Thus, long before the <em>Mapp </em>Court required the states to follow the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule, this Court elected to follow the exclusionary rule in Michigan. This Court did not, however, base its decision on the language of the Michigan Constitution. In fact, nowhere in <em>Marxhausen </em>did this Court opine that <em>the language of our Constitution </em>required the exclusion of evidence seized in violation of our constitutional provisions. Rather, the <em>Marxhausen </em>Court followed the exclusionary rule as a matter of policy preference in favor of the federal law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, similar to the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule, our exclusionary rule in Michigan is purely a common-law, judge-made rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Notwithstanding the <em>Leon </em>Court\u2019s adoption of the federal good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, to date, this Court has not recognized a similar state exception. The United States Supreme Court has stated, however, that the states are free to impose higher standards on searches and seizures than the Fourth Amendment requires. <em>Cooper v California, </em>386 US 58, 62; 87 S Ct 788; 17 L Ed 2d 730 (1967). Thus, the question arises whether Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 ll<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides more search and seizure protection than does its federal counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>In interpreting our Constitution, we are not bound by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the United States Constitution, even where the language is identical.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Harvey v Michigan, </em>469 Mich 1, 6 n 3; 664 NW2d 767 (2003). Conversely, we are free to interpret our Constitution consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the United States Constitution unless a compelling reason precludes us from doing so. As this Court stated in <em>Sitz v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>443 Mich 744, 758; 506 NW2d 209 (1993), however, a \u201c \u2018compelling reason\u2019 should not be understood as establishing a conclusive presumption artificially linking state constitutional interpretation to federal law.\u201d Rather, we must determine what law \u201c \u2018the people have made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at. 759, quoting <em>People v Harding, </em>53 Mich 481, 485; 19 NW 155 (1884). The following factors are relevant in determining whether a compelling reason exists to interpret the Michigan Constitution and the United States Constitution differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">1) [T]he textual language of the state constitution, 2) significant textual differences between parallel provisions of the two constitutions, 3) state constitutional and common-law history, 4) state law preexisting adoption of the relevant constitutional provision, 5) structural differences between the state and federal constitutions, and 6) matters of peculiar state or local interest. <em>[People v Collins, </em>438 Mich 8, 31 n 39; 475 NW2d 684 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The above factors are also helpful in determining the intent of the ratifiers with respect to our state constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>In <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196; 341 NW2d 439 (1983) (opinion by BRICKLEY, J.), this Court examined the circumstances surrounding the creation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 to determine whether the provision provided a higher degree of search and seizure protection than the Fourth Amendment. See also <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 752-757. In <em>Nash, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">The focus of the Michigan Constitutional Convention of 1961 was on the effect of <em>Mapp </em>on the third sentence of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] The Committee on Declaration of Rights, Suffrage, and Elections proposed that the final sentence of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10 be deleted in favor of the phrase \u201cEvidence obtained in violation of this section shall not be used except as authorized by law.\u201d The committee reasoned that the broad holding of <em>Mapp </em>may have invalidated the final sentence of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10. The merits of that sentence were also considered by the committee. The committee added the phrase \u201cexcept as authorized by law\u201d because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201cShould the definition of the federal limits imposed on the States with respect to the admissibility of evidence change in the future, the Michigan Legislature and the Michigan courts could incorporate, in statute and court decisions, those rules with respect to the admissibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>evidence which reflect the opinion of the Legislature and the Michigan courts as to what ought to constitute sound practice in this State, subject only to the continuing recognition of the limits set by federal constitutional supremacy.\u201d Committee Proposals and Reports, Constitutional Convention 1961, Supporting Report, Committee Proposal No 15, pp 7, 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">It therefore appears that the committee was attempting to allow for the possibility of a less stringent application of the exclusionary rule if allowed by federal law, rather than attempting to strengthen Michigan search and seizure protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">The debates of the committee of the whole at the convention considered both the merits of, and the effect of <em>Mapp </em>on, Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10. See 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 464-484, 488-533, 674-688. The view that <em>Mapp </em>was limited to searches of dwellings and that a limitation on the exclusionary rule was proper on the merits carried the day. Attempts to unite Michigan and United States search and seizure law by adopting the exact language of the Fourth Amendment in the proposed Michigan Constitution were defeated. Instead, the anti-exclusionary-rule proviso of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10 was amended back in to the proposed constitution. 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 531-688. Ultimately, language substantially similar to that of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10, as amended, was adopted by the convention and recommended to the people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">The convention\u2019s address to the people stated that proposed Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 was \u201cNo change from Sec. 10, Article II, of the present constitution except for improvement in phraseology.\u201d 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 3364. Indeed, the common understanding of the people upon reading the proposed constitutional provision could be nothing but the belief that the search and seizure provision of the new constitution represented no change. There had been no substantive alterations. <em>There is no indication that in readopting the language of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10 in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 the people of this state wished to place restrictions on law </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>enforcement activities greater than those required by the federal constitution. In fact, the contrary intent is expressed. [Nash, supra </em>at 211-213; quoted also at <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 754-756 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The <em>Nash </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">Though the people of the State of Michigan have corrected this Court when they have believed it to have gone too far, the historical general power of this Court to construe the constitutional provision relating to searches and seizures has not been removed. The history of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, and its plain import, however, suggest that its further expansion, with the concomitant expansion of the exclusionary rule to enforce it, should occur only when there is a compelling reason to do so. <em>[Nash, supra </em>at 214.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Thus, it is clear from the records of the constitutional convention that the people favored less stringent search and seizure protections than required under the Fourth Amendment at that time. Approval of the antiexclu-sionary clause evidenced the people\u2019s intent to move away from the exclusionary rule of <em>Marxhausen </em>and <em>Mapp </em>as a matter of state constitutional law and to restrict application of the judicially created, remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The text of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 itself is consistent with the above conclusion that the people intended to retreat from the exclusionary rule. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">The person, houses, papers and possessions of every person shall be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to bar from evidence in any criminal proceeding any narcotic drug, firearm, bomb, explosive or any other dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>weapon, seized by a peace officer outside the curtilage of any dwelling house in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The antiexclusionary clause, i.e., the last sentence quoted above, precludes this Court from excluding from evidence any of the enumerated items. This clause does not constrain this Court\u2019s authority regarding items not specifically enumerated in the provision. In other words, the directive of the people that this Court may not exclude certain evidence does not require the exclusion of all other evidence. The antiexclusionary proviso should be viewed not as a ratification of the common-law exclusionary rule regarding items enumerated in the proviso, but, rather, as a restriction on this Court\u2019s authority to apply the judge-made rule to those enumerated items. Because the proviso does not restrict this Court\u2019s authority regarding evidence not enumerated in the antiexclusionary clause, this Court remains free to repudiate or modify the exclusionary rule by virtue of the fact that it is a judicially created rule, not a constitutional rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Under the above authority, we are free to retain, modify, or retreat from the <em>Marxhausen </em>rule altogether. Because we find the reasoning of <em>Leon </em>persuasive, we choose to embrace <em>Leon </em>as a matter of our interpretive right under the common law and retreat from the judicially created exclusionary rule announced in <em>Marx-hausen. </em>The goal of the exclusionary rule, as expressed in <em>Leon, </em>is to deter police misconduct. <em>Leon, supra </em>at 906-907; see also <em>People v Hawkins, </em>468 Mich 488, 510-511; 668 NW2d 602 (2003); <em>People v Sobczak-Obetts, </em>463 Mich 687, 711 n 19; 625 NW2d 764 (2001). Thus, the goal of the exclusionary rule would not be furthered where police officers act in objectively reasonable good-faith reliance on a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"Az9p\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Our dissenting colleagues rely on several <em>pre-Leon </em>cases in contending that deterring police misconduct is not the only purpose of the exclusionary rule. <em>Post </em>at 562. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Leon, </em>however, stated that \u201cthe exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.\u201d <em>Leon, supra </em>at 916. Further, the Court directed \u201cthat suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 918. Thus, in determining whether to apply the exclusionary rule, the proper focus is on the deterrent effect on law enforcement officers, if any. \u201cIf exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect, therefore, it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, while the exclusionary rule may have had other purposes ascribed to it before <em>Leon, </em>the <em>Leon </em>Court effectively narrowed the focus of the rule as a remedy for police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Further, the <em>Leon </em>Court rejected the notion that the exclusionary rule is an effective tool in remedying the errors of judges and magistrates and deterring violations of the Fourth Amendment generally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">To the extent that proponents of exclusion rely on its behavioral effects on judges and magistrates in these areas, their reliance is misplaced. First, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates. Second, there exists no evidence suggesting that judges and magistrates are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment or that lawlessness among these actors requires application of the extreme sanction of exclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Third, and most important, we discern no basis, and are offered none, for believing that exclusion of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant will have a significant deterrent effect on the issuing judge or magistrate. Many of the factors that indicate that the exclusionary rule cannot provide an effective \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cgeneral\u201d deterrent for individual offending law enforcement officers apply as well to judges or magistrates. And, to the extent that the rule is thought to operate as a \u201csystemic\u201d deterrent on a wider audience, it clearly can have no such effect on individuals empowered to issue search warrants. Judges and magistrates are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team; as neutral judicial officers, they have no stake in the outcome of particular criminal prosecutions. The threat of exclusion thus cannot be expected significantly to deter them. <em>[Leon, supra </em>at 916-917.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The reasoning of <em>Leon </em>is persuasive. If judges and magistrates are \u201cneutral and detached,\u201d the exclusion of evidence would have no deterrent effect on their practices. Because the exclusionary rule would not deter judicial errors, the purpose of the rule would not be served by requiring exclusion in all cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Neither the text of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 nor the history of the provision ascribes broader protections to our constitutional provision than the Fourth Amendment requires. In fact, examination of the 1961 Constitutional Convention reveals that the delegates favored a less stringent application of the exclusionary rule at that time, but felt constrained by <em>Mapp </em>to limit the antiexclusionary clause to searches occurring outside the curtilage of a dwelling. <em>Nash, supra </em>at 212-213. As this Court recognized in <em>Nash, </em>there is no indication that by adopting Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 and adhering to the <em>language of </em>Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10, as amended, the people sought to place restrictions on law enforcement activity greater than those under the Fourth Amendment. \u201cIn fact, the contrary intent is expressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213. The intent of the delegates in 1961 is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s adoption of the good-faith exception in <em>Leon, </em>and the text of the Constitution is consistent with recognizing that exception. Because the exclusionary rule in Michigan is a judicially created, nonbinding rule, we interpret Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 consistent with the <em>Leon </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment and adopt the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in Michigan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>C. APPLICATION OF THE GOOD-FAITH EXCEPTION IN THIS CASE <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Applying the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in this case, we conclude that the circuit court erred by suppressing the marijuana, firearm, and firefighter paraphernalia. The police officers\u2019 reliance on the district judge\u2019s determination of probable cause and on the technical sufficiency of the search warrant was objectively reasonable. The information in the affidavit was not false or misleading, and the issuing judge did not \u201cwholly abandonO\u201d her judicial role. See <em>Leon, supra </em>at 923. A review of the affidavit and search warrant can lead to no other logical conclusion than that the address listed was that of defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>it probably did not even occur to the magistrate or executing officers that the address was not defendant\u2019s address. Further, the affidavit was not \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id,., </em>quoting <em>Brown, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Although the warrant was later determined to be deficient, excluding the evidence recovered in good-faith reliance on the warrant would not further the purpose of the exclusionary rule, i.e., to deter police misconduct. Because the exclusionary rule should be employed on a case-by-case basis and only when exclusion would further the purpose of the rule, it should not be employed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We adopt the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in Michigan. The purpose of the rule, i.e., deterring police misconduct, would not be served by applying the exclusionary rule in this case because the police officers\u2019 good-faith reliance on the search warrant was objectively reasonable. Thus, the officers committed no wrong that exclusion of the evidence would deter. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s ruling suppressing the evidence and remand for reinstatement of the charges against defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b632-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Weaver, Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Corrigan, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\"> The court did not dismiss the misdemeanor charge of larceny hy false pretenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-10\"> 467 Mich 939 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\"> In <em>Arizona v Evans, </em>514 US 1, 14-16; 115 S Ct 1185; 131 L Ed 2d 34 (1995), the Supreme Court followed <em>Leon </em>and held that a court employee\u2019s clerical error did not warrant the exclusion of evidence.

It must be understood that this overwrought language stands in support of the following proposition, which is found nowhere in either the Michigan Constitution or the United States Constitution, <em>to wit, </em>no matter how much good faith is demonstrated by the police in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>conduct of a criminal investigation, no matter how slight an imperfection in such investigation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> no matter how serious the crime under investigation, and no matter how indispensable the evidence obtained during the investigation in determining the truth of who perpetrated a crime, the prosecutor, in carrying out his responsibilities on behalf of the people of Michigan, must proceed to trial without that evidence. That is, the prosecutor must proceed to trial (if that is even possible after evidence has been excluded) as though the dead body in the basement did not exist, as though the illegal firearm under the sofa was never really there, and as though the incendiary materials in the garage were merely a figment of one\u2019s imagination, in the process requiring that a jury of defendant\u2019s peers\u2014a jury comprised of twelve citizens brought together for the sole purpose of exercising their judgment and common sense in order to determine the truth of a criminal charge\u2014render an accurate and just verdict while being deprived of what may well be the most relevant available evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">In urging such a justice system, the dissent also gives little consideration to the effect that decision-making by a blindfolded jury has upon public confidence in the integrity of a process viewed by the people, correctly, as indispensable in carrying out the first responsibility of government\u2014the maintenance of what the Constitution of the United States describes as \u201cdomestic tranquility.\u201d The dissent\u2019s denunciation of the majority is in defense of a justice system in which <em>more </em>juries will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>deprived of <em>more </em>evidence, and, therefore, in which <em>more </em>juries will render <em>more </em>verdicts in which guilt or innocence is determined inaccurately. The dissent\u2019s denunciation is also in defense of a system in which <em>more </em>citizens serving on <em>more </em>juries will perform their civic obligation only to learn afterward, for the first time, that they have been deprived of access to facts and evidence that might have been determinative in their decisions. The attitude of these jurors, as well as the attitude of victims, witnesses, and the public, toward a system of justice in which the government\u2019s ability to carry out its responsibility of protecting the people from criminals is compromised by such a cavalier attitude toward evidence can only be imagined.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">While the exclusion of evidence may, under exceptional circumstances, be constitutionally compelled, where it is not compelled\u2014as the United States Supreme Court has determined to be the case where the police have carried out their responsibilities in good faith\u2014it is hardly self-evident why the people of our State would wish to have more, rather than fewer, critical decisions of guilt or innocence decided by jurors who each has one of his hands tied behind his back. Evidence is the lifeblood of the criminal justice process, and it is indispensable in ensuring fair and just determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Concerning what furthers \u201ccitizen protections\u201d under our Constitution, the dissent\u2019s dismissive conclusion that Michigan has \u201cmanaged to exist for decades with the exclusionary rule and our streets have yet to become teeming with criminals released on \u2018technicalities,\u2019 \u201d <em>post </em>at 568, belies that there <em>is </em>a real, but uncertain, number of criminals on our streets who have gone either unprosecuted, prosecuted on lesser charges, or unconvicted, because evidence has been withheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>from a jury. That is an undeniable and logical reality of an exclusionary rule that pertains even to good-faith errors on the part of the police. While perhaps the extent to which our streets are or are not \u201cteeming\u201d with criminals who would have been incarcerated but for the absence of a good-faith exception cannot be precisely calculated, rates of violent crime have, in fact, grown enormously over recent decades.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Had our parents and grandparents, at the time of the inception of an exclusionary rule in Michigan lacking a good-faith exception, been able to look into their future and compared levels of violent crime then and now, it is quite certain that <em>they </em>would have viewed many of our streets today as \u201cteeming\u201d with crime. Doubtlessly, however, the people of Michigan will continue to \u201cmanage to exist\u201d at whatever levels of crime are contributed to by individual criminal justice decisions of the courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Despite the hyperbolic rhetoric of the dissent, the rights of criminal defendants have remained well-protected, both in the federal system and in those growing numbers of states in which the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule has been adopted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the other hand, the rights of everyone else, and of society generally, have been <em>better </em>protected because the criminal justice system has been allowed to assess a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on the basis of the full range of relevant evidence. And, as a result, in some unknown, but very real, number of cases, criminal defendants, who, under the dissent\u2019s approach, would have been left on the streets to continue to prey upon their communities, have been convicted of serious crimes on the basis of trustworthy evidence and after full due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The dissent asserts that it is \u201cunclear how an allegedly increasing crime rate is relevant in determining our citizens\u2019 constitutional rights.. . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>568. That is, of course, neither my position nor that of the majority. Increasing crime rates have been cited only in response to the dissent\u2019s suggestions that there are no adverse consequences to its position and that Michigan has \u201cmanaged to exist\u201d despite the absence of a good-faith exception. More accurately, my position is that the absolutist exclusionary rule of the dissent\u2019s constitution, has little to do with the exclusionary rule of the constitutions that actually prevail in the United States and Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The dissent seems agitated that this concurrence would invoke such considerations as the impact of the dissent\u2019s rule upon crime, the absence of deterrent effect of the dissent\u2019s rule on police misconduct, and the adverse impact of the dissent\u2019s rule upon the integrity of the justice system. These considerations allegedly are in contrast to the dissent\u2019s more focused concern about the Constitution. The problem with this analysis is that the dissent\u2019s constitution is not that of James Madison,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> not that of the United States Supreme Court, and not that ratified by the people of Michigan. Rather, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>United States Supreme Court has made clear that the exclusionary rule is of \u201cquasi-constitutional\u201d dimension and that its applicability in particular contexts is a function of a variety of pragmatic and balancing considerations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the dissent is entitled to its view that the rule should be applied more broadly, and contain fewer exceptions, the dissent should not confuse its own views with those of either the United States Constitution or the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Among other limitations on the exclusionary rule, the United States Supreme Court has concluded that the rule does not apply retroactively unlike most rules that are constitutional, <em>Linkletter v Walker, </em>381 US 618; 85 S Ct 1731; 14 L Ed 2d 601 (1965); the rule does not apply to those lacking standing, <em>Alderman v United States, </em>394 US 165; 89 S Ct 961; 22 L Ed 2d 176 (1969); the rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings, <em>United States v Calandra, </em>414 US 338; 94 S Ct 613; 38 L Ed 2d 561 (1974); the rule does not apply to civil proceedings, <em>United States v Janis, </em>428 US 433; 96 S Ct 3021; 49 L Ed 2d 1046 (1976); the rule does not apply to deportation proceedings, <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service v Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 US 1032; 104 S Ct 3479; 82 L Ed 2d 778 (1984); the rule does not apply where the unlawfully seized evidence is used against a parolee in parole revocation hearings, <em>Pennsylvania Bd of Probation v Scott, </em>524 US 357; 118 S Ct 2014; 141 L Ed 2d 344 (1998); the rule does not apply where evidence is used to impeach a defendant in a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>proceeding, <em>James v Illinois, </em>493 US 307; 110 S Ct 648; 107 L Ed 2d 676 (1990); the rule does not apply in the context of habeas corpus relief where the state has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of the Fourth Amendment claim, <em>Stone v Powell, </em>428 US 465; 96 S Ct 3037; 49 L Ed 2d 1067 (1976); the rule does not apply where the police have acted in objectively reasonable reliance upon a statute that is subsequently declared unconstitutional, <em>Illinois v Krull, </em>480 US 340; 107 S Ct 1160; 94 L Ed 2d 364 (1987); the rule does not apply if the government can be said to have also discovered the evidence through independent means, <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co v United States, </em>251 US 385; 40 S Ct 182; 64 L Ed 319 (1920); the rule does not apply if the connection between the illegality and the seizure has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint, <em>Nardone v United States, </em>308 US 338; 60 S Ct 266; 84 L Ed 307 (1939); the rule does not apply where the evidence would at some future time likely have been discovered, <em>Nix v Williams, </em>467 US 431; 104 S Ct 2501; 81 L Ed 2d 377 (1984); the rule does not apply where the police have in good faith relied upon a defective warrant, <em>United States v Leon, </em>468 US 897; 104 S Ct 3405; 82 L Ed 2d 677 (1984); <em>Massachusetts v Sheppard, </em>468 US 981; 104 S Ct 3424; 82 L Ed 2d 737 (1984); and the rule does apply, even with respect to substantial and deliberate violations of the Fourth Amendment, only \u201cin the absence of a more efficacious sanction... <em>Franks v Delaware, </em>438 US 154; 98 S Ct 2674; 57 L Ed 2d 667 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">\u201cNeither [these] cases nor any others hold that anything which deters illegal searches is thereby commanded by the Fourth Amendment. The deterrent values of preventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated have been considered sufficient to justify the suppression of probative evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>dence even though the case against the defendant is weakened or destroyed. We adhere to that judgment. But we are not convinced that the additional benefits of extending the exclusionary rule to other defendants would justify further encroachment upon the public interest in prosecuting those accused of crime and having them acquitted or convicted on the basis of all the evidence which exposes the truth.\u201d <em>Alderman, supra </em>at 174-175.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\u201cDespite its broad deterrent purpose, the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons. As with any remedial device, the application of the rule has been restricted to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.\u201d <em>Calandra, supra </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\u201cIn deciding whether to extend the exclusionary rule to grand jury proceedings, we must weigh the potential injury to the historic role and functions of the grand jury against the potential benefits of the rule as applied in this context.

The dissent would combine an exclusionary rule that is broad in its coverage, failing to exclude \u201cnarcotic drugs, firearms, bombs, explosives [and] any other dangerous weapons,\u201d with an exclusionary rule that is narrow in its exceptions, most importantly lacking a good-faith exception.

What all the dissent\u2019s unrestrained language cannot obscure, however, is that it offers little in the way of response to the principal arguments set forth in the majority and concurring opinions: (1) an exclusionary rule without a good-faith exception is not mandated by either the United States Constitution or the Michigan Constitution; (2) the costs of an exclusionary rule without a good-faith exception are enormously high, while the benefits are virtually nonexistent; and (3) the exclusionary rule that has existed in the United States and in Michigan, unlike that preferred by the dissent, has always taken into consideration a balancing of costs and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">One doubtlessly would search in vain over the past twenty-two years for similar language from other dissenting justices of this Court whose opposition to my dissenting colleague\u2019s criminal justice decisions, and whose opposition to the direction in which his decisions took this Court and the Michigan Constitution for many years, was no less deeply felt than that of my dissenting colleague.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-5\"> While the dissent asserts that the imperfection in this case is <em>not </em>slight, in truth, it is not relevant to the dissent whether it is slight or not because, under the dissent\u2019s view, <em>whatever </em>the magnitude of the imperfection, the evidence must he excluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-4\"> The dissent is, of course, correct that crime rates do not uniformly proceed upward or downward. <em>Post </em>at 568 n 9.

This can be confirmed by a cursory analysis of Bureau of Justice Statistics or FBI Uniform Crime figures.

If, from the perspective of the dissent, the cost of the majority position is the loss of constitutional protections, from the perspective of the majority, the cost of the dissent\u2019s position is that, absent any constitutional imperative and absent any conceivable impact in deterring unconstitutional searches or seizures, the dissent\u2019s position would result in more violent offenders populating our streets. Certainly, this is not a consequence that is intended or desired by the dissenting justices, but it nonetheless would be the inevitable consequence of their position. There is no free lunch for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>dissent. It is entitled to argue its positions, but it is no more immune than the majority from accountability and responsibility for these positions.

One of the virtues of enacting such alternative remedies is that they would compensate not only persons with respect to whom evidence of a crime has been discovered, but also those with respect to whom no such evidence has been discovered hut who have nonetheless been the victims of Fourth Amendment violations.

Today, the majority has chosen to ignore Michigan\u2019s history of protecting our citizens against unreasonable searches.

See <em>People v Collins, </em>438 Mich 8, 50; 475 NW2d 684 (1991) (CAVANAGH, C.J., dissenting). However, even if this Court must demonstrate a compelling reason to offer greater protection to our citizens, Michigan\u2019s jurisprudential history certainly meets this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Over forty years before the United States Supreme Court extended the exclusionary rule to the states in <em>Mapp v Ohio, </em>367 US 643; 81 S Ct 1684; 6 L Ed 2d 1081 (1961), Michigan adopted the exclusionary rule in <em>People v Marxhausen, </em>204 Mich 559, 573-574; 171 NW 557 (1919). \u201c[T]his Court created a body of state constitutional search and seizure law and adopted an exclusionary rule, all before either was subject to a federal floor.\u201d <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196, 214; 341 NW2d 439 (1983) (opinion of BRICKLEY, J.).

It is the duty of courts, when attention is seasonably called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>to a violation of a constitutional right, in obtaining evidence in criminal prosecutions, to vindicate the protection afforded individuals by the Constitution, and to suppress such evidence.

The majority\u2019s application of the compelling reason test disregards this, however, and ignores the jurisprudential history of the exclusionary rule in this Court. Those who have come before us have dedicated themselves to upholding Michigan\u2019s Constitution and providing reasoned analysis. Not only did this Court adopt the exclusionary rule before being required to do so, it also <em>declined </em>to recognize a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in <em>People v Bloyd, </em>416 Mich 538, 556; 331 NW2d 447 (1982). Our state is not obligated to discard decades of sound analysis and reasoned jurisprudence merely because the United State Supreme Court has announced a decision limiting citizens\u2019 federal constitutional rights contrary to Michigan jurisprudence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court is \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>obligated to accept what we deem to be a major contraction of citizen protections under our constitution simply because the United States Supreme Court has chosen to do so.\u201d <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 763. Our state is free to provide more protections to its citizens than the United States Constitution does. This Court\u2019s adoption of the exclusionary rule decades before being required to do so, and its subsequent decision not to adopt a good-faith exception, is more than sufficient to qualify as a compelling reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Notably, those who framed and adopted the Constitution were concerned about expanding the protection under Michigan\u2019s search and seizure provision beyond that of the federal constitution as it was interpreted in 1963. <em>Collins, supra </em>at 27; see also <em>Nash, supra </em>at 214. In 1963, the United States Supreme Court had adopted the exclusionary rule, but had not yet adopted the good-faith exception. Therefore, the 1963 ratification of our Constitution cannot support the notion that our citizens sought to have Michigan\u2019s Constitution adopt the good-faith exception as contained in the federal constitution, when it would be over twenty years before this exception was indeed recognized under the federal constitution. \u201c[W]e may not disregard the guarantees that our constitution confers on Michigan citizens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>merely because the United States Supreme Court has withdrawn.. . such protection.\u201d <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 759. Unless the ratifiers were prescient, they could not know how the United State Supreme Court might interpret the federal constitution in future years. Therefore, it is illogical to claim that the 1963 ratification essentially foreclosed an interpretation of our Constitution that differs from that of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Remarkably, the majority claims that the only purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct. That claim is incomplete and ignores the other well-documented purpose of the exclusionary rule. The United States Supreme Court has stated that the <em>purposes </em>of the exclusionary rule are to protect a person\u2019s Fourth Amendment guarantees by deterring lawless conduct by police officers <em>and </em>to close the courthouse doors \u201cto any use of evidence unconstitutionally obtained.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v United States, </em>371 US 471, 486; 83 S Ct 407; 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963); see also <em>Brown v Illinois, </em>422 US 590, 599; 95 S Ct 2254; 45 L Ed 2d 416 (1975); <em>Terry v Ohio, </em>392 US 1, 12-13; 88 S Ct 1868; 20 L Ed 2d 889 (1968) (The exclusionary rule serves to deter police misconduct <em>and </em>preserve judicial integrity.); <em>Elkins v United States, </em>364 US 206, 222; 80 S Ct 1437; 4 L Ed 2d 1669 (I960).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201cCourts which sit under our Constitution cannot and will not be made party to lawless invasions of the constitutional rights of citizens by permitting unhindered governmental use of the fruits of such invasions.\u201d <em>Terry, supra </em>at 13. The exclusionary rule \u201cis directed at <em>all </em>unlawful searches and seizures, and not merely those that happen to produce incriminating material or testimony as fruits.\u201d <em>Brown, supra </em>at 601 (emphasis added). In <em>Mapp, supra </em>at 648, the United States Supreme Court quoted <em>Weeks v United States, </em>232 US 383, 393; 34 S Ct 341; 58 L Ed 652 (1914), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">\u201cIf letters and private documents can thus be seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution. The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">As Justice Scalia also recently wrote in <em>Crawford v Washington, </em>541 US_,_; 124 S Ct 1354, 1373; 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004), the framers of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Constitution \u201cknew that judges, like other government officers, could not always be trusted to safeguard the rights of the people . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Without the exclusionary rule, the assurance against unreasonable searches and seizures would be \u201cvalueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties . . <em>.Mapp, supra </em>at 655. The Constitution exists to protect us all. Hundreds of years ago, our founders had the wisdom to recognize that our government must be held to the highest standards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It must be accountable to the people, for without the people, government has no reason to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In today\u2019s decision, the majority treats our Constitution as an impediment that courts must maneuver around for the justice system to work. This is evident in its zeal to adopt the good-faith exception in this case when the search warrant at issue does not come close to meeting the standards articulated in <em>Leon. </em>\u201cProbable cause to issue a search warrant exists where there is a \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for inferring a \u2018fair probability\u2019 that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>People v Kazmierczak, </em>461 Mich 411, 417-418; 605 NW2d 667 (2000). <em>Leon, supra </em>at 914-915, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>926, held that the good-faith exception does not apply if the magistrate abandoned his detached and neutral role, the police officers were dishonest or reckless, or the police officers could not have had an objectively reasonable belief that probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">This is not a case where there was a mere typographical error that was not discovered until after the warrant was carried out. See, e.g., <em>Arizona v Evans, </em>514 US 1, 15-16; 115 S Ct 1185; 131 L Ed 2d 34 (1995) (a police officer acted on incorrect computer data entered by a court clerk). And this is certainly not a case where there was a close call about the sufficiency of an affidavit. See, e.g., <em>Leon, supra </em>at 904. We concur in the findings of the trial court, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">In order for the warrant to be sustained the observations were made of a recent nature. Examination of the affidavit in support of a warrant, a search warrant, dues [sic, does] nothing to enlighten anyone. It obtains no reference as to when these contacts between Officer Born and the defendant were had, was not able to tell how close in time the contacts were with respect to defendant\u2019s alleged activities posing as a firefighter, how close the time those activities were to the date of the affidavit for the warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">Also looking at the affidavit, I don\u2019t find anything in the affidavit connecting the location of the dwelling, 29440 Hazelwood, Inkster, Michigan, to this defendant for any information stating why there is a request to search this location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">It doesn\u2019t have to be the defendant\u2019s residence but there has to be, in this Court\u2019s judgment, something connecting the defendant to the location that was searched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">Whether it was somewhere he worked, whether it was somewhere he was seen going in and out of. Whether it was somewhere he lived, or someone saw him going into after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the incident, was it his girlfriend or him being associated in some manner with that location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">And on the face of the affidavit I don\u2019t find anything connecting the defendant to that location that was searched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">So therefore based on those findings by the Court, I\u2019m going to grant the motion. I don\u2019t think that the affidavit sufficiently established the probable cause necessary so that the magistrate could properly have issued the warrant. So the motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">This is a case in which the affidavit offered <em>absolutely no </em>information linking defendant to the address on the warrant. It was not objectively reasonable for the police officers to have relied on a warrant that did not provide <em>any </em>information connecting defendant with the place to be searched. The majority pointedly states that the information provided was not false or misleading. And I agree, but that is only because it is impossible for one to find <em>nonexistent </em>information false or misleading.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The good-faith exception is premised on the belief that the law enforcement officer was \u201c \u2018acting as a reasonable officer would and should act in similar circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leon, supra </em>at 920, quoting <em>Stone v Powell, </em>428 US 465, 539-540; 96 S Ct 3037; 49 L Ed 2d 1067 (1976) (White, J., dissenting). <em>Leon </em>even states, \u201cWe emphasize that the standard of reasonableness we adopt is an objective one.... The objective standard we adopt, moreover, requires officers to have a reasonable knowledge of what the law prohibits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 920 n 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Unlike the majority, I give our trained law enforcement officers more credit, and I believe law enforcement officers know that when submitting an affidavit in support of the issuance of a search warrant they must include <em>why </em>they believe the area should be searched. Because of the lack of any information linking defendant to the place to be searched, even under the <em>Leon </em>good-faith exception, this warrant is insufficient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Further, the magistrate in this case did not review the affidavit for issuance of a search warrant with neutral and detached scrutiny. <em>Id. </em>at 913-914. The magistrate authorized a search warrant that provided no information linking the address with defendant. A neutral and detached magistrate would have directed the police officers to provide information linking the address to be searched with defendant. There is simply no fact indicating a connection between the address and defendant. There is no other term for the magistrate\u2019s approval in this case other than to describe it as being a \u201crubber stamp for the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The majority also argues \u201cthat the high cost of the exclusionary rule exacts too great a toll on our justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>system.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 541 n 9. The exclusionary rule, grounded in our Constitution, has been the rule of law in Michigan for over eighty years. While it may be obvious, I note that our state has managed to exist for decades with the exclusionary rule and our streets have yet to become teeming with criminals released on \u201ctechnicalities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Finally, I am somewhat heartened by the fact that the ever-sensitive concurrence has seen fit to attack my dissent with a lengthy diatribe championing law and order. I also applaud the concurrence\u2019s ability to vigorously criticize the dissent for its \u201coverwrought language\u201d and \u201chyperbolic rhetoric,\u201d yet still manage to hysterically argue that the dissent\u2019s approach leaves criminal defendants \u201con the streets to continue to prey upon their communities . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 548. While I am unclear how an allegedly increased crime rate is relevant in determining our citizens\u2019 constitutional rights, it is quite a marvel to watch the concurrence criticize the dissent for attempting to protect our citizens\u2019 constitutional liberties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At its core, the concurrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>clearly indicates the fundamental difference between my view of our citizens\u2019 constitutional liberties and the majority and concurrence\u2019s views. I believe that the Constitution exists to protect <em>all </em>citizens, and the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments, to protect all citizens from unlawful acts by the government. I do not believe that requiring the government to follow the law, while attempting to catch those who are allegedly breaking it, is a radical notion so easily dismissed. If, as the concurrence advocates, \u201c[e]vidence is the lifeblood of the criminal justice process,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 546, then I believe that the Constitution is the lifeblood of our democracy, and I do not agree with attempts to violate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The concurrence argues that the exclusionary rule has no effect in deterring even a single improper search. It is disingenuous to argue that the actions of law enforcement officers will not be influenced by the knowledge that even \u201cmistakes\u201d that violate a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights are still admissible in a court of law. The facts of this case indicate that the majority and concurrence are willing to classify almost any conduct as a \u201cmistake.\u201d The concurrence even goes so far as to rename these constitutional violations \u201cgood-faith imperfections.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 557 n 12.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is hard to take the arguments of the majority and concurrence seriously when they argue, as they do in this case, that a reasonable law enforcement officer would make the \u201cmistake\u201d of submitting an affidavit in support of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>search warrant that provides <em>no link </em>between the defendant and the place to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The majority and concurrence also argue that excluding evidence seized in violation of our Constitution hinders public confidence. I have much more faith in the people of our state. I believe that public confidence is shattered by a government that does not respect the constitutional rights of its citizens. I believe the citizens of our state understand that the Constitution protects us all and that they do not have to make a choice between constitutional liberties and justice. I believe our citizens expect the government to follow the law, just as they are required to do. No matter how \u201cindispensable\u201d evidence may be, law enforcement officers are not given a free pass merely because they are cloaked with governmental authority. The concurrence indicates its belief that our citizens\u2019 constitutional liberties should be discarded because it will make us \u201csafer.\u201d What a peculiar notion. Contrary to the concurrence, I agree with the following values, stated so eloquently by Justice Brand\u00e9is in his dissenting opinion in <em>Olmstead v United States, </em>277 US 438, 485; 48 S Ct 564; 72 L Ed 944 (1928):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means\u2014to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal\u2014would bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In the future, I am confident that history will show that the tactics used by the concurrence are flawed ones. Our citizens\u2019 concerns about safety should not be exploited because the concurrence believes that it has some divine notion about the Constitution\u2019s meaning. If the Constitution truly means what the concurrence argues, then crime rates and public confidence have nothing to do with the analysis. The concurrence claims that the \u201cthe dissent\u2019s constitution is one that would be unrecognizable to the framers of the United States Constitution or the Michigan Constitution, as well as to generations of justices . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 557.1 believe what would be unrecognizable to the framers and past generations of justices would be the majority and concurrence\u2019s insistence on discarding the rights of our citizens for their new version of a law and order society that <em>these justices </em>have decided is best for the people. Our decisions are our legacy. History will be our judge, and I welcome its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">When our government violates our citizens\u2019 constitutional rights, it should find no refuge in our courts. Today, the majority disregards decades of reasoned and sound jurisprudence by this Court protecting our citizens against unreasonable searches. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-7\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> \u201cThe right of the people to he secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d US Const, Am IV</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">\u201cThe person, houses, papers and possessions of every person shall be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.

While discussing the deterrent effects of the exclusionary rule in <em>James v Illinois, </em>493 US 307, 314; 110 S Ct 648; 107 L Ed 2d 676 (1990), the Court refers to the <em>purposes </em>of the exclusionary rule.

I disagree. In this case, conducting a search based on a warrant that does not establish <em>any </em>connection between the place to be searched and a defendant is not merely a technical violation. As the United States Supreme Court recently held, when a warrant does not describe the items to be seized <em>at all, </em>the warrant was so obviously deficient that the search is regarded as warrantless. <em>Groh v Ramirez, </em>540 US 551,_124 S Ct 1284, 1290; 157 L Ed 2d 1068 (2004). It was unreasonable for a law enforcement officer to rely on a warrant \u201cso patently defective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292. \u201c[E]ven a cursory reading of the warrant in this case\u2014perhaps just a simple glance\u2014would have revealed a glaring deficiency that any reasonable police officer would have known was constitutionally fatal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1294. Likewise, an affidavit that provides no information linking a defendant to the address to be searched, like the affidavit in this case, is also a glaring deficiency that would be evident to any reasonable law enforcement officer.

If crime rates are to be considered in constitutional interpretation, as the concurrence indicates, then the falling rates should give the concurrence pause. Perhaps the concurrence will change its notion if the rates continue to fall. Or, if the rates unfortunately increase, the concurrence may argue for a greater contraction of constitutional liberties. Either way, the concurrence\u2019s idiosyncratic method of constitutional interpretation is certainly unique.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The concurrence\u2019s distinctive ideas about constitutional interpretation also extend to its recitation of numerous federal cases dealing with the exclusionary rule in various settings, such as deportation proceedings.

Therefore, the lack of a deterrent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>effect justifies the violation of citizens\u2019 constitutional rights. This very notion\u2014that the government\u2019s disregard of constitutional rights justifies the government\u2019s <em>continued and increased </em>disregard of constitutional rights\u2014appears contrary to logic and, of course, our nation\u2019s history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\"> The concurrence also argues that people whose constitutional rights have been violated could pursue a civil damages lawsuit.
