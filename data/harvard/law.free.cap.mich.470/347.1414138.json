MCL 257.710e(6) provides that a plaintiffs damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle can be reduced by no more than five percent because of a plaintiffs failure to wear a safety belt. We adopt Justice BOYLE\u2019s concurrence in <em>Klinke v Mitsubishi Motors Corp, </em>458 Mich 582; 581 NW2d 272 (1998), and hold that MCL 257.710e(6) by its express terms limits application of its cap on the reduction of damages to cases arising under the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq. </em>Here the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not brought under the no-fault act; instead, the suit is based on the civil liability of a county road commission for its maintenance of a highway under the highway exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1402. Thus, the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on reduction of damages does not apply. We reverse the decisions of the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Appeals and the trial court and remand to the trial court for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On October 26, 1997, Patrick Mann, Sr., lost control of his pickup truck after he left the roadway and attempted to bring his vehicle back onto the paved surface. Mann collided with a tree on the side of the roadway, resulting in injures to both himself and Patrick Mann, Jr. There is a dispute over whether the Manns were wearing their safety belts during the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Patrick Mann, Sr., and Gayle Mann, for herself and as next friend of Patrick Mann, Jr., a minor, brought suit, alleging that the accident was caused by a roadway \u201cedge drop,\u201d and that defendant, the county road commission, is liable under the highway exception to governmental immunity for failing to keep the roadway in reasonable repair.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant seeks to offer at trial testimony of a biomechanical expert that the vehicle occupants (plaintiffs) were not wearing safety belts at the time of the accident and that they would have escaped with minor, superficial injuries had they been wearing safety belts.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Before trial, defendant brought a motion in limine, asking that the circuit court enter an order holding that the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages, MCL 257.710e(6), does not apply. If the safety belt statute\u2019s cap were to apply, then plaintiffs\u2019 negligence in failing to wear a safety belt could reduce their damages by no more than five percent. Defendant sought to have plaintiffs\u2019 damages reduced by more than that amount under common-law comparative negligence. Following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>argument on defendant\u2019s motion in limine, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. The trial court declined to extend the rationale of <em>Klinke, </em>beyond a products liability action, and held that the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on reduction of damages does apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The Court of Appeals granted defendant\u2019s application for leave for an interlocutory appeal and affirmed. 254 Mich App 86; 657 NW2d 517 (2002). This Court granted leave to appeal, limiting the grant to \u201cwhether the limitation on the reduction of damages based on a plaintiffs negligence established by MCL 257.710e(6) applies in this case.\u201d 468 Mich 944 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The issue before us is whether the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages, MCL 257.710e(6), applies to a suit against a county road commission brought under the highway exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1402. This case presents a question of statutory interpretation, which is reviewed de novo. <em>Stozicki v Allied Paper Co, Inc, </em>464 Mich 257, 263; 627 NW2d 293 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Before 1985, evidence of a plaintiffs failure to use a safety belt was not admissible in any tort action. <em>Romankewiz v Black, </em>16 Mich App 119; 167 NW2d 606 (1969). In 1985, the Legislature adopted a safety belt law, MCL 257.710e, requiring front seat passengers in automobiles to wear safety belts and providing that failure to use a safety belt \u201cmay be considered evidence of negligence and may reduce the recovery for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d MCL 257.710e(6). The safety belt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>law limits the amount by which recovery for damages may be reduced to no more than five percent of the damages: \u201csuch negligence shall not reduce the recovery for damages by more than five percent.\u201d MCL 257.710e(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Two years later, in deciding an automobile products liability action, this Court held that under the common law a plaintiffs failure to wear a safety belt could be used at trial for purposes of comparative negligence. <em>Lowe v Estate Motors Ltd, </em>428 Mich 439; 410 NW2d 706 (1987). In <em>Lowe </em>the accident occurred before the effective date of MCL 257.710e, and the Court\u2019s decision was not based on the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">As a result, in a tort suit there are two alternative grounds for admitting evidence of the failure to use a safety belt\u2014the safety belt statute or common-law comparative negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The primary difference between the two is that when evidence of the failure to use a safety belt is admitted under the safety belt statute, there is a five percent cap on the reduction of damages; when evidence of the failure to use a safety belt is admitted under common-law comparative negligence, the safety belt statute and its cap do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The question here is whether the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages, MCL 257.710e(6), applies to a suit brought under the highway exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1402.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The safety belt statute, MCL 257.710e, requires the use of safety belts in an automobile.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It allows evidence of the failure to use a safety belt to be admitted in court to prove comparative negligence, while limiting the reduction for recovery of damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle to no more than five percent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">Failure to wear a safety belt in violation of this section may be considered evidence of negligence and may reduce the recovery for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle. However, such negligence shall not reduce the recovery for damages by more than five percent. [MCL 257.710e(6).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We hold that the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages is applicable only to tort actions brought under the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">By its own terms, \u00a7 710e(6) is limited to \u201cdamages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d A loss involving the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle is a \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d under the no-fault act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle within Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>has been abolished, allowing for certain exceptions within MCL 500.3135(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the cap on reduction of damages for failure to wear a safety belt, \u00a7 710e(6), can only apply in those limited tort suits allowed under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>no-fault act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As Justice BOYLE stated in her concurrence in <em>Klinke, supra </em>at 594 \u201c[t]he fact that the safety-belt statute tracks the language of the no-fault act demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s clear intent to apply the five-percent limitation on reduction of damages for a plaintiffs negligence within the context of the no-fault act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The question in this case is whether the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages applies when suit is brought against a county road commission under the highway exception to governmental immunity. We hold that because the plaintiffs suit was not brought under the no-fault act, the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages, \u00a7 710e(6), does not apply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages is also inapplicable in this case because the plaintiffs do not allege that their damages arose out of the \u201cownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d Rather, plaintiffs allege that the accident and their damages were caused by a roadway \u201cedge drop,\u201d and that defendant is liable under the highway exception to governmental immunity for failing to keep the roadway in reasonable repair. Plaintiffs allege that their damages arose from the failure to keep the roadway in reasonable repair, not from the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In its opinion, the Court of Appeals panel held that the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages applied here, in a suit under the highway exception to governmental immunity, because the damages did arise out of the operation of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>incorrect interpretation of \u201cdamages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">This Court has construed almost identical language, \u201ctort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use within this state of a motor vehicle,\u201d as referring to liability <em>caused by </em>the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle. <em>Citizens Ins Co of America v Tuttle, </em>411 Mich 536, 544; 309 NW2d 174 (1981). In <em>Tuttle, </em>the liability arose from the defendant\u2019s improper keeping of his cow, not the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle. Here the damages arose from the improper maintenance of the highway, not the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">This interpretation is in accord with the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Klinke v Mitsubishi Motors Corp, </em>219 Mich App 500; 556 NW2d 528 (1996), written by Judge MARKMAN, and with Justice BOYLE\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Klinke, </em>458 Mich 595 n 5, which recognized that there \u201c[t]he only damages \u2018arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle\u2019 in this litigation are the damages caused by plaintiffs fault. To the extent that plaintiffs damages were caused by a product defect, they do not arise out of \u2018ownership, maintenance, or operation.\u2019 Thus, the five-percent cap would not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In <em>Klinke </em>the Court of Appeals concluded that the five percent cap on the reduction of damages for failure to wear a safety belt found in the Vehicle Code does not apply to products liability actions against automobile manufacturers. \u201c[B]y its plain meaning, this provision is expressly limited to damages arising out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ownership, maintenance or operation of a motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d 219 Mich App 509. \u201cConspicuously absent is any reference to the <em>design or construction </em>of a motor vehicle. Even the most liberal interpretation of the words \u2018ownership,\u2019 \u2018common maintenance\u2019 and \u2018operation\u2019 cannot stretch far enough to include design and construction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>LaHue v Gen Motors Corp, </em>716 F Supp 412 (WD Mo, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Likewise, even the most liberal interpretation of the words \u201cownership,\u201d \u201ccommon maintenance,\u201d and \u201coperation\u201d cannot stretch far enough to include maintenance of a highway. Plaintiffs here are attempting to recover damages arising out of the road commission\u2019s failure to maintain the highway; they are not attempting to recover damages arising out of \u201cthe ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d In other words, plaintiffs are not seeking damages for the \u201coperation of a motor vehicle\u201d; rather, they are seeking damages for the road commission\u2019s failure to maintain the highway in a condition reasonably safe and fit for travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Because the plaintiffs\u2019 suit is based on the civil liability of a county road commission for its maintenance of a highway, the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on reduction of damages does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion in limine to preclude application of the five percent damage reduction cap in MCL 257.710e(6). We reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the trial court, and remand the case to the trial court for entry of an order granting defendant\u2019s motion, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor, Young and Markman, JJ., concurred with WEAVER, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> For purposes of tins appeal, we accept plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> In this case, if the evidence of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to wear safety belts were not admitted under the safety belt statute, it would be admitted under the common law for the purpose of comparative negligence.

Rather, as explained above, we recognize that the terms of the safety belt statute limit its applicability to motor vehicle accidents under the no-fault act. Thus, the only tort suits to which the safety belt statute will apply are those allowed under the no-fault act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\"> Because we conclude that this cap only applies to cases arising under the no-fault act, and that since this case does not arise under the no-fault act the safety belt statute\u2019s cap on the reduction of damages does not apply, we do not address whether the application of the cap in this case would violate the Title-Object Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">But we note that in its analysis the Court of Appeals applied the wrong test to determine whether the Title-Object Clause was violated. The Court of Appeals panel reasoned that applying the safety belt cap in a suit for a defective highway did not violate the scope of the title of the Vehicle Code because \u201cthere is a natural correlation or connection between governmental liability for failing to maintain a highway in reasonable repair and the Michigan Vehicle Code, which governs the operation of vehicles on those same public highways.\u201d 254 Mich App 99. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The proper test for determining whether a statute violates the Title-Object Clause is whether it contains \u201csubjects diverse in their nature and having no necessary connection,\u201d <em>People ex rel Drake v Mahaney, </em>13 Mich 481, 494-495 (1865), <em>Pohutski v City of Allen Park, </em>465 Mich 675, 691; 641 NW2d 219 (2002), not whether there is a \u201cnatural correlation or connection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b443-12\"> The Court of Appeals opinion stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">Subsection 710e(6) does not provide that \u201cliability\u201d must arise out of the operation of a motor vehicle, but rather that \u201cdamages\u201d must so arise, and subsection 710e(6) does not provide that damages must arise out of the operation of a particular party\u2019s motor vehicle, but rather only that the damages arise out of the operation of <em>a </em>motor vehicle. Therefore, the clear language of subsection 710e(6) required only that plaintiffs suffered damages arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle as alleged here. If plaintiffs had not been operating a motor vehicle, there would not have been an accident, injuries, and damages. The operation of a motor vehicle was a necessary component giving rise to plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>cause of action, and there was a nexus between their damages and the operation of a motor vehicle.

I would find that the five percent cap on damage reduction for failure to wear one\u2019s safety belt applies to a suit brought under the highway exception to governmental immunity. This would be consistent with my dissenting opinion in <em>Klinke v Mitsubishi Motors Corp, </em>458 Mich 582; 581 NW2d 272 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">STATUTORY ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The safety belt statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">Failure to wear a safety belt in violation of this section may be considered evidence of negligence and may reduce the recovery for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle. However, such negligence shall not reduce the recovery for damages by more than <em>5%. </em>[MCL 257.710e(6).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">The majority holds that, in an action pleaded in avoidance of governmental immunity premised on the highway exception, plaintiffs damages do not \u201carise out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d It bases this conclusion on the fact that the Legislature used similar language in the no-fault act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use within this state of a motor vehicle... is abolished.... [MCL 500.3135(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Although similarity exists in the language of the two statutes, it is deceptive and should not be taken to indicate that the Legislature intended identical results when applying them. A comparison of the two reveals that they are not identical. The difference in the Legislature\u2019s choice of language is telling.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The no-fault act refers to \u201cliability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use... of a motor vehicle . ...\u201d The safety belt law refers to \u201cdamages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d Here, plaintiffs\u2019 damages arose out the operation of the vehicle. The majority maintains that plaintiffs are not seeking damages \u201cfor\u201d the operation of a motor vehicle. <em>Ante </em>at 357. However, that misconstrues the safety belt statute. By definition, the liability arising from an act and the damages caused by it are not identical. I agree with the Court of Appeals analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">[MCL 257.710e(6)] does not provide that \u201cliability\u201d must arise out of the operation of a motor vehicle, but rather that \u201cdamages\u201d must so arise, and subsection 710e(6) does not provide that damages must arise out of the operation of a <em>particular party\u2019s </em>motor vehicle, but rather only that the damages arise out of the operation of <em>a </em>motor vehicle. Therefore, the clear language of subsection 710e(6) required only that plaintiffs suffered damages arising out of . the operation of a motor vehicle as alleged here. If plaintiffs had not been operating a motor vehicle, there would not have been an accident, injuries, and damages. The operation of a motor vehicle was a necessary component giving rise to plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, and there was a nexus between their damages and the opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>tion of a motor vehicle. [254 Mich App 86, 103; 657 NW2d 517 (2002) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The premise upon which the majority builds its analysis is that the safety belt statute applies only in conjunction with the no-fault act. MCL 500.3135. I continue to believe that the Legislature intended the broadly based, tort damage recovery limitation of the safety belt statute to be applicable in any action involving a motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">At common law, the failure to use a safety belt was not admissible to prove contributory negligence. When the safety belt statute was enacted, it was intended as a punishment for plaintiffs who did not use their safety belts, reducing their available damages. The statute encouraged drivers to wear their safety belts. By contrast, the purpose of the five percent cap was \u201cto prevent the injured party from recovering substantially less based solely on the failure to wear a safety belt,\u201d as I noted in <em>Ullery v Sobie, </em>196 Mich App 76, 80; 492 NW2d 739 (1992). Similarly, as the Court of Appeals observed in this case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in <em>Thompson v </em>Fitzpatrick,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the five percent cap was \u201cintended by the Legislature to protect plaintiffs against drastic reduction in damage awards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The Legislature apparently concluded that limiting recovery for those who fail to wear safety belts would further both goals. The Court of Appeals agreed with this observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">The Senate Bill Analysis regarding supporting arguments for the 1985 amendment of MCL 257.710e indicated that \u201cseat belt use saves lives and reduces the number and severity of injuries. Experience has shown that mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>seat belt laws produce a significant and lasting increase in the use of seat belts, even when enforcement is relaxed.\u201d Senate Analysis, SB 6, February 26, 1985. It is abundantly clear that the Legislature intended to encourage all drivers to wear their seat belts for purposes of public safety and to limit attacks on damage awards based on comparative negligence where a defendant is negligent. [254 Mich App 104-105.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Thus, the more legal actions in which the damage cap applies, the more effective the act will be. The fact that the state of the law has changed does not retroactively alter the Legislature\u2019s intent in passing the safety belt statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The majority acts to frustrate this legislative intent. The language of the safety belt statute reduces one\u2019s damages by five percent. Nothing suggests that the Legislature wanted to reduce damages by five percent in a two-car accident, but set no limit where only one car was involved. Absent some indication of such intent, it is illogical to conclude that the Legislature intended such disparate results from the same negligence, failing to wear a safety belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">For example, if a motorist whose only negligence is his failure to wear a safety belt is hit by a truck, his damages will be reduced by five percent under the statute. However, if, instead, the accident involves a negligent bicyclist, applying the majority\u2019s interpretation, the same injured motorist could experience a much greater damage reduction for failing to wear a safety belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The Legislature enacted a standard of care, the wearing of safety belts, that carries a limited penalty for its violation. The majority frustrates the Legislature\u2019s intent and limits its power by finding a clear indication of intent that the statute be applied only to no-fault cases. This is despite the fact that the safety belt statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>itself contains no such limitation. The majority extrapolates the limitation from the Legislature\u2019s use of the same string of words in the no-fault act as in the Vehicle Code. I interpret the use of the phrase \u201cownership, maintenance or operation of a motor vehicle\u201d as a convenient description for the common uses of motor vehicles, not a limitation of the damage cap to no-fault claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">I would find that the five percent cap on damages reduction for failure to wear a safety belt applies to a suit brought under the highway exception to governmental immunity. It is apparent that the intent of the Legislature in passing the safety belt act was twofold: to foster public safety and to limit attacks on damage awards based on a motorist\u2019s comparative negligence in failing to wear a safety belt. Subsequent changes in the law cannot affect the Legislature\u2019s intent at the time that the cap was enacted. Applying the cap only to no-fault cases defies the Legislature\u2019s intent and reads into the statute a limitation not written there.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and of the trial court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-7\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-11\"> The majority maintains that its holding is not based solely on the similarity in the language of the safety belt statute and the no-fault act. It insists instead that \u201cthe terms of the safety belt statute limit its applicability to motor vehicle accidents under the no-fault act.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 354 n 6. However, the safety belt statute makes no reference to the no-fault act. Therefore, despite its assertion to the contrary, the majority bases this conclusion solely on the fact that the Legislature used similar language in the no-fault act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\"> 254 Mich App 103-104.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\"> 199 Mich App 5; 501 NW2d 172 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
