FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Defendant was stopped when a law enforcement officer observed the car defendant was operating cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the fog line twice. The officer also observed that it was dark and the car did not have its headlights on. Defendant told the officer his name was Christopher Noble Barbee. Defendant\u2019s name is actually Edmund McGe-hee Barbee, Jr. Defendant\u2019s fiance\u00e9 gave the officer defendant\u2019s correct name.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">A Breathalyzer test determined defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.29 grams per 210 liters of breath. Defendant pleaded guilty of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, third offense, MCL 257.625, in exchange for the dismissal of two charges related to driving while his license was suspended, MCL 257.904. Because defendant gave the law enforcement officer a false name, the trial court scored OV 19 at ten points and imposed a prison sentence of twenty-nine to sixty months. Defendant objected to the assessment of ten points under OV 19, arguing that giving the law enforcement officer his brother\u2019s name was not interference with the administration of justice because the officer would have learned his true identity in due course. Defendant\u2019s motion for resentencing, which challenged the scoring of OV 19, was denied. The Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal for lack of merit in the grounds presented. This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 469 Mich 973 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">We review de novo issues of statutory interpretation. <em>People v Krueger, </em>466 Mich 50, 53; 643 NW2d 223 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The issue in this case is one of statutory interpretation. The statute at issue, MCL 777.49, states, in pertinent part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Offense variable 19 is a threat to the security of a penal institution or court or interference with the administration of justice or the rendering of emergency services. Score offense variable 19 by determining which of the following apply and by assigning the number of points attributable to the one that has the highest number of points:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">(a) The offender by his or her conduct threatened the security of a penal institution or court....................25 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">(b) The offender used force or the threat of force against another person or the property of another person to interfere with, attempt to interfere with, or that results in the interference with the administration of justice or the rendering of emergency services..........................15 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">(c) The offender otherwise interfered with or attempted to interfere with the administration of justice ..............10 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">(d) The offender did not threaten the security of a penal institution or court or interfere with or attempt to interfere with the administration of justice or the rendering of emergency services by force or threat of force................0 points[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Because the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, we enforce the statute as written and follow its plain meaning, giving effect to the words used by the Legislature. See <em>In re MCI, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">While \u201cinterfered with or attempted to interfere with the administration of justice\u201d is a broad phrase that <em>can </em>include acts that constitute \u201cobstruction of justice,\u201d it is not limited to <em>only </em>those acts that constitute \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Legislature specifically chose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>use the phrase \u201cinterfered with or attempted to interfere with the administration of justice.\u201d If the Legislature had meant for OV 19 to apply only in cases dealing with the obstruction of justice, it could have easily used that phrase. \u201cObstruction of justice\u201d is a well-known term of art. In <em>People v Thomas, </em>438 Mich 448, 457-458; 475 NW2d 288 (1991), this Court stated that common-law obstruction of justice is comprised of various offenses. To the contrary, conduct that \u201cinterfered with or attempted to interfere with the administration of justice\u201d does not have to necessarily rise to the level of a chargeable offense because it is merely being used as one of various factors to determine a defendant\u2019s sentencing guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>People v Deline, </em>254 Mich App 595, 597; 658 NW2d 164 (2002), ignored the significance of the words used by the Legislature in MCL 777.49 and equated \u201cinterfered with or attempted to interfere with the administration of justice\u201d with \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the Legislature chose not to use the phrase \u201cobstruction of justice,\u201d this Court cannot interpret the statute as if it had. In reaching this decision, we are merely applying basic rules of statutory interpretation and giving effect to the words used by the Legislature. See <em>Coleman v Gurwin, </em>443 Mich 59, 65; 503 NW2d 435 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">While the <em>Deline </em>panel held that OV 19 could only be scored when the conduct interfered with the judicial process, we find that the phrase \u201cinterfered with or attempted to interfere with the administration of jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tice\u201d encompasses more than just the actual judicial process. Law enforcement officers are an integral component in the administration of justice, regardless of whether they are operating directly pursuant to a court order. In <em>Hewitt v White, </em>78 Mich 117, 119; 43 NW 1043 (1889), this Court referred to the sheriffs duties as relating to \u201cthe administration of civil and criminal justice.\u201d Similarly, in <em>White v East Saginaw, </em>43 Mich 567, 570; 6 NW 86 (1880), this Court referred to the sheriffs duties as \u201c \u2018more or less directly connected with the administration of justice,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>People v Edwards, </em>9 Cal 286 (1858). It is certainly interference with the administration of justice to provide law enforcement officers with a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The investigation of crime is critical to the administration of justice. Providing a false name to the police constitutes interference with the administration of justice, and OV 19 may be scored, when applicable, for this conduct. Therefore, to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion, an order will be issued disapproving the reasoning of <em>Deline.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Conduct that occurs before criminal charges are filed can form the basis for interference, or attempted interference, with the administration of justice, and OV 19 may be scored for this conduct where applicable. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s assessment of ten points for OV 19 because defendant\u2019s conduct constituted interference with the administration of justice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-8\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Kelly, Taylor Young, and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\"> MCL 777.49 details the conduct that warrants points under OV 19. Points assessed are used in conjunction with other factors to produce a sentencing guidelines range within which a defendant\u2019s minimum sentence must fall unless the sentencing court identifies substantial and compelling reasons for deviating from the range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-15\"> The statute has been amended twice since the date of defendant\u2019s offense. The amendments, however, do not affect the issue or the outcome in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-16\"> In <em>People v Thomas, </em>438 Mich 448, 458; 475 NW2d 288 (1991), this Court determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014making a false statement in a police report\u2014was a \u201csubstantial impediment to the administration of justice,\u201d but was <em>not </em>an obstruction of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> Notably, in an opinion issued one week after <em>Deline, </em>the Court of Appeals essentially reached the opposite conclusion. In <em>People v Cook, </em>254 Mich App 635; 658 NW2d 184 (2003), the Court of Appeals held that it was proper for the trial court to score ten points under OV 19 for defendant's conduct in attempting to flee from the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
