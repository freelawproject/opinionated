Because there is also no genuine question of material fact that plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of the police officer position, we reverse the Court of Appeals judgment on this issue as well. We reinstate the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In 1986, plaintiff, Allan Peden, a police officer in Detroit\u2019s 13th Precinct, suffered a heart attack while performing clerical tasks consistent with his \u201cA Clerk\u201d position. Plaintiff was diagnosed with heart disease and underwent successful heart surgery. Plaintiffs physician released him to work on indefinite restricted duty. For about ten years, plaintiff continued working on restricted duty status, first remaining in the \u201cA clerk\u201d position and eventually winning a \u201cbidded\u201d position with the police department\u2019s Crime Analysis Unit (CAU).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In 1995, the Detroit Police Department compiled a list of \u201c24 Essential Job Functions of a Law Enforcement Officer\u201d (the essential functions list or EFL). This list was based on model standards developed by the Michigan Law Enforcement Officers Training Council, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>a council created by statute to develop educational, mental, and physical standards for all commissioned law enforcement officers in the state of Michigan. See MCL 28.601 <em>et seq. </em>The department\u2019s list includes such tasks as pursuing suspects in foot chases, engaging in vehicle pursuits, effecting forcible arrests, overcoming violent resistance, and qualifying with a firearm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In 1996, the department placed plaintiff on involuntary, nonduty, disability retirement. The CAU physician, Dr. Hill, signed the application for early retirement on behalf of the department. Dr. Hill reviewed plaintiffs medical records, including records made by plaintiffs physicians and the department\u2019s physicians over the course of several years of routine medical examinations, and determined, on the basis of those records, that plaintiff was unable to perform the EFL tasks and was therefore eligible for disability retirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Plaintiff filed suit against defendant, alleging that the department violated the ADA and the PWDCRA when it placed him on involuntary disability retirement. Defendant argues that plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of his former CAU police officer position and, therefore, plaintiff is not entitled to proceed on his ADA and PWDCRA discrimination claim. Plaintiff contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>that the EFL tasks are not essential to his former CAU position because that position is essentially clerical in nature. Alternatively, plaintiff argues that he can perform the EFL tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The circuit court dismissed plaintiffs case on summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10), concluding, as a matter of law, that the department is entitled to define the essential functions of a police officer position and that plaintiff failed to present prima facie evidence demonstrating that he is capable of performing those functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a determination regarding what constitutes the essential functions of a position and whether a plaintiff is capable of performing those essential functions must be made with a case-by-case examination of the particular circumstances involved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that while defendant had presented some evidence showing that the EFL tasks are essential to a police officer position, plaintiff presented evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether those functions are, in practice, essential to plaintiffs specific position with the CAU and whether plaintiff can perform the essential functions of his position despite his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">This case presents a question of statutory interpretation that is an issue of law reviewed de novo. <em>G C Timmis &amp; Co v Guardian Alarm Co, </em>468 Mich 416, 419; 662 NW2d 710 (2003). The grant or denial of summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10) is likewise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>reviewed de novo. <em>Maiden v Rozwood, </em>461 Mich 109, 118; 597 NW2d 817 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">A. OVERVIEW OF THE ADA</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The ADA was enacted by Congress in part \u201cto provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d 42 USC 12101(b)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>42 USC 12112(a), prohibiting employment discrimination, states that \u201cno covered entity\u00ae shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>A plaintiff alleging a violation of the ADA carries the burden of proving a prima facie case. <em>Doe v Univ of Maryland Medical Sys Corp, </em>50 F3d 1261, 1264-1265 (CA 4, 1995). To satisfy this burden, the plaintiff must first show that he is a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d entitled to the ADA\u2019s protections. 42 USC 12112(a). A \u201cdisability\u201d is defined under \u00a7 12102(2) as \u201c(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d is defined as \u201can individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d Section 12111(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">It is important to recognize that the ADA does not protect against discrimination based on <em>any </em>disabilities, but only against discrimination based on those disabilities (or perceived disabilities) that substantially limit at least one major life activity of the disabled individual, but that, with or without reasonable accommodation, do not prevent the disabled individual from performing the essential functions of the position held or sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">After the plaintiff presents sufficient evidence demonstrating that he is a \u201cqualified individual with a disability,\u201d his next burden lies in proving that his employer \u201cdiscriminated\u201d against him. The ADA broadly defines the term \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to prohibit employers from undertaking a variety of measures that adversely affect qualified individuals with disabilities. See \u00a7 12112(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Plaintiff in this case has alleged purposeful discrimination. In claims under the ADA alleging purposeful discrimination, once the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the plaintiffs evidence. <em>Raytheon Co v Hernandez, </em>540 US 44,_; 124 S Ct 513, 520; 157 L Ed 2d 357 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">B. OVERVIEW OF THE PWDCRA</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In <em>Chmielewski v Xermac, Inc, </em>457 Mich 593, 601; 580 NW2d 817 (1998), quoting <em>Allen v Southeastern Michigan Transportation Auth, </em>132 Mich App 533, 537-538; 349 NW2d 204 (1984), we stated that the Handicappers\u2019 Civil Rights Act (amended in 1998 and renamed the \u201cPersons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act\u201d) \u201c \u2018prohibits discrimination against individuals because of their handicapped status. The purpose of the act is to mandate \u2018the employment of the handicapped to the fullest extent reasonably possible.\u2019 \u201d Under MCL 37.1202(l)(a)-(e), which prohibit employment discrimination, an \u201cemployer\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> shall refrain from taking any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>a number of adverse employment actions against an individual \u201cbecause of a disability . . . that is unrelated [or not directly related] to the individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties or a particular job or position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The plaintiff bears the burden of proving a violation of the PWDCRA. \u201cTo prove a discrimination claim under the [PWDCRA], the plaintiff must show (1) that he is [disabled] as defined in the act, (2) that the [disability] is unrelated to his ability to perform his job duties, and (3) that he has been discriminated against in one of the ways delineated in the statute.\u201d <em>Chmielewski, supra </em>at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">A \u201cdisability,\u201d for purposes of article 2, MCL 37.1201-37.1214, is defined in MCL 37.1103(d) as: (i) \u201c[a] determinable physical or mental characteristic of an individual... if the characteristic: (A) . .. substantially limits 1 or more of the major life activities of that individual and is unrelated to the individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position . . . (ii) \u201c[a] history of [such a] determinable physical or mental characteristic . .. \u201d; or (iii) \u201c[b]eing regarded as having [such a] determinable physical or mental characteristic .. ..\u201d \u201c \u2018Unrelated to the individual\u2019s ability\u2019 means, with or without accommodation, an individual\u2019s disability does not prevent the individual from ... performing the duties of a particular job or position.\u201d MCL 37.1103(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Thus, like the ADA, the PWDCRA generally protects only against discrimination based on physical or mental disabilities that substantially limit a major life activity of the disabled individual, but that, with or without accommodation, do not prevent the disabled individual from performing the duties of a particular job. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>Sanchez v Lagoudakis (After Remand), </em>458 Mich 704, 715; 581 NW2d 257 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Once the plaintiff has proved that he is a \u201cqualified person with a disability\u201d protected by the PWDCRA, he must next demonstrate that he has been discriminated against in one of the ways set forth in MCL 37.1202. Like the ADA, the PWDCRA prohibits employers from taking any of a variety of measures that adversely affect protected individuals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">If the plaintiff presents a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination, the burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut such evidence. <em>Kerns v Dura Mechanical Components, Inc (On Remand), </em>242 Mich App 1, 12; 618 NW2d 56 (2000). See <em>also Hazle v Ford Motor Co, </em>464 Mich 456, 463-466; 628 NW2d 515 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">C. ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF A DETROIT POLICE OFFICER</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The dispute in this case primarily concerns whether the EFL tasks are essential to plaintiffs former police officer position.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If so, plaintiff must show that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>able, with or without accommodation, to perform these functions; otherwise, he may not proceed on a claim under either the ADA or the PWDCRA. If plaintiff shows that he is able to perform the essential functions of the position, he may proceed to demonstrate that the department discriminated against him in one of the ways set forth in the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">i. THE ADA</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Regarding what the \u201cessential functions\u201d of an employment position are, Congress specifically provided under the ADA that \u201cconsideration shall be given to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.\u201d 42 USC 12111(8).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) regulations provide that the term \u201cessential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>functions means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires. The term \u2018essential functions\u2019 does not include the marginal functions of the position.\u201d 29 CFR 1630.2(n)(l). A function may be essential if, inter aha:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">(i) [t]he reason the position exists is to perform that function; (ii) [there is a] limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed; and/or (iii) [t]he function [is] highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function. [29 CFR 1630.2(n)(2)(i)-(iii).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The EEOC regulations further provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(i) The employer\u2019s judgment as to which functions are essential; (ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; (iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function; (iv) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; (v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement; (vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or (vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. [29 CFR 1630.2(n)(3).][<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Because the plaintiff bears the overall burden of demonstrating under the ADA that he is a \u201cqualified individual with a disability,\u201d the burden of proving that a challenged function is not \u201cessential\u201d lies with the plaintiff. See <em>Laurin v Providence Hosp, </em>150 F3d 52 (CA 1, 1998). Further, a contrary position would be at odds with \u00a7 12111(8), which requires that \u201cconsideration shall be given to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are essential.. . .\u201d We find compelling the court\u2019s analysis of this issue in <em>Hamlin v Charter Twp of Flint, </em>942 F Supp 1129, 1138 (ED Mich, 1996), in which Judge Rosen stated succinctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">Pretty clearly, placing the burden on the employer to show a certain job function is essential would place courts and jurors in the position of second-guessing an employer\u2019s business judgment as to what the essential functions of a job are, without even requiring the plaintiff challenging the function to first come forward with evidence that the function is not essential.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>In analyzing whether the EFL tasks are \u201cessential\u201d to plaintiffs former position, the EEOC regulations suggest that courts must undertake a factual analysis of the relevant factors. The dominant consideration in this factual analysis is that plaintiff was a police officer. A police officer is a member of a profession charged with carrying out what arguably constitute primary functions of government, protecting the citizenry from criminals and preserving \u201cdomestic tranquility.\u201d A police officer performs functions that are indispensable to our free and ordered society. In Michigan, a police officer is \u201cresponsible for the prevention and detection of crime and the enforcement of the general criminal laws of this state.\u201d MCL 28.602(k)(i). A police officer is a member of a highly regulated profession, subject to a broad range of municipal and state rules and policies, not to mention the constraints of the federal and state constitutions. Each of these regulations is designed to ensure that a police officer performs the functions of his position within the boundaries of public policy. When the police officer acts outside these boundaries, adverse consequences may be considerable, including the failure to detect and apprehend criminals, the erosion of the freedoms of citizens, transgressions of the Constitution, and a general undermining of the well-being of society. As a police officer, plaintiff was entrusted with the full measure of the responsibilities of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The statutory law in Michigan further defines the role of a police officer, and provides guidance regarding the essential functions that enable a police officer to perform his duties. MCL 92.2, for example, provides that a city council, such as that of the city of Detroit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">may make and establish rules for the regulation and government of the police, prescribing and defining the powers and duties of policemen and nightwatchmen, and shall prescribe and enforce such police regulations as will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>most effectually preserve the peace and good order of the city, preserve the inhabitants from personal violence, and protect public and private property from destruction by fire and from unlawful depredation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Pursuant to these powers, the city of Detroit has given the department the authority to promulgate rules that will enable the department and its officers to effectively maintain the peace in the city. In response, the department promulgated the EFL.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the EFL was formulated in accordance with MCL 92.2 and with the purpose of satisfying the statutory obligations imposed on defendant and its police officers, the defendant\u2019s claim that the functions included in that list are \u201cessential\u201d to police officer positions is, in this Court\u2019s opinion, highly persuasive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Further, it is the \u201cduty of all sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, constables, <em>policemen </em>and public officers, to arrest and prosecute all persons of whose violation of the [Michigan Penal Code] they may have knowledge or reasonable notice, and for each neglect of such duty, the officer so offending shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d MCL 750.52 (emphasis added). MCL 479.13 provides that \u201cevery peace officer shall arrest, on sight or upon warrant, any person found violating or having violated, any provision of [the Motor Carrier Act]....\u201d See also MCL 765.26 and MCL 764.1b. Thus, the ability to effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>arrests is not only a duty arising from the police officer\u2019s general obligation to maintain the peace, but it is a duty specifically imposed on police officers. An officer who neglects to attempt to make an arrest where necessary has committed a criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">It is apparent that the EFL is a compilation of functions that the department expects an officer will be able to perform so that he may adequately \u201cpreserve the peace and good order of the city, preserve the inhabitants from personal violence, and protect public and private property from destruction by fire and from unlawful depredation,\u201d MCL 92.2, and thereby satisfy his professional and legal duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">As noted above, EEOC regulation 29 CFR 1630.2(n)(2)(i) provides that an alleged job function may be essential if \u201cthe reason the position exists is to perform the function....\u201d Accordingly, there is no question that the reason cities such as Detroit hire police officers and fund their positions is so that the officers will perform those functions necessary to adequately maintain the peace and enforce the laws of the community.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> MCL 92.2 grants municipalities the authority to prescribe and enforce police regulations that will most effectively serve these ends, and the department promulgated the EFL pursuant to this authority. Thus, the police officer positions exist specifically for the purpose of performing the very tasks identified in the EFL.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Further, EEOC regulation 29 CFR 1630.2(n)(2)(ii) provides that a function may be essential if there are a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u201climited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed . In fact, there is a highly limited number of police officers available among whom the performance of the EFL tasks can be distributed. Because of budgetary constraints, there is a limited number of officers that the department employs to effectively police and patrol the entire city of Detroit, a city of nearly one million people that serves as the center of a metropolitan area of more than four million people and that functions as an international gateway into the United States.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Additionally, EEOC regulation 29 CFR 1630.2(n)(2)(iii) provides that a function may be essential if it is \u201chighly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function.\u201d In fact, because of the nature of the obligations under which police officers labor, the police officer position involves highly specialized responsibilities such that new officers are hired specifically for their ability to perform the EFL tasks.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Only a small portion of the overall population would be physically and otherwise equipped to carry out such responsibilities. Thus, the EEOC regulations at 29 CFR 1630.2(n)(2) lead to the conclusion that the EFL tasks constitute essential functions of a police officer position.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">As further noted above, EEOC regulation 29 CFR 1630.2(n)(3) provides a nonexhaustive list of factors that may be considered in determining a position\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>essential functions. The first factor is \u201c[t]he employer\u2019s judgment....\u201d Section 1630.2(n)(3)(i). This factor has already been discussed and clearly does not weigh in favor of plaintiffs argument. The second factor, \u201c [written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job,\u201d \u00a7 1630.2(n)(3)(ii), is not relevant in this case because neither side has presented evidence relating to any job description prepared <em>before </em>plaintiff was hired. However, because the written job description currently used by the department includes the EFL tasks, and because, at least since 1975, the department has maintained a written job description that includes many tasks similar to those on the EFL, this factor too does not appear to weigh in plaintiffs favor. Another EEOC factor is \u201c[t]he consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function ....\u201d Section 1630.2(n)(3)(iv). If defendant, rather than plaintiff, is correct in its assessment of the necessary functions of the police officer position, then the consequences of siding with the plaintiff would potentially exact a considerable cost on the ability of defendant to carry out its responsibilities. As earlier noted, the duties of the police officer position are essential to carrying out what is arguably the primary function of government, protecting the citizenry from criminals and preserving \u201cdomestic tranquility.\u201d Thus, this factor likewise does not weigh in plaintiffs favor. Another EEOC factor refers to the \u201cterms of a collective bargaining agreement [CBA]....\u201d Section 1630.2(n)(3)(v). Plaintiff notes that there is nothing in the CBA that prevents the department from employing individuals with disabilities or making accommodations for these individuals. Although that may be the case, there has been no evidence presented to this Court that a decision by the department to <em>refrain </em>from doing so violates the CBA. Thus, this factor also does not weigh in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>This leaves three remaining factors from the EEOC nonexhaustive list to consider, all of which are relied on by plaintiff in support of his case. These are \u201c[t]he amount of time spent on the job performing the function,\u201d \u201c[t]he work experience of past incumbents in the job,\u201d and \u201c[t]he current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.\u201d Section 1630.2(n)(3)(iii), (vi),, (vii). These three factors implicate similar considerations. Plaintiff claims that in his CAU position, he was never called upon to perform the EFL tasks and that other employees in similar positions were likewise not required to perform these tasks. Thus, plaintiff argues that the EFL tasks are not \u201cessential functions\u201d of his and similar positions. Were this Court to agree with this analysis, we would effectively be eviscerating the CAU and other similar positions of their \u201cpolice officer\u201d significance. We decline to do this because the fact remains that these positions are advertised as police officer positions, hired as police officer positions, supervised as police officer positions, governed by laws pertaining to police officer positions, and subject to the terms and benefits of police officer positions. Further, such positions are supported by public funds appropriated for the employment of police officers and they must be filled by applicants who satisfy the standards for police officers. Moreover, to ensure satisfaction of its critical public obligations, the department has determined that all Detroit police officers, including those who need not regularly engage in patrol functions, must be constantly capable of performing those functions during times of riots or crises, or special circumstances, such as the recent electrical blackout or, more predictably, during large special event gatherings, such as the Detroit Thanksgiving Day parade, the Fourth of July fireworks, or major sporting events such as the upcoming Super Bowl. While it may be true that plaintiff, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>other individual officers, have been rarely called on to perform EFL tasks, this does not obviate the fact that these tasks remain essential to the police officer position.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Accordingly, under the relevant EEOC standards, there is no genuine question of material fact presented in the record before us that the EFL tasks are essential to plaintiffs former police officer position.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition on this issue in favor of defendant. Unless plaintiff can, with or without reasonable accommodation, perform the EFL tasks, his claim under the ADA must be dismissed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">ii. THE PWDCEA</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The Court of Appeals noted in its opinion that \u201c[t]he ADA\u2019s \u2018qualified\u2019 language and the PWDCRA\u2019s \u2018disability\u2019 language require essentially the same analysis .. . [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the result under either statute is the same.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We agree that both statutes require <em>essentially </em>the same analysis, and in the predominant number of cases, the result under either statute may well be the same. However, because the acts are not identical, and because federal laws and regulations are not binding authority on a Michigan court interpreting a Michigan statute, we caution against simply assuming that the PWDCRA analysis will invariably parallel that of the ADA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Unlike the ADA, the PWDCRA does not provide specific guidance regarding what the <em>duties of a particular job </em>are. Thus, the task falls upon the judiciary to determine how to resolve relevant disputes in the absence of a more specific legislative directive. In doing this, we take into account a number of considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">First, we take cognizance of the obvious fact that there is statutory silence on this matter in the PWDCRA and that something more than silence is required, in our judgment, to warrant redefining the role of the employer in determining the scope of job positions within its purview. That is, there is no indication anywhere in the PWDCRA that the employer\u2019s customary responsibilities in this regard were to be altered by the act, and we decline to read any such indication from the act\u2019s silence. Therefore, in the absence of any contrary indication, we believe that the customary responsibilities of the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ployer in defining the scope of job positions are unaffected by the act and that the judgment of the employer in terms of such scope is entitled to substantial deference by the courts under the PWDCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Second, we take into consideration that the PWDCRA is an <em>antidiscrimination </em>statute. It is not a statute designed to regulate, or to set governmental standards for, particular employment positions. Nor is it a statute designed to enable judges to second-guess, or to improve upon, the business judgments of employers. Rather, the PWDCRA\u2019s purpose is to ensure that \u201c[t]he opportunity to obtain employment. . . without discrimination because of a disability\u201d is established as a protected civil right. MCL 37.1102(1). In order to avoid transforming the PWDCRA from an antidiscrimination statute into something that is unwarrantedly broader, we believe that the judgment of the employer regarding the duties of a given job position is entitled to substantial deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Third, our analysis regarding what constitute the \u201cduties of a particular job\u201d is premised on an assumption that the employer is the single most interested person in the world in the success of his business. Therefore, as a general matter, it can reasonably be expected that the functions or duties that the employer specifies for a given position will be those reasonably well-designed to effect the success of such business. It is contrary to the economic interests of a reasonable employer to define a job position in a manner that is either inadequate or irrelevant. While the employer\u2019s own judgment about the duties of a job position will not always be dispositive, it is nonetheless always entitled to substantial deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Finally, in <em>Chmielewski </em>we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>in interpreting provisions of the HCRA [the former PWDCRA], analogous federal precedents are persuasive, although not necessarily binding....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">Because the HCRA definition [of disability] mirrors that of the ADA, we examine federal law for guidance. <em>[Chmielewski, supra </em>at 601-604 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Accordingly, because the PWDCRA and the ADA are similar in purpose, and generally require similar proofs, we examine the ADA for guidance. The ADA specifically provides that the employer\u2019s judgment regarding what functions of a job are essential shall be given consideration. This is the only such provision in the ADA. As earlier noted, see n 10, it is our judgment that this provision reflects a general congressional affirmation of the right of employers to determine what the essential functions of any particular employment position are. While we do not accept as dispositive in interpreting the PWDCRA the EEOC regulations pertaining to the ADA, see n 11, we do believe that the explicit emphasis set forth in the ADA itself suggests the extent of the deference due the employer\u2019s own judgment in determining the duties of a job under the PWDCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Thus, we hold that, in disputes regarding what the duties of a particular job are, the employer\u2019s judgment is entitled to substantial deference. Consistent with the plaintiffs burden of proving discrimination under the PWDCRA, the plaintiff bears the burden of presenting sufficient evidence to overcome this deference. Unless the plaintiff can satisfy this burden, it is to be presumed that the employer\u2019s judgment concerning the duties of a particular job is reasonable. In such circumstances, the plaintiff must prove that he can, with or without accommodation, perform those duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Accordingly, the department\u2019s judgment that the EFL tasks are duties of plaintiffs former police officer position is entitled to considerable deference. Plaintiff here has not sustained his burden of demonstrating that the department\u2019s judgment in this regard is not reasonable. Thus, we hold that the EFL tasks are \u201cjob duties\u201d of a city of Detroit police officer position under the PWDCRA. Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals reversal of the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition for defendant on this issue. Unless plaintiff can, with or without accommodation, perform these functions, his claim under the PWDCRA must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">D. ABILITY TO PERFORM ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Defendant moved for summary disposition of plaintiffs entire case, arguing that plaintiff is unable to perform the EFL tasks and, therefore, is not entitled to proceed on his ADA and PWDCRA claims. To overcome defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff bears the burden of raising a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he can perform the EFL tasks. Unless plaintiff can satisfy this burden, summary disposition in defendant\u2019s favor is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In our judgment, the evidence supports summary disposition. After plaintiff suffered a heart attack and was diagnosed with heart disease, his physician released him to work on restricted duty only. Accordingly, plaintiff spent the majority of his career as a desk clerk.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The record indicates that for approximately ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>years, there was never a question that plaintiff s heart condition prevented him from performing the full range of duties normally required of police officers. This is precisely why plaintiffs physician placed him on restricted duty and why he remained in a nonpatrol, desk-clerk position for ten years. Plaintiffs own counsel admitted to the trial court that plaintiff, because of his heart condition, cannot perform regular patrol functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In attempting to withstand defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff argues that the department failed to undertake an individualized assessment of his condition before placing him on disability retirement in 1995, and, therefore, that a genuine question of material fact necessarily remains regarding whether he can perform the EFL tasks. However, in light of the circumstances of plaintiffs employment history and the nature of his medical condition, we believe that the department was not required to perform an individualized assessment of plaintiffs condition beyond those assessments that were routinely carried out. Department physicians examined plaintiff and consulted the medical records prepared by plaintiffs own physicians. Plaintiffs medical records indicated, as would be expected, that plaintiffs heart condition continued to persist. Under such circumstances, it would be pointless to require the department, before placing plaintiff on disability retirement, to have him undertake agility tests in order to determine whether he could perform the EFL tasks. Such tests would essentially require plaintiff to perform those very tasks that, because of his heart condition, his medical records indicated he was to refrain from performing. When the department stated in 1995 that plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of a police officer position, it was relying on evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>that already had been conclusively established by plaintiffs own medical records and accepted as the truth by all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Plaintiff has presented evidence that he chased down a purse-snatcher on foot approximately fifteen years ago. This evidence perhaps demonstrates that plaintiff is not incapable of performing on a sporadic basis individual EFL tasks. However, in light of the substantial contrary evidence reflected in plaintiffs medical records and by ten years of employment history, that evidence does not create a genuine question of material fact regarding whether plaintiff is capable of performing the essential functions of a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Accordingly, in light of the evidence in support of summary disposition, the evidence presented by plaintiff does not raise a genuine question of material fact. Because the record establishes that plaintiff is unable to perform the EFL tasks, he may not proceed on his ADA and PWDCRA claims. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In conclusion, plaintiff has raised no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the EFL tasks are \u201cessential functions\u201d of his former police officer position. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals on this question, and we reinstate the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">We further hold that plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he is able to perform the essential functions of a police officer position.

In holding that no transfer was required, we stated that \u201can individual is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>handicapped even if some accommodation is necessary to allow that individual to perform the duties of a particular job or position,\u201d but that \u201cthe existence of a [disability is] determined with reference to the job actually held or applied for----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 33.

MCR 2.116(0(10), (G)(4). <em>Quinto v Cross &amp; Peters Co, </em>451 Mich 358; 547 NW2d 314 (1996).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EEOC INTERPRETIVE GUIDELINES</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The majority describes the statutory framework of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 USC 12101 <em>et seq., </em>and the Michigan Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.1101 <em>et seq. </em>It disregards the Interpretive Guidelines promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). These guidelines are valuable in clarifying that the \u201cessential functions\u201d of a police officer must be essential in reality, not just on paper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">The inquiry into whether a particular function is essential initially focuses on whether the employer actually requires employees in the position to perform the functions that the employer asserts are essential. For example, an employer may state that typing is an essential function of a position. If, in fact, the employer has never required any employee in that particular position to type, this will be evidence that typing is not actually an essential function of the position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">It is important to note that the inquiry into essential functions is not intended to second guess an employer\u2019s business judgment with regard to production standards, whether qualitative or quantitative, nor to require employers to lower such standards. (See \u00a7 1630.10 Qualification Standards, Tests and Other Selection Criteria). If an employer requires its typists to be able to accurately type 75 words per minute, it will not be called upon to explain why an inaccurate work product, or a typing speed of 65 words per minute, would not be adequate. Similarly, if a hotel requires its service workers to thoroughly clean 16 rooms per day, it will not have to explain why it requires thorough cleaning, or why it chose a 16 room rather than a 10 room requirement. <em>However, if an employer does require accurate 75 word per minute typing or the thorough cleaning of 16 rooms, it will have to show that it </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>actually imposes such requirements on its employees in </em>fact, <em>and not simply on paper. </em>[29 CFK Pt 1630, App 1630.2(n) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The EEOC Interpretive Guidelines render the question of what comprises the essential functions of a job a factual matter. In addition, the language cited suggests that it is the employer who must show that the purported \u201cessential functions\u201d of a job are imposed uniformly.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">THE APPROPRIATE BURDEN OF PROOF</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">With respect to which party bears the burden of proving the essential nature of the disputed \u201cessential functions,\u201d the majority finds persuasive the analysis of a federal district court. It disregards rulings by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that the burden is on the employer. See <em>Monette v Electronic Data Sys Corp, </em>90 F3d 1173, 1179-1180, 1184-1185 (CA 6, 1996), and <em>Hamlin v Charter Twp of Flint, </em>165 F3d 426, 429-431 (CA 6, 1999). I find the Sixth Circuit analysis more soundly grounded in the EEOC\u2019s Interpretive Guidelines and more compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">A CASE-BY-CASE ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In formulating its opinion, the majority considers the job requirements <em>for </em>a department\u2019s police officers in general terms. The consideration should be focused, instead, case by case, on the essential functions of an officer in the plaintiffs position. Other courts reviewing ADA claims against law enforcement agencies have taken the latter approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>For example, in <em>Champ v Baltimore Co,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff did not prevail because the defendant showed that he could not perform essential duties that actually were required of all officers. Plaintiff had lost the complete use of one arm and could not drive a vehicle under emergency conditions or effectuate a forcible arrest. He was not proficient with a firearm. The department provided evidence that all officers were subject to reassignment at any time and that nonpatrol officers actually were reassigned to patrol in emergencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Similarly, in <em>Shoemaker v Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm </em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court considered the small size of the police department and the actual duties of its officers in determining that all officers were required to perform patrol work. The plaintiff could not do that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In <em>Dorris v </em>Kentwood,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a Michigan federal district court refused to grant summary disposition in favor of the defendant police department. There, the officer offered evidence that his position as an in-school instructor did not require the strenuous physical exertion demanded of a patrol officer. In each of the cases, the department was obligated to come forward with evidence that in practice all of its officers were required to perform the activities that it demanded of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The proper factual analysis is set forth at 29 CFR pt 1630.2(n). The trial court in this case failed to engage in that analysis. Rather, it decided that public policy considerations required that defendant be insulated from judicial review of the \u201cessential functions\u201d that it had established for its officers. It ignored that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>has raised a question of fact regarding whether those functions were uniformly applied to all officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNIFORMLY APPLIED IN PRACTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In this case, for ten years after plaintiffs physician placed him on restrictive duty status, he worked for defendant, a large, urban police department that was divided into many subdivisions. Eventually, he successfully bid for both A-clerk and Crime Analysis Unit (CAU) positions. He won these positions without regard to his medical condition. Neither required the physical capabilities of a patrol officer. After plaintiff had served three years in the CAU, defendant forced him into involuntary disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Defendant asserts that plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his job. As evidence of its definition of essential functions, defendant relies on a Michigan Law Enforcement Officer Training Commission list that it had adopted. See <em>ante </em>at 198-199. However, plaintiff provided testimony that full-duty officers were not routinely evaluated to determine whether they could perform all the tasks on the list. Further evidence demonstrated that defendant continued to employ others, including a wheelchair-bound officer, who also could not perform all the tasks on the essential functions list.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">There is precedent for adopting plaintiffs position that, to establish grounds for dismissal, essential functions must be uniformly applied in practice to all. The court in the case of <em>Simon v St Louis Co, Mo,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>faced a situation similar to the instant one. After the plaintiffs dismissal, other disabled officers remained at work as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>commissioned police officers. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit remanded the case to the district court with the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">On remand, the district court should consider whether the requirements for police officers of St. Louis County, as testified to at trial by Colonel Kleinknecht, are reasonable, legitimate, and necessary requirements for all positions within the department. The district court should determine whether the ability to make a forceful arrest and the ability to perform all of the duties of all of the positions within the department are in fact uniformly required of all officers. If not uniformly required, they should not be considered actual requirements for all positions. <em>[Id. </em>at 321.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In <em>Simon, </em>the plaintiff police officer presented evidence that the defendant police department\u2019s physical requirements for officers were not actually applied to all officers. This case is similar to <em>Simon </em>in that Officer Peden presented evidence that the department\u2019s essential functions were not, in fact, required of all but were selectively required.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization, I do not imply that every officer must spend the same percentage of time on every task on the essential functions list. Rather, if all the tasks are applicable to all the officers, as the police department asserts, then all tasks must actually be considered when assessing the ability of any officer. If one officer is subject to forced disability retirement because he cannot perform an essential function, then all officers who cannot perform that function should be forced to retire.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The difficulty that plaintiff raises here is that, although the department asserts that all officers must satisfy all tasks on the list, that assertion may not be true in practice. In accordance with the EEOC Interpretive Guidelines, we should not defer to an essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>function if it is essential only on paper. Given that plaintiff has offered evidence that officers who cannot perform the essential functions are still employed by the department, summary disposition should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I agree with the majority that the courts should give deference to the descriptions given by police departments of the essential functions of their officers\u2019 jobs. However, I do not believe that the deference should be absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">To constitute a basis for dismissal, the essential functions must be uniformly applied to all police officers. The burden is on the department, if challenged, to make this showing. In this case, plaintiff raises the issue whether defendant viewed the tasks on its essential functions list as applicable to all positions within the police department and uniformly required them.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Consequently, summary dismissal of plaintiffs claim was not appropriate. While it is unknown whether plaintiff would prevail at trial, he has provided enough evidence to escape summary disposition. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-9\">CAVANAGH and WEAVER, JJ., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> 884 F Supp 991 (D Md, 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> 160 Pa Cmwlth 216; 634 A2d 772 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\"> 1994 US Dist LEXIS 15640; 1994 WL 762219, 4 Am Disabilities Cas (BNA) 741 (WD Mich, 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> 656 F2d 316, 320 (CA 8, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
