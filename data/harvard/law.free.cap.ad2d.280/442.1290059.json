Each contract provided that a failure to close on any one of them would be a default on all three. Each contract also included a liquidated damages clause. Pursuant to the terms of the contract for the purchase of the restaurant, the plaintiffs Marie Beninati and Lee I. Beninati were required to sign personal guarantees. When the parties met at the scheduled closing, Mr. Beninati refused to sign the guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The plaintiffs willfully defaulted on all three contracts when Mr. Beninati refused to execute a personal guarantee. Pursuant to the terms of those contracts, the defendants deemed the down payment to be liquidated damages and retained it. Under these circumstances, we agree with the Supreme Court that the defendants were entitled to retain the down payment as liquidated damages (see, <em>Maxton Bldrs. v Lo Galbo, </em>68 NY2d 373), and the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Friedmann, J. P., McGinity, Feuerstein and Smith, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
