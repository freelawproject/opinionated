The accident occurred when Bracisco\u2019s plane crashed into a tree near his home on a flight from Hayward to Middletown on December 23, 1972. Bracisco\u2019s widow and children (plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>tiffs) brought the instant wrongful death action alleging negligence and strict liability in tort against the plane\u2019s manufacturer, Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech), its subsidiary Beechcraft West, Richard H. Dederian, owner of \u201cFlight Care\u201d airplane maintenance facility, and Shell Oil Company, supplier of the plane\u2019s gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The case proceeded to trial by jury. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case the trial court granted Shell Oil Company\u2019s motion for nonsuit. At the completion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of each of the remaining defendants, specifically finding Beech was not negligent or strictly liable for Bracisco\u2019s death. Plaintiffs appeal solely from the judgment entered in favor of Beech on the strict liability claim which was premised on the charge the plane was defectively designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Evidence introduced at trial can be summarized as follows: Bracisco worked in San Francisco and would fly home to Middletown on the weekends. It was his custom, upon arriving in Middletown, to circle the valley where his house was located before landing at the local airport. On the day of the accident several witnesses saw and heard Bracisco\u2019s plane before it crashed. Bracisco\u2019s plane approached the valley in a descending left turn. There was conflicting testimony regarding whether or not the plane\u2019s engine was fully audible during Bracisco\u2019s descent. Some witnesses testified they could hear the engine, but it was running slow, decelerating. One of these witnesses testified there was a sudden surge of engine power split seconds before the crash. At least one eyewitness testified the plane\u2019s engine was clearly audible at full power during its descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Expert testimony regarding the cause of the crash was also in conflict. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert testified the accident occurred as a result of \u201cunporting\u201d of the left fuel tank during the plane\u2019s descending left turn, resulting in a loss of engine power. \u201cUnporting\u201d occurs when the plane\u2019s nose is allowed to drop below the horizon and the fuel sloshes forward in the tank and away from the fuel line port or pickup outlet leading to the engine. The resulting diminishing fuel supply causes the engine to slow down, idle and eventually stop. Under this theory, Bracisco struggled during his descent to get fuel back to the\" engine but succeeded in doing so only moments before impact. Plaintiffs claimed \u201cunporting\u201d occurred due to defective design of the plane\u2019s fuel tanks. They also claimed Beech was aware the unporting problem rendered the plane unsafe, but failed to give adequate instructions, directions or warnings in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Beech\u2019s experts opined the cause of the crash was an \u201caccelerated stall\u201d from which Bracisco was unable to recover. A \u201cstall\u201d in aeronautical terms refers to a situation where a plane moves too slowly to maintain adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>lift on the wings so that the plane begins to fall rather than fly or glide. An \u201caccelerated stall\u201d occurs when as the result of a sharp turn, centrifugal force makes the plane \u201cheavier\u201d and the minimum speed needed to keep the wings lifted is increased. Failing to maintain the needed speed under the circumstances resulted in the crash. Beech\u2019s position was that the crash was not caused by defective design but by Bracisco\u2019s error in piloting the plane.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In instructing the jury, the trial court gave a modified version of BAJI No. 2.60<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> regarding plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 burden of proof for each of the alleged strict liability and negligence claims. This instruction was followed by a modified version of BAJI No. 9.00.5 defining design defect,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and by plaintiffs\u2019 special instruction No. 22<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> providing a product is defective if warnings are required in order to make it safe and these are not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 principal contention on appeal is that the version of BAJI No. 2.60 which the court gave the jury erroneously stated plaintiffs\u2019 burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>proof regarding defective design under <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 413, 432 [143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1]. They claim this error was prejudicial and requires reversal in light of the instruction\u2019s misleading effect, Beech\u2019s counsel\u2019s reliance upon it in his closing argument, and the fact there was a great degree of conflict in the evidence regarding defective design. We find this contention meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">I. <em>Waiver of error.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">II. <em>BAJI No. 2.60, as given, was prejudicial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co., supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 413, held a product may be found defective in design under either of two alternative tests: \u201cFirst, ... if the plaintiff establishes that the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. Second, ... if the plaintiff demonstrates that the product\u2019s design proximately caused his injury and the defendant fails to establish, in light of the relevant factors, that, on balance, the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">In the present case, the version of BAJI No. 2.60 given to the jury listed seven issues which plaintiffs had the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence. It also stated defendant Beech had the burden to show the benefits of the challenged design outweighed its concomitant risks. More importantly, it did not, however, specify that <em>not all </em>of the seven listed elements need be proven by the plaintiffs in order to establish a prima facie case of defective design.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It also failed to specify under what circumstances the burden shifts to defendant to show the benefits inherent in the defective design outweigh its risks. Although BAJI No. 2.60 abstractly listed each party\u2019s burden of proof, it failed to put the listed issues into perspective under Barker\u2019s alternative defective design tests. This failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>correctly allocate the prescribed burdens rendered the given instructions erroneous and misleading. The instruction given by the court imposed upon plaintiffs a burden of proof on the issues more onerous than that which they were otherwise required to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We must now determine whether this instructional error was prejudicial. Error is considered prejudicial \u201c[wjhere it seems probable that the jury\u2019s verdict may have been based on the erroneous instruction. . . .\u201d <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Cable </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 425, 428 [11 Cal.Rptr. 377, 359 P.2d 929]; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Harnischfeger Corp. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 663, 670 [117 Cal.Rptr. 1, 527 P.2d 353].) Whether \u201cthe probable effect of the instruction has been to mislead the jury . . . depends on all the circumstances of the case, including the evidence and the other instructions given.\u201d <em>(Butigan </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 652, 660-661 [320 P.2d 500, 65 A.L.R.2d 1]; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Harnischfeger Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at pp. 670-671; see also <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59, 72 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022].)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">\u201cWhile there is no precise formula for measuring the effect of an erroneous instruction [citation], a number of factors are considered in measuring prejudice: (1) the degree of conflict in the evidence on critical issues [citations]; (2) whether respondent\u2019s argument to the jury may have contributed to the instruction\u2019s misleading effect [citation]; (3) whether the jury requested a rereading of the erroneous instruction [citation] or of related evidence [citation]; (4) the closeness of the jury\u2019s verdict [citation]; and (5) the effect of other instructions in remedying the error [citations]. \u201d <em>(LeMons </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 869, 876 [148 Cal.Rptr. 355, 582 P.2d 946].)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Mindful of these principles we proceed to review the case at bar. Initially we note the evidence introduced at trial was particularly conflicting on the determinative issues necessary to prove defective design: whether the plane failed to satisfy ordinary consumer expectations as to safety in its intended or reasonably foreseeable operation; whether safety instructions or warnings regarding the alleged defectively designed fuel tank were required, and if so whether they were given; and whether the alleged defective design was the proximate cause of the crash. In this context we note that although the jury was given a special verdict, only one of these theories of defective design (whether defective design was the proximate cause of decedent\u2019s death) was presented to it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is impossible to estimate how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>jury would have resolved the other defective design issues had it been properly instructed on the burden of proof law and specifically asked to resolve them. In such circumstances the court \u201c \u2018should not speculate upon the basis of the verdict.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Luque </em>v. <em>McLean </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 136, 147 [104 Cal.Rptr. 443, 501 P.2d 1163]; <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Owen </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 484, 507 [139 Cal.Rptr. 494].)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">We next note Beech\u2019s counsel\u2019s closing argument intensified the detrimental potential of the erroneous instruction. Counsel not only read to the jury the portion of the improper instruction pertaining to plaintiff\u2019s burden of proving the seven listed issues (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>but structured his whole closing argument around these issues referring to them cumulatively without mentioning <em>Barker\u2019s </em>alternative defective design tests.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In light of this argument and the giving of modified BAJI 2.60, it is very probable the jury could have been misled into believing plaintiffs could not establish a case of defective design unless each one of the seven listed issues had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. As aptly noted in <em>Moreno </em>v. <em>Fey Manufacturing Corp. </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 23, 27-28 [196 Cal.Rptr. 487], \u201c[a]ll instructions to the jury are important, so that careful and conscientious jurors can apply the proper law to the facts they find to have been proven. However, few instructions are of greater importance than that which informs the jury which party bears the burden of proof on the issues in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We lastly look at the effect of other instructions in curing the error. Modified BAJI No. 9.00.5 correctly instructed the jurors on <em>Barker\u2019s </em>alternative tests (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>and plaintiffs\u2019 special instruction No. 22 correctly defined defective design in terms of failure to give required safety warnings (see fn. 3, <em>ante). </em>While these instructions correctly stated the law, they did not cure the error, since they did not address the issue of plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof. Furthermore, to the extent these instructions could be interpreted to refer to plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof, they presented the jury with inconsistent and confusing statements of the law vis-a-vis modified BAJI No. 2.60. We cannot assume the jury ignored modified BAJI No. 2.60 and based its defective design verdict solely on these other correct statements of the law. \u201c \u2018The prejudicial effect of a <em>misstatement </em>of an <em>important principle of law </em>cannot easily be overcome by another declaration contradicting it. The jury are bound (and so instructed) to accept the court\u2019s instructions as correct statements of the law. . . . They are likely to be confused and misled by the conflicting statements, and it is not easy to determine which charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>controlled their determination.\u2019\u201d <em>(Henderson </em>v. <em>Harnischfeger Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 673, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In light of these factors and our examination of the entire record, we conclude the probable effect of the erroneous instruction was to mislead the jury. Accordingly, we conclude the error was prejudicial and the judgment should be reversed on the strict liability cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">HI. <em>Negligence per se instructions.</em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Judgment in favor of defendant Beech Aircraft Corporation on the strict liability cause of action is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Poch\u00e9, Acting P.
