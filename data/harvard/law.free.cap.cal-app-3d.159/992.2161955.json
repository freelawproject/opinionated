Code, \u00a7 10851), possessing a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377), and receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which he admitted had a value in excess of $25,000 (\u00a7 12022.6, subd. (a)). Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction which ensued, contending (1) that the trial court erred in enhancing the principal term of his sentence pursuant to section 12022.6, and (2) that the trial court abused its discretion by not striking that enhancement on its own motion. We find these contentions to be without merit and will therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The judgment of conviction based upon defendant\u2019s pleas of guilty represents the culmination of five separate criminal actions against defendant. In the interests of clarity and a complete understanding of what happened in the trial court, it is necessary to review the full panoply of the criminal proceedings pending against defendant at the time he entered his pleas of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">In action No. 77351, defendant was charged by information with taking and driving a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851); driving that vehicle \u201cin wilful and wanton disregard for the safety of persons and property\u201d (id., \u00a7 23103); resisting a public officer in the discharge of a duty of his office (\u00a7 148); and failing to stop after being involved in an automobile accident (Veh. Code, \u00a7 20002), the last three offenses being charged as misdemeanors. Defendant entered pleas of not guilty to these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>In action No. 79319, defendant was charged by information with possession of \u201ca controlled substance, to wit: Phencyclidine,\u201d in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11377. Defendant also entered a plea of not guilty to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In action No. 82376, defendant was charged by information with one count of burglary (\u00a7 459); one count of grand theft (\u00a7\u00a7 484, 487); three counts of taking and driving a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851); one count of forgery (\u00a7 470); two counts of receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496), both of which included an allegation that during the commission of the offense defendant \u201ctook, destroyed or damaged\u201d property whose loss was in excess of $25,000 (\u00a7 12022.6, subd. (a)); one count of failing to stop after being involved in an automobile accident (Veh. Code, \u00a7 20002), and one count of resisting a public officer in the discharge of a duty of his office (\u00a7 148), the last two offenses being charged as misdemeanors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In action No. 78429, defendant was charged by information with burglary (\u00a7 459). Finally, defendant was charged by a criminal complaint filed in the municipal court (docket No. C8264763) with two counts of having committed an assault with a deadly weapon or instrument (\u00a7 245) and one count of mayhem (\u00a7 203).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">It therefore appears that as of February 1982 defendant was facing possible trial in five criminal actions on fourteen felonies and five misdemeanors. Defendant was also the subject of criminal proceedings in yet another criminal action which is not pertinent to this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">At a hearing conducted on February 23, 1982, the trial court outlined the terms of a negotiated disposition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">\u201cThe Court: This matter involves four docket numbers: 77351, 78429, 79319, which are all Superior Court cases that were sent to this department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>for trial. In addition thereto, we have a case bearing a Municipal Court docket number C8266872 [action No. 82376], which has a complaint which has been filed, and it\u2019s my understanding, in order to accommodate everyone, what we\u2019re going to do today, you will stipulate that in the Municipal Court matter I may sit as a magistrate and arraign Mr. Loera, take the preliminary waiver and also take his plea. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">\u201cMr. Johnson: That\u2019s correct, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">\u201cMr. Schori: So stipulated, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\u201cThe Court: All right. And this is the disposition in the case: Mr. Loera will plead guilty to the Municipal Court complaint, and that will be Count 3, which is a violation of Penal Code Section 496; in addition thereto, he will admit the excessive taking or damage or destruction clause, which will mean an additional year. This case will be the principal term. So, he will have a four-year term imposed for this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201cThen he will plead guilty to Count 1 in Information number 77351, which is a violation of Vehicle Code Section 10851, and that will run consecutive. So, it will be four years and eight months. Then he will plead guilty to Count 1, a violation of Health and Safety Code Section 11377A in Information number 79319, and an additional eight months will be imposed consecutive, for a total term of five years and four months in state prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">\u201cOnce he does that, the district attorney will dismiss all the remaining counts and, in addition thereto, will dismiss in total Information number 78429. Now, was that the disposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">\u201cMr. Schori: That\u2019s correct, your Honor. Steven Schori, Deputy District Attorney, appearing for the People. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">\u201cThe Court: . . . Was that your understanding of the disposition, Mr. Johnson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-11\">\u201cMr. Johnson: Yes, it is, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-12\">\u201cThe Court: And Mr. Loera, is that your understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">The trial court thereupon arraigned defendant on municipal court docket No. C8266872; advised him of his rights and the consequences of guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>pleas with regard to all actions; accepted his pleas of guilty<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and his admission of the section 12022.6 enhancement in accordance with the negotiated disposition; accepted the parties\u2019 stipulations that defendant\u2019s pleas and his admission of the enhancement were supported by a factual basis; and set a date for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">On April 23, 1982, the trial court sentenced defendant to state prison for a term of two years on count three of action No. 82376, with an additional term of one year for the enhancement pursuant to section 12022.6, subdivision (a), and consecutive eight-month terms for count one of action No. 77351 and count one of action No. 79319, for a total aggregate sentence of four years and four months. On motion of the prosecutor and in conformity with the negotiated disposition, the remaining charges against defendant were then ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Defendant filed a notice of appeal in which he stated that his appeal from the judgment was based solely on grounds occurring after entry of his pleas of guilty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 31(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Both of defendant\u2019s contentions on this appeal relate to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s imposition of the one-year enhancement term pursuant to section 12022.6, subdivision (a),  His first contention, which is comprised of imprecisely framed and occasionally contradictory arguments, is a general claim that this statute cannot be used to enhance a sentence for receiving stolen property. We will examine the history, language, and purpose of section 12022.6 and conclude that this contention must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">As previously recited, defendant admitted the enhancement allegation as part of the negotiated disposition. In addition, he made no objection when he was sentenced in accordance with section 12022.6, subdivision (a). We were therefore concerned as to whether defendant may have waived his right to challenge the sentence.  It is apparent from defendant\u2019s brief, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>ever, that he is in effect contending that the sentence imposed was unlawful. The imposition of a sentence which is unlawful, and consequently void, is a jurisdictional defect subject to correction whenever it comes to the attention of either a trial court or a reviewing court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753, 763 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289]; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 816, 818-819 [166 Cal.Rptr. 795]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walling </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 893, 896 [164 Cal.Rptr. 681]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Crowson </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 623, 627, fn. 3 [190 Cal.Rptr. 165, 660 P.2d 389].) We therefore conclude that defendant is not precluded from pressing his contention by virtue of his admission and previous inaction, or by his failure to secure a certificate of probable cause ordinarily required by section 1237.5. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 571, 574 [58 Cal.Rptr. 313, 426 P.2d 881]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pinon </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 904, 910 [158 Cal.Rptr. 425].)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Section 12022.6 was added to the Penal Code as part of the 1976 enactment commonly known as the determinate sentencing law. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 305.5, p. 5162.) In its original version, the statute provided for enhancement of the sentence imposed for any felony except robbery, arson, or burglary, if the elements of the offense involved \u201cA taking or damage\u201d of funds or property in excess of either $100,000 or $500,000, with the length of the enhancement term to be fixed in relation to a specified percentage of \u201cthe base term selected by the [trial] judge.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See Cassou &amp; Taugher, <em>Determinate Sentencing in California: The New Numbers Game </em>(1978) 9 Pacific L.J. 5, 44.) Section 12022.6 was amended the following year by an enactment (Stats. 1977, ch. 165, \u00a7 93, p. 679) which made significant modifications in the scope and effect in the statute. In the words of two leading commentators, the amendatory enactment \u201cgreatly expanded the enhancement\u2019s applicability and simplified its calculation. The enhancement became applicable to any felony; the numerical triggers were . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>[reduced] . . . ; and the penalty itself became one or two years.\u201d (Cassou &amp; Taugher, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">As amended, and as relevant here, section 12022.6 reads in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who takes, damages or destroys any property in the commission or attempted commission of a felony, with the intent to cause such taking, damage or destruction, and the loss exceeds: [1f] (a) Twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), the court shall in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which the defendant has been convicted impose an additional term of one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The emphasis of defendant\u2019s argument is on the application and meaning of the statute\u2019s \u201ctakes, damages or destroys\u201d language. It has been held that \u201cIn enacting section 12022.6, the Legislature did not intend that a taking was to be a necessary element of the underlying crime in order to impose the enhancement.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kellett </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 949, 958 [185 Cal.Rptr. 1].) We are unable to fathom upon what basis defendant first acknowledges this construction of section 12022.6 and then ignores it when he argues that the enhancement imposed upon him pursuant to that statute is invalid because \u201c[i]n this case the stolen property was neither damaged nor destroyed in an amount of $25,000 or more . . . [and] . . . there was no taking because [defendant] received the stolen property.\u201d Defendant\u2019s argument proceeds as follows: \u201cReceipt of stolen property is considerably different than the requisite taking for . . . section 12022.6. . . . The connotation with receiving is clearly that the recipient obtains possession by permissive means. This is contra to the connotation with taking which is that possession is obtained by non-permissive means,\u201d thereby excluding the crime of receiving stolen property from the offenses to which section 12022.6 is applicable. This construction of section 12022.6 is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">We first deal with defendant\u2019s statement that \u201cthe stolen property was neither damaged nor destroyed in an amount of $25,000 or more.\u201d It appears from the probation officer\u2019s report that the property stolen consisted of three trucks loaded with goods, and that the goods alone had a value of $73,734. It fairly appears from that same source that defendant was arrested while attempting to move some of the stolen goods from a place where they had previously been secreted. Defendant at the time of his arrest was driving a rented truck containing part of the stolen goods, which the probation officer stated to have \u201ca total value in excess of $25,000.\u201d It is of no consequence that most of the stolen property was eventually recovered and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>that the owner\u2019s ultimate uninsured loss was less than $25,000; section 12022.6 is applicable \u201cwithout regard for the duration of the dispossession\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kellett, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at p. 960; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Bates </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 481, 483-484 [169 Cal.Rptr. 853]) or for \u201cthe victim\u2019s ultimate out-of-pocket loss.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 529, 539 [167 Cal.Rptr. 174].) For purposes of this discussion, the operative facts are that property was stolen and that at the time it was stolen the loss was in excess of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument that he did not personally \u201ctake\u201d the property is an attempt to invoke the \u201cfundamental principle that one may not be convicted of stealing and of receiving the same property.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jaramillo </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 752, 757 [129 Cal.Rptr. 306, 548 P.2d 706]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 533, 538 [144 Cal.Rptr. 199]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Swinney </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 332, 337 [120 Cal.Rptr. 148], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Zamora </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 538, 564-565, fn. 26 [134 Cal.Rptr. 784, 557 P.2d 75].) This principle is a general rule which is subject to a number of exceptions. \u201cFor example, when there is evidence of complete divorcement between the theft and a subsequent receiving, such as when the thief has disposed of the property and subsequently receives it back in a transaction separate from the original theft, convictions on both charges would be proper.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jaramillo, supra, </em>at p. 759, fn. 8; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 239, 247, fn. 4 [175 Cal.Rptr. 296].) In addition, in situations where \u201cthe thief commits an initial act of concealment and then, at a later time, indulges in new acts of concealment entirely separate from the theft, he may be prosecuted for the later concealment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Swinney, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d at p. 337; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeldin </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 744, 747 [81 Cal.Rptr. 270].) The theft of property and the receiving of that property are complementary aspects of a single criminal dispossession of property. The circumstances of defendant\u2019s arrest support an inference that he was engaging in a second act of concealing the stolen property, thereby removing this case from the ambit of the \u201cfundamental principle that one may not be convicted of stealing and of receiving the same property.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jaramillo, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 757, 759, fn. 8; <em>People </em>v. <em>Swinney, supra; People </em>v. <em>Wheeldin, supra.) </em>There is consequently no inflexible impediment to defendant\u2019s sentence for receiving stolen property being enhanced by virtue of the initial \u201ctaking\u201d for which he was not convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The distinction drawn by defendant between possession obtained by \u201cpermissive\u201d as opposed to \u201cnonpermissive\u201d means is an argument \u201creminiscent of the hypertechnicality of the common law of theft\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 529 at p. 540) which we find unpersuasive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>Defendant is obviously attempting to introduce the \u201ctaking\u201d element of common law theft, which had a distinct if imprecise meaning. (See Perkins on Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) ch. 4, \u00a7 1C, pp. 302-303.)  For purposes of section 12022.6, it is irrelevant that defendant may not have been the thief who did the actual \u201ctaking,\u201d regardless of whether it was accomplished by \u201cpermissive\u201d or \u201cnonpermissive\u201d means. \u201cThe Legislature was not concerned with the crime committed by a defendant so long as property valued in excess of $25,000 was taken. [1] Moreover, the clear language of the statute .... does not on its face require the intent to permanently deprive the owner of property, but rather that the property be intentionally rather than accidentally taken.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kellett, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d 949 at pp. 958-959.) Defendant does not dispute that property was in fact intentionally taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Clearly, the acquisition of stolen property by a person other than the thief is not permissive from the standpoint of the property\u2019s rightful owner. As far as he is concerned, this is a separate yet still unauthorized \u201ctaking\u201d unconnected with the initial deprivation of possession. This is recognized in the language of the receiving statute, which applies to \u201c[e]very person who buys or receives ... or who conceals, sells, withholds or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding\u201d stolen property. (\u00a7 496, subd. 1.) The law thus recognizes that a violation of section 496 may involve various forms and acts of \u201ctaking.\u201d (See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 330, 343-344 [146 Cal.Rptr. 311]; Fricke &amp; Alarcon, Cal. Criminal Law (8th ed. 1961) p. 323.) In determining the meaning of the word \u201ctake\u201d as used in section 12022.6, we follow the rule that \u201c[c]ourts should first look to the plain dictionary meaning of the [word] . . . .\u201d <em>(Rosenfield </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 198, 202 [191 Cal.Rptr. 611].) With regard to section 12022.6, this has already been done: \u201cThe dictionary definition of \u2018take\u2019 is \u2018to get into one\u2019s hands or into one\u2019s possession . . . .\u2019 (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1961) p. 2329.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kellett, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d 949 at p. 959.) It would be a tortured definition of the word to hold that stolen property passing through hands increasingly distant and removed from those of the owner somehow can no longer be identified as taken. Because the Legislature was not concerned with the specific crime committed by which possession was obtained (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Kellett, supra, </em>at p. 958), we decline to adopt such a definition and thereby limit section 12022.6 to crimes which must include the \u201ctaking\u201d element of common law theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">This court is required to construe section 12022.6 in a manner which will best effectuate the intent of the Legislature. (See <em>Landrum </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 1, 12 [177 Cal.Rptr. 325, 634 P.2d 352]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shirokow </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 301, 306-307 [162 Cal.Rptr. 30, 605 P.2d 859]; <em>Rosenfield </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d 198 at p. 202; <em>People </em>v. <em>Veasey </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 779, 790 [159 Cal.Rptr. 775].) The courts of this state have uniformly held that the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting section 12022.6 was to deter large-scale crime. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kellett, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d 949 at p. 959; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 452 at p. 459; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 529 at p. 539.) This goal will be especially effectuated in situations where the usual sanctions of section 496 will be compounded with an additional term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to section 12022.6. Section 496 is aimed at a class of criminals who by their parasitic nature foment crime by others. \u201c[I]t is directed at the traditional \u2018fence\u2019 and at those who lurk in the background of criminal ways in order to provide the thieves with a market or depository for their loot. [1\u00cd] . . . Experience has shown that by cutting off the \u2018fence\u2019 a major obstacle is placed in the path of encouraging thefts as a profitable venture. . . . [I]n the eyes of the law the \u2018fence\u2019 is more dangerous and detrimental to society than is the thief . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tatum </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 179, 183-184 [25 Cal.Rptr. 832]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jaramillo, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 752 at p. 758; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 533 at p. 538; see Perkins on Criminal Law, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>ch. 4, \u00a7 6, p. 394.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The essence of defendant\u2019s argument is that the \u201ctaking\u201d language used in section 12022.6 is synonymous with \u201cstealing.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kizer) </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 932 [204 Cal.Rptr. 179], we rejected a substantially similar argument. We stated: \u201c \u2018Steal\u2019 is but one meaning of the word \u2018take.\u2019 (See Webster\u2019s Third Internat. Dict.)  Where a word of common usage has more than one meaning, the one which will best attain the purpose of the Legislature should be adopted in construing a statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hacker Emporium, Inc. </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 474, 478-480 [93 Cal.Rptr. 132].)  To construe the word \u2018takes\u2019 in section 12022.6 as meaning \u2018steals\u2019 is to give it a restricted meaning which is inconsistent with the legislative intent of deterring large-scale crime, the legislative goal in enacting the statute. [Citation.] The purpose of the statute is clearly served by imposing the enhancement upon the receiver of stolen property.\u201d (At p. 935.) Defendant has advanced no compelling reason why we should depart from our holding in <em>Kizer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">We conclude that in light of law, logic, experience, and legislative purpose, it is appropriate to permit the application of section 12022.6 to enhance a sentence for receiving stolen property. The trial court therefore did not err when it imposed the additional term of imprisonment. Defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence was unlawful consequently fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>HI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Poch\u00e9, Acting P.
