Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and personal use of a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.5. A jury found Capps guilty of first degree murder and the use allegation to be true. In ruling upon Capps\u2019 motion for a new trial, the court modified the verdict to a conviction of second degree murder. (\u00a7 1181, subd. 6.) Capps appeals the judgment entered upon the modified verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">The principal question presented is whether the court was factually and legally justified in reducing Capps\u2019 conviction of first degree murder to that of murder in the second degree. We answer that question affirmatively. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>also decide Capps\u2019 contentions the court prejudicially erred by instructing the jury on the felony-murder rule, failing to instruct <em>sua sponte </em>on involuntary manslaughter, limiting his voir dire, denying his motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct and denying him presentence custody credits are without merit. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">On March 8, 1980, when Jocelyn Turner went to the apartment of her boyfriend, Richard McNeese, McNeese was talking with Capps. As Turner sat nearby, the two men continued to chat for about five minutes'. The conversation became increasingly louder as the two men started to argue about a scale. Capps wanted the scale because he had some people waiting for him at his house. He needed the scale to weigh his drugs. McNeese refused to give Capps the scale and said: \u201cIf you want to fight, well, let\u2019s go outside and fight.\u201d Capps replied: \u201cI don\u2019t need to. I have all the protection I need.\u201d As the argument continued, Turner saw Capps pull a gun out of a brown leather pouch that was lying on the floor next to his feet and point the gun at McNeese. Turner asked McNeese whether he wanted her to call the police. McNeese said no. Capps said if the police were called he would \u201cbring my whole biker gang over.\u201d Becoming nervous, Turner went to the bathroom to dry her hair. When she left the two men, the gun was back in the pouch and Capps and McNeese were still sitting in the living room and arguing. Moments later Turner heard a popping sound. She came out of the bathroom to see McNeese staggering and fall to the floor. Capps was running out of the apartment. Shortly afterwards a woman ran into the apartment, grabbed something from the floor and ran out.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Phillip Ricardo, a neighbor in a downstairs apartment, heard a gunshot, saw Capps standing in the doorway of McNeese\u2019s apartment and then watched Capps run down the stairway holding a gun as a woman ran up the stairway. Another neighbor bumped into Capps outside; Capps had a gun in his hand covered by a coat. Meanwhile, Ricardo saw the woman who ran up the stairs run down and get into the same car as Capps.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">A locked black trunk found inside McNeese\u2019s bedroom contained a .22 handgun and a shotgun that had been stolen by Capps and Robert Russell in a residential burglary three days before the killing. Russell testified he and Capps transported the loot to Steve Kelso\u2019s apartment and had placed it in the back bedroom. Two days before McNeese was killed, Capps had given the .22 handgun to his girlfriend, Wanda Affeldt, as a birthday present. Capps and Affeldt spent that night at Kelso\u2019s apartment, three doors down from McNeese\u2019s apartment. The next morning, when Capps saw Af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>feldt\u2019s purse and gun were missing he was angry and wanted to know who had taken them.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The day before McNeese\u2019s homicide Chandra Sinclair was standing outside Kelso\u2019s apartment. She overheard a conversation between Capps and a girl named Mary Alice: \u201cHe asked where the stuff was.\u201d \u201cShe said that they brought the stuff to Richard\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On the day McNeese was killed, Sinclair went to Kelso\u2019s apartment. It was empty and it seemed to her its occupants were moving out. When she went to the parking lot, she saw Capps and Affeldt and told them there was nobody at Kelso\u2019s apartment. Capps said: \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019ll go up and find who we\u2019re looking for.\u201d Capps and Affeldt appeared to be \u201cin a trance,\u201d \u201cjust really strange.\u201d When Capps got out of the car, Sinclair saw a dark pouch near Capps\u2019 right side. Affeldt stayed in the car when Capps walked towards the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Capps testified he and Affeldt went to the apartment building where McNeese lived looking for Steve Carle, who lived with Kelso and owed Capps some money. Finding no one in the Kelso/Carle apartment, Capps and Affeldt passed by the open door of McNeese\u2019s apartment. Capps stayed to talk with McNeese while Affeldt went downstairs to the car. During their conversation, Capps argued with McNeese over a scale. During the argument, Affeldt returned and Capps asked her to look for the scale in the , apartment. While Affeldt was in the hall, McNeese opened a cabinet, took out the scale, threw it at Capps and threatened him with a gun. Both men struggled for the gun, but it went off, fatally wounding McNeese. Capps picked up the gun and ran. Affeldt, having heard the gun go off, ran into the living room, grabbed the scale and Capps\u2019 jacket, and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Affeldt testified she did not see a gun on Capps when he went into the apartment building and he was not wearing a pouch at his side.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The jury was instructed on premeditated first degree murder, first degree felony murder (on burglary and robbery theories), second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. Capps challenges the giving of instructions on the felony-murder rule on both constitutional and factual grounds. We reject Capps\u2019 constitutional challenge on the authority of <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 462-476 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697].  Since there is sufficient evidence for the second degree murder conviction (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>part IIA, <em>post), </em>any error by the trial court in giving first degree felony-murder instructions is harmless. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Strickland </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 946, 958 [114 Cal.Rptr. 632, 523 P.2d 672].)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Capps attacks the modified verdict at two levels. He argues it is not supported by sufficient evidence and it is constitutionally defective because it deprived him of his rights to trial by jury and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The modified verdict rests on the court\u2019s finding of express malice, the only theory of second degree murder on which the jury was instructed. The modified verdict must be upheld if there is substantial evidence to support it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 55 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Here, from the evidence presented a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Capps was the aggressor in his argument with McNeese, first threatening and then shooting McNeese with a gun brought along for \u201cprotection.\u201d Capps\u2019 conduct, which was sufficiently hostile to make McNeese think Capps wanted to fight him, and Capps\u2019 threat to \u201cbring my whole biker gang over\u201d if Turner called the police indicate Capps used his gun against McNeese with an intent to kill. In short, the record contains sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s finding of express malice (see \u00a7 188) and its modification of the verdict to second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The court instructed the jurors they need not all agree on one of the prosecution\u2019s three theories of first degree murder so long as they each were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Capps was indeed guilty of first degree murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Milan </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 185, 194-195 [107 Cal.Rptr. 68, 507 P.2d 956]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nicholas </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 249, 272-273 [169 Cal.Rptr. 497].) The jury\u2019s general verdict, however, does not disclose the theory or theories relied on for the conviction. Consequently, unlike the court, some or all of the jurors relying on the felony-murder rule may not have reached the issue of express malice. Capps argues the court may not modify the verdict based on a fact or element undecided by the jury because to do so violates his constitutional rights to trial by jury and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The essential elements of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to trial by jury in a felony proceeding (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16) are to have a decision on guilt or innocence made by the unanimous verdict of 12 impartial jurors. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 208 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 P.2d 91]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258, 265-266 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 687, 692-693 [131 Cal.Rptr. 782, 552 P.2d 742]; Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7 330, p. 323.) Those elements were all satisfied below. \u201c[I]t is clear that the constitutional guarantee [to trial by jury] ([former] art. I, sec. 7) is fully observed when the verdict of the jury in the case is rendered and recorded.  The remaining and different question\u2014whether judgment shall be pronounced upon the verdict or the verdict set aside\u2014is \u2018strictly of legal cognizance,\u2019 which must be determined by the trial court. . . .\u201d <em>(Estate of Bainbridge </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 166, 169 [146 P. 427]; see also <em>Estate of Baird </em>(1924) 195 Cal. 59, 67 [231 P. 744].) In making that determination upon deciding a motion for new trial in either a civil (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657, subd. 6)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or criminal (\u00a7 1181, subd. 6)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> case, the trial court must independently weigh the evidence and assess whether it sufficiently supports the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Civil cases: <em>Green </em>v. <em>Soule </em>(1904) 145 Cal. 96, 102-103 [78 P. 337]; <em>Lippold </em>v. <em>Hart </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 24, 25-26 [78 Cal.Rptr. 833]; 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 35; criminal cases: <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753, 761 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 583, fn. 1 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robarge </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 628, 633-634 [262 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>P.2d 14]; Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 566, pp. 574-575.)  No violation of the right to trial by jury occurs when a court finds the evidence lacking and grants a new trial. <em>(Clemmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Insurance Co. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 865, 889 [151 Cal.Rptr. 285, 587 P.2d 1098], <em>Estate of Bainbridge, supra, </em>169 Cal. at pp. 167-170.)  Nor does such a violation occur when, as here, a court finds the evidence insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict and then decides to modify that verdict (rather than to grant a new trial) based on its conclusion a reasonable jury could have properly determined there was express malice. (Cf. <em>Jehl </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 821, 827-832 [59 Cal.Rptr. 276, 427 P.2d 988].) So long as the modified verdict relies exclusively on evidence presented to the jury (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 313, 319 [198 Cal.Rptr. 26]), the court does not violate a defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury when it finds a fact or element which the jurors also could reasonably have found on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We also find no due process violation (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a)) resulting from the lower court\u2019s decision to modify the jury\u2019s verdict. The \u201clesser degree thereof\u201d and \u201clesser crime included therein\u201d limitations on the range of permissible modification (see \u00a7 1181, subd. 6, at fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>preserve a defendant\u2019s right to fair notice of the charges against him. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 806, 809 [126 Cal.Rptr. 235, 543 P.2d 603].) Similarly, the requirement the court find the defendant \u201cguilty\u201d of the lesser degree or crime (see \u00a7 1181, subd. 6, at fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>preserves the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (\u00a7 1096; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Borchers </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 321, 327-328 [325 P.2d 97]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheran </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 101, 109-110 [315 P.2d 5].)  Furthermore, we see no fundamental unfairness to a defendant when a trial court, in order to <em>reduce </em>a conviction, reviews the evidence presented and finds it appropriate to modify the verdict based on a fact or element undecided by the jury. As our Supreme Court stated in an analogous context, \u201c. . . the trial court\u2019s action will avoid an unwarranted all-or-nothing [decision by] the jury and will ensure that the verdict is no harsher or more lenient than the evidence merits.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 324 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Ill<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Cologne, Acting P.
