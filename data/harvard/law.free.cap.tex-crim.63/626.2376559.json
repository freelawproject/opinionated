The first is that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence; second, that there is a material variance between the allegations in the indictment and the evidence adduced upon the trial in this: That said indictment charges the burglary. to have been committed by entering a house, and does not allege the house to be a private residence, whereas the testimony developed the fact and was positive that said house was a private residence; hence, the proof was of a separate and distinct offense than that alleged. P&gt;oth grounds would be serious if true, but we arc unable to decide the matter, because the record does not contain a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Finding no reversible error in' the record as presented, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
