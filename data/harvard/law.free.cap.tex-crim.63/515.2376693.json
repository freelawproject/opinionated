It appears that when appellant was arrested he had a 'subpoena issued for this witness, but it was not served because the witness had crossed the State line and gone into Louisiana temporarily. This motion might present-ground for the reversal -of this case if the action of the court in overruling it had been excepted to at the time, and a bill of exceptions preserved. In the record, however, there is no bill of exceptions to the action of the court in overruling the motion for continuance, and in the absence of a -bill of exceptions we can not review the action of the court in so doing. Trevino v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 64; Lerman v. State, 40 S. W. Rep., 286, and authorities cited under section 645 of White\u2019s Annotated Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">This is the only ground relied on in the motion for a new trial, but we have carefully read the record, including the statement of facts, and we are of opinion that if the witness had so testified, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>would not have probably been true, when we consider the testimony in the case, especially that of Hr. J. M. Hickey, the landlord of defendant, who testified that appellant told him he had killed the hog and carried the meat to his mother-in-law\u2019s, the witness, Emma Grant. The hog, under this testimony j was not in the field at the time it was killed, but carried there after it was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>'Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
