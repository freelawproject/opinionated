Upon a trial he was convicted, and his punishment assessed at four years confinement in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">It -appears from the evidence that appellant went into the pa-sture of Moore Bros, and drove out t'wo head of cattle; a short distance from the pasture he was joined by his brother, John Ellington, -and together they drove them an-d put them in wh-at is known as the Mooney field. This was at night. The next morning -early they went -to this field and got' these two head -of cattle, 'and -drove them to their -slaughter pen, about -on-e or one and a half miles from Clifton. They were butchering cattle f-or the market, -and told the men whom they had employed that they h-ad two fat cat-tie that they wanted HI led that day. One of the Moore Brothers, getting information about the cattle, went to the pen, found his cattle tied therein, and took them. A complaint was sworn out, -and both the Ellingtons were -arrested that -day.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Appellant claimed t'o have taken the cattle under a claim -of ownership. He testified he had bought a number of head -of cattle from parties at San An-gelo and ICearnes, Texas, a part -of which he had lost, and he had taken these -cattle, believing -that they were a part of the cattle he had lost, -s-aying that he had been informed that -a part -of his lost cattle were in the Moore Brothers\u2019 pasture, -and he thought these were two -of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The court then permitted the State -to prove -th-a-t a week or ten days prior thereto, the appellant -and hi-s brother had been seen driving two head of cattle in the Moore Bros.\u2019 brand, -and -had placed them also in the Mo-on-ey field, -and t-o prove by Moore Bros, that these cattle were also taken without their eon-sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The appellant complains -of the court admitting this evidence of another and different offense. Whenever the question -of the intent with which property is taken becomes an issue, then the taking of other property by the same person -about the same time is -admissible in evidence as bearing on the intent of the person alleged to have taken the property. The court -in the seventh paragraph of his charge to the jury so instructs the jury, -and under the evidence in this case it was not error to admit the testimony. Coward v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 590; Hennessy v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 340; Nixon v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 205. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The appellant also complains that the count erred in not charging on circumstantial evidence. In this case the appellant admitted taking the cattle from the pasture of the owners, and it was unnecessary to charge on circumstantial evidence. Rodgers v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 563; Russell v. State, 44 S. W. Rep., 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The next complaint is that the court \u201c\u00a1committed material error in the fourth paragraph of his main charge wherein he attempted to define to the jury who are principals. That it was not and never has been the law in this State, and the charge was not called for by the evidence, and was prejudicial to the .rights of the 'defendant, and prevented him from having a fair presentation of his case to the jury.\u201d Again in the fourth paragraph it is claimed: \u201cThe court committed error in admitting in evidence certain declarations alleged to have been made by his brother, John Ellington.\u201d There 'is no bill of exceptions reserved to the admissibility of the testimony as t\u2019o what the witness stated he heard John Ellington say, consequently as to whether it was properly admitted can not be reviewed by us. However, after it was admitted, it was proper for the court to instruct the jury that \u201cif they believed from the evidence that John Ellington was not a party to said agreement, if any has been shown, or that he was not present aiding and assisting the defendant at the time of the \u2022commission of the offense, if an -offense ha-s been committed, then in that event he would not be a principal, and in that event you will not consider any declaration, if any has been shown, made by John Ellington when the defendant was not present.\u201d The charge in its entirety may not be artistically drawn, but it is a charge limiting the consideration of testimony which had been -admitted without \u2022objection, as shown by the record, 'and clearly instructs the jury that they must not consider this -evidence unless tire two were both present, aiding and assisting each -other in the commission of the offense. This is a matter that could not be prejudicial to the appellant. It was error, if error, in his favor, and the motion i-s \u2019too general, in that it does not point out wherein the Charge was wrong, but only says \u201cit is not and never was the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In the next ground appellant says: \u201cThe trial court committed an error in failing and refusing to define \u201cwhat is meant by fraudulent taking of property, and want of consent.\u2019 \u201d There is no requested instruction on these words. The -court charged the jury: \u201cTheft is the fraudulent taking -of corporeal personal property belonging to another from his possession without his consent, and with the intent to deprive the owner of the value of the same, and to appropriate it to the use and benefit of the person taking the same.\u201d This defines theft in the language of the statute. (Art. 858, , Penal Code.) If -appellant desired the words \u201cfraudulent taking,\u201d -and \u201cconsent\u201d specifically defined, he should have presented charges requesting the court to do -so. These words have a -well-understood meaning, with which -all are familiar, and the jury -could .not pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>sibly have been misled. The owners testified that they had not given appellant their consent, John Moore testifying: \u201cI did not consent for Borne Ellington (defendant), nor John Ellington, nor anyone else to take these cattle.\u201d J. IC. Moore testified: \u201cI did not consent for the defendant nor anyone else to take this cow and heifer or to move them from my pasture.\u201d Appellant, in his testimony, did not claim to have the consent of either of these gentlemen, but testified that he got the cattle out of the Moore Bros/ pasture without their knowledge, but he testified they were cattle that had escaped from him. The court presented his defense in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201cYou are further instructed that where property alleged to have been stolen was taken under a claim of ownership there must appear from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt before the defendant can be convicted the three following facts: (1) That the property taken was not the property of the defendant and his brother, John Ellington, and that it was the property of John Moore and J. IC. Moore at' the time that it was alleged to have been taken. (2) That the defendant at the time that he took the property did not in good faith believe that the same was his and his brother\u2019s, and that he took said property under said belief. (3) That the defendant fraudulently took the two cows alleged to have been stolen. How, if you believe from the evidence that the defendant took the two cows in controversy in his possession and drove the same, in good faith believing at the time that he did so that they were the property of he and his brother, John Ellington, nr if you have a reasonable doubt thereof, then you will find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">We can not consider the ground complaining of the admissibility of testimony of the witness Parks, there being no bill of exceptions in the record. However, there is a bill of exceptions complaining of the admissibility of the testimony of the witness Price, being the only bill in the record. By the bill it appears that appellant, in cross-examining the witness, 'had asked him a number of questions, proving that he had overtaken defendant and bis brother, and when he did so, they \u201cdropped the cattlethat it was dark, and that he was a deputy sheriff, then asldng: \u201cYou didn\u2019t think they had stolen the cattle? A. I didn\u2019t know they had. Q. Were you an officer? A. Yes, sir. Q. If you had thought they had stolen these cattle you' would have arrested them? A. I didn\u2019t know whose cattle they were. Q. If you have thought they had these cattle stolen you would have arrested them ? A. Yes, sir.\u201d On redirect examination the State asked the witness: \u201cQ. State what caused you to go back to the Mooney ranch. A. I thought they were stolen cattle.\u201d To this question and answer the appellant objected. The appellant had endeavored to prove by this witness that he did not believe the cattle were stolen, or he would have arrested them at the time, and having made this proof, for the purpose of basing an argument' thereon to the jury, we do not think that appellant is in position to complain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Whenever the \u2018appellant sought by questioning to elicit the opinion of the witness as -to whether or not he thought the cattle were stolen, he is not in position to complain that such opinion finally gets before the jury. Of course, such testimony generally is not admissible\u2014what a witness\u2019 thoughts were as basis for his action, yet' the appellant first injected this into the case, and under such circumstances we would not feel called upon to reverse a case.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b448-8\">[Rehearing denied November 29, 1911.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The only other ground in the motion alleges the insufficiency of the testimony. The testimony -amply supports the verdict. The contentions in the brief having no support in the motion, can not be considered by us. It has been the uniform holding of this court that error not '-assigned in the motion for a new trial can not be reviewed by us on. appeal (Bailey v. State, 45 S. W. Rep., 708), and a mere suggestion of error in the motion for a new trial is insufficient; it must point out the error that the court may know in what the complaint consists. (Martin v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">There being no error -assigned in the motion for a new trial, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
