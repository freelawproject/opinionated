Court adjourned on February 4, 1911. The bills of exception and statement of facts were not filed until March 4, 1911. The court granted a thirty day order after adjournment of court for filing- bills of exception and statement of facts. It had no power or authority to do this. Twenty days was the full time. See Davis v. State, this day decided, and authorities there cited. The motion of the Assistant Attorney-General is therefore sustained, and said statement of facts and bills of exception are struck out and not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-20\">There is no other question raised in the record that can be considered without a statement of facts and bill of exceptions.
