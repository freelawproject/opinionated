If the judgment had been entered and writ of commitment issued during the term of court, a different question might be presented, but as no writ has ever issued, as shown by the testimony, the sheriff would not be authorized to place relators in jail. He must have a writ authorizing him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">Because of the fact that no judgment entry is shown to have been made at the term of court, and no writ has ever issued, relators are ordered released and discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">\n<em>Discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">Davidson, Presiding Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
