It is shown that there is a practice prevalent among manufacturers to brand the first quality of their paper with the firm name, and thus identify themselves with such superior products, while the second quality of flint paper commonly bears a different designation, such as Star paper, and the like. Sometime prior to the month of March, 1888, the defendants, Baeder, Adamson &amp; Company, had.marked their second rate paper as flint paper, manufactured at Riverside Flint Paper Mills, Philadel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>phia, with the cut of a star under the words \u201cflint paper.\u201d At or about the last mentioned time, they changed such designation of their second class paper so it should read as follows: \u201c Bader\u2019s Flint Paper * Manufactured at Riverside Flint Paper Mills, Philadelphia, ISTo. 1, warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">It is asserted on the part of the plaintiffs, and the affidavits in their behalf support such contention, that this close imitation of \u25a0 the plaintiffs\u2019 trade name and their mark upon their goods was adopted for the purpose of deceiving the public and turning off upon purchasers a second class paper which should appear to have been made by the plaintiffs themselves as their first-class paper. _</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">_ This is the view taken by the learned judge at the special term in denying the motion to dissolve the injunction. A perusal of the affidavits satisfies us that a proper case was made by the plaintiffs to restrain the defendants in conducting their business in the manner as is above enjoined until the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It follows that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Van Brunt, Ch. J., and Brady, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
