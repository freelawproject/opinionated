The court\u2019s charge on the definition of \u201cresidence\u201d was unduly restrictive in light of this Court\u2019s rulings in civil cases, imposed an unconstitutional burden on the right of defendant to choose his voting residence and dictated a guilty verdict even if the jury credited the testimony of defendant and his witnesses. <em>(Matter of Ferguson v McNab, </em>60 NY2d 598; <em>Martin v City of Cohoes, </em>37 NY2d 162; <em>Matter of Palla v Suffolk County Bd. of Elections, </em>31 NY2d 36; <em>Matter of Brunner, </em>41 NY2d 917; <em>Laufer v Hauge, </em>140 AD2d 671; <em>Matter of Gadway, </em>123 AD2d 83; <em>Matter of Gladwin v Power, </em>21 AD2d 665, 14 NY2d 771; <em>Matter of Newcomb, </em>192 NY 238; <em>Perkins v Guaranty Trust Co., </em>274 NY 250; <em>Matter of Bressler v Holt-Harris, </em>37 AD2d 898, 30 NY2d 529.)

II. Charging the jury that defendant\u2019s chosen voting residence had to be a \u201cpermanent home\u201d and the place to which he \u201calways intend [ed] to return\u201d was constitutionally impermissible. <em>(Levy v Scranton, </em>780 F Supp 897; <em>Ramey v Rockefeller, </em>348 F Supp 780; <em>Auerbach v Rettaliata, </em>765 F2d 350.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b478-8\">Wesley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Defendant John O\u2019Hara, an attorney and frequent candidate for elective office, was convicted of seven crimes arising from his fraudulent filing of a false voter registration form and voting in five separate elections in an election district in which he did not reside. On appeal, defendant contends that the definition of voting residence contained in the Election Law is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>odds with our recognition that in today\u2019s society, a person can have more than one residence. This case, however, turned on whether a second residence actually existed, not a choice between two. The court\u2019s charge correctly reflects the state of New York law and did not, as defendant now contends, direct a verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Defendant has lived in a multi-unit apartment building at 579 61st Street in Brooklyn since the 1980s. Until 1992, he registered to vote using the 61st Street address, which was within the 20th Election District and part of the 51st State Assembly District and the 38th Council District of the City of New York. Following redistricting in 1991-1992, 579 61st Street was no longer situated within these districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">On November 2, 1992, defendant prepared, signed and filed a new voter registration form specifying that he resided at 553 47th Street. This address was located within the newly redrawn borders of the 20th Election District, the 51st State Assembly District and the 38th Council District of the City of New York. Using the 47th Street address, defendant voted in those districts on five occasions \u2014 November 3, 1992; May 4, 1993; September 14, 1993; September 28, 1993 and November 2, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Defendant was charged with one count of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 175.35), one count of false registration (Election Law \u00a7 17-104 [4]) and five counts of illegal voting (Election Law \u00a7 17-132 [3]). Defendant was tried and convicted on all counts of the indictment in 1997. On appeal, the Appellate Division reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial due to an improper missing witness charge, and rejected defendant\u2019s remaining contentions as unpreserved or without merit (253 AD2d 560). The second trial ended in a deadlocked jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">During opening statements of the third trial, defense counsel argued that the only basis for the People\u2019s charges rested on the assertion that defendant never lived at 553 47th Street. According to defense counsel, the evidence would establish that, contrary to the People\u2019s position, defendant had in fact taken up residence at 553 47th Street. Defense counsel submitted that ultimately the case would turn on the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">At trial, the People called several witnesses. An employee for the phone company testified that defendant maintained a phone at the 61st Street address. There was, however, no rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ord of any telephone service at the 47th Street address. In addition, the owner of 579 61st Street testified that defendant was a tenant at that address from 1990 to 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Raphael Munoz and Roberto Lozano testified that they, along with another individual, moved into 553 47th Street in 1992, with the intent of purchasing the building from Magaly Lucas, the owner, which they eventually did. According to Munoz and Lozano, when the three men first moved in, nobody else was living in the building, the apartment was in shambles and the basement was uninhabitable. Each man testified that some time after moving in, defendant approached them, told them that he was receiving mail at that address and asked them to hold it for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Defendant presented the testimony of an employee of the Office of Court Administration who stated that in 1993 defendant\u2019s attorney registration form listed 553 47th Street as his home address. Defendant further proffered the testimony of an American Express employee that defendant\u2019s billing statements listed the 47th Street address. Several neighbors who had participated in defendant\u2019s political campaigns testified that they had on occasion observed him walking into the 47th Street house and that they had understood that he lived there with his former girlfriend, Lucas. One neighbor testified that Josephine and Raymond Vales \u2014 the owners of the house prior to Lucas \u2014 had at some time renovated the basement into a complete apartment. Defendant\u2019s mother and aunt also testified that defendant resided at the 47th Street address.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Finally, defendant testified that he moved into the 47th Street address because his ex-girlfriend, Lucas, owned the house. He stated that he kept the 61st Street address for his relatives and used it as an office. When he and Lucas separated, she moved to Manhattan and allowed him to stay in the basement apartment at 47th Street free of charge. Defendant further testified that he never changed his driver\u2019s license to the 47th Street address and that he used the 61st Street address for all State and Federal tax forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">On redirect, the People called Josephine Vales, who testified that when she and her husband owned the 47th Street building they never renovated the basement into a habitable apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">During the charge conference, the trial court indicated that it would define residency to the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">\u201cAccording to the law a residence is that place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>where a person maintains a fixed, permanent and principal home and to which he wherever temporarily located always intends to return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\u201cAdditionally, a candidate who has two residences may choose one to which he has the legitimate, significant and continuing attachment as his residence for purpose of the [E]lection [L]aw. It is for the candidate to decide which address is to be his voting and campaign address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201cHowever, the address chosen by the defendant as his residence must comport with the definition of residence as I have previously given it to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Defense counsel objected to the charge, indicating that he agreed with the court\u2019s use of the definition of \u201cresidence\u201d found in Election Law \u00a7 1-104 (22). and that a candidate can choose between multiple residencies. As defense counsel noted, \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with that definition of residency [the charge language involving multiple residencies] being attached to the first definition of residency [the charge language taken directly from Election Law \u00a7 1-104 (22)].\u201d Defense counsel limited his objection \u201cstrictly to the fact that after these two portions of residency are read, the Court refers the jurors back to Election Law Section 1-104 sub 22.\u201d According to counsel, \u201cI think that might be somewhat confusing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Defense counsel further objected to use of the Election Law\u2019s definition of residence in reference to the first count of the indictment, which charged defendant with filing a false instrument. Counsel asserted that the only definition which should be used in that regard was that a candidate who has two residences may choose one to which he has a legitimate, significant and continuing attachment. The court did not change its charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The jury convicted defendant on all counts of the indictment. The Appellate Division affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Defendant now argues that the Election Law definition of \u201cresidence\u201d cannot be applied literally in a case of dual residency and that a literal application of Election Law \u00a7 1-104 (22) is unconstitutional. Defendant further maintains that the indictment should be dismissed because the Election Law definition of \u201cresidence\u201d is vague. However, during the jury charge conference, defendant did not object to the specific language of the charge, nor did he raise any of the constitutional issues he now asserts. Thus, those issues are unpreserved <em>(see, People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Cadorette, </em>56 NY2d 1007, 1009; <em>People v Whalen, </em>59 NY2d 273, 279-280).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Defendant did, however, object to the trial court\u2019s second reference to the Election Law definition of \u201cresidence\u201d on the ground that it \u201cmight be somewhat confusing\u201d for the jury. According to defendant, under the court\u2019s charge, his failure to relinquish the 61st Street apartment compromised his assertion that the 47th Street apartment also was his residence for purposes of registration and voting, and therefore, in essence dictated a guilty verdict. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In this case, all the counts of the indictment stem from defendant\u2019s affirmation in his voter registration form that 553 47th Street was his place of residence pursuant to the Election Law during 1992-1993 for voting purposes. A person commits the offense of \u201cfalse registration\u201d under the Election Law when he or she \u201c[k]nowingly gives a false residence within the election district when registering as an elector\u201d (Election Law \u00a7 17-104 [4]). \u201cIllegal voting\u201d is committed when a person \u201c[v]otes or offers or attempts to vote at an election * * * in an election district or from a place where he does not reside\u201d (Election Law \u00a7 17-132 [3]). Finally, a person violates Penal Law \u00a7 175.35 \u201cwhen, knowing that a written instrument contains a false statement or false information, and with intent to defraud the state * * * he offers or presents it to a public office * * * with the knowledge or belief that it will be filed with, registered or recorded in or otherwise become a part of the records\u201d of that public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The Election Law defines residence as \u201cthat place where a person maintains a fixed, permanent and principal home and to which he, wherever temporarily located, always intends to return\u201d (Election Law \u00a7 1-104 [22]). Thus, to be a resident of a place, a person must be physically present with the intent to remain for a time <em>(see, Matter of Palla v Suffolk County Bd. of Elections, </em>31 NY2d 36, 47; <em>see also, Williams v Salerno, </em>792 F2d 323, 327 [2d Cir]). The definition of \u201cresidence\u201d comes from traditional notions of domicile <em>(Matter of Palla, supra, </em>31 NY2d, at 47; <em>see also, Matter of Hosley v Curry, </em>85 NY2d 447, 451, <em>rearg denied 85 </em>NY2d 1033). The determination of an individual\u2019s residence is dependent upon an individual\u2019s expressed intent and conduct <em>(Matter of Palla, supra, </em>31 NY2d, at 47).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">New York courts have recognized that in this modern and mobile society, an individual can maintain more than one bona fide residence <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Gallagher v Dinkins, </em>41 AD2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>946, <em>affd </em>32 NY2d 839; <em>Matter of Gladwin v Power, </em>21 AD2d 665, <em>affd </em>14 NY2d 771; <em>Matter of Chance v Power, </em>14 AD2d 595, <em>affd </em>10 NY2d 792). However, for the purposes of the Election Law, one cannot create an address solely for the purpose of circumventing residency requirements <em>(Matter of Mosley v Curry, </em>207 AD2d 116, 118, <em>revd on other grounds </em>85 NY2d 447, supra; <em>see also, Matter of Lemishow v Black, </em>104 AD2d 460, <em>affd </em>63 NY2d 684, 685).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The crucial determination whether a particular residence complies with the requirements of the Election Law is that the individual must manifest an intent, coupled with physical presence \u201cwithout any aura of sham\u201d <em>(Matter of Gallagher, supra, </em>41 AD2d at 947). As this Court has stated, an individual having two residences may choose one to which she has \u201clegitimate, significant and continuing attachments as her residence for purposes of the Election Law\u201d <em>(Matter of Ferguson v McNab, </em>60 NY2d 598, 600). Generally, where there is no reason to assume that a residence has been asserted merely for the purposes of voting, where no fraud or deception has been practiced and where there is a history of the residence employed, the courts have upheld a fact-finder\u2019s determination of residency <em>(Matter of Gallagher, supra, </em>41 AD2d at 947; <em>see also, Matter of Ferguson, </em>96 AD2d 916, <em>affd </em>60 NY2d 598, <em>supra; Matter of Gladwin, supra; Matter of Chance, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Here, the jury was not asked, as defendant claims, to determine whether as between two residences defendant picked the more appropriate one. The sole issue here was whether defendant genuinely took up residence at 553 47th Street for voting purposes. In considering whether 553 47th Street was a bona fide residence from which defendant could vote, the jury needed to be informed of the Election Law\u2019s definition of residence. The jury was not instructed to convict defendant if it found that he actually maintained two residences. The charge, when read as a whole, was not confusing as a matter of law. It instructed the jury on how to determine whether 553 47th Street could be considered defendant\u2019s residence for voting purposes, and it informed the jury that if the proof established that defendant had two residences he could pick one as long as the \u201cresidence\u201d he picked (553 47th Street) was indeed a residence of his, and not a sham. The jury applied that instruction to the facts it found, and convicted defendant on all counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We respond to the dissent with three points. First, the arguments it addresses overwhelmingly are unpreserved; they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>not made before the Trial Judge. Second, we cannot agree with the dissent\u2019s foundation premise that the Election Law and case law definitions of residence cannot stand side-by-side (an argument plainly not made to the Trial Judge). Finally, the dissent points out that defendant\u2019s own testimony, \u201cif credited,\u201d would have been sufficient to establish residency under our own Election Law cases (dissenting opn, at 389). The jury, however, also heard \u2014 and by its verdict credited \u2014 testimony from the phone company employee that defendant had telephone service at 61st Street but not 47th Street; the 61st Street landlord that defendant was a tenant there; and the owners of the 47th Street premises that the basement where defendant says he resided was uninhabitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Rosenblatt, J. (dissenting). Defendant was arrested after he registered to vote and voted in five elections using an apartment on 47th Street in Brooklyn as his legal voting residence. He was indicted on one count of false registration under Election Law \u00a7 17-104 (4), five counts of illegal voting under Election Law \u00a7 17-132 (3) and one count of offering a false instrument for filing under Penal Law \u00a7 175.35. Convictions for such felonies are punishable by up to four years in prison (Penal Law \u00a7 55.10 [1] [b]). \"Because defendant acknowledged that he had listed the 47th Street apartment as his residence, the only fact issue at trial was whether that apartment was his \u201cresidence\u201d within the meaning of the Election Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">What qualifies as a voter\u2019s \u201cresidence\u201d in New York, however, is far from crystal clear. Election Law \u00a7 1-104 (22) defines \u201cresidence\u201d as \u201cthat place where a person maintains a <em>fixed, permanent and principal </em>home and to which he, wherever temporarily located, always intends to return\u201d (emphasis added). Under the statutory definition, residence is the equivalent of domicile <em>(see, Matter of Palla v Suffolk County Bd. of Elections, </em>31 NY2d 36, 47). Over the last several decades, however, this Court has not adhered to the strict, literal meaning of this statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In <em>Matter of Gladwin v Power </em>(21 AD2d 665), a candidate for assembly had a family home outside her assembly district. She also rented space within the district, which she used as an office and \u201cfor occasional living.\u201d A rival primary candidate brought an action to invalidate her designating petition. The Appellate Division held that \u201c[t]he evidence establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>satisfactorily the current intention and the persisting intention over a number of years of [the candidate] to maintain a legal residence\u201d in the district <em>(Gladwin v Power, supra, </em>at 665). We affirmed without opinion (14 NY2d 771).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Similarly, in <em>Matter of Bressler v Holt-Harris </em>(37 AD2d 898), a voter lived in a house with his family outside the City of Albany. At the same time, to remain eligible to run for citywide elected office, he kept a studio apartment in the City, for which his law firm paid the rent. He kept a few personal items in the apartment and had eaten and slept there <em>once </em>in seven years. He also had his political mail sent there. A rival candidate brought an application to strike the voter from the City\u2019s registry. Applying an identically worded Election Law statute, the Appellate Division concluded that the voter had established residence by showing a \u201ccontinuity of conduct * * * for many years evincing an intention to be and remain a resident of the City * * * as well as a continuous voting record from said address for several years last past\u201d <em>(Bressler v Holt-Harris, supra, </em>at 898). This Court affirmed on the Appellate Division\u2019s opinion (30 NY2d 529).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In both cases, as in numerous others, the alleged \u201cresidence\u201d located inside the voting district was by no means \u201ca fixed, permanent and principal home\u201d to which the candidate \u201calways intend[ed] to return.\u201d As New York appellate courts have repeatedly refused to invalidate candidacies based on failures to comply strictly with statutory residency requirements, an alternative, judicially created test for residence has crept into the jurisprudence. Candidates may now have two \u201cresidences,\u201d providing that they \u201cchoose one to which [they] ha[ve] <em>legitimate, significant and continuing </em>attachments\u201d <em>(Matter of Ferguson v McNab, </em>60 NY2d 598, 600 [emphasis added] [citing <em>Matter of Gallagher v Dinkins, </em>41 AD2d 946, <em>affd without opinion </em>32 NY2d 839]; <em>see also, Matter of Isabella v Hotaling, </em>207 AD2d 648; <em>Matter of Getter v Lasher, </em>196 AD2d 613; <em>Matter of Umland v Board of Elections, </em>143 AD2d 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The narrower statutory definition of residence cannot logically be read compatibly with the dual residency authorized by <em>Ferguson. </em>A voter cannot have two \u201cfixed, permanent and principal home[s].\u201d \u201cPrincipal\u201d is defined as \u201cfirst, highest, or foremost in importance, rank, worth, or degree, chief\u2019 <em>(see, </em>American Heritage College Dictionary, at 1088 [3d ed]). It is not possible to have two living quarters both of which are \u201cfirst, highest or foremost in importance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>In Election Law cases involving more than one residence, courts have endeavored to reconcile this incompatibility by deeming the narrow statutory definition of residence satisfied when a candidate has \u201clegitimate, significant and continuing\u201d attachments to the particular residence chosen for Election Law purposes <em>(see, Ferguson v McNab, supra). </em>Thus, a residence chosen by the voter and satisfying the <em>Ferguson </em>standard essentially has been held to constitute that candidate\u2019s \u201cfixed, permanent and principal\u201d residence even though such a residence objectively might not satisfy the narrow statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The charge in this case did not instruct the jury that a residence satisfying the <em>Ferguson </em>standard is deemed to be a \u201cfixed, permanent and principal\u201d residence for purposes of the Election Law. The judge instructed the jury that it must determine whether defendant\u2019s 47th Street apartment satisfied the statutory definition of residence, then noted that a candidate could have two residences under the <em>Ferguson v McNab </em>formulation, and finally reiterated that the defendant\u2019s residence \u201cmust comport with\u201d the statutory definition. Defense counsel objected, claiming that the charge as a whole was confusing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">A jury, upon hearing the entire charge, must be able to \u201cgather from its language the correct rules which should be applied in arriving at decision\u201d <em>(People v Ladd, </em>89 NY2d 893, 895 [quoting <em>People v Russell, </em>266 NY 147, 153]). A party is entitled to \u201can unambiguous instruction of the pertinent law\u201d <em>(see, Schafer v Norwood Equip. Corp., </em>277 App Div 933, 934). It is not sufficient to excerpt portions of statutes or holdings in the abstract without adequately explaining them in a manner understandable to a lay person <em>(see, Stryzinski v Arnold, </em>285 App Div 780, 782-783).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Here, the court\u2019s instruction on the issue of defendant\u2019s residence \u2014 two terse paragraphs \u2014 was the crucial charge which would definitively guide the jury in determining guilt or innocence. It was confusing in two ways. First, the jury could have understood the charge as requiring defendant to meet <em>both </em>the statutory definition <em>and </em>the <em>Ferguson </em>dual-residence qualification. As we have demonstrated, however, the literal Election Law definition and the <em>Ferguson </em>standard cannot stand side-by-side. The charge failed to synthesize the statutory definition with the <em>Ferguson </em>formulation. It charged both without any further explanation. In essence, the court asked the 12 jurors to do the impossible: integrate and comprehend two facially incompatible formulations of residence. This should not be countenanced in a felony prosecution. We cannot fathom the rule that would apply in this case if a voter\u2019s chosen residence had to qualify under both <em>Ferguson </em>and the literal statutory definition. Nor could a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Moreover, the instruction also could readily have been interpreted as subordinating the <em>Ferguson </em>dual-residence standard to the stringent statutory residence test. Viewed in that light, the jury was told, in effect, that it could acquit defendant only if the 47th Street apartment was in fact his \u201cprincipal\u201d residence \u2014 i.e., the home that was \u201cfirst, highest and foremost in importance.\u201d This was a clear departure from the dual-residence jurisprudence of civil Election Law cases involving the same statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Defendant testified that he moved to the 47th Street apartment in 1993 with the \u201cintent to set up residency\u201d there. He further testified that he moved his clothes and lamps to that apartment, where he initially stayed overnight \u201call the time\u201d until construction work on the building began, after which he \u201cstayed there a lot.\u201d This testimony, if credited, certainly would have been sufficient to establish residency under the <em>Ferguson </em>formulation as applied in our civil Election Law jurisprudence. Indeed, these facts are far stronger than those in <em>Bressler v Holt-Harris, </em>where the voter\u2019s one-room apartment was held to satisfy the Election Law definition of residence even though the voter regularly lived with his wife in a two-story house outside the City and could remember eating and sleeping at the apartment only once in seven years. Clearly, under the court\u2019s charge, the jury, in this criminal prosecution, could have returned a guilty verdict on facts indistinguishable from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>those held sufficient to establish a legal residence in <em>Bressler </em>\u2014 a civil case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Historically, the \u201cresidence\u201d issue has been addressed in the context of civil election appeals. In those cases, members of the Board of Election and appellate judges have determined on a case-by-case basis whether the connection between a particular voter and the asserted voting residence is sufficient. Central to each determination is a full understanding of relevant authority, which allows a comparison between the facts of the case at bar to the facts of cases that have already been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">This, however, was a criminal prosecution, and a unique one at that. So far as we can discern, defendant is the only person ever brought to trial in New York on a charge of this kind.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If politically charged disputes such as this and questions of \u201cresidence\u201d are going to be resolved in the criminal arena and decided by juries, with the possibility of criminal conviction and incarceration, we should ensure that the definition of residence is plainly fixed and easily understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Accordingly, we would reverse the conviction and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick and Graffeo concur with Judge Wesley; Judge Rosenblatt dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Levine concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">. The majority correctly points out that defense counsel \u201cha[d] no problem\u201d with the court charging just the statutory definition and then the <em>Ferguson </em>formulation. It was, however, the court\u2019s reiteration of the statutory definition that rendered the charge as a whole \u201cconfusing.\u201d The majority holds that defense counsel, by withholding his objection until after the reiteration of the statutory standard, somehow is foreclosed from arguing that asking the jury to apply both formulations simultaneously was confusing as a matter of law. We disagree. Counsel obviously viewed the <em>Ferguson </em>standard as <em>modifying </em>the statutory definition and therefore had no objection to the charge until the court erroneously engrafted the statutory definition back onto the <em>Ferguson </em>formulation. Counsel\u2019s objection at that point unambiguously alerted the trial court to his assertion that, objectively, the statutory definition and <em>Ferguson </em>formulation cannot abide one another and thus could not be charged conjunctively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\">. We cannot agree that the jury must have credited the testimony that contradicted defendant\u2019s position that he resided at the 47th Street apartment. It is impossible to tell what testimony the jury actually credited because the erroneous charge would have allowed the jury to return a guilty verdict even if it fully credited defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-10\">. Defendant is one of two persons who have been criminally prosecuted for the failure to establish leg\u00e1l residence inside a voting district <em>(see, People v Ramos, </em>Sup Ct, Bronx County, Nov. 9, 1994, Bamberger, J., indictment No. 94-5993, <em>affd </em>223 AD2d 495). There, the defendant was prosecuted criminally for using his inlaws\u2019 Bronx County apartment as his legal residence. The prosecutor instructed the Grand Jury on the issue of residence using only the statutory definition. The Supreme Court dismissed the indictment, holding that \u201cit was not enough to simply read the Election Law definition of residence to the grand jury. Such an instruction did not convey the applicable law in a manner that fairly apprised the grand jury of the issue it had to decide\u201d (slip opn, at 4). The Appellate Division affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
