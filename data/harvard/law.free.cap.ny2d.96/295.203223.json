The court below erred in concluding that plaintiff failed to establish prima facie that he sustained a serious injury under the permanent loss of use of a body member threshold category. His proof sufficiently showed that his injury resulted in a permanent loss of use of his right arm, and any contention that he did not establish serious injury because he failed to show that such loss of use was \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cconsequential\u201d is irrelevant as this category does not require such a showing. <em>(Licari v Elliott, </em>57 NY2d 230; <em>Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41; <em>Hezekiah v Williams, </em>100 Misc 2d 807, 106 Misc 2d 407, 81 AD2d 261; <em>Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent.

The court below erred in concluding that plaintiff failed to establish prima facie that he sustained a permanent loss of use of a body function or system as his proof sufficiently showed such a loss to a body function or system of his. III. If plaintiff must make a showing that his claimed loss of use of a body member, function or system of his is \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cconsequential,\u201d plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to his loss being \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cconsequential.\u201d <em>(Gaddy v Eyler, </em>79 NY2d 955; <em>Scheer v Koubek, </em>70 NY2d 678; <em>Licari v Elliott, </em>57 NY2d 230.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-5\"><em>Mlynarski &amp; Cawley, P.

An injured party may bring a plenary action in tort, however, to recover for non-economic loss, pain and suffering, but must show that he or she has suffered a serious injury within the meaning of the No-Fault Law. The issue before this Court is whether a party bringing a claim under the no-fault serious injury category of \u201cpermanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system\u201d is required to prove that the loss of use is significant or consequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">We conclude that only a total loss of use is compensable under the \u201cpermanent loss of use\u201d exception to the no-fault remedy. Insofar as plaintiffs have not established total \u201closs of use\u201d and have abandoned any claim concerning a \u201cpermanent consequential limitation\u201d or \u201csignificant limitation of use of a body function or system,\u201d they have failed to establish a \u201cserious injury\u201d within the meaning of the No-Fault Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Plaintiff Richard Oberly, a dentist, was injured while being transported in an ambulance owned by defendant Bangs Ambulance. Plaintiff was positioned face-up on a stretcher with an IV needle in his arm, and a five-pound TV pump was set on a shelf above him. While in transit, the ambulance struck a curb, and the IV pump toppled from the shelf and fell on his right forearm. Plaintiff suffered bruising and continues to complain of pain and cramping in that arm, which pain allegedly limits his ability to practice as a dentist.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Plaintiff and his wife commenced this personal injury action for negligence, alleging a serious injury under the No-Fault Law, Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Supreme Court against defendant, asserting that plaintiff had suffered a serious injury. In response to defendant\u2019s demand that they particularize the serious injury, plaintiffs identified four of the plausible injury standards under Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d): \u201csignificant disfigurement,\u201d \u201cpermanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system,\u201d \u201cpermanent consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member\u201d and \u201csignificant limitation of use of a body function or system.\u201d Following joinder of issue, defendant moved for summary judgment. In opposing summary judgment, plaintiffs abandoned all of the cited serious injury standards except for the \u201cpermanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Supreme Court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action for lack of evidence that he had suffered a serious injury. The Appellate Division affirmed, ruling that the statute requires a party claiming a partial loss of use of a body \u201corgan or member\u201d to show that the limitation is \u201cconsequential or significant,\u201d and that plaintiff had not met that threshold. The two dissenting Justices concluded that the nerve damage to plaintiff\u2019s arm could constitute a partial loss of use of a body \u201cfunction or system,\u201d for which no proof of significance was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">On this appeal, plaintiffs argue that the statute does not require proof that a \u201cpermanent loss of use\u201d of a body member is significant even if the loss is only partial. They also contend that the limitation of the use of plaintiff\u2019s arm itself qualifies as \u201cpermanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The No-Fault Law was adopted by the Legislature in 1973 to assure prompt and full compensation for economic loss and to provide for non-economic loss in the case of serious injury <em>(see, Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41, 46-47; Insurance Law \u00a7 5104 [a] [formerly \u00a7 673 (1)]). As originally enacted, it contained two categories of \u201cserious injury\u201d: first, claims for death, dismemberment, significant disfigurement, certain types of fractures and permanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system and second, claims for medical charges as a result of an injury that exceeded $500. In 1977, this section was replaced with the present section, which defines a serious injury as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201ca personal injury which results in death; dismemberment; significant disfigurement; a fracture; loss of fetus;[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] permanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system; permanent consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member; significant limitation of use of a body function or system; or a medically determined injury or impairment of a non-permanent nature which prevents the injured person from performing substantially all of the material acts which constitute' such person\u2019s usual and customary daily activities for not less than ninety days during the one hundred eighty days immediately following the occurrence of the injury or impairment\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 [d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The serious injury category at issue, \u201cpermanent loss of use,\u201d has been in place since 1973 without legislative change. Until today, however, the question of how this statutory section should be construed has never been squarely before this Court. We hold that to qualify as a serious injury within the meaning of the statute, \u201cpermanent loss of use\u201d must be total.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Our holding today proceeds from both the statutory text and from the conclusion that the Legislature, in amending the definition of \u201cserious injury\u201d in 1977, meant to create a consistent framework. First, the statute speaks in terms of the loss of a body member, without qualification. Thus, the legislative intent is shown in the actual wording of the statute <em>(Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577, 583). Second, requiring a total loss is consistent with the statutory addition, in 1977, of the categories \u201cpermanent consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member\u201d and \u201csignificant limitation of use of a body function or system.\u201d Had the Legislature considered partial losses already covered under \u201cpermanent loss of use,\u201d there would have been no need to enact the two new provisions <em>(see, Matter of New York Life Ins. Co. v State Tax Commn., </em>80 AD2d 675, 677, <em>affd </em>55 NY2d 758 [a court will not by implication read into a statute a limitation for which no sound reason can be found and which would render the clause futile]).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">While the Appellate Division properly affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, it improperly engrafted the term \u201cpartial\u201d to the \u201closs of use\u201d standard. Because both the \u201cpermanent consequential limitation of use\u201d standard and the \u201closs of use\u201d standard require a permanent injury, and because there is no qualitative difference between a partial \u201closs of use\u201d and a \u201climitation of use,\u201d engrafting the term \u201cpartial\u201d creates a redundancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Levine, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">.
