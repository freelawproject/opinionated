Section 240 of the Labor Law does not apply to the facts of this accident. Here plaintiff and the offending window glass were essentially at the same level, and the object that fell was not an item unsecured or being hoisted in relation to work being performed above him. This accident comes squarely within this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co. </em>(81 NY2d 494). There was no elevation differential between plaintiff and the falling glass such as would invoke the protections of section 240. The presence or absence of any device mandated by section 240 (1) was not a factor in this accident. Under these circumstances, plaintiff had no prima facie claim under section 240; the mere fact that it may be said that the glass \u201cfell from an elevated work site\u201d is not, by itself, enough to change that. EBH was entitled to summary judgment on the section 240 claim. <em>(Misseritti v Mark TV Constr. Co., </em>86 NY2d 487; <em>Fox v Jenny Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>122 AD2d 532, 70 NY2d 761; <em>Nieves v Five Boro Air Conditioning &amp; Refrig.

II. EBH also was entitled to a dismissal of plaintiffs Labor Law \u00a7 200 and common-law negligence claims for two reasons: (a) because there could be no liability under section 200 or in common-law negligence on the part of EBH to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>plaintiff injured by a dangerous condition that he was employed to rectify, and (b) there can be no such liability where the accident occurred as a detail of the means and methods of the work of the independent contractor employing plaintiff, over which work EBH did not exercise any supervision or control, regardless of whether it may have had the authority to do so, if it chose to exercise such authority, but did not. As a result the certified question must be answered in the negative and defendant-appellant EBH is entitled to an order dismissing the Labor Law \u00a7 240, Labor Law \u00a7 200 and common-law negligence claims against it. <em>(Gasper v Ford Motor Co., </em>13 NY2d 104; <em>Kowalsky v Conreco Co., </em>264 NY 125; <em>Carrion v Lewmara Realty Corp., </em>222 AD2d 205; <em>Lanzilotta v Lizby Assocs., </em>216 AD2d 229; <em>McCullum v Barrington Co. &amp; 309 56th St. Co., </em>192 AD2d 489; <em>Barnes v Lucas, </em>234 AD2d 405; <em>Sanders v TDX Constr.

Neither situation presented here gives rise to liability under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Plaintiff Alex Narducci, an employee of Atlantic Windows, was assigned the task of removing steel window frames, as part of a larger restoration project, from the third floor exterior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of a fire-damaged Long Island City warehouse owned by Manhasset Bay Associates and leased to Thypin Steel. To oversee the restoration, Thypin hired Preferred Restoration Experts as its general contractor and Preferred, in turn, hired EBH Construction as its construction manager on the site. Preferred also hired the window subcontractor, A &amp; D Windows who hired Atlantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On the day of his accident, plaintiff began by working on the window frame furthest to the right of the three that he was assigned to remove. As he stood on a ladder propped against the right-most window frame sawing the frame loose, plaintiff paused, looked over and saw a large piece of glass from an adjacent window frame falling toward him. He turned to avoid being hit in the face by the glass, but was severely cut on his right arm. Plaintiff did not fall from the ladder, nor did the ladder malfunction in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Plaintiff brought suit under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1), alleging that he should have been given a scissor jack \u2014 a type of hydraulic platform \u2014 to perform his work properly. Supreme Court denied motions by defendants Manhasset Bay Associates, Thypin Steel and EBH Construction to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) claim, holding that issues of fact existed as to whether scaffolding could have prevented the accident. Further, the court denied EBH Construction\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s Labor Law \u00a7 200 claim against it. A divided Appellate Division affirmed. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Plaintiff Louis Capparelli, Jr., a journeyman electrician employed by Burns Electric Co., was assigned the job of installing fluorescent light fixtures into a dropped ceiling grid as part of the renovation of Onondaga Plaza, a facility in Syracuse. The owner of the facility, Council House Realty Corp., hired Zausmer Frisch Construction, Inc. as its general contractor for the renovation, and Zausmer Frisch contracted with Burns Electric.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Planning to install a ceiling fixture, plaintiff climbed about half-way up an eight-foot step ladder in order to reach the ten-foot ceiling. From his position on the ladder, plaintiff lifted the light fixture into the ceiling grid so that its edges rested on the grid. Plaintiff\u2019s next step would have been to secure the fixture to the ceiling grid by twisting metal tabs attached to the fixture; however, as he was about to descend the ladder in order to change position to perform that step, the light fixture began to fall from the grid. Plaintiff immediately reached out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to stop the fixture from hitting him, but the fixture slid as he tried to hold it, cutting his right hand and wrist. Plaintiff\" did not fall from the ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Plaintiff brought suit under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1), alleging that he should have been given a scaffold to perform his work that day. Supreme Court denied cross motions for summary judgment on the Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) claim, holding that issues of fact existed. The Appellate Division modified by granting the cross motion of third party defendant Burns Electric, holding that plaintiffs injury was caused by \u201cthe usual and ordinary dangers of a construction site\u201d and not the \u201cextraordinary elevation risks\u201d covered by Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) (256 AD2d 1141). Following a judgment of Supreme Court dismissing the remaining causes of action, plaintiff appealed. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Not every worker who falls at a construction site, and not every object that falls on a worker, gives rise to the extraordinary protections of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). Rather, liability is contingent upon the existence of a hazard contemplated in section 240 (1) and the failure to use, or the inadequacy of, a safety device of the kind enumerated therein <em>(see, Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., </em>81 NY2d 494, 501).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) \u201c \u2018is to be construed as liberally as may be for the accomplishment of the purpose for which it was * * * framed\u2019\u201d <em>(Koenig v Patrick Constr. Corp., </em>298 NY 313, 319, quoting <em>Quigley v Thatcher, </em>207 NY 66, 68), however, this principle operates to impose absolute liability only <em>after </em>a violation of the statute has been established. Even \u201ca violation of [Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1)] cannot \u2018establish liability if the statute is intended to protect against a particular hazard, and a hazard of a different kind is the occasion of the injury\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., 78 </em>NY2d 509, 513, quoting <em>DeHaen v Rockwood Sprinkler Co., </em>258 NY 350, 353).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) applies to both \u201cfalling worker\u201d and \u201cfalling object\u201d cases. With respect to falling objects, Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) applies where the falling of an object is related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>to \u201ca significant risk inherent in * * * the relative elevation * * * at which materials or loads must be positioned or secured\u201d <em>(Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., supra, </em>78 NY2d, at 514). Thus, for section 240 (1) to apply, a plaintiff must show more than simply that an object fell causing injury to a worker. A plaintiff must show that the object fell, while being hoisted or secured, <em>because of </em>the absence or inadequacy of a safety device of the kind enumerated in the statute <em>(see, e.g., Pope v Supreme-K.R.W. Constr. Corp., </em>261 AD2d 523; <em>Baker v Barron\u2019s Educ. Serv. Corp., </em>248 AD2d 655).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In addition, the fact that an injured plaintiff may have been working at an elevation when the object fell is of no moment in a \u201cfalling object\u201d case, because a different type of hazard is involved. Working at an elevation does not increase the risk of being hit by an improperly hoisted, load of materials from above. The hazard posed by working at an elevation is that, in the absence of adequate safety devices (e.g., scaffolds, ladders), a worker might be injured in a fall. By contrast, falling objects are associated with the failure to use a different type of safety device (e.g., ropes, pulleys, irons) also enumerated in the statute <em>(see, Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., supra, </em>81 NY2d, at 501). Because the different risks arise from different construction practices, the hazard from one type of activity cannot be \u201ctransferred\u201d to create liability for a different type of accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Applying these principles to the facts in <em>Narducci, </em>the glass that fell on plaintiff was not a material being hoisted or a load that required securing for the purposes of the undertaking at the time it fell, and thus Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) does not apply. No one was working on the window from which the glass fell, nor was there evidence that anyone worked on that window during the renovation. The glass that fell was part of the preexisting building structure as it appeared before work began. This was not a situation where a hoisting or securing device of the kind enumerated in the statute would have been necessary or even expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Furthermore, while the risk of falling glass is assuredly greater at a warehouse whose windows have been damaged in a fire, that is not the type of risk that Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) was intended to address. Absolute liability for falling objects under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) arises only when there is a failure to use necessary and adequate hoisting or securing devices. The absence of a necessary hoisting or securing device of the kind enumerated in Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) did not cause the falling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>glass here. This was clearly a general hazard of the workplace, not one contemplated to be subject to Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) <em>(see, Misseritti v Mark IV Constr. Co., </em>86 NY2d 487).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Nor does the fact that plaintiff was working at an elevation bring this scenario within the ambit of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). Plaintiff does not contest that the ladder on which he was standing functioned properly. He was not injured as a result of a fall. Thus, since the ladder had no legally sufficient causal connection to this injury, it could not be deemed \u201cinadequate\u201d under these facts <em>(see, Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., supra, 78 </em>NY2d, at 513).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Plaintiff argues that if he had performed the task on a scissor jack it might have prevented the accident since he would have performed his work horizontally instead of vertically and, as a result, would have been in a different location when the glass fell. Also, plaintiff asserts that a scissor jack might have protected him from falling glass. As noted, however, a scissor jack is designed to protect the <em>worker </em>from falling, an entirely different risk. Here, plaintiff was adequately secured. The only risk was the glass. Since the glass was not an object being hoisted or secured, Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">With respect to plaintiff Narducci\u2019s Labor Law \u00a7 200 and common-law negligence claims against EBH Construction, we hold that the motion by defendant EBH Construction to dismiss those claims against it should have been granted. There was insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to rebut EBH\u2019s argument that it did not exercise sufficient control of the activities of subcontractors to justify the imposition of liability <em>(Lombardi v Stout, </em>80 NY2d 290, 294).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The plaintiff in <em>Capparelli </em>similarly fails to state a claim under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). Plaintiff\u2019s job was to secure the light fixture into place after he hoisted it into the ceiling grid. The ceiling that plaintiff was working at was ten feet high, while the ladder he was given was eight feet tall. Plaintiff was standing no less than halfway up the ladder when the light fixture fell on his arm, causing the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Under these undisputed facts, there was no height differential between plaintiff and the falling object. Plaintiff was working at ceiling level when his accident occurred. That being so, this is not a case that entails the hazards presented by \u201ca difference between the elevation level where the worker is positioned and the higher level of the materials or load being hoisted or secured\u201d <em>(Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>78 NY2d, at 514). The fact that gravity worked upon this object which caused plaintiffs injury is insufficient to support a section 240 (1) claim <em>(see, Rodriguez v Tietz Ctr. for Nursing Care, </em>84 NY2d 841; <em>Terry v Mutual Life Ins.
