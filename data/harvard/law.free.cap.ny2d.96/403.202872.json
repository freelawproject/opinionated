While we refuse to impose liability based solely on ownership of contaminated land, we nonetheless conclude that where, as here, a landowner can control activities occurring on its property and has reason to believe that petroleum products will be stored there, the landowner is liable as a discharger for the cleanup costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Defendant Village at Lakeside, Inc. owns a trailer park where defendant Vanessa Green leased a trailer pad. Green owned and maintained a 275-gallon, above-ground kerosene tank, which was used to heat her mobile home and was serviced by defendant H. Reynolds &amp; Sons, Inc. In January 1992, the tank fell, spilling kerosene on the ground. No attempt was made to clean up the spill until the State intervened and removed the discharge at a cost in excess of $15,000,,</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">The State then commenced this action <em>against' </em>all three defendants pursuant to Navigation Law article 12 to recover its cleanup costs. Although Green did not appear, Lakeside and Reynolds answered and asserted cross claims for indemnification against each other and Green. Lakeside then sought summary judgment dismissing the complaint against it, arguing that because it did not own, maintain or install the tank, it was not liable as a discharger under Navigation Law \u00a7 181 (1). The State cross-moved for summary judgment, contending that, as owner of the property on which the spill occurred, Lakeside was strictly liable for the cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Supreme Court denied Lakeside\u2019s motion and granted the State\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment, finding Lakeside liable for the cleanup costs because, as owner of the contaminated property, it had control over the site and source of the discharge. The Appellate Division reversed, granted Lakeside\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint against it. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>concluded that Navigation Law \u00a7 181 (1) limits liability to \u201cthe owner of the <em>system </em>from which a discharge occurred, regardless of fault\u201d (271 \u00c1D2d 11, 14 [emphasis in original]), and because Lakeside did not own the tank, it was not a \u201cdis-charger\u201d strictly liable for the cleanup costs. This Court granted the State leave to appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Article 12 of the Navigation Law, commonly known as the Oil Spill Act, was enacted to ensure swift, effective cleanup of petroleum spills that threaten the environment (Navigation Law \u00a7\u00a7 170, 171). To achieve this objective, the Legislature established the \u201cEnvironmental Protection and Spill Compensation Fund,\u201d which finances State cleanup efforts when the discharger is unknown, unwilling or unable to pay these costs (Navigation Law \u00a7 179). Once the Fund has disbursed monies for the cleanup, it must then seek reimbursement from a responsible party (Navigation Law \u00a7 187 [1]; \u00a7 188). To ensure prompt reimbursement, the Legislature has broadly defined those persons liable to the Fund:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\"><em>\u201cAny person who has discharged petroleum shall be strictly liable, without regard to fault, </em>for all cleanup and removal costs and all direct and indirect damages, no matter by whom sustained\u201d (Navigation Law \u00a7 181 [1] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">A \u201cdischarge\u201d is further defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">\u201cany intentional or unintentional action or omission resulting in the releasing, spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying or dumping of petroleum into the waters of the state or onto lands from which it might flow or drain into said waters\u201d (Navigation Law \u00a7 172 [8]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Construing these provisions liberally to effect their legislative purpose <em>(see, </em>Navigation Law \u00a7 195), we conclude that Lakeside is a discharger within the meaning of Navigation Law \u00a7 181 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">As the statutory language indicates, a \u201cdischarge\u201d includes <em>\u201cany </em>intentional or <em>unintentional action or omission </em>resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>in\u201d the spilling of petroleum (Navigation Law \u00a7 172 [8] [emphasis added]). Nothing in the statutory language requires proof of fault or knowledge. To the contrary, the language is sufficiently broad to include landowners, like Lakeside, who have both control over activities occurring on their property and reason to believe that their tenants will be using petroleum products. As the owner and lessor of the trailer park, Lakeside had the ability to control potential sources of contamination on its property, including Green\u2019s maintenance of a 275-gallon kerosene tank <em>(see, Matter of White v Regan, </em>171 AD2d 197, 199-201, <em>lv denied </em>79 NY2d 754; <em>cf., State of New York v Shore Realty Corp., </em>759 F2d 1032, 1050-1051 [2d Cir]). Lakeside\u2019s failure, unintentional or otherwise, to take any action in controlling the events that led to the spill or to effect an immediate cleanup renders it liable as a discharger <em>(see, Huntington Hosp. v Anron Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, </em>250 AD2d 814, 815; <em>State of New York v Montayne, </em>199 AD2d 674, 675; <em>Domermuth Petroleum Equip. &amp; Maintenance Corp. v Herzog &amp; Hopkins, </em>111 AD2d 957, 958-959).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">By predicating.liability on a landowner\u2019s control over the contaminated premises, we ensure that landowners are not in all instances liable for spills occurring on their property. A landowner, for example, who falls victim to a \u201cmidnight dumper,\u201d or an errant oil truck that spills fuel, would not be liable as a \u201cdischarger\u201d because, in those cases, the landowner could not control the events resulting in the discharge. Here, however, Lakeside, as owner of the property, was in a position to control the site and source of the discharge. As Green\u2019s lessor, moreover, Lakeside could have reasonably expected Green to use fuel to heat her home; and it received the benefit of the lease as well as the cleanup. In these circumstances, Lakeside is liable for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Interpreting the term \u201cdischarger\u201d to include landowners like Lakeside is consistent with the statute\u2019s intent. Article 12 enables the State to respond swiftly to oil spills that threaten the environment, and ensures that adequate funds are available to effect the cleanups <em>(see, </em>Navigation Law \u00a7 171). By imposing strict liability on landowners, like Lakeside, article 12 ensures that a responsible party is readily available to reimburse the State for its cleanup costs. Limiting liability to those who actually cause or contribute to the discharge, as Lakeside urges, would discourage landowners from promptly cleaning up their contaminated land, leaving the State to shoulder the entire cost of the cleanup while it searches for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>party at fault <em>(see, White v Long, </em>85 NY2d 564, 569; Koegel, <em>Dischargers vs. Dischargers under the Navigation Law, </em>NYLJ, July 25, 1995, at 1, col 1). Such a result could only frustrate future cleanups, causing unnecessary delays and depleting the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The Fund\u2019s ability to file a lien on real property owned by dischargers further reflects a legislative policy of holding landowners, like Lakeside, strictly liable for the cleanup costs (Navigation Law \u00a7 181-a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Navigation Law \u00a7 181-a (1) provides that the Fund \u201cshall have a lien\u201d on real property \u201cowned by a person liable to the fund\u201d and \u201cupon which the discharge occurred.\u201d Although the owner must first be deemed liable under section 181 (1), the lien provision envisions landowners as ready sources of reimbursement. Landowners benefit from the State\u2019s cleanup efforts and their property \u201cvery often is the only asset * * * which the Fund could go against\u201d (Sponsor\u2019s Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1991, ch 488, at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Lakeside is not, however, without redress. In <em>White v Long (supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 568), we held that Navigation Law \u00a7 181 (5) allows a faultless landowner to seek contribution from the actual discharger, even though the landowner itself is liable as a discharger under section 181 (1). While we declined to address whether a landowner could be deemed a \u201cdischarger\u201d under the Navigation Law, we recognized that proof of fault is not a predicate to liability and that more than one discharger may exist under Navigation Law \u00a7 181 (1). The fact that more than one party can be deemed a discharger suggests that liability under the statute is broad and inclusive, extending to landowners, like Lakeside, regardless of whether they actually caused or contributed to the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be reversed, with costs, and the order of Supreme Court granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment against defendant Village at Lakeside, Inc. reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur; Judge Graffeo taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-12\">. The State discontinued its causes of action against Green and Reynolds, and Reynolds discontinued its cross claims against Lakeside and Green. The State\u2019s appeal brings up for review the Appellate Division\u2019s non-final order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\">. Although the State did not rely below on the environmental lien provisions, we may take judicial notice of these provisions and their legislative history <em>(see, Affronti v Crosson, </em>95 NY2d 713, 720).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
