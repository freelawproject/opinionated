Harvey, Sr., a shareholder of a retail liquor store, purchased medical reimbursement health coverage from defendant Members Employees Trust for Retail Outlets (METRO), a self-insured health benefit plan. METRO was established by the Metropolitan Package Store Association, a trade association of liquor stores, to provide health benefits to the employees of participating association members. Harvey\u2019s store was a member of the association and participated in the METRO plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Harvey\u2019s medical records indicate that he suffered from various illnesses caused by alcohol abuse, including cirrhosis of the liver. He was hospitalized twice in 1994 and ultimately died in the hospital from hypovolemic shock and liver failure. The METRO plan denied coverage for Harvey\u2019s hospitalization and medical care on the ground that it did not provide benefits for illnesses arising from the use of alcohol. Thereafter, plaintiff, as the executor of Harvey\u2019s estate, brought this action for a judgment declaring that METRO was obligated to reimburse the estate for Harvey\u2019s hospital and medical bills. Plaintiff moved, and METRO cross-moved, for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Supreme Court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion, granted METRO\u2019S cross motion and dismissed the complaint. The Appellate Division reversed, granted summary judgment to plaintiff and remitted the matter to Supreme Court for entry of a judgment declaring that METRO was obligated to reimburse Harvey\u2019s estate for the medical and hospital bills (272 AD2d 575). The court held that Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 and its implementing regulations did not permit an insurer to exclude coverage for medical conditions causally related to alcohol use. The court also determined that Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 and its implement<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ing regulations were not preempted by the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) (Public Law 93-406, adding 29 USC \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq.). </em>We granted leave to appeal and now affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The first issue before us on this appeal is whether the Insurance Law and its implementing regulations permit a self-insured health benefit plan like METRO to exclude coverage for medical conditions that develop as a consequence of alcohol use. Conceding that the Insurance Law and regulations apply to health benefit self-insurers, METRO argues that the exclusion of alcohol-related illnesses is authorized by Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 (Z) (6) (A) and 11 NYCRR 52.16 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Before its amendment in 1999, Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 (Z) (6) (A) expressly provided that \u201c[e]very insurer delivering a group * * * policy or issuing a group * * * policy for delivery, in this state, which provides coverage for inpatient hospital care <em>must make available </em>and, if requested by the policyholder, provide <em>coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism or alcohol abuse,\u201d </em>including coverage for minimum periods of detoxification treatment and rehabilitation services (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The applicable regulation provides that \u201c[n]o policy shall limit or exclude coverage by type of illness, accident, treatment or medical condition, <em>except </em>* * * mental or emotional disorders, <em>alcoholism </em>and drug addiction, <em>except </em>that coverage must be made available or provided pursuant to section * * * 3221 * * * of the Insurance Law\u201d (11 NYCRR 52.16 [c] [2] [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">METRO reads Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 as mandating coverage for alcohol rehabilitation and detoxification treatment. It then interprets the regulation as allowing the exclusion of coverage for illnesses arising from the use of alcohol. To reach its conclusion, METRO reads the exception for \u201calcoholism\u201d contained in the regulation as referring not to alcoholism itself, but to ill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>nesses arising from the use of alcohol. METRO maintains that it would make no sense to read the exception for \u201calcoholism\u201d as referring to alcoholism alone because the exception then would be canceled out by the further requirement that coverage for treatment of alcoholism be made available pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 3221. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">METRO\u2019S argument is based on a misreading of the statute and regulation. Contrary to METRO\u2019S position, Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 <em>(l) </em>(6) (A) does not mandate coverage for alcoholism. Rather, it simply requires insurers to make <em>available </em>to proposed insureds the option to purchase certain additional coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism. In this way, the statute promotes the legislative goal \u201cto promote and expand * * * health insurance coverage\u201d for \u201cthe diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism through reimbursement for detoxification and rehabilitation services\u201d (L 1981, ch 28, \u00a7 1; <em>see also, </em>former Insurance Law \u00a7 162 [17]; Mem of Assembly-member Passannante, 1981 NY Legis Ann, at 47; Bill Jacket, L 1983, ch 595).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">With an understanding of the correct application of the statute, METRO\u2019S argument \u2014 that the regulation makes sense only if it is read to allow the exclusion of coverage for alcohol-related illnesses \u2014 does not withstand scrutiny. The \u201calcoholism\u201d exception in the regulation permits insurers to exclude coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism itself, thereby recognizing that coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism is not mandated. The regulation\u2019s further exception for Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 merely requires group insurers to make available as an option certain added coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism. This leaves intact and meaningful the literal application of the regulatory bar against excluding coverage \u201cby type of illness\u201d (11 NYCRR 52.16 [c] [2], <em>supra) </em>to illnesses arising from the use of alcohol. The two exceptions in the regulation do not cancel each other out but complement each other and, thus, do not compel us to accept the tortured interpretation of the regulation that METRO urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Indeed, the drafters of the regulation could have used the phrase illnesses \u201carising out of\u2019 alcoholism or similar terminology if they intended the exclusion for alcoholism to apply to such illnesses. The insurance regulations use such \u201carising out of\u2019 language in various sections <em>(see, e.g., </em>11 NYCRR 16.12 [e] [Code 2-14060] [\u201cCoverage for liability arising out of use of hazardous pesticides\u201d]; [e] [Code 2-50000] [\u201cCoverage for losses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>arising out of the actions of a foreign government\u201d]; 52.25 [b] [2] [iv] [\u201cIllness, treatment or medical condition arising out of\u2019 various risk exposures, such as \u201cwar\u201d and \u201cservice in the armed forces\u201d]; 60-1.2 [d] [\u201cBodily injury to or sickness, disease or death of any employee of the insured arising out of\u2019 the insured\u2019s employment]).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">In fact, section 52.16 itself provides an exception for the exclusion of coverage with respect to \u201cillness, accident, treatment or medical condition <em>arising out of </em>\u2019 certain other enumerated situations (11 NYCRR 52.16 [c] [4] [emphasis supplied]). The drafters of the regulation, however, chose not to use such language in crafting the alcoholism exception to the prohibition of exclusions based upon type of illness contained in section 52.16 (c) (2). Under these circumstances, no reason exists to interpret the alcoholism exception as referring to \u201cillnesses arising from alcoholism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In this case, Harvey suffered from illnesses arising from his use of alcohol. As previously discussed, the applicable regulation explicitly prohibits METRO from excluding coverage by type of illness, and the exception for coverage for alcoholism is inapplicable here. Thus, we agree with the Appellate Division that Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 <em>(l) </em>(6) (A) and 11 NYCRR 52.16 (c) did not permit METRO to exclude coverage for Harvey\u2019s alcohol-related illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We also agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that ERISA (29 USC \u00a7 1001 <em>et </em>seq.) does not pre-empt the application of Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 <em>(l) </em>(6) (A) and 11 NYCRR 52.16 (c) in this case. Congress enacted ERISA in 1974 \u201cto safeguard employees from the abuse and mismanagement of funds that had been accumulated to finance various types of employee benefits\u201d <em>(James v Fleet/Norstar Fin. Group, </em>992 F2d 463, 465 [2d Cir]). ERISA \u201cdoes not go about protecting plan participants and their beneficiaries by requiring employers to provide any given set of minimum benefits\u201d <em>(New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v Travelers Ins. Co., </em>514 US 645, 651). Rather, it \u201ccontrols the administration of benefit plans\u201d by imposing, among other things, \u201creporting and disclosure mandates * * * and fiduciary responsibilities for plan administrators\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">ERISA provides an extensive and complex pre-emption scheme to facilitate the maintenance of a uniform national law governing employee benefit plan administration. The pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>emption provisions allow plan fiduciaries to administer employee benefit plans uniformly across State lines based upon the governing documents and instruments, while still allowing certain incidental State regulation of plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">As relevant here, ERISA contains a broad general preemption provision (see, 29 USC \u00a7 1144 [a]). That, however, is followed by an Insurance Savings Clause (see, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1144 [b] [2] [A]) which limits pre-emption with respect to State regulation of insurance. The application of the Insurance Savings Clause to preserve State insurance regulation is in turn expressly subject to an exception contained in the so-called \u201cDeemer Clause,\u201d by which employee benefit plans are not to be deemed insurers even if subject to State regulation as such (see, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1144 [b] [2] [B]). The Deemer Clause, however, is statutorily trumped, in pertinent part here, by a 1983 amendment to ERISA permitting State insurance regulations to be extended to any non-fully insured employee benefit plan which is a \u201cmultiple employer welfare arrangement [MEWA] * * * to the extent [that the regulation is] not inconsistent with the preceding sections of [the ERISA statute]\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 1144 [b] [6] [A] [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">METRO persuasively argues that ERISA\u2019s general preemption provision \u2014 which directs that ERISA \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may * * * relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d (29 USC \u00a7 1144 [a]) \u2014 applies to preempt Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 and its implementing regulations because those provisions \u201crelate to\u201d the METRO benefits plan in requiring the plan to provide coverage for alcohol-related illnesses. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that a State law relates to an ERISA plan \u201cif it has a <em>connection with </em>or reference to such a plan\u201d <em>(Shaw v Delta Air Lines, </em>463 US 85, 97 [emphasis supplied]). The forbidden connection has been found in State mandates that impose a particular benefit structure on ERISA-covered employee benefit plans <em>(see, Travelers, supra, </em>514 US, at 656-658; <em>Shaw v Delta Air Lines, supra, </em>463 US, at 97; <em>see also, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v Massachusetts, </em>471 US 724, 739 [\u201cthe mandated-benefit law as applied relates to ERISA plans and thus is covered by ERISA\u2019s broad pre-emption provision\u201d]). Here, Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 <em>(l) </em>(6) (A) and 11 NYCRR 52.16 (c) apparently have a \u201cconnection with\u201d the METRO employee benefit plan because they similarly impose a basic benefit structure by dictating that the plan provide coverage for alcohol-related illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The determination that ERISA\u2019s general pre-emption provision is triggered in this case does not, however, end the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>emption analysis. As previously outlined, even when a State insurance regulation of general application falls within ERISA\u2019s general pre-emption provision, its supersedure may be avoided under ERISA\u2019s Insurance Savings Clause, which declares that, \u201c[e]xcept as provided [in the next subparagraph],\u201d nothing in ERISA \u201cshall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance\u201d (29 USC \u00a7 1144 [b] [2] [A]).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v Massachusetts </em>(471 US 724, <em>supra) </em>is the seminal case on the scope of the Insurance Savings Clause in exempting State insurance regulation from ERISA\u2019s broad general pre-emption provision. There, the insurer challenged on express pre-emption grounds the validity of a statute mandating that all group health insurance policies sold within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including those sold to ERISA employee benefit plans, provide certain minimum coverage for treatment of mental illness. In rejecting the insurer\u2019s contention that the Savings Clause should be construed to preserve only \u201ctraditional\u201d State law directly regulating insurers on \u201csuch matters as the way in which insurance may be sold,\u201d the Supreme Court of the United States interpreted the Insurance Savings Clause expansively (id., at 741). The Court held that the Savings Clause extended to State regulation of the substantive content of health insurance policies in employee benefit plans, including provisions mandating the scope and type of health insurance benefits, akin to the regulation at issue here <em>(see, id., </em>at 744). The Court recognized that saving substantive content-based State regulation of insurance contracts would perpetuate \u201cthe disuniformities currently facing national [employee benefit] plans that enter into local markets to purchase insurance\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 747), in derogation of one of the purposes of ERISA. But, the Court concluded, \u201c[s]uch disuniformities * * * are the inevitable result of the congressional decision to \u2018save\u2019 local insurance regulation. Arguments as to the wisdom of these policy choices must be directed at Congress\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Nonetheless, because METRO is a free-standing employee welfare plan whose benefits are self-funded rather than funded through insurance policies, application of the statute and regulation to METRO loses the protection of the Insurance Savings Clause by virtue of the Deemer Clause exception, which provides that no employee benefit plan \u201cshall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer * * * or to be engaged in the business of insurance * * * for purposes of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies [or] insurance contracts\u201d (29 USC \u00a7 1144 [b] [2] [B]). As explained in <em>FMC Corp. v Holliday,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cBy forbidding States to deem employee benefit plans \u2018to be an insurance company or other insurer ... or to be engaged in the business of insurance,\u2019 the deemer clause relieves plans from state laws \u2018purporting to regulate insurance.\u2019 As a result, self-funded ERISA plans are exempt from state regulation insofar as that regulation \u2018relate [s] to\u2019 the plans. State laws directed toward the plans are pre-empted because they relate to an employee benefit plan but are not \u2018saved\u2019 because they do not regulate insurance. State laws that directly regulate insurance are \u2018saved\u2019 but do not reach self-funded employee benefit plans because the plans may not be deemed to be insurance companies, other insurers, or engaged in the business of insurance for purposes of such state laws\u201d (498 US 52, 61).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Plaintiff urges, however, that the Deemer Clause is inapplicable to the METRO plan because, as METRO concedes, the plan is a MEWA (see, 29 USC \u00a7 1002 [40] [A]). As quoted and explained in the earlier outline of the over-all pre-emption scheme of ERISA, despite the Deemer Clause, State regulation of insurance may be applied to self-funded MEWA employee welfare benefit plans such as METRO, \u201cto the extent not <em>inconsistent </em>with the preceding <em>sections </em>of [ERISA]\u201d (29 USC \u00a7 1144 [b] [6] [A] [ii], <em>supra </em>[emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Congress added the MEWA provision to curb abuses by certain multiple employer trusts, which often invoked ERISA pre-emption to avoid State regulation and proceeded to squander or embezzle trust funds, ultimately declaring bankruptcy and \u201cleaving thousands of people holding the bag for millions of dollars in unpaid hospital and medical bills\u201d (128 Cong Rec 30356 [statement of Rep Erlenborn]). The purpose of the amendment was to make clear the extent to which State insurance regulation is saved from pre-emption, when applied to employee benefit plans that are also MEWAs <em>(see, id., </em>at 30357). In light of the MEWA provision, \u201cstates are now free to regulate MEWAs whether or not the MEWA may also be an ERISA-covered employee welfare benefit plan\u201d (Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements Under the Employee Retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ment Income Security Act: A Guide to Federal and State Regulation [ERISA Guide], US Dept of Labor Doc, at 5 &lt;http:// www.dol.gov/dol/pwba/public/pubs/mwguide.pdf&gt;).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">METRO asserts that Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 <em>(l) </em>(6) (A) and 11 NYCRR 52.16 (c) are <em>inconsistent </em>with ERISA, thereby rendering the MEWA exception to the Deemer Clause inoperative. Therefore, METRO urges, the Deemer Clause controls to restore application of ERISA\u2019s general pre-emption provision to invalidate the State regulation at issue here. Because no direct conflict exists between the State mandate for health benefit coverage here and any specific provision in ERISA, METRO cannot point to any \u201csection\u201d of ERISA with which the statute and regulation here are \u201cinconsistent\u201d <em>(see, id.). </em>As noted in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (supra, </em>471 US, at 732), ERISA does not regulate the substantive content of welfare-benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Instead, METRO contends that the conflict, hence inconsistency, is between the State regulation of the content of health benefits in this MEWA employee benefit plan and ERISA\u2019s core concern for nationwide uniformity in the administration of all such plans. METRO does not make clear whether this argument is based purely upon statutory interpretation in addressing the critical issue here from the standpoint of express preemption analysis, or relies instead upon the implied conflict pre-emption doctrine on the theory that substantive content-based State regulation of employee health benefit coverage in the METRO plan stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the congressional objectives in enacting ERISA <em>(see, Geier v American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 US 861, 881-882). Under either theory, METRO\u2019S argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Congress itself made the policy determination that the objective of national uniformity in the administration of employee benefit plans must yield to its concomitant \u201cdecision to \u2018save\u2019 local [substantive content-based as well as procedural] insurance regulation,\u201d knowing full well that it would perpetuate \u201cdisuniformities\u201d <em>(Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>471 US, at 747). In the same vein, as indicated in the previously cited legislative history of the MEWA amendment, Congress made a second policy decision in 1983 to permit further disuniformity by, in effect, extending the Insurance Savings Clause to this type of content-based health benefit regulation of self-insured MEWA employee health benefit plans. Therefore, enforcement of the mandated coverage for alcohol-related illness under Insurance Law \u00a7 3221 and 11 NYCRR 52.16 (c) is neither inconsistent nor in conflict with ERISA or congressional objectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>in enacting it and, thus, does not violate the Supremacy Clause (US Const, art VI, cl [2]), either under express pre-emption or implied conflict pre-emption analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\">. The Appellate Division order is final and subject to review by this Court because the remittal to Supreme Court contemplates purely ministerial action (see <em>generally, </em>Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 17, at 79-81 [3d ed]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">. The 1999 amendment did not affect the applicability of the statute to alcoholism. The amendment merely mandates availability of extended optional coverage to treatment of all forms of \u201cchemical abuse\u201d and \u201cchemical dependence\u201d (L 1999, ch 558, \u00a7 27). \u201cChemical abuse\u201d includes alcohol and substance abuse <em>(id.). </em>\u201cChemical dependence\u201d includes alcoholism and substance dependence <em>(id.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
