On January 26, 1998, the prosecution filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty pursuant to CPL 250.40 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In September 1998, County Court denied defendant\u2019s motions to suppress oral and written statements he had made to the police, and scheduled the trial to begin November 9, 1998. Prior to that date, the People and counsel for defendant entered into plea negotiations and ultimately agreed that defendant would be permitted to plead guilty to murder in the first degree in full satisfaction of the indictment and receive an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life imprisonment, in exchange for defendant\u2019s cooperation in the prosecution\u2019s case against his codefendants. They further agreed that the prosecution would formally withdraw the notice of intent after defendant\u2019s allocution and offer of his guilty plea but before the court\u2019s acceptance of that plea. After a recess, during which defendant had the opportunity to confer once again with his counsel, defendant offered a plea of guilty to murder in the first degree in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">County Court conducted a detailed allocution regarding whether defendant offered the plea freely, voluntarily and with full awareness of the rights he was forfeiting. At the time of the plea, defendant expressly waived his right to appeal except with respect to his motion to suppress. After defendant\u2019s al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>locution, the People withdrew the notice of intent and County Court then accepted defendant\u2019s plea and ordered a presentence investigation and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">On December 22, 1998, after defendant\u2019s guilty plea had been entered but before sentencing, this Court decided <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei </em>(92 NY2d 613, <em>cert denied </em>527 US 1015). <em>Hynes </em>came to this Court as a result of a CPLR article 78 petition in the nature of prohibition seeking to prevent Justice Tomei from enforcing an order declaring the plea provisions of the death penalty statute facially unconstitutional. In that case, we struck CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and CPL 220.30 (3) (b) (vii), the plea provisions, from New York\u2019s death penalty statute. Those provisions permitted a defendant \u2014 against whom a 250.40 (2) notice was pending \u2014 to enter a guilty plea to the crime of first degree murder only with consent of the People and permission of the court and only when the agreed-upon sentence was either life without parole or a term of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">This Court excised those provisions to avoid a constitutional infirmity under <em>United States v Jackson (390 US </em>570 [1968]). New York\u2019s death penalty statute, like the defect the Supreme Court specifically identified in the Federal Kidnaping Act in <em>Jackson, </em>created a two-tiered penalty structure that impermissibly burdened capital defendants\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment rights to trial by jury by limiting imposition of a death sentence exclusively to defendants asserting those rights by insisting upon a jury trial <em>(see, Matter of Hynes, supra, </em>at 621, citing <em>United States v Jackson, supra, </em>at 583). In order to remedy that flaw, this Court construed the first-degree murder statute to prohibit entry of a guilty plea to murder in the first degree while a CPL 250.40 notice is pending <em>(see, Matter of Hynes v Tomei, supra, </em>at 629). Further, in order to prevent a \u201crace to the courthouse\u201d in first-degree murder cases, we held that a defendant does not have an unqualified right to plead guilty before the notice is filed and prior to the expiration of the statutory period within which the notice may be filed <em>(see, Matter of Francois v Dolan, </em>95 NY2d 33, 38-39).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In February 1999, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that it was invalid under <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei. </em>County Court denied the motion, noting first that defendant did \u201cnot challenge his plea as involuntary or unknowing or unintelligent,\u201d and concluding that because defendant\u2019s plea was actually entered <em>\u201cafter </em>the notice of intent was withdrawn\u201d or \u201cin conjunction with the withdrawal of the no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tice of intent,\u201d it was valid notwithstanding <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei </em>(180 Misc 2d 564, 566, 567). Thereafter, on April 28, 1999, the court sentenced defendant to 25 years to life in prison, in accordance with the terms of the negotiated plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Division, defendant argued that his plea was invalid and that his suppression motion was improperly denied. That court reversed defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that it was error to deny defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, vacated defendant\u2019s plea and sentence and restored the parties to their pre-plea position by reinstating the notice of intent to seek the death penalty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate Division determined that because the plea was entered \u201cpursuant to statutory provisions invalidated after defendant\u2019s waiver [of his right to appeal] * * * defendant <em>could not have knowingly and intelligently waived </em>his right to appeal the constitutional infirmity\u201d (274 AD2d 754, 756 [emphasis supplied]). The court further concluded that defendant\u2019s challenge fell into the category of those claims \u2014 such as an illegal sentence or an involuntary plea \u2014 that could never be waived in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Turning to defendant\u2019s argument that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hynes v Tomei </em>rendered his plea invalid, the Appellate Division held that the procedure utilized by County Court in order to avoid any <em>Jackson </em>problem was \u201cflawed because it overlooks the essence of the <em>Hynes-Jackson </em>infirmity\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 757). The court reasoned that the \u201cconstitutional infirmity arises not from the <em>entry </em>of a guilty plea to murder in the first degree while a death notice is pending, but from the requirement placed upon a defendant <em>to choose </em>between pleading guilty to murder in the first degree or opting for trial while a death notice is pending\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis in the original]). Thus, the Appellate Division concluded that the \u201cmere proffer of a plea bargain to murder in the first degree while a death notice is pending presents a capital defendant with the same unconstitutional choice faced by the defendants in <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei </em>* * * and <em>Matter of Relin v Connell </em>* * * namely, \u2018exercise Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights and risk death, or abandon those rights and avoid the possibility of death\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at 757-758 [quoting <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei, supra, </em>at 626]). A Judge of this Court granted both the People and defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>leave to-appeal. We now reverse on the People\u2019s appeal, and dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On this appeal, the dispositive issue is whether, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to first degree murder was invalid as having impermissibly burdened his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The People essentially raise three points for reversal. First, they argue that invalidity under <em>Jackson-Hynes </em>was avoided under the sequence in which defendant\u2019s plea was offered, accepted and entered in this case. That is because immediately after defendant\u2019s allocution, but before the plea actually became effective by its acceptance by the court and its formal entry, the People had withdrawn the notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Second, the People contend that, even assuming that the mere proffer of a guilty plea while a notice of intent was still pending implicated a <em>Jackson </em>infirmity, it would not necessarily render defendant\u2019s plea of guilty constitutionally invalid, and the Appellate Division erred in holding otherwise. Third, the People assert that defendant\u2019s separate waiver of his right to appeal precludes appellate review of all claims except for that related to denial of his suppression motion. Because we agree that, under binding Supreme Court precedent, defendant\u2019s plea was <em>not </em>rendered invalid by <em>JacksonHynes, </em>we need not address whether the specific procedure employed in this case avoided any <em>Jackson </em>defect, nor whether defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal precluded him from making his constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Defendant makes a two-fold counter-argument regarding the validity of his guilty plea under <em>Jackson-Hynes. </em>First, he contends that, because he did not \u2014 and indeed could not\u2014 predict this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei, </em>as a matter of law his guilty plea could not have been made knowingly and intelligently and the Appellate Division therefore correctly set it aside. Second, he argues that, as the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Division held, <em>Jackson-Hynes </em>invalidates <em>any </em>procedural scheme under which a defendant is forced to choose to plead guilty to a capital offense as the only means of avoiding exposure to the death penalty. Hence, as a result, a guilty plea thus engendered cannot constitutionally be valid. United States Supreme Court precedents defeat both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">As to the effect of the handing down of <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei </em>subsequent to defendant\u2019s guilty plea, <em>Brady v United States </em>(397 US 742 [1970]) is directly on point and conclusively contrary to defendant\u2019s position. In <em>Brady, </em>the Supreme Court considered the validity of a capital offense guilty plea under the very same Federal Kidnaping Act death penalty provisions that were declared unconstitutional in <em>Jackson. </em>Brady pleaded guilty prior to the <em>Jackson </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Like defendant\u2019s argument here regarding the later <em>Hynes </em>decision by our Court, Brady argued in the Supreme Court that his inability to anticipate the intervening <em>Jackson </em>decision established that his plea could not have been knowingly and intelligently made. The Supreme Court\u2019s outright rejection of that contention is directly applicable to the same argument here. \u201c[A]bsent misrepresentation or other impermissible conduct by state agents, a voluntary plea of guilty intelligently made in light of the then applicable law does not become vulnerable because later judicial decisions indicate that the plea rested on a faulty premise\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 757 [citation omitted]). Accordingly, the \u201cfact that Brady did not anticipate <em>United States v Jackson, supra, </em>does not impugn the truth or reliability of his plea\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Here, too, defendant\u2019s guilty plea was not rendered invalid merely because our subsequent <em>Hynes </em>decision may have shown \u201cthat the plea rested on a faulty premise\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s alternative argument for invalidating his plea is also meritless, upon further review of, on the one hand, <em>Brady </em>and other Supreme Court cases upholding guilty pleas under statutes violating <em>Jackson </em>and, on the other hand, Supreme Court decisions vacating death sentences imposed after trial under statutes violating <em>Jackson. </em>Defendant argues that, in effect, any guilty plea to a capital offense is invalid where a defendant was faced with the choice of exercising Fifth and Sixth Amendment trial rights and risking death, or waiving those rights and pleading guilty in order to avoid that risk. <em>Brady, </em>however, expressly cautioned against the conclusion that a <em>Jackson </em>defect in the particular death penalty statute necessarily required invalidation of a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>plea entered pursuant thereto that was otherwise valid (i.e., voluntary, knowing and intelligent):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">\u201cPlainly, it seems to us, <em>Jackson </em>ruled neither that all pleas of guilty encouraged by the fear of a possible death sentence are involuntary pleas nor that such encouraged pleas are invalid whether involuntary or not. <em>Jackson </em>prohibits the imposition of the death penalty under [the defective statute], but that decision neither fashioned a new standard for judging the validity of guilty pleas nor mandated a new application of the test theretofore fashioned by courts and since reiterated that guilty pleas are valid if both \u2018voluntary\u2019 and \u2018intelligent\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brady, supra, </em>at 747 [citing <em>Boykin v Alabama, </em>395 US 238, 242]; <em>see also, Hynes, supra, </em>at 623, n 3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">This conclusion was reiterated in <em>Parker v North Carolina </em>(397 US 790), decided during the same term as <em>Brady. </em>In <em>Parker, </em>the Court noted \u201c[i]t may be that under <em>United States v Jackson </em>* * * it was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty under the statutory framework which existed in North Carolina at the time of Parker\u2019s plea\u201d <em>{id., </em>at 794-795). Nonetheless, the Court held \u201cthat an otherwise valid plea is not involuntary because induced by the defendant\u2019s desire to limit the possible maximum penalty to less than that authorized if there is a jury trial\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 795; <em>see also, North Carolina v Alford, </em>400 US 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In stark contrast, in a series of 1971 cases in which death sentences were imposed after trial under the very same constitutionally defective North Carolina statute pursuant to which the <em>Parker </em>defendant pleaded guilty to a capital offense, the Supreme Court summarily reversed the death sentences, relying on <em>Jackson (see, Atkinson v North Carolina, </em>403 US 948; <em>Roseboro v North Carolina, </em>403 US 948; <em>Hill v North Carolina, </em>403 US 948; <em>Williams v North Carolina, </em>403 US 948; <em>Sanders v North Carolina, </em>403 US 948; <em>see also, Matter of Hynes v Tomei, supra, </em>92 NY2d, at 624 [noting Supreme Court reversals of death sentences imposed after trial under unconstitutional pleading scheme]).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">This post <em>-Jackson </em>line of cases illustrates the Supreme Court\u2019s shift in focus away from the coercive effect of the death penalty on a defendant who pleads guilty, and toward the \u201cimpermissible burden\u201d a two-tiered penalty structure imposes on a defendant\u2019s assertion of his or her constitutional rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Accordingly, the Supreme Court left undisturbed convictions in which the risk of death was avoided by an otherwise valid guilty plea. Contrariwise, the Court held that death sentences imposed upon capital defendants who had exercised Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under such defective statutes were constitutionally barred by <em>Jackson. </em>In <em>Hynes, </em>we explicitly noted the effect of the later cases vacating death sentences imposed under Jackson-faulty statutes <em>(see, Matter of Hynes v Tomei, supra, </em>92 NY2d, at 624). In response to those cases, we construed and excised portions of the New York death penalty statute to eliminate its <em>Jackson </em>infirmity and thereby obviate such future Fifth and Sixth Amendment challenges to the imposition of death sentences. Thus, any <em>Jackson-Hynes </em>infirmity does not \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 render invalid an otherwise valid guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As noted above, this case is procedurally and analytically indistinguishable from <em>Brady v United States </em>(397 US 742, supra) with respect to an asserted violation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. In both <em>Brady </em>and in this case, defendants each entered an otherwise entirely valid guilty plea under a statute that was Jackson-defective at the time of the plea. Thus, we conclude that defendant\u2019s guilty plea to first-degree, murder \u2014 even if it had been the exclusive means by which he avoided exposure to the risk of imposition of the death penalty \u2014 did not, standing alone, violate his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. Because the order of the Appellate Division was based upon the premise that defendant\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were thus violated, it must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The dissent\u2019s effort to distinguish this case from <em>Brady </em>is unavailing and actually inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s own view of its <em>Brady </em>precedent. As the dissent accurately notes, the gravamen of defendant\u2019s constitutional complaint here is the impairment of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, inducing his guilty plea. \u201cJust as the applicable provisions chilled a defendant\u2019s exercise of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in <em>United States v Jackson </em>and <em>Hynes v Tomei, </em>the provisions, already declared unconstitutional, chill those rights in this case\u201d (dissenting opn, at 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Having recognized that the thrust of defendant\u2019s claim is that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated, the dissent attempts to distinguish <em>Brady </em>as merely involving \u201cwhether defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary when the reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the plea was to avoid the death penalty. Here, voluntariness is not an issue\u201d (id., at 460). The dissent\u2019s portrayal of <em>Brady </em>is inaccurate. First, as already noted, <em>Brady </em>expressly states that its ruling was intended to cover not only the issue of whether or not a guilty plea induced by a <em>Jackson </em>defect is involuntary, but also whether such a guilty plea is invalid, irrespective of its voluntariness. To be sure, <em>Brady </em>indicated that <em>Jackson </em>did not necessarily render involuntary all guilty pleas encouraged by fear of a possible death sentence under defective statutes. <em>Brady </em>did more than that, however. <em>Brady </em>explicitly made clear that <em>Jackson </em>additionally did <em>not </em>imply that all \u201csuch encouraged pleas are invalid <em>whether involuntary or </em>not\u201d (397 US, at 747 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Moreover, in <em>Hynes, </em>we expressly recognized that <em>Brady </em>and its companion cases were controlling on the very issue in this case as framed by the dissent: \u201cwhether the plea is valid when the statutory provisions under which the plea was made are unconstitutional\u201d (dissenting opn, at 460). Citing <em>Brady, Alford </em>and <em>Parker, </em>we stated in <em>Hynes </em>that the Supreme Court had \u201crefused to vacate guilty pleas <em>simply because they were agreed to pursuant to statutes subsequently invalidated by Jackson\u201d (Matter of Hynes v Tomei, </em>92 NY2d, at 623, n 3 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Finally, the dissenting opinion ignores the effect of its acknowledgment that \u201c[h]ere, voluntariness is <em>not </em>an issue\u201d (dissenting opn, at 460 [emphasis supplied]). That concession, together with our holding that the mere fact that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was entered before <em>Hynes </em>was decided is not inconsistent with a finding that it was made knowingly and intelligently, is fatal to all of defendant\u2019s arguments adopted by the dissent. In settled doctrine from at least as early as <em>Boykin v Alabama </em>(395 US 238, 243), the Supreme Court has held that a voluntary, knowing, intelligent and fully counseled guilty plea waives, among other rights, a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. Our precedents are in full agreement (s<em>ee, eg., People v Hansen, </em>95 NY2d 227, 230).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In <em>Tollett v Henderson </em>(411 US 258), the Supreme Court reviewed its <em>Brady </em>and <em>Parker </em>precedents, which had applied that waiver principle to capital offense guilty pleas induced by statutes impermissibly burdening defendant\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment trial rights \u2014 the heart of defendant\u2019s contentions here. In <em>Tollett, </em>the Court emphatically confirmed its continued adherence to those holdings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u201cWe thus reaffirm the principle recognized in the <em>Brady </em>trilogy: a guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process. When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea\u201d (411 US, at 267).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Because, under <em>Brady, </em>defendant\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment arguments for invalidation of his guilty plea necessarily fail, we need not consider the effect of his separate waiver of the right to appeal on his assertions of the impairment of those very Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Accordingly, on the People\u2019s appeal, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, the plea reinstated and the case remitted to the Appellate Division to conduct, in the exercise of its factual review powers and its interests of justice jurisdiction, the necessary review of the record. Defendant\u2019s appeal should be dismissed upon the ground that he is not adversely affected by the Appellate Division order within the meaning of CPL 450.90 (1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">. The court also upheld the County Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">. [1] Defendant\u2019s appeal must be dismissed. Although the order of the Appellate Division granted defendant only partial relief, it was nonetheless not adverse to defendant within the meaning of CPL 450.90 (1) and, thus, this Court is not empowered to review defendant\u2019s challenges to that order insofar as it upheld the denial of his suppression motion and reinstated the death notice (see, CPL 450.90 [1]; Karger, Powers of New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 129 [a], at 735 [3d ed]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\">. Contrary to the position taken by the dissent, all of defendant\u2019s contentions are related to and exclusively in support of this one Federal constitutional challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b554-7\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcL\">(dissenting). Because I agree with the Appellate Division that this plea was invalid pursuant to our decision in <em>Matter of Hynes v Tomei </em>(92 NY2d 613, <em>cert denied </em>527 US 1015) and because the acceptance of the plea violated statutory as well as fundamental constitutional principles, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">On May 29, 1997, defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [a] [vi]; [b]), murder in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]), conspiracy in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 105.15) and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 265.03). On January 26, 1998, the prosecutor filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty as provided in CPL 250.40 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Prior to our decision in <em>Hynes v Tomei, </em>which was decided on December 22, 1998, and while the notice of intent to seek the death penalty was still in effect, defendant pleaded guilty to the first count of the indictment, murder in the first degree. During that proceeding, he waived his right to appeal all is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>sues except the denial of his motion to suppress statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to the plea, there were negotiations between the prosecution and the defense and it was understood that after the plea, but prior to the imposition of sentence, the prosecution would withdraw the notice of intent to seek the death penalty. That understanding was carried out when, by written statement dated October 16, 1998, the District Attorney withdrew the notice of intent to seek the death penalty. On April 28, 1999, after the decision in <em>Hynes v Tomei, </em>the Schoharie County Court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">By motion dated February 18, 1999, defendant moved to withdraw his plea. The motion was based on several grounds. First, defendant alleged violation of several constitutional provisions, both Federal and State. The affidavit of the attorneys in support of the motion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201c6. Said motion is made in reliance upon the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, his right to a jury trial, his right to \u00e1 reliable sentence determination, his right to due process, his right to compulsory process, his right to confrontation, his right to equal protection, his right against self-incrimination, and other rights protected by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, Article I of the New York State Constitution, and other authorities as cited within the memorandum of law submitted in support hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amn\">Second, defendant argued that the holding of <em>Hynes v Tomei </em>precluded his guilty plea because the facts in his case were identical to the facts in <em>Hynes. </em>Third, defendant argued that he could not plead guilty while a notice of intent to seek the death penalty was in effect and that a judgment of conviction upon a plea pursuant to statutory provisions which had been declared unconstitutional was itself invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In a \u201cMemorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Withdraw Plea,\u201d defendant relied on State and Federal cases in support of his argument that he was entitled to the benefits of the change in the law made before judgment was entered in the case: <em>People v Walker </em>(81 NY2d 661, 667); <em>People v Catalanotte </em>(72 NY2d 641, 643, <em>cert denied </em>493 US 811); and <em>Griffith v Kentucky </em>(479 US 314, 323).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion. The Appellate Division reversed, vacated the judgment, restored the indictment to the pre-plea stage and reinstated the prosecution\u2019s notice of intent to seek the death penalty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">On this appeal, defendant\u2019s contentions are that the holding in <em>Hynes </em>precludes his plea, that a judgment entered upon statutory provisions that have been declared unconstitutional is invalid and that <em>Hynes </em>explicitly states that he cannot validly plead guilty while a notice of intent to seek the death penalty is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In <em>Hynes v Tomei, </em>this Court declared unconstitutional CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and 220.30 (3) (b) (vii),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plea provisions of the Death Penalty Statute, on the grounds that they were in violation of <em>United States v Jackson </em>(390 US 570). In <em>Jackson, </em>the Supreme Court held unconstitutional the death penalty provision of the Federal Kidnaping Act (18 USC \u00a7 1201 [a]) on the ground that it imposed an impermissible burden on the exercise of constitutional rights. Specifically, the statute permitted a defendant to avoid the death penalty only by pleading guilty. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cUnder the Federal Kidnaping Act, therefore, the defendant who abandons the right to contest his guilt before a jury is assured that he cannot be executed; the defendant ingenuous enough to seek a jury acquittal stands forewarned that, if the jury finds him guilty and does not wish to spare his life, he will die. Our problem is to decide whether the Constitution permits the establishment of such a death penalty, applicable only to those defendants who assert the right to contest their guilt before a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>jury. The inevitable effect of any such provision, is of course, to discourage assertion of the Fifth Amendment right not to plead guilty and to deter exercise of the Sixth Amendment right to demand a jury trial. If the provision had no other purpose or effect than to chill the assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them, then it would be patently unconstitutional\u201d (390 US, at 581-582).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In <em>Hynes, </em>this Court stated that because the provisions prohibited the imposition of the death penalty only on a plea of guilty to murder in the first degree, the sections needlessly encouraged defendants to forego trial in an effort to avoid a death penalty prosecution. Just as the applicable provisions chilled a defendant\u2019s exercise of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in <em>United States v Jackson </em>and <em>Hynes v Tomei, </em>the provisions, already declared unconstitutional, chill those rights in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Defendant\u2019s second argument is that a judgment of conviction entered after this Court decided <em>Hynes v Tomei </em>is invalid. Once this Court declared the plea provisions unconstitutional, no judgment should have been entered pursuant to a plea of guilty under those provisions. When an applicable provision of law changes while a case is still on appeal, the new standard applies to that case <em>(Griffith v Kentucky, supra, </em>479 US 314, 322-323; <em>People v Walker, </em>81 NY2d 661, 667; <em>People v Catalonotte, supra, </em>72 NY2d, at 645). In <em>Griffith, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201c[FJailure to apply a newly declared constitutional rule to criminal cases pending on direct review violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication. * * * But after we have decided a new rule in the case selected, the integrity of judicial review requires that we apply that rule to all similar cases pending on direct review\u201d <em>(Griffith v Kentucky, </em>479 US, at 322-323).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The application of a change of law to any case on direct appeal is not uniquely Federal. This Court has applied a change in law to cases on direct appeal <em>(People v Morales, </em>37 NY2d 262 [conviction reversed where a notice-of-alibi statute, which had prevented defendant from calling an alibi witness, was declared unconstitutional]; <em>People v Pepper, </em>53 NY2d 213 [the holding of <em>People v Samuels </em>(49 NY2d 218) that once an ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>cusatory instrument has been filed, a defendant cannot waive his constitutional right to counsel except in the presence of counsel, would be applied to all cases on direct review]). It is noteworthy that the majority addresses none of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The majority\u2019s view that this case is governed by <em>Brady v United States </em>(397 US 742) is simply incorrect. The <em>Jackson </em>case held the plea provisions of the kidnaping statute unconstitutional. It did not invalidate the entire statute, nor did it prevent pleas under the statute. Here, by contrast, the very statute authorizing defendant\u2019s plea has been declared unconstitutional. The issue in <em>Brady </em>was whether defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary when the reason for the plea was to avoid the death penalty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, voluntariness is not an issue. The issue is whether the plea is valid when the statutory provisions under which the plea was made are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Third, the clear statement of <em>Hynes v Tomei </em>is that a defendant cannot plead guilty to murder in the first degree while a notice of intent to seek the death penalty is pending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201cFinally, while CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and 220.30 (3) (b) (vii) relate exclusively to pleas in first degree murder cases and \u2018needlessly\u2019 encourage guilty pleas in violation of <em>Jackson, </em>CPL 220.60 (2) (a) is not limited to first degree murder cases, nor does it, in the absence of CPL 220.10 (5) (e), violate <em>Jackson. </em>Therefore, only CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and 220.30 (3) (b) (vii) must be stricken. Under the resulting statute, a defendant may not plead guilty to first degree murder while a notice of intent to seek the death penalty is pending\u201d (92 NY2d, at 628-629).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Since the plea here was made while the intent to seek the death penalty was pending, defendant\u2019s plea is invalid. This is a matter not of Federal law but of State statutory interpretation and State procedure in guilty pleas. Therefore I cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>agree with the majoritys view that there is no State aspect to defendant\u2019s argument here. The plea provisions of the Death Penalty Statute were held unconstitutional on Federal grounds. But defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a State statute and the validity of that plea is very much before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Finally, because an intent to seek the death penalty cannot be refiled once it is withdrawn (CPL 250.40 [4]), the matter should be remitted to the trial court and the indictment restored to the pre-plea stage, without the notice of intent to seek the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur with Judge Levine; Judge Smith dissents in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">On the People\u2019s appeal, order reversed, plea reinstated and case remitted to the Appellate Division, Third Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein. Defendant\u2019s appeal dismissed upon the ground that he is not adversely affected by the Appellate Division order within the meaning of CPL 450.90 (1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">. I agree with the Appellate Division that, as a matter of public policy, the defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal cannot preclude review by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">. The majority concludes that defendant\u2019s appeal must be dismissed because the Appellate Division order was not adverse to him within the meaning of CPL 450.90 (1). Contrary to the view of the majority, when a decision reinstates the possibility of death, it is certainly partially adverse to the defendant. CPL 450.90 (1) states that an appeal may \u201cbe taken to the court of appeals by either the defendant or the people from any adverse or partially adverse order of an intermediate appellate court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">. CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and 220.30 (3) (b) (vii) state in identical language: \u201cA defendant may not enter a plea of guilty to the crime of murder in the first degree as defined in section 125.27 of the penal law; provided, however, that a defendant may enter such a plea with both the permission of the court and the consent of the people when the agreed upon sentence is either life imprisonment without parole or a term of imprisonment for the class A-I felony of murder in the first degree other than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-11\"><em>. </em>The voluntariness of the plea was the only issue raised and determined in <em>Brady. </em>This is clear from a statement in the opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">\u201cIn 1967, petitioner sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, claiming that his plea of guilty was not voluntarily given because \u00a7 1201(a) operated to coerce his plea, because his counsel exerted impermissible pressure upon him, and because his plea was induced by representations with respect to reduction of sentence and clemency\u201d (397 US, at 744).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
