In <em>DJL Rest. Corp. v City of New York </em>(96 NY2d 91 [decided today]), we recounted the history and results of New York City\u2019s initiative in studying and dealing with the adverse effects of adult establishments. The study concluded in 1995 with the City\u2019s adoption of an Amended Zoning Resolution <em>(see, </em>Amended Zoning Resolution of City of NY \u00a7 12-10 [hereinafter AZR]) as a means of stemming the negative, secondary effects of adult establishments, such as crime, property devaluation, blight, and the inappropriate exposure of children and teenagers to sexually oriented environments.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The AZR confines certain \u201cadult eating or drinking establishments\u201d to the City\u2019s manufacturing and high density commercial zoning districts and mandates that they be a minimum distance from areas where children are likely to be present, such as churches, schools and day care centers <em>(see, </em>Zoning Resolution of City of NY \u00a7 32-01 [b]; \u00a7 42-01 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In 1996, a group of establishments, including Stringfellow\u2019s, brought an unsuccessful attack on the constitutionality of the AZR <em>(see, Stringfellow\u2019s of N. Y. v City of New York, </em>91 NY2d 382). Rejecting this challenge, we held that the AZR was not \u201cpurposefully directed at controlling the content of the message conveyed through adult businesses,\u201d but was aimed at the entirely separate societal goal of ameliorating the adverse social consequences of proliferating adult uses <em>(see, Stringfellow\u2019s of N. Y. v City of New York, </em>91 NY2d, at 397, <em>supra; see also, City of Renton v Playtime Theatres, </em>475 US 41, 47-50; <em>Matter of Town of Islip v Caviglia, </em>73 NY2d 544, 552-555). Moreover, we recognized that the AZR is applicable even to establishments that may legitimately claim they do not contribute to urban blight <em>(see, Stringfellow\u2019s of N. Y. v City of New York, </em>91 NY2d, at 401, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>While Stringfellow\u2019s was pursuing its constitutional challenge, it adopted a policy in which it purported to admit minors. The \u201cminors policy,\u201d set forth in a seven-page document, is an elaborate eight-step protocol. First, the doorman is instructed to call a manager, who must then \u201cbeep or call one of [their] attorneys!\u201d (Managers have all the home phone, mobile phone and beeper numbers of the attorneys.) A staffer then must photocopy the ID or license of the parent or guardian and accompany the adult on a tour of the establishment so that the adult may determine if it is suitable for the minor. If so, the parent or guardian must sign a sworn statement that the entertainment featured \u201cis not harmful\u201d to the minor and staple it to a copy of the adult\u2019s ID. The staffer must then ask the child for identification. The child must attest, under oath and in writing, that \u201cthis type of entertainment is not harmful or offensive to me in any way\u201d and that \u201cI will not be harmed by seeing exposed female breasts.\u201d No minor may be admitted unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, and there is no age minimum. Thus, a child of any age may presumably be admitted, except that no \u201ctable dances\u201d are to be given to \u201ccustomers under 17.\u201d The protocol concludes with a nine-point checklist and an admonition that all of the papers and materials must be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">From the summer of 1997, when the policy was instituted, until November 5, 1998, Stringfellow\u2019s admitted only one minor, a 13-year-old child from Caracas, Venezuela. This event was unusual enough to be reported in the newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">After promulgating its minors policy, Stringfellow\u2019s sought a judgment declaring that it was not an \u201cadult eating or drinking establishment\u201d as defined by the AZR. After the City brought an enforcement proceeding, Supreme Court consolidated the actions. Stringfellow\u2019s moved to dismiss the City\u2019s complaint and Supreme Court granted the motion. The Appellate Division reversed and remanded the matter for further proceedings, concluding that Stringfellow\u2019s is an \u201cadult eating or drinking establishment,\u201d notwithstanding its minors policy. Upon remand from the Appellate Division, Supreme Court, among other rulings, granted a permanent injunction preventing Stringfellow\u2019s from using the premises as an adult establishment and the Appellate Division affirmed. Stringfellow\u2019s appealed to this Court as of right, pursuant to CPLR 5601 (b), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>IL</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Pursuant to the AZR an \u201cadult establishment\u201d is \u201ca commercial establishment where a \u2018substantial portion\u2019 of the establishment includes an adult bookstore, adult eating or drinking establishment, adult theater, or other adult commercial establishment, or any combination thereof\u2019 <em>(see, </em>Amended Zoning Resolution of City of NY \u00a7 12-10). An \u201cadult eating or drinking establishment,\u201d in turn, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">\u201can eating or drinking establishment which regularly features any one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201c(1) live performances which are characterized by an emphasis on \u2018specified anatomical areas\u2019 or \u2018specified sexual activities,\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201c(3) employees who, as part of their employment, regularly expose to patrons \u2018specified anatomical areas;\u2019 and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">\u201cwhich is <em>not customarily open to the general public during such features because it excludes minors by reason of </em>age\u201d (Amended Zoning Resolution of City of NY \u00a7 12-10 [b] [italics and footnote added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">As a bar that features topless dancing, there is no question that Stringfellow\u2019s meets subdivisions (1) and (3) of the definition. Stringfellow\u2019s focuses, however, on the underscored phrase: \u201cnot customarily open to the general public during such features because it excludes minors by reason of age.\u201d Stringfellow\u2019s contends that by adopting a minors policy, it has become \u201ccustomarily open to the general public\u201d and does not \u201cexclude [] minors by reason of age.\u201d It argues that the underscored phrase must be given some meaning, relying on <em>City of New York v Dezer Props. </em>(95 NY2d 771, 773), in which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>recognized the importance of according \u201cmeaning to every section of the [AZR].\u201d Moreover, Strihgfellow\u2019s contends that the statute must be read as written, with no further requirements beyond those that the City expressly included <em>(see, City of New York v Les Hommes, </em>94 NY2d 267, 274). Thus, because it purportedly admits minors, the argument goes, it cannot be counted as an \u201cadult eating or drinking establishment.\u201d Finally, Stringfellow\u2019s argues that the Appellate Division erred by considering industry standards in its interpretation of the word \u201ccustomarily\u201d in the AZR.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We reject these arguments. As the Appellate Division observed, the minors policy represents Stringfellow\u2019s attempt \u201cto avoid both the restrictions of the [AZR] as well as any potential criminal liability\u201d (253 AD2d 110, 119). In essence, it reflects an impossible tightrope walk between the AZR and the Penal Law: If children are not customarily admitted, the establishment is subject to the AZR. If children are customarily admitted, the management risks criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Stringfellow\u2019s so-called minors policy is an obvious attempt at an end run around the AZR. Under any definition, Stringfellow\u2019s is not \u201ccustomarily open to the general public.\u201d In <em>Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Assn. v City of New York </em>(82 NY2d 35, 43), we interpreted the phrase \u201ccustomarily open or accessible to the public\u201d contained in the New York City Landmarks Law. We explained that \u201ccustomary openness\u201d requires openness that is \u201cusual, ordinary or habitual (rather than rare or occasional).\u201d Stringfellow\u2019s minors policy plainly fails this test. Minors cannot walk up to the club and be admitted. Indeed, the minors policy is drawn so restrictively as to amount to the de facto exclusion of minors. It comes as no surprise that Stringfellow\u2019s purportedly admitted only one child under its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">When the lawmakers\u2019 purpose is as clear as it is here, we will not bend their words into the shape of a loophole. The City, in drafting the AZR, was exacting in its requirement that these establishments be distanced from schools and day care centers <em>(see, </em>Zoning Resolution of City of NY \u00a7 42-01 [b]; <em>see also, </em>Fredericks, <em>Adult Use Zoning: New York City\u2019s Journey on the Well-Traveled Road From Suppression to Regulation of Sexually Oriented Expression, </em>46 Buff L Rev 433, 451 [1998]; <em>see generally, Buzzetti v City of New York, </em>140 F3d 134). The AZR was designed to keep children away from these establishments, not to have them invited in as customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Stringfellow\u2019s strained interpretation is at odds with the underlying purposes of the Penal Law, which includes provisions designed to shield children from exposure to activities appropriate only for adults <em>(see, e.g., </em>Penal Law \u00a7 260.10 [endangering the welfare of a child]; Penal Law \u00a7 235.21 [disseminating indecent material to minors]) and would create an untenable paradox. Instead of receiving the intended benefits of the AZR, children would serve as the very vehicles by which topless bars can escape classification as \u201cadult eating or drinking establishments.\u201d With supreme irony, the more children the management were to admit, the more secure would be its claim that it is customarily open to the public. We cannot countenance this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\">. Stringfellow\u2019s has changed its name to \u201cTen\u2019s.\u201d In that the caption refers to Stringfellow\u2019s, we continue that designation in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\">. Section 12-10 of the Zoning Resolution also further defined the terms used in the above section as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">\u201c[Specified sexual activities\u201d are \u201c(1) human genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal; (2) actual or simulated acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse or sodomy; or (3) fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic region, buttock, anus or female breast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">\u201cSpecified anatomical areas\u201d are \u201c(1) less than completely and opaquely concealed: (i) human genitals, pubic region, (ii) human buttock, anus, or (iii) female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola; or (2) human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely and opaquely concealed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
