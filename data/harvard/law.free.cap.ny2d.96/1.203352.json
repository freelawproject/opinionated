Where an insurance policy possesses clear and unambiguous language, the court should enforce its terms. <em>(Branch v Chenango Mut. Ins.

Equitable considerations should not be permitted to override the clear and unambiguous provisions of the insurance policy. <em>(Reed v Federal Ins.

Plaintiffs argument that the intentional act exclusion of the policy cannot be enforced because plaintiffs son had no insurable interest in the property is without merit. <em>(Wagner v Gaudig &amp; Blum Corp., </em>223 App Div 254; <em>Moran v Moran, </em>74 Misc 2d 384; <em>Farwell v Johnson, </em>121 Misc 556; <em>Scarola v Insurance Co., </em>31 NY2d 411; <em>Welch v Commercial Ins.

We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Defendant issued plaintiff a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy that provided coverage against loss by fire. The policy excluded coverage for loss resulting from intentional acts by \u201can insured,\u201d and defined \u201can insured\u201d as <em>\u201cyou </em>and, if residents of <em>your </em>household, <em>your </em>relatives.\u201d That definition included plaintiff and her six minor children who lived with her in the insured premises. While the policy was in effect,\" plaintiff\u2019s 17-year-old son intentionally set the premises on fire. Although plaintiff\u2019s son was solely responsible for the arson, defendant disclaimed liability based on the policy exclusion for intentional acts by \u201can insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Plaintiff commenced this action seeking declaratory relief and damages. Supreme Court granted summary judgment for plaintiff, holding that she was entitled to coverage under the policy. Noting that \u201cthe equities clearly favor recovery to the innocent [insured],\u201d the court concluded that because plaintiffs fire insurance policy excludes coverage for acts committed by \u201can insured\u201d rather than by \u201cthe insured,\u201d defendant provides significantly less coverage than that required in the standard insurance policy set forth in Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (e) (175 Mise 2d 616, 620). The Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, reversed and dismissed plaintiffs lawsuit. The majority determined that the policy terms were unambiguous and should be enforced, and that limiting the breadth of coverage to exclude innocent insureds did not violate Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (f) (1) (A). The dissent concluded that defendant\u2019s policy \u201cimpermissibly deprives an innocent owner of coverage\u201d-and that the policy violates Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (256 AD2d 1100, 1102). Plaintiff appealed as of right pursuant to CPLR 5601 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On appeal, defendant argues that because the pertinent policy language is unambiguous, the contract should be enforced according to its terms and plaintiffs recovery barred. Specifically, defendant contends that by setting the insured premises on fire, plaintiffs son, who was \u201can insured,\u201d violated a policy exclusion entitled <em>\u201cIntentional Acts,\u201d </em>which states that it \u201c[does] not pay for loss which results from an act committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>by or at the direction of <em>an </em>insured and with the intent to cause a loss\u201d (emphasis added). Defendant further maintains that there is no violation of Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (f) (1) (A), that the exclusionary clause of the policy is valid under New York State law and that the exclusionary clause applies in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We hold that the. subject exclusion impermissibly restricts the coverage mandated by statute and afforded the innocent insured (Insurance Law \u00a7 3404; <em>Reed v Federal Ins. Co., </em>71 NY2d 581). The New York standard fire insurance policy is codified in Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (e). Any policy that insures against the peril of fire must incorporate \u201cterms and provisions no less favorable to the insured than those contained in the [standard policy]\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 [f] [1] [A]). The standard policy exclusion provision entitled \u201cConditions suspending or restricting insurance,\u201d states that damages will be disclaimed \u201cfor loss occurring * * * while the hazard is increased by any means within the control or knowledge of <em>the </em>insured\u201d (emphasis added). The standard policy is the minimum level of coverage permissible for an insurance company to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In <em>Reed, </em>we upheld the right of an innocent insured property owner to recover on a fire insurance policy that had been damaged by the independent willful misconduct of another insured. \u201c[A]s a matter of fairness and equity * * * the independent wrongdoing of one insured should not bar recovery as to the coinsured under a policy that names and is intended to protect her\u201d <em>{id., </em>at 588).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Through use of the language \u201cthe insured\u201d in the standard policy, the statute delineates independent liabilities and obligations as to each insured to refrain from incendiary acts. Accordingly, to the extent that the <em>\u201cIntentional Acts\u201d </em>exclusion creates joint liability and bars coverage to plaintiff, an innocent insured not implicated in her son\u2019s incendiary act, the exclusion provision is unenforceable under Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 (f) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">As Supreme Court aptly noted in the present case, the \u201can insured\u201d language contained in defendant\u2019s policy \u201coffers an innocent party significantly less coverage than the language \u2018the insured\u2019. Since the latter phrase is that adopted by the Legislature in the Insurance Law, use of the former violates that statute\u2019s requirement that all fire policies offer the level of coverage provided in the standard policy\u201d <em>(Lane v Security Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>175 Misc 2d, at 620).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>As a final matter, we note that our decision is limited to matters involving fire insurance, where Insurance Law \u00a7 3404 is implicated. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v Mugavero </em>(79 NY2d 153), which involved liability insurance not governed by section 3404, is inapplicable. Hence, reliance by defendant and the Appellate Division majority on <em>Mugavero </em>to support the application of joint responsibility was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be reversed, with costs, and judgment granted declaring plaintiff entitled to coverage under the subject insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Levine, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
