At that time, interstate pipeline companies enjoyed market control of prices as they provided the only means for the sale and distribution of gas from the wellhead to local distribution companies (regulated utilities in New York).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) completed the transition when it ordered all interstate pipelines to \u201cunbundle\u201d their transportation services from their gas sales (FERC Order No. 636, 57 Fed Reg 13267). The pipelines became common carriers of natural gas <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Texas E. Transmission Corp. v Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>95 NY2d 323, 325-329). Large industrial buyers could now buy natural gas directly from suppliers, bypassing local utilities. The gas is delivered by pipeline, or more commonly, by a New York gas utility. Pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs, the cost of the transport paid by the user is separate from the purchase price of the gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Allowing industrial end users to bypass local utilities and purchase gas outside the State created a tax problem for New York. The State\u2019s system of natural gas taxation was developed prior to deregulation and focused on utilities and other entities that sold gas within New York. Section 186 of the Tax Law imposes a corporate franchise tax on any corporation, joint stock company or association \u201cformed for or principally engaged in the business of supplying water, steam or gas, when delivered through mains or pipes\u201d (Tax Law \u00a7 186 [1]). The tax (.75%) is assessed against \u201cgross earnings from all sources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>within this state\u201d <em>(id.). </em>In addition, Tax Law \u00a7 186-a imposes a tax (3.5%) on the gross income or gross operating income of gas sellers for gas sales for \u201cultimate consumption or use\u201d in New York (Tax Law \u00a7 186-a [1], [2] [c], [d]). Although utilities are prohibited from identifying taxes assessed pursuant to section 186-a on a customer\u2019s bill <em>(see, </em>Tax Law \u00a7 186-a [6]), both taxes are passed through to gas customers by the utility\u2019s gross receipts tax assessment in its rate charged to customers pursuant to its Public Service Commission tariff <em>(see, Matter of Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v Commissioner of Taxation &amp; Fin., </em>255 AD2d 80, 82; <em>see also, </em>L 1991, ch 166, \u00a7 149). Deregulation allowed end users to avoid the \u201cpass-through\u201d taxes by buying gas from out-of-State producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In an attempt to recapture those taxes and to \u201cequalize\u201d the tax burden on all gas consumers, the Legislature enacted the Natural Gas Import Tax (L 1991, ch 166, \u00a7\u00a7 147-149). The tax (4.25% of the price paid) is imposed \u201con the privilege or act of importing gas services [gas provided through pipes or mains] or causing gas services to be imported into this state for [the importer\u2019s] own use or consumption in this state\u201d (Tax Law \u00a7 189 [2] [a]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time the Legislature enacted section 189, it took note that the taxes imposed by sections 186 and 186-a are passed on to consumers; that the legislation required the Public Service Commission to continue the pass-through; and that section 189 was \u201can attempt to impose on those consumers who purchase gas services outside this state a comparable fair tax burden\u201d (L 1991, ch 166, \u00a7 149).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Tennessee Gas is a natural gas pipeline company that acts primarily as a transporter of natural gas. Its pipeline originates in Texas and Louisiana and runs through New York into New England. Tennessee is regulated by FERC and operates under a FERC tariff. Tennessee has a number of pumping facilities along its pipeline that increase the pressure in the line. Ten of these facilities are located in New York. The compressors are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>powered by natural gas (compressor fuel) that is drawn off the line. Pursuant to Tennessee\u2019s tariff, ownership of the compressor gas passes at the point where the gas enters Tennessee\u2019s pipeline outside New York. Tennessee is therefore a \u201cgas importer\u201d under Tax Law \u00a7 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Although Tennessee filed reports with FERC for the period November 30, 1991 through November 30, 1996, it did not pay any section 189 tax on compressor fuel consumed in New York. The State Tax Department audited Tennessee\u2019s FERC filings and determined that Tennessee owed $1.6 million in section 189 taxes, plus interest and penalties. Following an exchange of letters between Tennessee and the Department, and prior to any proceedings before the Tax Tribunal, Tennessee commenced this declaratory judgment action challenging its status as a gas importer under the statute and the facial constitutionality of section 189. Each side moved for summary judgment. Supreme Court dismissed Tennessee\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust its administrative remedies and characterized Tennessee\u2019s challenge to the statute as based on its specific application to Tennessee\u2019s New York activities. Tennessee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The Appellate Division noted that the purpose of the statute is to equalize the tax burdens of natural gas consumers in New York. It agreed with Supreme Court that Tennessee\u2019s challenge was actually directed at the statute\u2019s application to Tennessee\u2019s activities in New York and that a facial challenge to the statute was not merited. Tennessee again appealed, and we now reverse and declare the statute unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Tennessee argues, and the Attorney General concedes, that the import tax discriminates against interstate commerce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute provides differential treatment of in-State and out-of-State economic interests that benefit the former and burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the latter <em>(see, Oregon Waste Sys. v Department of Envtl. Quality, </em>511 US 93, 99); it imposes a tax on the ouUof-State purchase of gas consumed in New York while not taxing instate purchases of gas used in New York. State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce on their face are \u201cvirtually <em>per se </em>invalid\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Where a tax is facially discriminatory it may survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if the State can show that the tax \u201cadvances a legitimate local purpose that cannot adequately be served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 101; <em>see also, City of New York v State of New York, </em>94 NY2d 577, 596-597). The State contends that the import tax survives Tennessee\u2019s Commerce Clause challenge because the tax complements the taxes imposed under sections 186 and 186-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Certain \u201ccomplementary\u201d or \u201ccompensatory\u201d taxes may satisfy Commerce Clause scrutiny even though they discriminate against interstate commerce <em>(Oregon Waste, supra, </em>at 102). A valid complementary tax must satisfy three criteria. First, it must identify the intrastate tax burden for which it attempts to compensate. Second, the interstate tax must \u201croughly approximate,\u201d but not exceed, the amount of the tax on intrastate commerce. Third, the events on which both taxes are imposed must be \u201c \u2018substantially equivalent;\u2019 that is they must be sufficiently similar in substance to serve as mutually exclusive \u2018proxies]\u2019 for each other\u201d <em>(Oregon Waste, supra, </em>at 103 [quoting <em>Armco Inc. v Hardesty, </em>467 US 638, 643]; <em>see also, Homier Distrib. Co. v City of Albany, </em>90 NY2d 153, 163). As United States Supreme Court Justice Cardozo noted, under a truly compensatory tax scheme \u201cthe stranger from afar is subject to no greater burdens as a consequence of ownership than the dweller within the gates. The one pays upon one activity or incident, and the other upon another, but the sum is the same when the reckoning is closed\u201d <em>(Henneford v Silas Mason Co., </em>300 US 577, 584).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Tennessee concedes that the Legislature\u2019s stated intent in enacting Tax Law \u00a7 189 was to level the tax field for gas consumers in New York regardless of the location of their gas source. However, Tennessee vigorously contests that section 189 is in fact a valid compensatory tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">If the import tax roughly approximates, but does not exceed, the amount of the tax on intrastate commerce, it passes the second prong of the compensatory tax test <em>(see, Oregon Waste, supra, </em>at 103). Here, the tax rates imposed on consumers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>purchase <em>gas </em>in-State are the same as those who purchase gas elsewhere \u2014 the sum of the in-State tax rates equals the import tax rate. Tennessee argues, however, that the taxes are not \u201cimposed\u201d on consumers of natural gas in both instances and, thus, the resulting taxes cannot roughly approximate each other. The import tax is directly assessed on the importer/ consumer, and the in-State tax is imposed on the utility or seller, which then passes those taxes through to the consumer. The State argues that, therefore, economic incidence of the tax is the same. Tennessee cautions that this type of \u201ceconomic incidence analysis\u201d will draw the Court into the thicket of analyzing and comparing different markets to determine if the tax burden imposed on interstate activity roughly approximates, but does not exceed, the intrastate tax burden <em>(see, Fulton Corp. v Faulkner, </em>516 US 325, 336-338).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">There is no doubt that the taxes in question here are imposed, in fact, on the <em>same </em>activity \u2014 the use of natural gas in New York. Significantly, the Legislature noted (and mandated the Public Service Commission to continue) the \u201cpass-through\u201d practice of utilities with regard to sections 186 and 186-a taxes when it enacted the import tax (L 1991, ch 166, \u00a7 149).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The taxes paid by the utilities are based, in part, on revenues derived from gas sales. The tax therefore reflects the \u201ccost\u201d of gas purchased in New York by utility customers. Moreover, because the in-State taxes are imposed on a receipt tax basis (including transportation costs charged to utility customers for delivering the gas in-State along with income from any other source), the taxes imposed under sections 186 and 186-a will never be less than the import tax on comparable volumes of gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The practical effect of the statutes is the same \u2014 consumers carry the tax burden for the use of natural gas in New York. Thus, we need not engage in the difficult quantitative assessment of the extent to which a discriminatory tax supports inState economic activity \u2014 which may be highly speculative \u2014 in order to reach our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Tennessee also notes that not all gas consumers who buy their gas in New York pay the pass-through taxes because some gas suppliers are not regulated by the Public Service Commission and therefore are not required to pass the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>through to their customers. In support of its contention, Tennessee offered two affidavits from suppliers who are not regulated by the Public Service Commission and a list of unregulated marketers that were certified to sell gas in New York as of March 1999. The Attorney General counters that Tennessee has failed to identify that portion of the gas market served by non-regulated sellers. Indeed, the Attorney General points to Public Service Commission documents that show, for the tax period in question, unregulated sellers served only 4,000 small customers <em>(see, </em>New York State Public Service Commission, Department of Public Service, 1995-1996 Annual Report, at 13).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Tennessee\u2019s submissions do not convince us that sales of gas subject to sections 186 and 186-a pass-through taxes as compared to unregulated sales establish the \u201c \u2018substantial distinctions and real injuries\u2019 \u201d necessary in a Commerce Clause challenge <em>(Associated Indus. v Lohman, </em>511 US 641, 654 [quoting <em>Gregg Dyeing Co. v Query, </em>286 US 472, 481]). The Supreme Court has never \u201cdeemed a hypothetical possibility of favoritism to constitute discrimination that transgresses constitutional commands\u201d <em>(Associated Indus., supra, </em>at 654).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The third element of a valid compensatory tax is that the events on which the taxes are imposed must be \u201c \u2018substantially equivalent;\u2019 * * * they must be sufficiently similar in substance to serve as mutually exclusive \u2018proxies]\u2019 for each other\u201d <em>(Oregon Waste, supra, </em>511 US, at 103 [citation omitted]). Tennessee correctly points out that sections 186 and 186-a are franchise taxes. They are imposed on corporations for the privilege of doing business in New York while section 189 is an import tax. Tennessee asserts that the taxing events are so different that they cannot reasonably be seen as taxing similar economic activity. The Attorney General compares the statute to sales and use taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">A State can impose a sales tax for sales within the State and a use tax on goods purchased outside the State and consumed within the State provided the use tax does not exceed the sales tax. Although the taxing events are different (purchase or use), they completely cover one area of economic activity \u2014 the taxation of all tangible property used or consumed in-State regardless of where the property is acquired <em>(see, Associated Indus. v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Lohman, </em>511 US 641, <em>supra; see also, Henneford v Silas Mason Co., </em>300 US 577, <em>supra). </em>However, the Supreme Court has been cautious to note that its \u201cmore recent cases have shown extreme reluctance to recognize new compensatory categories\u201d <em>(Fulton Corp., supra, </em>516 US, at 338).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">A new category is not required here. As noted earlier, the taxable events are, in fact, the sale of gas in New York and the use of imported gas in New York. Although the in-State taxes are calculated, not by the price paid for the product, but by the gross income/receipts of the seller, they are in essence, taxes from the sales of gas because of the nature of the pass-through. The taxes are also mutually exclusive; the consumer either buys the gas in-State or imports it \u2014 the taxes cannot overlap. The State has thus met its burden of establishing that Tax Law \u00a7 189 is a valid compensatory tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Tennessee\u2019s last challenge to the import tax is premised on \u201cfair apportionment.\u201d The central purpose of fair apportionment \u201cis to ensure that each State taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction\u201d <em>(Goldberg v Sweet, </em>488 US 252, 260-261) and to minimize the likelihood that an interstate transaction will be improperly burdened by multiple taxation <em>(see, Oklahoma Tax Commn. v Jefferson Lines, supra, </em>514 US, at 184-185; <em>Matter of Tamagni v Tax Appeals Tribunal, supra, </em>91 NY2d, at 541). To determine the threat of malapportionment, the Supreme Court has employed \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d consistency tests <em>(Oklahoma Tax Commn., supra, </em>at 185).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Tennessee limits its challenge to whether the taxes in question are internally consistent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">\u201cInternal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every other State would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear. This test asks nothing about the degree of economic reality reflected by the tax, but simply looks to the structure of the tax at issue to see whether its identical application by every State in the Union would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate. A failure of internal consistency shows as a matter of law that a State is attempting to take more than its fair share of taxes from the interstate transaction\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Tennessee correctly argues that the taxes in question run afoul of the internal consistency test. If consumers buy gas in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>State with a provision identical to Tax Law \u00a7 186, they would pay a pass-through tax even though they exported the gas to New York and consumed it here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bec\u00e1use the import tax contains no credit for taxes assessed on the purchase of gas out-of-State, a double tax occurs; the statute crosses over from a permissible exercise of the State\u2019s taxing powers to an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The State attempts to save the tax by pointing to the enactment language of section 189 <em>(see, </em>L 1991, ch 166, \u00a7 149). In that provision, the Legislature appears to have anticipated the constitutional flaw we now identify. It notes that \u201cif a court of final, competent jurisdiction should adjudge the privilege taxation imposed by this act to be infirm because of the lack of an appropriate credit for tax imposed by another jurisdiction on the sale of the gas service therein then, in such event, <em>such appropriate credit, </em>to the extent of the tax imposed by this act, shall be <em>deemed to be available </em>in the <em>manner provided by such court of final, </em>competent jurisdiction\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The Attorney General would have us employ the savings language only if Tennessee can establish that it did indeed pay a pass-through tax like that imposed by section 186 in the State where it purchased the compressor gas. But this is a facial challenge: the internal consistency test is measured by hypothetically employing the taxes in question as if they existed in all States; there is no \u201cas applied\u201d escape hatch from the test as the Attorney General seems to argue <em>(see, Goldberg v Sweet, supra, </em>488 US, at 261). The savings provision would appear to remedy the flaw in section 189 by providing a credit for any double taxation. However, we find the savings provision invalid here because it requires the Court to define the parameters of the credit and the manner in which it will be implemented. This violates fundamental separation of powers principles. The savings provision would require us to rewrite the statute and create quasi-judicial tax regulations. We are not well suited as an institution for such a task.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and Tax Law \u00a7\u00a7 189, 189-a and 189-b declared unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">.

Transmission Corp. v Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>95 NY2d 323; <em>City of New York v State of New York, </em>94 NY2d 577; <em>Matter of Tamagni v Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>91 NY2d 530, <em>cert denied </em>525 US 931; <em>Homier Distrib. Co. v City of Albany, </em>90 NY2d 153).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\">. Our courts have also recognized the use of the revenue tax surcharge as an element of Public Service Commission tariffs (see, <em>Matter of Brooklyn Union Gas Co., supra, </em>255 AD2d, at 82).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">. In 1996, there were approximately 4,578,511 gas customers in New York <em>(see, </em>Financial Statistics of the Major Investor-Owned Utilities in NYS [The \u201cFive Year Book\u201d], New York State Dept of Pub Svc, 1999, Tables 9C, 60 [also available on-line at &lt;http://www.dps.state.ny.us/welcome99.htm&gt;]). Thus, unregulated sellers served less than .1% of all gas customers statewide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">. Contrary to Tennessee\u2019s assertion, Tax Law \u00a7 186-a applies only to gross income from sales of gas to be used or consumed in New York. Therefore, that provision does not present any internal inconsistency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
