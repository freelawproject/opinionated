Petitioners lack standing to maintain this proceeding because the only in-fact injury they have alleged \u2014 economic harm \u2014 is not an injury within the zone of interests to be protected by section 35-b, and there are no compelling prudential concerns that would justify giving lawyers standing to represent the rights of potential clients. <em>(Society of Plastics Indus. v County of Suffolk, </em>77 NY2d 761; <em>Lujan v National Wildlife Fedn., </em>497 US 871; <em>Matter of Mobil Oil Corp. v Syracuse Indus.

The Court of Appeals\u2019 approval of updated fee schedules for application in the First Department was a reasonable exercise of the responsibilities charged to the Court by section 35-b of the Judiciary Law. <em>(Matter of City of New York v State of New York Commn. on Cable Tel., </em>47 NY2d 89; <em>Matter of Director of Assigned Counsel Plan v Bodek, </em>87 NY2d 191; <em>Matter ofWerfel v Agresta, </em>36 NY2d 624; <em>Matter of Met Council v Crosson, </em>84 NY2d 328; <em>Corkum v Bartlett, </em>46 NY2d 424; <em>Matter of Kindlon v County of Rensselaer, </em>158 AD2d 178; <em>Matter of Jacob, </em>86 NY2d 651; <em>Kauffman &amp; Sons Saddlery Co. v Miller, </em>298 NY 38; <em>Matter of Mercy Hosp. v New York State Dept. of Social Servs., </em>79 NY2d 197; <em>Matter of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v Public Serv.

The Court of Appeals acted reasonably and within its authorized powers by approving the revised uniform fee schedules. <em>(Matter of Johnson v Ambach, </em>74 AD2d 986; <em>Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222; <em>Matter of Daxor Corp. v State of New York Dept. of Health, </em>90 NY2d 89; <em>Akpan v Koch, </em>75 NY2d 561; <em>Flacke v Onondaga Landfill Sys., </em>69 NY2d 355; <em>Matter of Regional Action Group for the Envt. v Zagata, </em>245 AD2d 798.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b612-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b612-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">On this appeal, we determine the extent of authority that Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b confers on the Court of Appeals in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>nection with the rate of compensation for assigned counsel in capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides for four-member screening panels, one for each Judicial Department, charged with proposing and periodically updating fee schedules for assigned capital counsel, in consultation with the Administrative Board of the Courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fee schedules are subject to approval by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In November 1996, the Court of Appeals, acting in its administrative capacity, approved the Capital Counsel Fee Schedules submitted by each Department\u2019s panel. All four schedules set hourly fees for lead counsel at $175 and for associate counsel at $150. The schedules also set hourly rates for \u201creasonably necessary\u201d additional legal and paralegal assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>In accordance with the legislative mandate that it periodically update the fee schedules, the Court of Appeals, in September 1997, directed the panels to reexamine capital counsel fees in light of experience and empirical data. The Administrative Board of the Courts recommended a bifurcated compensation scheme, reducing the lead counsel hourly rate to $100 for services before the prosecution announces its intent to seek the death penalty and $125 for post-notice representation. The Administrative Board also recommended reducing the associate counsel rate to $75 pre-notice and $100 post-notice. The screening panels for the Second, Third and Fourth Departments adopted the recommendations. The First Department Panel, however, was deadlocked. Two panel members supported the fee reductions and two recommended that the existing rates remain the same. By order dated December 16, 1998, the Court of Appeals, in its administrative capacity, approved the recommended reductions and ordered them applicable to all four Departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In April 1999, petitioners, the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys, on behalf of its members certified to accept capital cases, and four individual attorneys, commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul the December 1998 order, contending that respondents exceeded their administrative capacity when they revised the rates in the First Department, and that the reduced fee schedules did not meet the standards of Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b for adequate compensation. Supreme Court dismissed the petition on the merits, finding that petitioners failed to establish that the order was made in violation of lawful procedure, was affected by an error of law or was unreasonable, irrational or an abuse of discretion. Without reaching the merits, the Appellate Division affirmed, holding that petitioners lacked standing to challenge the administrative order. This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">While the Appellate Division decided only the issue of standing and the parties have argued that issue here, we assume, without deciding, that petitioners have standing and we therefore address the merits of the petition <em>(see, People v Alvaranga, </em>84 NY2d 985, 986; <em>People v Lindsay, </em>72 NY2d 843, 845; <em>Babigian v Wachtler, </em>69 NY2d 1012, 1013; <em>Matter of Roman Catholic Diocese v New York State Dept. of Health, </em>66 NY2d 948, 951).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The issue before us distills to whether the Legislature has delegated the ultimate administrative rule-making authority to the Court of Appeals or to the respective screening panels. Under petitioners\u2019 theory, we need look no further than two phrases in Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b (5) (a): \u201c[e]ach screening panel shall * * * <em>promulgate * </em>* * a schedule of fees\u201d; and \u201cwhich schedule shall be subject to the <em>approval </em>of the court of appeals\u201d (emphasis supplied). Petitioners argue that this language vests the screening panels with responsibility to adopt the fee schedules, leaving the Court of Appeals in a strictly reactive role, limited to ratifying or disapproving the fee schedules adopted by the panels. This limited role, petitioners contend, precludes the Court from any legitimate exercise of a more expansive administrative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We disagree. The term \u201cpromulgate\u201d has a variety of meanings that include: \u201c1. to make known by open declaration: proclaim 2 a: to make known or public the terms of (a proposed law); b: to put (a law) into action or force\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 933 [10th ed 1994]). The appropriate definition depends on the setting, and in this case, the legislative intent. We are left with no doubt that under the statutory scheme, \u201cpromulgate\u201d means to make known or public the terms of a proposed fee schedule for disposition by the Court of Appeals in its ultimate rule-making authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The language of Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b (5) (a) upon which petitioners focus, and other provisions in that subsection, ascribe a role for the screening panels subordinate to that of the Court of Appeals in setting capital defense counsel fee schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Notably, the Legislature directed that \u201c[p]rior to approving fee schedules, the court shall invite the submission of written comments from interested parties\u201d (Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b [5] [a]). The Legislature thus chose to incorporate a public comment period comparable to that required of an administrative agency under the State Administrative Procedure Act (\u00a7 202 [1] [a]) before that agency exercises its rule-making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>authority. Significantly, the Legislature directed that the public comment period take place after the screening panels promulgate the schedules and before the Court of Appeals acts on them. Had the Legislature intended the screening panels to be the predominant or ultimate administrative rule-making bodies, they \u2014 and not the Court of Appeals \u2014 presumably should have had the benefit of outside criticism and suggestions from the public comment period. Critically, the Legislature set the public comment period stage after the screening panels complete their work. This sequence is inconsistent with petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the word \u201cpromulgate\u201d and their view of the primacy of those panels.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Petitioners\u2019 position is also contrary to the overall statutory framework. The capital offense statute assigns to the Court broad administrative responsibilities such as supervising and rule-making regarding collection of proportionality data at the trial level, including developing forms for data reports (see, Judciary Law \u00a7 211-a; CPL 470.30 [3] [b]); adopting forms for jury verdicts at the penalty stage (see, CPL 400.27 [15]); adopting rules for appellate procedures regarding mental retardation determinations (see, CPL 400.27 [12] [f]); and the final disposition of the Capital Defender Office\u2019s proposals for determining minimum standards for appointment as lead and associate counsel in capital cases (see, Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b [4] [b] [iv]). The most important of these administrative functions is the Court\u2019s assigned role with respect to legislative fulfillment of the state\u2019s constitutional responsibility to provide competent counsel to capital defendants and to provide a system of compensation for that representation. In discharging its administrative function, the Court\u2019s authority is not restricted to narrow readings of powers expressly conferred by the statute, but includes implied powers necessary for the proper discharge of those broad responsibilities. \u201cWhere an agency has been endowed with broad power to regulate in the public interest, we have not hesitated to uphold reasonable acts on its part designed to further the regulatory scheme\u201d <em>(Matter of City of New York v State of New York Commn. on Cable Tel., </em>47 NY2d 89, 92). No less may be said of the authority of the Court of Appeals to carry out its administrative duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In interpreting the statute to resolve the basic issue of whether the Court of Appeals\u2019 authority on capital defense fee schedules is primary and independent, or \u2014 as petitioners contend \u2014 secondary and entirely contingent upon screening panel determinations, we cannot overlook the possible conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>quences of petitioners position. Under their reading of Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b (5) (a), the Court of Appeals is powerless to act on fee schedules in the absence of their promulgation by the screening panels. Thus, the legislative objective in providing for the initial setting of capital defense fee schedules and then their updating could be thwarted by a screening panel default, or paralyzed by its inability to achieve a majority determination in case of deadlock. Had this impasse occurred at the initial stage of capital defense fee schedule adoption, the entire process would have come to a halt. The criminal courts within the First Department would have been stymied, unable to comply with their constitutional and statutory mandate to assign paid counsel to indigent capital defendants. The courts have repeatedly rejected statutory constructions that are unconscionable or antithetical to legislative objectives <em>(see, Spiegelberg v Gomez, </em>44 NY2d 920, 921-922; <em>Matter of United Press Assns. v Valente, </em>308 NY 71, 83-84; <em>People v Santoro, </em>229 NY 277, 281-282; <em>see also, </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 143, at 289-290 [legislation \u201cshould receive an interpretation which would not lead to unreasonable consequences\u201d]; \u00a7 144, at 292 [\u201cA construction which would render a statute ineffective must be avoided\u201d]). For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeals is the final arbiter for setting fees pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 35-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Finally, we reject petitioners\u2019 remaining argument that the overall reduction is arbitrary and capricious or jeopardizes the legislative intent to provide adequate court-appointed counsel to capital defendants. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contentions, the fee schedule approved by this Court is adequate. The record establishes that after considering public comments, surveys, responses from the departmental screening panels and other empirical data and documentation, the Court concluded that the 1996 capital counsel fees should be reduced and that the revised fees would still ensure the availability of competent representation for capital defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Among the documents reviewed by the Court was an April 1998 report prepared for the American Bar Association detailing compensation rates for capital representation in each of the 38 states implementing the death penalty (1998 Report for ABA, Rates of Compensation for CourUAppointed Counsel in Capital Cases at Trial: A State-By-State Overview). That report revealed that the reduced hourly rates were still higher than the available fees in at least 36 of the other 37 states. The Court also reviewed a 1998 report prepared by a subcommittee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>of the Judicial Conference of the United States providing an in-depth examination of the rates of compensation for capital counsel in Federal death penalty prosecutions (1998 Report of US Jud Conf on Federal Death Penalty Cases: Recommendation Concerning the Cost \u00e1nd Quality of Defense Representation). In its report, the subcommittee adjudged that the maximum Federal rate of up to $125 per hour was sufficient to attract competent defense counsel. Moreover, the report noted that the rates paid for Federal death penalty representation ranged from a high average of $115.82 in 1991 to a low of $79.92 in 1994, with the most recent reported average of $108.84 in 1997. Thus, even the reduced rates approved by this Court exceeded the average rate of compensation actually paid for Federal capital representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Significantly, the Court took into consideration that additional state funds were available to provide capital defendants with necessary expert and investigative services and that, unlike some jurisdictions, the Court had declined to set a cap on the total fees available in each case. The confluence of the high rate set in 1996 and the Court\u2019s unwillingness to set a limit on total fees resulted in significant amounts being paid to defense counsel in a number of capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">After carefully reviewing these and other materials submitted, the Court concluded not only that the former rates were higher than necessary to assure competent capital representation but also that the revised rates still exceeded the average rate of compensation nationwide and would continue to attract skilled attorneys to represent capital defendants. This reduction was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur in Per Curiam opinion; Chief Judge Kaye and Judge Graffeo taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">.
