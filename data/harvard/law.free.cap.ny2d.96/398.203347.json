We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">On September 17, 1996, Marvin Castro lost five fingertips (two from his right hand, three from his left) in an accident involving a die cutting machine. The injury left the distal, or outermost, joints of the fingers intact. Castro sued the manufacturer of the machine, United Container Machinery Group. United in turn brought a third-party action against plaintiffs employer, Southern Container Corp., seeking common-law contribution and indemnification. Southern moved to dismiss the third-party complaint against it, on the ground that Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 barred recovery. Supreme Court denied the motion, finding questions of fact \u201cregarding the extent and nature of plaintiffs \u2018grave injury.\u2019 \u201d The Appellate Division reversed, holding that Southern was entitled to summary judgment because plaintiffs injury did not constitute \u201closs of multiple fingers\u201d and was, therefore, not a grave injury under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 (273 AD2d 337). We now affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">United and plaintiff both contend that plaintiffs injury was grave for purposes of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 and that the third-party action against Southern should not have been dismissed. Their position is based on a misguided reading of the requirements of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11. First, they argue that plaintiffs loss of multiple fingertips meets the \u201closs of multiple fingers\u201d requirement in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law notwithstanding the statute\u2019s silence on the issue of partial losses. Next, United argues that the question of whether a partial loss of multiple fingertips is grave is a question of fact to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Finally, United posits that Southern failed to meet its burden of proof for summary judgment because all Southern showed was the undisputed fact that plaintiff lost five fingertips. These arguments fail because, based on the plain language and legislative history of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11, plaintiffs injury cannot be classified as grave.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Among the major changes to the workers\u2019 compensation system effected by the Omnibus Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Reform Act of 1996, was the abrogation of employers\u2019 liability to third parties for injuries to their employees (see, L 1996, ch 635). In amending Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 to provide that an \u201cemployer shall not be liable for contribution or indemnity to any third person based upon liability for injuries sustained by an employee\u201d unless the employee\u2019s injuries are shown to be grave, the Legislature sought to limit employer\u2019s liability that existed under <em>Dole v Dow Chem. Co. </em>(30 NY2d 143). The central component of the reform initiative was relief in the form of immunization from tort liability to employers, such as Southern, who provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Injuries qualifying as grave are narrowly defined in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11. Thus, the only determination to be made is whether the injury falls within the statute\u2019s objective requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The term \u201closs of multiple fingers\u201d cannot sensibly be read to mean partial loss of multiple fingers. Words in a statute are to be given their plain meaning without resort to forced or unnatural interpretations <em>(see, </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 232; <em>Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577, 583). As a matter of standard English usage, the word \u201cfinger\u201d means the whole finger, not just its tip.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">There is, similarly, no merit in United\u2019s further contention that the word \u201ctotal\u201d appearing elsewhere in the litany of injuries leads to the conclusion that its absence in the phrase under consideration was intended to mean something less than a total loss of multiple fingers. In the list of injuries contained at Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11, \u201ctotal\u201d is used in conjunction with the term \u201closs of use\u201d and not in conjunction with \u201closs of multiple fingers\u201d or any other enumerated body part. While the phrase loss of use might require some indication as to the degree of use lost, the term \u201closs of multiple fingers\u201d does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The legislative history is fully consistent with this reading of the statute. That the purpose of the amendment was to reduce the number of suits against employers is beyond cavil: \u201cIn making this change, the bill restores the basis of the bargain between business and labor \u2014 that workers obtain necessary medical care benefits and compensation for workplace injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>regardless of fault while employers obtain a degree of economic protection from devastating lawsuits\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1996, ch 635, 1996 NY Legis Ann, at 460). It is likewise apparent that the means by which the reduction in lawsuits was to be accomplished was by barring suits except in extremely limited, defined circumstances. \u201cThe grave injuries listed are deliberately both <em>narrowly and completely described. </em>The list is exhaustive, not illustrative; it is not intended to be extended absent further legislative action\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem, supra; emphasis added). While it is doubtful that any list that purported to be the complete catalog of \u201cgrave\u201d injuries would \u2014 or ever could \u2014 meet with universal approval, that is not the question before us and we may not lightly alter this legitimate exercise of legislative prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">. Although denominated as a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211, both Supreme Court and the Appellate Division treated the motion as one for summary judgment pursuant to CPLR 3212, as do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\">. To the extent that the parties analogize to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 for the definition of \u201cfinger,\u201d the vastly different legislative purposes of sections 11 and 15 compel us to reject the analogy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
