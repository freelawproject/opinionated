Defendant did not contact plaintiffs to keep them informed and, in fact, avoided plaintiffs\u2019 inquiries regarding the status of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">In response to a formal disciplinary grievance plaintiffs filed against him in September of 1997, defendant admitted that he had failed to commence the action against Fleischer before the Statute of Limitations had expired in March of 1994 and stated that, after two years, when his clients finally contacted him, he was \u201ctoo embarrassed to discuss the matter and put it off.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thereafter, on December 5, 1997, plaintiffs commenced this legal malpractice action against defendant, sounding in both contract and tort. Defendant moved for summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>dismissing the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 action was barred by the three-year Statute of Limitations, since the malpractice occurred in March 1994 when defendant failed to commence the action against Fleischer. Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that the continuous representation doctrine tolled the limitations period at least until defendant finally revealed, in 1997, that he had failed to timely commence plaintiffs\u2019 action against the home inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Appellate Division reversed, granted defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint. The court held that, on these facts, the doctrine of continuous representation was not applicable to toll the limitations period. Because plaintiffs\u2019 contract action was never commenced and defendant \u201c \u2018did nothing to foster the impression or to lull [the] plaintiff into believing that the action [against Fleischer] was proceeding,\u2019 \u201d the Appellate Division held that defendant was not representing plaintiffs in their contract action against Fleischer (270 AD2d 245, 246 [quoting <em>Muller v Sturman, </em>79 AD2d 482, 486] [brackets in original]). We granted leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">An action to recover damages for legal malpractice accrues when the malpractice is committed <em>(see, Glamm v Allen, </em>57 NY2d 87, 93). \u201cWhat is important is when the malpractice was committed, not when the client discovered it\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 95). Here, plaintiffs\u2019 legal malpractice cause of action against defendant accrued in March of 1994, when the Statute of Limitations had expired on the underlying breach of contract action plaintiffs retained defendant to commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Effective September 4, 1996, CPLR 214 (6) was amended, shortening the limitations period in nonmedical malpractice claims from six to three years to the extent that the claims sought breach-of-contract damages, and directing that a uniform limitations period applied \u201cregardless of whether the underlying theory is based in contract or tort\u201d (CPLR 214 [6], as amended by L 1996, ch 623). At the time plaintiffs\u2019 legal malpractice action against defendant accrued, however, legal malpractice actions, when based upon a contract theory, were governed by the six-year limitations period applicable to contract actions <em>(see, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v Enco Assocs., </em>43 NY2d 389, 395-396; <em>Santulli v Englert, Reilly &amp; McHugh, </em>78 NY2d 700, 707-708).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In <em>Brothers v Florence </em>and its companion cases (95 NY2d 290), this Court upheld the application of the 1996 amendment to CPLR 214 (6) to previously accrued claims by affording <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>litigants a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d after the amendment\u2019s effective date to commence an otherwise time-barred action. The Court determined that, for those cases not immediately time-barred as of the 1996 amendment\u2019s effective date, litigants would have \u201cno less than one year from the amendment\u2019s effective date to bring suit\u201d <em>(Brothers [Early v Rossback], supra, </em>95 NY2d, at 306). Further, where nonmedical malpractice plaintiffs would have more than one year left to commence an action under the newly amended Statute of Limitations, those plaintiffs were entitled to the full time remaining under the three-year limitations period <em>(see, id., </em>at 306 n).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Like the action at issue in <em>Early v Rossback, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 action here was not immediately time-barred upon the 1996 amendment\u2019s effective date. Instead, there were still six months remaining in which to bring suit against defendant for his failure to commence plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim against Fleischer. Thus, under the bright-line rule articulated by this Court in <em>Brothers v Florence </em>and its companion cases, the limitations period did not expire until September 4, 1997, one year from the effective date of the 1996 amendment. Because plaintiffs did not commence this action until December 5, 1997, just over three months later, plaintiffs\u2019 action is time-barred unless the continuous representation doctrine is available and applies to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The continuous representation doctrine, like the continuous treatment rule, its counterpart with respect to medical malpractice claims, \u201crecognizes that a person seeking professional assistance has a right to repose confidence in the professional\u2019s ability and good faith, and realistically cannot be expected to question and assess the techniques employed or the manner in which the services are rendered\u201d <em>(Greene v Greene, </em>56 NY2d 86, 94). The doctrine also appreciates the client\u2019s dilemma if required to sue the attorney while the latter\u2019s representation on the matter at issue is ongoing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cNeither is a person expected to jeopardize his pending case or his relationship with the attorney handling that case during the period that the attorney continues to represent the person. Since it is impossible to envision a situation where commencing a malpractice suit would not affect the professional relationship, the rule of continuous representation tolls the running of the Statute of Limitations on the malpractice claim until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ongoing representation is completed\u201d <em>(Glamm v Allen, supra, </em>57 NY2d, at 94).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Application of the continuous representation or treatment doctrine is nonetheless generally limited to the course of representation concerning a specific legal matter or of treatment of a specific ailment or complaint; \u201c[t]he concern, of course, is whether there has been continuous treatment, and not merely a continuing relation between physician and patient\u201d <em>(McDermott v Torre, </em>56 NY2d 399, 405). Thus, the doctrine is not applicable to a client\u2019s or patient\u2019s continuing general relationship with a lawyer or physician involving only routine contact for miscellaneous legal representation or medical care, unrelated to the matter upon which the allegations of malpractice are predicated <em>(see, Young v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>91 NY2d 291, 296; <em>Nykorchuck v Henriques, </em>78 NY2d 255; <em>Glamm v Allen, supra, 57 </em>NY2d, at 94). Instead, in the context of a legal malpractice action, the continuous representation doctrine tolls the Statute of Limitations only where the continuing representation pertains specifically to the matter in which the attorney committed the alleged malpractice <em>(see, Glamm, supra, </em>at 94; <em>see also, Weiss v Manfredi, </em>83 NY2d 974, 977).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">While it is true that this Court and others have held that a professional\u2019s failure to take action or provide services necessary to protect a client\u2019s or patient\u2019s interests does not, standing alone, constitute representation or treatment for purposes of tolling the Statute of Limitations <em>(see, e.g., Young v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., supra, </em>91 NY2d, at 296-297; <em>Ashmead v Groper, </em>251 AD2d 716), we reject defendant\u2019s contention, and the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion, that the instant matter falls within that category of cases. The court below relied on <em>Ashmead v Groper (supra), </em>a case in which the plaintiff retained the defendant attorney in 1981 to represent him in his pursuit of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Shortly after the attorney had been retained, the plaintiff received an award based upon an established average weekly wage and, in May of 1984, the case was closed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board. In 1995 the plaintiff commenced a legal malpractice action alleging negligence in establishing plaintiff\u2019s average weekly wage. The timeliness of that action turned on whether the continuous representation doctrine tolled the applicable limitations period from May of 1984 until September 1992, when plaintiff had obtained another lawyer. In concluding that the doctrine did not apply to toll the limitations pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>riod, the Appellate Division noted that because \u201cplaintiff was unaware of the need for any further legal services in connection with his workers\u2019 compensation claim, he was not faced with the dilemma that gave rise to the continuous treatment/ representation doctrine\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 717 [citing <em>Young v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>91 NY2d 291, <em>supra]).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Similarly, <em>Young v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp. (supra) </em>involved a malpractice suit alleging failure to timely diagnose and treat plaintiff\u2019s breast cancer. There, a mammogram report had recommended a biopsy to rule out any malignancy but that recommendation was never communicated to plaintiff, even upon her return visits for treatment of an unrelated condition. Looking to the underlying purpose behind the continuous treatment doctrine \u2014 to avoid undermining the continuing trust developing between a professional and his or her client or patient \u2014 this Court determined that the doctrine was not applicable in the absence of contemplated subsequent treatment because \u201ca patient who is not aware of the need for further treatment of a condition is not faced with the dilemma that the doctrine is designed to prevent\u201d <em>(Young, supra, </em>91 NY2d, at 296 [citing <em>Allende v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>90 NY2d 333, 337-338; <em>Rizk v Cohen, </em>73 NY2d 98, 104]). Even in <em>Young, </em>however, this Court did recognize that treatment does not \u201cnecessarily terminate upon a patient\u2019s last visit if further care or monitoring of the condition is \u2018explicitly anticipated by both physician and patient\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 296 [quoting <em>Richardson v Orentreich, </em>64 NY2d 896, 898]).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">This case is distinguishable from both <em>Ashmead </em>and <em>Young. </em>In those cases, the plaintiffs were unaware of any need for further legal services or medical treatment, and there was no mutual understanding with the professional that further services were needed in connection with the specific subject matter out of which the malpractice arose. By contrast, plaintiffs here were acutely aware of such need for further representation on the specific subject matter underlying the malpractice claim and there was a mutual understanding to that effect. Moreover, the record indisputably established that plaintiffs were left with the reasonable impression that defendant was, in fact, actively addressing their legal needs. Thus, this case is most analogous to, and controlled by, this Court\u2019s decisions in both <em>Richardson v Orentreich (supra) </em>and the earlier decided <em>McDermott v Torre </em>(56 NY2d 399, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In <em>McDermott v Torre (supra), </em>this Court held that the continuous treatment doctrine would apply to toll the limita-</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tions period where, after the alleged malpractice had occurred, the plaintiff had returned to the defendant doctor seeking not only medical attention for unrelated ailments, but also to complain about continued pain related to the very condition giving rise to the malpractice claim. The Court noted that even a complete discharge of a patient by a physician did not necessarily preclude a finding of continuing treatment because \u201c[i]ncluded within the scope of \u2018continuous treatment\u2019 is a timely r turn visit instigated by the patient to complain about and seek treatment for a matter related to the initial treatment\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 406). In <em>Richardson (supra), </em>this Court adhered to that rule, concluding that \u201cwhere the physician and patient reasonably intend the patient\u2019s uninterrupted reliance upon the physician\u2019s observation, directions, concern, and responsibility for overseeing the patient\u2019s progress, the requirement for continuous care and treatment for the purpose of the Statute of Limitations is certainly satisfied\u201d <em>(supra, </em>64 NY2d, at 899).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">By a parity of reasoning, \u201ccontinuous representation\u201d in the context of a legal malpractice action does not automatically come to an end where, as here, pursuant to a retainer agreement, an attorney and client both explicitly anticipate continued representation. Plaintiffs retained defendant for the sole purpose of pursuing their specific contract claim. Thus, upon signing the retainer agreement, plaintiffs and the defendant reasonably intended that their professional relationship of trust and confidence \u2014 focused entirely upon the very matter in which the alleged malpractice was committed \u2014 would continue. Indeed, even in his letter to the Grievance Committee, defendant acknowledged that his services had been retained specifically to \u201cinvestigate, research and <em>prosecute </em>their claim against Fleischer\u201d \u2014 the equivalent of a \u201ccourse of treatment\u201d in the legal malpractice context. Moreover, like the \u201ctimely return visit instigated by the patient\u201d in <em>McDermott, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to contact defendant on at least one occasion, in October of 1996, inquiring about the status of their case and requesting a letter in response, confirms this understanding and supports application of the doctrine here. Accordingly, this case appears to fall well within that realm of <em>continuous </em>professional services already recognized by this Court in the medical malpractice context.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Of course, even when further representation concerning the specific matter in which the attorney allegedly committed the complained of malpractice is needed and contemplated by the client, the continuous representation toll would nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>end once the client is informed or otherwise put on notice of the attorney\u2019s withdrawal from representation. Here, at the earliest, plaintiffs may have received reasonable notice of defendant\u2019s withdrawal from representation upon defendant\u2019s interminable failure to respond to their telephone inquiries of October 18, 1996. We thus conclude that, on these facts, defendant was continuously representing plaintiffs at least until, after his extended failure to return their telephone inquiries of October 1996, they may have been put on sufficient notice that the representation had ceased. Even calculating the limitations period from that time, this action, brought just under 14 months from that date, was still timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-14\"> In September 1998, the Grievance Committee for the Tenth Judicial District concluded that defendant\u2019s actions constituted a breach of the Code of Professional Responsibility and issued a Letter of Admonition to the attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
