Here, a search warrant authorized police to search for four particularized items and \u201cany other property the possession of which would be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>contraband.\u201d While executing the warrant, police discovered several weapons in plain view, none of them enumerated in the warrant. The issue before us is whether overbroad language can be severed from an otherwise valid warrant and the plain view seizure upheld. On the facts presented here, we hold that it can.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Defendant allegedly stole a tractor and asked his acquaintance, John DiDominico, to help him sell it. DiDominico owned a similar tractor and defendant wanted to switch Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plates with DiDominico and transport the tractor out of the vicinity undetected. In return, defendant offered to cut DiDominico in on the sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">DiDominico informed the police of defendant\u2019s plan. He told them how defendant stole the tractor from a nearby landowner, stashed it temporarily on State land and then moved it to a creek bed on DiDominico\u2019s property. He also told them that defendant was preparing to transport the tractor to nearby Warsaw, New York. According to DiDominico, defendant had already removed the VIN plate from the stolen tractor, as well as a steel tow chain and a \u201ctop link bar,\u201d part of a coupling device attached to the rear of the tractor. With DiDominico\u2019s consent, police inspected the tractor. By tracing a hidden VIN number stamped inside the tractor, they located the owner, who confirmed that it was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Police obtained a warrant authorizing them to search defendant\u2019s property for the stolen tractor\u2019s ignition key, the missing VIN plate, the steel chain, the top link bar and <em>\u201cany other property the possession of which would be considered </em>contraband.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In a supporting deposition attached to the warrant, DiDominico stated that defendant kept a variety of firearms on his property and had mentioned to him that two of his handguns were unregistered.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">While executing the warrant, the police discovered various guns, including a .357 magnum revolver and a .22 caliber semiautomatic pistol. The revolver was wrapped in plastic inside a floor vent in the rear bedroom of defendant\u2019s trailer. The semiautomatic was wrapped in cloth, hidden in a jar underneath his bathroom sink. Both guns were loaded. By file-checking the guns over the phone, the police learned that they were unregistered and seized them. The officers also seized six blasting caps they found in a floor vent in defendant\u2019s living room. They were not able to locate any of the items listed in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>After indictment, defendant moved to suppress the guns and blasting caps, arguing that the warrant was unconstitutionally overbroad in that it authorized a general search for \u201cany other property the possession of which would be considered contraband.\u201d He also argued that the plain view doctrine did not authorize the seizure of the guns and blasting caps. Supreme Court held a suppression hearing in connection with the execution of the search warrant. The officers testified that at all times during the search they were looking for only the four enumerated items.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The court denied defendant\u2019s motion, holding that the over-broad language could be severed from the warrant and that the police lawfully seized the weapons in plain view while executing the valid (particularized) portion of the warrant. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed. We likewise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">I. Particularity and Overbreadth</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution provides that no warrants shall issue except those \u201cparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the * * * things to be seized\u201d (US Const 4th Amend). To meet the particularity requirement, the warrant\u2019s directive must be \u201cspecific enough to leave no discretion to the executing officer\u201d <em>(People v Darling, </em>95 NY2d 530, 537 [citing <em>Andresen v Maryland, </em>427 US 463, 480; <em>Marron v United States, </em>275 US 192, 196]). The requirement was designed to prohibit law enforcement agents from undertaking a general exploratory search of a person\u2019s belongings <em>(see, Coolidge v New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443, 467). Indeed, indiscriminate searches pursuant to general warrants \u201cwere the immediate evils that motivated the framing and adoption of the Fourth Amendment\u201d <em>(Payton v New York, </em>445 US 573, 583).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Contrary to the People\u2019s contention, we hold that the warrant\u2019s final directive, authorizing the search for \u201cany other-property the possession of which would be considered contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>band\u201d was overbroad. It granted the executing officers unfettered discretion to look anywhere and seize anything they thought \u201cwould be considered contraband.\u201d Had this been the only directive, the warrant would fail for lack of particularity and any evidence seized under it would be suppressed <em>(e.g., People v Nieves, </em>36 NY2d 396, 405).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">II. Severability</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We must next determine whether the overbroad directive invalidates the entire warrant. The warrant described four items \u2014 the stolen tractor\u2019s ignition key, the missing VIN plate, the steel chain and the top link bar \u2014 with particularity sufficient to satisfy the Fourth Amendment. Defendant argues that notwithstanding these particularized directives the additional authorization to search for \u201cany other * * * contraband\u201d poisoned the warrant as a whole, allowing a general search. The People ask us to sever the unparticularized directive and sustain the warrant insofar as it authorized the seizure of the particularized items.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">It is now settled law that when a search warrant is partially but not wholly invalid, only the fruits of the invalid portion need be suppressed. We first recognized this in <em>People v Hansen </em>(38 NY2d 17 [1975]). There, the warrant authorized police to search a residence and a van for drug contraband. The Court determined that the police had probable cause to search the residence but not the van <em>(see, People v Hansen, supra, </em>at 19-20). We severed the invalid portion (suppressing the evidence seized from the van) and upheld the valid portion (admitting the evidence seized from the residence) <em>(see, People v Hansen, supra, </em>at 21-22). As one commentator notes, it would be \u201charsh medicine indeed\u201d if a partially valid warrant were to be invalidated in toto merely because it erroneously permitted a search for additional items (2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 4.6 [f], at 581-582 [3d ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Attempting to distinguish <em>Hansen, </em>defendant contends that the severance doctrine cannot be applied to any warrant that contains a provision authorizing a general search. To deter general searches, defendant argues, <em>all </em>evidence seized during execution of an overbroad warrant should be sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>pressed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree and hold that the severance doctrine is equally applicable in the context of the partially overbroad warrant here. Indeed, other New York courts, relying on <em>Hansen, </em>have severed unconstitutionally overbroad directives like the one before us, upholding seizures under the remaining particularized portions <em>(see, e.g., People v Conte, </em>159 AD2d 993, 994 [sustaining seizure of evidence particularized in warrant even though portion of warrant impermissibly authorized police to seize \u201cother contraband\u201d]; <em>People v Niemczycki, </em>67 AD2d 442, 444 [sustaining seizure of particularized item even though warrant also authorized seizure of \u201cany other contraband\u201d]; <em>People v Haas, </em>55 AD2d 683 [severing portion of warrant authorizing a search for \u201cstolen goods\u201d and admitting evidence particularly described in valid remainder]). By admitting evidence seized pursuant to the particularized portion, these courts strike what we regard as the proper balance between deterring overbroad searches and the need to introduce validly seized evidence in prosecuting criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We have a further complication not present in <em>Hansen. </em>Unlike the case before us, <em>Hansen </em>involved the seizure of evidence specifically authorized in the valid (unsevered) portion of the warrant. Thus, there was no doubt that the evidence seized was not the fruit of the warrant\u2019s invalid directive. Here, however, the items seized were not enumerated in the warrant. Defendant argues that it is entirely possible that the guns and blasting caps <em>were </em>the fruits of the overbroad directive to seize \u201cany other * * * contraband.\u201d This possibility, defendant contends, renders them inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Defendant relies on <em>People v Giordano </em>(72 AD2d 550). There, an otherwise particularized warrant also authorized a search for \u201cany other contraband.\u201d While executing the warrant the police seized unenumerated weapons in plain view. The court refused to sever the overbroad directive and suppressed the weapons, stating that it was \u201cimpossible to tell\u201d whether the police were executing the valid or invalid portion of the warrant when they seized the unenumerated items in plain view <em>(People v Giordano, supra, </em>at 551).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Under <em>Giordano, </em>the plain view doctrine is inapplicable as a matter of law whenever a warrant contains an invalid directive and the evidence seized in plain view fits within that directive. This rule is not called for by the Constitution or our decisional law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The better approach is to sever the invalid directive and apply the plain view doctrine to the valid remainder. Thus, if at the time of seizure, the executing officers were not intruding upon the individual\u2019s expectation of privacy more than was necessary to execute the valid portion of the warrant, the Fourth Amendment does not require suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">This approach has been embraced by numerous other courts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and accommodates the needs of law enforcement as well as the privacy interests that underlie the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, it is faithful to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s insistence that a neutral and detached magistrate decide when someone\u2019s privacy may be invaded. Here, the evidence was discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>only after the judge properly authorized the officers to enter defendant\u2019s residence to search for particularized items based on a showing of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">There are, however, limits to this approach. Severance is feasible here because the warrant was largely specific and based on probable cause. Only the tail end contained the regrettable phrase, \u201cany other * * * contraband.\u201d We emphasize that this phrase should not be used in search warrants because, when alone, it epitomizes the general warrant, a command so antithetical to our forebearers\u2019 sensibilities that they drafted the Fourth Amendment to abolish it. Unfortunate phrases like \u201cany contraband\u201d or \u201cany other contraband\u201d have nevertheless appeared often enough in search warrants as to have created a sizeable body of law <em>(see generally, </em>Martin J. McMahon, Annotation, <em>Propriety in Federal Prosecution of Severance of Partially Valid Search Warrant and Limitation of Suppression to Items Seized Under Invalid Portions of Warrant, </em>69 ALR Fed 522, \u00a7 3, at 527-532). The inclusion of this type of phrase jeopardizes search warrants that are otherwise perfectly valid and fully serviceable. Whether this is the result of bad habits or the use of old forms, the phrase is obnoxious to the principles of the Fourth Amendment and has no valid place in search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">We therefore conclude that the overbroad authorization to search for \u201cany other * * * contraband\u201d may be severed from the warrant. Inasmuch as the items seized were not named in the warrant, we must determine whether they are admissible under the plain view doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">III. Plain View Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d (US Const 4th Amend). The seizure of an individual\u2019s property without obtaining a warrant is per se unreasonable, subject to several narrow, well-defined exceptions <em>(see, People v Diaz, </em>81 NY2d 106, 110; <em>see also, Thompson v Louisiana, </em>469 US 17, 19-20). One such exception is the plain view doctrine, a judicially formulated concept first enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Coolidge v New Hamphsire </em>(403 US 443, <em>supra; see generally, Twenty-Ninth Review of Criminal Procedure, Warrantless Searches and Seizures, </em>88 Geo L J 912, 934 n 174). The doctrine rests on the premise that police should be able to seize incriminating evidence in plain view if they had the right to be where they were when they saw it. Critically, such a seizure involves no invasion beyond what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>warrant (or some other exception to the warrant requirement) allows <em>(see, People v Diaz, supra, </em>at 111; <em>see also, Blasich, </em>73 NY2d 673, 677).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">As we stated in <em>People v Diaz (supra, </em>at 110), law enforcement officers may properly seize an item in \u201cplain view\u201d without a warrant if (i) they are lawfully in a position to observe the item; (ii) they have lawful access to the item itself when they seize it; and (iii) the incriminating character of the item is immediately apparent <em>(see also, Horton v California, </em>496 US 128, 136-137). Defendant argues that the first requirement of the plain view doctrine has not been satisfied. He asserts that because they were executing an unconstitutional general warrant the police were not lawfully on his property when they encountered the guns and blasting caps. We disagree. Although the warrant was partially invalid, that defect \u2014 as we have concluded \u2014 did not strip the police of the authority to enter upon defendant\u2019s premises to search for the particularized items.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Once the overbroad portion is severed from the warrant, we adjudge the propriety of the search and seizure based on a straightforward application of the plain view doctrine. The constitutionality of a plain view seizure \u201cmust turn on the legality of the intrusion that enables [police] to perceive and physically seize the property in question\u201d <em>(Texas v Brown, </em>460 US 730, 737). The valid portion of the warrant determines the permissible scope and intensity of the search <em>(see, United States v George, supra, </em>975 F2d 72, 80 [\u201cIn determining whether the (plain view) doctrine applies in the case of a redacted warrant the trial court must therefore ask if, when the officers came upon the item found in plain view, they were in a place where the <em>redacted </em>warrant * * * authorized them to be.\u201d]).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Focusing on when and where the plain view item was seized, the suppression court is able to determine whether the seizure occurred within the scope of the valid portion of the warrant. To prevail, the People must establish that the executing officers (i) found the item in a place where one reasonably would have expected to look while searching for an object particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>described and (ii) found it before they found all the objects described in the valid portion of the warrant <em>(see, United States v Fitzgerald, supra, </em>724 F2d 633, 637; <em>United States v George, </em>supra, 975 F2d, at 80; <em>see generally, </em>2 LaFave, Search and Seizure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.6 [f], at 582-583).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is largely a factual determination involving the size and character of the enumerated object and where one would reasonably look for it. The police, to put it graphically, may not open dresser drawers searching for a stolen piano. If the People fail to meet these conditions, the police were necessarily searching beyond the scope and intensity of the valid portion of the warrant and the evidence must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Here, the warrant \u2014 to the extent it authorized a search for and seizure of the tractor ignition key and the VIN plate\u2014 provided the executing officers lawful access to defendant\u2019s home and anything in it that might contain either item. Accordingly, we have no basis to disturb Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the police discovered the guns and blasting caps in plain view within the scope of the valid portion of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\">. <em>See also, </em>Wroth &amp; Zobel, Editorial Note, 2 Legal Papers of John Adams 106, 116 (1965) (commenting on colonists\u2019 \u201cwidespread resistance to general warrants which led ultimately to the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures in the Fourth Amendment\u201d); <em>see generally, </em>Patrick T.

There is limited case support for this argument (see, <em>e.g., People v Bradford, </em>81 Misc 2d 320, 323 [finding warrant \u201chopelessly tainted\u201d by a directive to seize \u201cany evidence tending to prove other robberies\u201d]; <em>United States v Burch, </em>432 F Supp 961, 964 [refusing to sever directive to seize \u201cother unknown articles which are believed and reported to be stolen\u201d]; <em>accord, In re LaFayette Academy, </em>462 F Supp 767, 774; <em>Kinsey v State, </em>602 P2d 240, 243 [Okla Crim App 1979]). These cases rest on the premise that the Fourth Amendment was designed specifically to prohibit general searches and that the inclusion of several particularized directives does not change the character of the warrant as one authorizing a general search. The overwhelming majority of courts, however, reject this analysis and sever the overbroad directive <em>(see, United States v Brown, </em>984 F2d 1074, 1077 [10th Cir] [citing at least eight circuits holding that \u201cwhere a warrant contains both specific as well as unconstitutionally broad language, the broad portion may be redacted and the balance of the warrant considered valid\u201d]; <em>United States v Riggs, </em>690 F2d 298, 300 [1st Cir] [noting that weight of authority favors severance in context of partially overbroad warrants]; <em>State v Tucker, </em>133 NH 204, 208-209, 575 A2d 810, 813-814 [1990]; <em>State v Kealoha, </em>62 Haw 166, 177-178, 613 P2d 645, 652-653 [1980]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">.
