The legislative intent of Agriculture and Markets Law article 25-AA, as well as the 1997 revisions to Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 301 (11) do not support the lower court\u2019s conclusions. II. The lower court exceeded its authority when engaging in statutory construction of Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 301 (11). <em>(Schrader v Carney, </em>180 AD2d 200; <em>Sega v State of New York, </em>60 NY2d 183, <em>rearg denied sub nom.

Appellants\u2019 acknowledged violation of the Lysander Zoning Law requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>that the injunction be affirmed, whether or not Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a) applies. <em>(Matter of Town of Butternuts v Davidsen, </em>259 AD2d 886.) II. The courts below were correct in concluding that the term \u201cfarm operations\u201d in Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 301 (11) no longer includes farm residential buildings. <em>(Riley v County of Broome, </em>95 NY2d 455; <em>New York State Bankers Assn. v Albright, </em>38 NY2d 430; <em>Matter of Stein, </em>131 AD2d 68; <em>Town of Beekman v Sherman, </em>213 AD2d 627; <em>Matter of Dworman v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>94 NY2d 359; <em>Matter of Killian [General Motors Corp., Delco Chassis Div. </em>\u2014 Sweeney], 89 NY2d 748; <em>Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451.) III. Alternatively, even if Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a) applies, appellants have not shown that the Lysander Zoning Law unreasonably restricts or unreasonably regulates farm operations. <em>(Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557.) IV. Alternatively, even if Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a) applies, the minimum floor area requirement is a valid exercise of the Town\u2019s zoning authority which is not precluded by Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a). <em>(Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 US 365; <em>Matter of Diocese of Rochester v Planning Bd., </em>1 NY2d 508; <em>Town of Pompey v Parker, </em>53 AD2d 125; <em>Matter of Village Bd. of Trustees v Zoning Bd. of Appeals, </em>164 AD2d 24; <em>Matter of Stevens v Smolka, </em>11 AD2d 896; <em>Osetek v Barone, </em>60 Misc 2d 980; <em>Corning v Town of Ontario, </em>204 Misc 38; <em>Matter of Town of Bedford v Village of Mount Kisco, </em>33 NY2d 178; <em>Shepard v Village of Skaneateles, </em>300 NY 115.) V. Alternatively, there are potential public health, safety and other factors precluding a grant of summary judgment to appellants. VI.

The protections afforded by Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a to farm workers housing were not removed nor diminished by the 1997 amendment of the definition of \u201cfarm operation\u201d in Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 301 (11). <em>(Matter of Albano v Kirby, </em>36 NY2d 526; <em>Matter of Erie County Agric.

Evidence in the record of the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the Town\u2019s prohibition of the use of mobile homes for farm labor housing unreasonably restricted the Hafners\u2019 farm operation, with no evidence to the contrary, precluded the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Town pursuant to CPLR 3212 (b). <em>(Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b659-5\"><em>Elizabeth Corron Dribusch, </em>Glenmont, for New York Farm Bureau, Inc., <em>amicus curiae.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVkV\">The term \u201cfarm operation\u201d as defined in section 301 (11) of the Agricultural Districts Law should be construed to include mobile homes for farm labor housing because the plain language of the statute and the legislative intent underlying the enactment of the Agricultural Districts Law clearly support such an interpretation. <em>(Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669; <em>Matter of Washington Post Co. v New York State Ins.

This case arises from defendants\u2019 attempt in 1999 to install several single-wide mobile homes for housing migrant workers on the farm. The mobile homes do not comply with a Town zoning ordinance that \u201call one-story single family dwellings\u201d have a minimum living area of 1,100 square feet (Town Zoning Code \u00a7 139-56 [A]).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">The central issue before us is whether the zoning ordinance, as applied to defendants\u2019 installation of mobile homes to house migrant farm workers, is superseded by Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">\u201c1. Policy of local governments, a. Local governments, when exercising their powers to enact and administer comprehensive plans and local laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, shall exercise these powers in such manner as may realize the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>and goals set forth in this article, and <em>shall not unreasonably restrict or regulate farm operations within agricultural districts </em>in contravention of the purposes of this article unless it can be shown that the public health or safety is threatened\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The statute defines \u201c[f]arm operation [s]\u201d as \u201cthe land and on-farm buildings, equipment and practices which contribute to the production, preparation and marketing of crops, livestock and livestock products as a commercial enterprise\u201d (Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 301 [11]).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In 1998, the Town initially granted defendants a temporary building permit for two mobile homes, but refused to extend the permit in 1999 and disapproved defendants\u2019 permit application to site additional mobile homes on the farm, relying solely on Town Zoning Code \u00a7 139-56 (A). The Town then commenced this action for an injunction precluding defendants from using the mobile homes to house migrant workers and directing removal of the structures unless defendants obtained the necessary building permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Defendants alleged, as an affirmative defense, that the zoning ordinance unreasonably restricted farm operations within the meaning of Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a) and that the Town failed to show that its restriction on mobile homes was necessary to protect the public health or safety. They also sought, in a counterclaim, an order directing the Town to issue building permits and certificates of occupancy for the mobile homes. Thereafter, defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. In support of their motion, they submitted a letter addressed to the Town from the Department of Agriculture and Markets, which stated that the \u201cDepartment has consistently viewed mobile homes used for farmworker residences as protected \u2018on-farm buildings\u2019 \u201d and that it viewed application of the Town\u2019s zoning code in defendants\u2019 case as an unreasonable restriction on farm operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Supreme Court denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the Town, permanently enjoining defendants from using mobile homes without building permits and certificates of occupancy. The court reasoned that Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a) did not \u201ccreate an exemption from local zoning authorities or ordinances for all \u2018farm operations\u2019 \u201d and, specifically, that the statute did not provide any protection to \u201cfarm residential build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ings,\u201d including mobile homes. The Appellate Division affirmed for \u201creasons stated\u201d at Supreme Court (277 AD2d 1055). We granted leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Legislature enacted article 25-AA of the Agriculture and Markets Law in 1971 for the stated purposes of protecting, conserving and encouraging \u201cthe development and improvement of [this State\u2019s] agricultural lands\u201d (L 1971, ch 479, \u00a7 1). At that time and again in 1987 (L 1987, ch 774, \u00a7 1), the Legislature specifically found that \u201cmany of the agricultural lands in New York state are in jeopardy of being lost for any agricultural purposes\u201d due to local land use regulations inhibiting farming, as well as various other deleterious side effects resulting from the extension of nonagricultural development into farm areas (Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 300).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">To foster the socio-economic vitality of agriculture in New York, the Legislature gave county legislative bodies the power to create \u201cagricultural districts\u201d <em>(see, id., </em>\u00a7 303). Lands falling within those \u201cagricultural districts\u201d may be entitled to various statutory protections and benefits. As is relevant here, Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a) mandates that, when exercising their powers to regulate land use activities, local governments must do so in a manner consistent with the policy objectives of article 25-AA. Thus, the statute directs that local governments \u201cshall not unreasonably restrict or regulate farm operations within agricultural districts in contravention of the purposes of this article unless it can be shown that the public health or safety is threatened\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 305-a [1] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In this case, as previously noted, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, who appears <em>amicus curiae </em>on defendants\u2019 behalf, has concluded that \u201cmobile homes used for farmworker residences [are] protected \u2018on-farm buildings.\u2019 \u201d Rejecting the Commissioner\u2019s position, the courts below concluded that use of mobile homes to house migrant farm workers does not fall within the definition of \u201cfarm operation.\u201d Initially, the Legislature defined the phrase \u201c[f]arm operation\u201d as \u201cthe land used in agricultural production, farm buildings, equipment and <em>farm residential buildings\u201d </em>(L 1992, ch 534, \u00a7 1 [emphasis supplied]; <em>see also, </em>L 1995, ch 235, \u00a7 1). In 1997, the Legislature amended the definition to mean \u201cthe land and <em>on-farm buildings, </em>equipment, and practices which contribute to the production, preparation and marketing of crops, livestock and livestock products as a commercial enterprise\u201d (L 1997, ch 357, \u00a7 2 [emphasis supplied]). The courts below reasoned that, by deleting the phrase \u201cfarm residential buildings,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Legislature intended to limit the definition of \u201cfarm operation\u201d to non-residential buildings, thereby divesting those buildings of the protections of Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a (1) (a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">As urged by defendants and the Commissioner, the literal language of the definition does not exclude \u201cfarm residential buildings\u201d from the protective reach of the statute. To the contrary, Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 301 (11) makes plain that <em>all </em>buildings located \u201con-farm\u201d may be considered part of a \u201cfarm operation\u201d if they otherwise satisfy the requirements of the statute <em>(see, id., </em>\u00a7 301 [11]). Moreover, the legislative history supports the Commissioner\u2019s view by explaining that the statute was amended in 1997 to correct technical errors and to <em>strengthen </em>\u2014 not limit \u2014 the protections against unreasonably restrictive local laws and ordinances <em>(see, </em>Senate Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1997, ch 357, at 3, reprinted in 1997 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2345 [amendments were needed \u201cto correct technical errors and improve the Department\u2019s ability to effectively administer the law\u201d]; Senate Sponsor John R Kuhl, Jr., Letter in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1997, ch 357 [the bill \u201cincorporates several technical changes * * * proposed by the Department (of Agriculture and Markets)\u201d and is intended \u201cto further improve and strengthen the law\u201d]; Assembly Sponsor William L. Parment Letter in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1997, ch 357 [\u201cThis legislation will improve the administration of the Agricultural Districts Program by strengthening the * * * unreasonably restrictive local ordinance provisions * * * and making various technical corrections\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The Commissioner also concluded that \u201cthe Town of Lysander\u2019s Zoning Code, insofar as it <em>prohibits </em>the siting of mobile homes having an area of less than 1,100 square feet for farm labor housing on farm operations * * * unreasonably restricts such farm operations, including Paul Hafner Farms.\u201d According to the Commissioner,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201cFrequently, farmers rely on mobile home housing for their farm laborers to accommodate the long work day, seasonal housing needs and to address the real shortage of rental housing in rural areas. Local government prohibitions or restrictions on the use of mobile homes can significantly impair the viability of farm operations.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The Commissioner\u2019s view in this regard is entitled to deference. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Where, as here, the \u201cinterpretation of a statute or <em>its application </em>involves knowledge and understanding <em>of </em>underlying operational practices or entails an evaluation of factual data and inferences to be drawn therefrom, the courts regularly defer to the governmental agency charged with the responsibility for administration of the statute\u201d <em>(Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459 [emphasis supplied]; <em>see also, Matter of Jennings v New York State Off. of Mental Health, </em>90 NY2d 227, 239).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Finally, the Town failed to make any evidentiary showing that the statutory exception to the ban on unreasonable regulations of farm operations <em>applied </em>\u2014 i.e., that an <em>absolute </em>ban on single-wide mobile homes was needed because \u201cthe public health or safety [was] threatened\u201d (Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 305-a [1] [a]). Therefore, we agree with defendants and the Commissioner that defendants were entitled to summary judgment dismissing the Town\u2019s complaint. The Town\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We note that, as a result of our reversal, defendants\u2019 counterclaim for an order directing the Town to issue building permits and certificates of occupancy \u2014 which had been rendered academic by the rulings below \u2014 apparently now remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment granted and the case remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
