For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant is a resident of Missouri. Appellant owned a mare that she wished to breed during the 2009 breeding season. Appellees are both residents of Ohio. Appellees operated a horse-breeding business under the trade name of Kinwalker Stables. In furtherance of its business, appellees placed advertisements on the Internet offering the breeding services of their stallion. Appellant saw one of appellees\u2019 advertisements online and contacted appellees by e-mail to inquire into their breeding services. Appellees and appellant exchanged several e-mails, and eventually the parties reached an agreement for the breeding of appellees\u2019 stallion to appellant\u2019s mare by means of artificial insemination for the price of $515. In January 2009, appellees mailed appellant the \u201cBreeding Agreement and Transported Semen Agreement.\u201d On January 11, 2009, appellant executed and mailed back the contract, along with the required deposit fees. On January 15, 2009, upon receiving the agreement and deposit fees from appellant, Rossing signed the agreement for appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 3} From January to June 2009, the parties continued to correspond by both e-mail and telephone in order to arrange the shipment of semen. Appellant paid the remaining balance on the contract and contacted appellees to have the semen shipped during a time when her mare was in heat. Appellant claims that appellees shipped the semen late, and when it arrived, it was allegedly unsafe for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, appellant filed suit against appellees in the Circuit Court of St. Francois County, Missouri, for breach of contract and violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. Although served with a summons, appellees failed to file an answer or otherwise respond to the suit. Default judgment in the amount of $8,572.94 was entered against appellees in December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 5} On April 27, 2010, appellant brought an action to enforce the foreign judgment by filing an authenticated copy of the Missouri judgment in the Preble County Court of Common Pleas. Upon receiving notice, appellees responded by simultaneously filing an answer and a motion to dismiss or vacate the foreign judgment. Appellees argued that the Missouri judgment was void because appellees did not have sufficient contacts with the state of Missouri to permit the Missouri court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over them. On August 4, 2010, after holding an evidentiary hearing on the matter, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss or vacate the foreign judgment. The trial court found that appellees did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Missouri to satisfy due process. In reaching its decision, the court declined to discuss Missouri\u2019s long-arm statute on the ground that even if the long-arm statute would allow the exercise of jurisdiction, exercising that jurisdiction would violate due process. Appellant filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 6} Assignment of error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred when it granted [appellees\u2019] motion to dismiss or vacate the foreign judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 8} In her first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that the Missouri court lacked personal jurisdiction over appellees because appellees\u2019 conduct satisfies the Missouri long-arm statute and creates sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy due-process requirements. Appellant maintains that the trial court erred in failing to discuss Missouri\u2019s long-arm statute. Appellant further contends that the court erred in failing to apply Missouri law in its due-process analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 9} Pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of Section 1, Article IV, United States Constitution, Ohio courts must recognize the validity of a foreign judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. <em>Wyatt v. Wyatt </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 268, 269, 602 N.E.2d 1166. A foreign judgment may be collaterally attacked, however, if the foreign court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction was either not authorized by the foreign court\u2019s internal law or if the assertion of jurisdiction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Litsinger Sign Co. v. Am. Sign Co. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 1, 4, 40 O.O.2d 30, 227 N.E.2d 609. A judgment rendered by a court that lacks jurisdiction over the person is void. <em>CompuServe, Inc. v. Trionfo </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 157, 161, 631 N.E.2d 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201c \u2018When a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction is properly challenged * * * the jurisdictional question thus raised is one for the judge, with the burden on the plaintiff ultimately to prove the existence of a ground for jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rita Ann Distrib. v. Brown Drug Co., </em>164 Ohio App.3d 145, 2005-Ohio-5786, 841 N.E.2d 400, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Combs v. Bakker </em>(C.A.4, 1989), 886 F.2d 673. We review the trial court\u2019s ruling granting a motion to dismiss or vacate for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to a de novo standard of review. <em>Buflod v. Von Wilhendorf, L.L.C., </em>Warren App. No. CA2006-02-022, 2007-Ohio-347, 2007 WL 210790, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 11} To determine whether a court has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident, it must engage in a two-step analysis. \u201cFirst, the court must determine whether the state\u2019s \u2018long-arm\u2019 statute and applicable civil rule confer personal jurisdiction, and, if so, whether granting jurisdiction under the statute and the rule would deprive the defendant of the right to due process of law pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>U.S. Sprint Communications Co., Ltd. Partnership v. Mr. K\u2019s Foods, Inc. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 181, 183-184, 624 N.E.2d 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cA state\u2019s long arm statute or equivalent civil rule provides the basis upon which the exercise of personal jurisdiction is authorized by state law. * * * The interpretation of the applicable long arm statute or civil rule must be determined by application of the forum state\u2019s law.\u201d <em>Hack v. Fisher-Bord Worldwide Moving, </em>Summit App. No. 20914, 2002-Ohio-3863, 2002 WL 1758384, \u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 13} Missouri\u2019s long-arm statute provides the basis for the assertion of personal jurisdiction over appellees. Mo.Rev.Stat. 506.500 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c1. Any person or firm, whether or not a citizen or resident of this state, or any corporation, who in person or through an agent does any of the acts enumerated in this section, thereby submits such person, firm, or corporation, and, if an individual, his personal representative, to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state as to any cause of action arising from the doing of any of such acts:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(1) The transaction of any business within this state;</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(2) The making of any contract within this state;</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(3) The commission of a tortious act within this state * *</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">{\u00b6 18} Even assuming the validity of appellant\u2019s contention that the breeding contract was made in Missouri,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which would then place appellees within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>reach of Missouri\u2019s long-arm statute, the Missouri court could not properly exercise jurisdiction over appellees because of due-process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 19} The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a nonresident defendant have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state so that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462, 471-472, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528. Minimum contacts must have a basis in \u201csome act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d Id. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528. Jurisdiction is therefore proper when the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create such a substantial connection with the forum state that he could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. Id. Accordingly, random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts are not sufficient to establish minimum contacts with the forum state. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 20} To determine whether a nonresident defendant has made sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Missouri, the court may consider five factors: \u201c1) the nature and quality of the contacts; 2) the quantity of those contacts; 3) the relationship of the cause of action to those contacts; 4) the interest of Missouri in providing a forum for its residents; and 5) the convenience to the parties.\u201d <em>Consol. Elec. &amp; Mechanicals, Inc. v. Schuerman </em>(Mo.App.2006), 185 S.W.3d 773, 776. \u201cThe first three factors are of primary importance and the last two are of secondary importance.\u201d <em>Mead v. Conn </em>(Mo.App.1993), 845 S.W.2d 109,112.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 21} After reviewing the specific circumstances of this case, we find that appellees did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Missouri to satisfy due-process requirements. The manner in which the contractual relationship between the parties was formed suggests that appellees did not intend to create a substantial connection with the forum state. It was appellant who initiated appellees\u2019 contact with the forum state, not vice versa. Appellees did not purposefully direct their Internet advertisement towards residents of Missouri; they simply responded to an inquiry by a Missouri resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 22} Further, the quantity, nature, and quality of appellees\u2019 contacts were insufficient to constitute a substantial connection with Missouri. Missouri courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>have consistently held that the mere use of interstate facilities, such as telephones, mail, or facsimile machines, are \u201csecondary or ancillary factors which \u2018cannot alone provide the minimum contacts required by due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schuerman, </em>185 S.W.3d at 777, quoting <em>Bell Paper Box, Inc. v. Trans W. Polymers, Inc. </em>(C.A.8, 1995), 53 F.3d 920, 923; <em>TSE Supply Co. v. Cumberland Natural Gas Co. </em>(Mo.App.1983), 648 S.W.2d 169, 170. In the case at bar, appellees\u2019 only contacts with the state of Missouri occurred when they exchanged e-mails with appellant, telephoned appellant, and mailed the breeding contract and the semen to appellant in Missouri. Absent evidence of some other connection to Missouri, we cannot find that appellees had a substantial connection to that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 23} Our holding is supported by numerous Missouri cases in which the nature and number of contacts were far greater than in the present case, and yet were ruled insufficient to meet due-process requirements. In <em>Johnson Heater Corp. v. Deppe </em>(Mo.App.2002), 86 S.W.3d 114, a Wisconsin resident made several phone calls to a Missouri corporation before entering into a contract for the purchase of a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system. Even though the Wisconsin resident sent numerous faxes, mailings, and payments to the Missouri corporation, the Missouri court of appeals found insufficient contacts to satisfy due-process requirements. In <em>Farris v. Boyke </em>(Mo.App.1996), 936 S.W.2d 197, the Missouri court of appeals found that although respondents, residents of Illinois, had been physically present in Missouri on at least four different occasions, had made several dozen phone calls to Missouri, and had sent numerous facsimiles and letters to Missouri, respondents did not have such a substantial connection to the forum state that they could have anticipated being haled into court there. In <em>Elaine K. v. Augusta Hotel Assoc. Ltd. Partnership </em>(Mo.App.1993), 850 S.W.2d 376, a Missouri company initiated contact with a Georgia hotel for accommodations. Even though the Georgia hotel had placed several telephone calls to the Missouri company, had mailed brochures to Missouri, and had sent a letter to the Missouri company detailing the agreed room-rental terms, the Missouri court of appeals found that the contacts were insufficient to satisfy due-process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 24} The facts before us fail to demonstrate that appellees had sufficient minimum contacts with Missouri that the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice would be satisfied. The trial court did not err in granting appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss or vacate the Missouri judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 25} Assignment of error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court erred when it allowed Ashley N. Rossing to testify to information of which she had no personal knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>{\u00b6 27} In her second assignment of error, appellant argues that Rossing\u2019s testimony regarding Fliehman\u2019s contacts with the state of Missouri was improper because it called for speculation. Appellant contends that because Rossing did not have personal knowledge of Fliehman\u2019s contacts, she was an incompetent witness, and the trial court therefore erred when it overruled her objection to Rossing\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Appellant maintains that the court erred in granting Fliehman\u2019s motion to dismiss or vacate the foreign judgment because it considered Rossing\u2019s testimony when the testimony should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cSince matters of jurisdiction are often not apparent on the face of the summons or pleadings, evidentiary hearings are an appropriate vehicle for resolving such issues. In deciding the merits of the defense, the court may hear the matter on affidavits, depositions, interrogatories, or receive oral testimony. * * * If an evidentiary hearing is conducted, plaintiff has the burden of proving jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Friedman v. Speiser, Krause &amp; Madole, P.C. </em>(1988), 56 Ohio App.3d 11, 13-14, 565 N.E.2d 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 29} Before a witness may testify at an evidentiary hearing, the court must be able to infer that the witness is competent and has personal knowledge of that to which he or she testifies. <em>Starinchak v. Sapp, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-484, 2005-Ohio-2715, 2005 WL 1303212, \u00b6 28. A trial court has wide discretion in determining whether a witness is competent to testify, and an appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling absent an abuse of discretion. Id. at \u00b6 27. An abuse of discretion constitutes more than an error of law or judgment; it requires a finding that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 30} Evid.R. 602 provides: \u201cA witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the witness\u2019 own testimony.\u201d Personal knowledge is defined as \u201c \u2018Knowledge gained through firsthand observation or experience, as distinguished from a belief based on what someone else has said.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bonacorsi v. Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Ry. Co., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 314, 2002-Ohio-2220, 767 N.E.2d 707, \u00b6 26, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.Rev.1999) 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 31} The following colloquy took place at the evidentiary hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[APPELLEES\u2019 ATTORNEY]: * * * What was your relationship with Lee Fliehman, the other defendant in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[ROSSING]: He was my husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201c[APPELLEES\u2019 ATTORNEY]: All right. And he is not any more?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c[ROSSING]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c[APPELLEES\u2019 ATTORNEY]: At the time that the stuff [the horse semen] was sold to Nancy Wood, were you married to Lee [Fliehman]?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c[ROSSING]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c[APPELLEES\u2019 ATTORNEY]: How long have you been married to Lee [Fliehman]?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c[ROSSING]: Uh, a couple of months.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c[APPELLEES\u2019 ATTORNEY]: All right. During the time, to your knowledge, during the time you were married to him, did he have any contacts at all with Missouri, different than yours, that you already testified to?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection, Your Honor, calls for speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c[THE COURT]: It is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c[APPELLEES\u2019 ATTORNEY]: The answer ma\u2019am?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c[ROSSING]: What was the question again, I\u2019m sorry?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c[APPELLEES\u2019 ATTORNEY]: Yes, to the best of your knowledge, during the time that you were married to him or otherwise, did he have any contacts with Missouri different than yours that you\u2019ve already testified to?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c[ROSSING]: No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-16\">{\u00b6 47} The manner in which appellees\u2019 counsel inquired about Fliehman\u2019s contacts with Missouri specifically limited Rossing\u2019s testimony to those observations that she personally made or perceived throughout the course of her relationship with Fliehman. Because Rossing\u2019s testimony was limited to the scope of her personal knowledge, the trial court acted within the bounds of its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s objection and admitting the testimony. The court was entitled to consider Rossing\u2019s testimony in deciding appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss or vacate the foreign judgment. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-18\">Bressler and Ringland, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-15\">. Appellant contends that the breeding contract was made within the state of Missouri because that is where she accepted and signed the contract. Appellees contend, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>contract was made in Ohio. \u201cThis was literally a sale conducted by an Ohio resident, from Ohio, and in Ohio, which just happened to be with a Missouri resident.\u201d Regardless of where the contract was entered into, a disputed issue we need not and do not decide, the facts fail to demonstrate that appellees had sufficient minimum contacts with Missouri to satisfy due-process requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
