This is the second time this dispute is before us. We issued a decision on September 11, 2009, which reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings. <em>Sugarcreek Twp. v. Centerville, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 480, 2009-Ohio-4794, 921 N.E.2d 655 <em>(\u201cSugarcreek I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">{\u00b6 2} In 2006, Centerville entered into a preannexation agreement with the owner of two parcels of real property located in Sugarcreek Township. The annexation was an expedited type-2 annexation pursuant to R.C. 709.023, in which the annexed land nevertheless also remains part of the township from which it was annexed. The terms of the preannexation agreement required Centerville to enact an ordinance adopting a tax-increment-financing plan (\u201cTIF plan\u201d) that would apply to the annexed land. On April 20, 2006, prior to the filing of the annexation petitions with the Greene County Board of Commissioners, Sugarcreek adopted its own TIF plan that encompassed some of the annexed lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">{\u00b6 3} A TIF plan \u201cis a method of financing that is used to pay for public improvements. A public entity will sell bonds for public improvements and recoup the money from the increase in value of property that is enhanced by the public improvements. The property owners make service payments to a fund in lieu of property taxes, and the public entity pays the bond obligations with the money in this fund, rather than with the public entity\u2019s general revenue fund.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Sugarcreek I </em>at \u00b6 24. R.C. 5709.40 authorizes a municipality to adopt an ordinance creating a TIF plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 4} In late June and early July 2006, Greene County granted Centerville\u2019s annexation petitions. In September 2006, Sugarcreek commenced an action for declaratory judgment in the common pleas court. In paragraph 58 of its second amended complaint, Sugarcreek sought \u201ca declaration that Centerville may not implement a TIF on the Annexed Land, both because Sugarcreek is entitled to all real property tax receipts from the Annexed Land and because Centerville may not adopt a TIF on land that is already covered by Sugarcreek\u2019s TIF.\u201d Sugar-creek also sought a declaration that Centerville\u2019s annexation of the two parcels of real property located in Sugarcreek Township was invalid because proper procedures were not followed in annexing the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 5} The parties filed motions for summary judgment in the declaratory-judgment action. The trial court found that Sugarcreek is entitled to all real property taxes collected from the two parcels of land annexed by Centerville. Therefore, Centerville could not adopt a TIF plan covering the annexed land. The court reasoned \u201cthat Centerville\u2019s commitment in the Pre-Annexation Agreement, that would result in Centerville\u2019s TIF for the annexed land, would divert real property taxes from Sugarcreek in violation of R.C. \u00a7 709.023(H).\u201d The trial court granted Sugarcreek a declaratory judgment \u201cthat the City of Centerville may not implement a TIF on the annexed land * * * that would in any way divert real property taxes for the annexed territory from Sugarcreek Township.\u201d The trial court also found that the annexations of the two parcels of land were properly petitioned, granted, accepted, and completed in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 6} Centerville filed a notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment, arguing that Sugarcreek Township neither had standing to challenge the annexation nor had presented a real case or controversy. Centerville also argued that the trial court had erred in finding that a municipality may not enact a TIF plan covering property that has been annexed under the expedited annexation procedure in R.C. 709.023.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 7} Based on our review of the record before us, we held that the trial court did not err in finding that Sugarcreek had standing to bring a declaratory-judgment action and that the controversy was ripe for adjudication. Further, we concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[T]he trial court erred in part in holding that Sugarcreek is entitled to all property tax revenues from the annexed property. The trial court correctly concluded that Centerville cannot interfere with Sugarcreek\u2019s collection of real property tax revenue levied on the unimproved and improved value of the real estate that remains in the township. However, the court failed to recognize that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Centerville is also entitled to its own share of the minimum levies on the property * * * and can therefore enact TIF legislation to the extent that it does not interfere with Sugarcreek\u2019s right to collect its share of the minimum levies on the property under the same statutes.\u201d <em>Sugarcreek I </em>at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">{\u00b6 9} We reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. On remand, the parties could not agree on the correct application of our judgment to the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment with regard to the TIF plan that Centerville had agreed to implement in the preannexation agreements. Following additional briefing by the parties, the trial court applied our reasoning with regard to revenue that each entity could receive from the minimum levies (or statutory \u201cinside millage\u201d), and further found that Centerville and Sugarcreek were entitled to their respective revenues from additional levies (or voted \u201coutside millage\u201d) imposed by each for the annexed territory. Consequently, Centerville could not adopt a TIF plan that would affect Sugarcreek\u2019s right to its outside millage. The trial court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cCenterville\u2019s and Sugarcreek\u2019s shares of the outside millage, are the outside millage real property taxes voted respectively by the residents of Centerville and Sugarcreek, including residents of the annexed territory, and applicable to Centerville and Sugarcreek respectively, including the annexed territory. Centerville may enact a TIF Plan to exempt its own share of the outside millage applicable to the annexed territory. * * * But Centerville may not enact a TIF Plan to exempt Sugarcreek\u2019s share of the outside millage, i.e., real estate taxes voted by Sugarcreek on Sugarcreek Township including the annexed territory. Those Sugarcreek real estate taxes remain subject to Sugar-creek Township pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 709.023(H). Otherwise the last phrase of R.C. \u00a7 709.023(H) would refer only to inside millage, a limitation not expressed or implied in the law, and, in the opinion of this Court, a conclusion not intended by the Court of Appeals\u2019 Opinion on September 11, 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 11} Centerville filed a notice of appeal, raising the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in determining that a municipality cannot TIF the voted (outside) millage of a township\u2019s real property taxes on territory that has been annexed utilizing the R.C. 709.023 (expedited type-2) annexation process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by re-construing then misapplying R.C. 709.023(H) on remand contrary to this court\u2019s construction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>opinion and by adding language to R.C. 5709.40 that judicially amended the municipal TIF statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 14} When reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, an appellate court conducts a de novo review. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. <em>\u201cDe Novo </em>review means that this court uses the same standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal Co. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision is not granted any deference by the reviewing appellate court. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 15} Centerville argues that the trial court erred and varied from our mandate in Sugarcreek I in holding that any TIF plan Centerville may adopt cannot interfere with Sugarcreek\u2019s right to revenue from the outside millage tax on the two annexed parcels that Sugarcreek imposed. Because municipal annexations are governed by statute, we necessarily refer to the sections of the Revised Code implicated by Centerville\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 16} Annexation is governed by R.C. Chapter 709. R.C. 709.02 to 709.11 govern petitions for annexation filed by a majority of the owners of real property contiguous to a municipal corporation. Prior to the enactment of S.B. 5 in 2001, once a municipality annexed contiguous land that was situated in a township, the municipality then had to petition the county\u2019s board of commissioners to conform the resulting new boundaries of the municipality and the township pursuant to R.C. 503.07. <em>Sugarcreek I </em>at \u00b6 104. If a municipality failed to so petition, the annexed property became part of the municipal corporation but also remained part of the township. The taxpayers in the annexed area then resided both in the city and in the township and were obligated to pay both taxes levied by the township and taxes levied by the municipality. Id. at \u00b6 106. If, however, a municipality successfully petitioned to conform the boundaries pursuant to R.C. 503.07, the annexed land was no longer a part of the township, but the municipality then was required to pay the township real property tax on the annexed area. R.C. 709.19. \u201cThis indicates an intent to benefit townships, by allowing payment whenever any taxable property is excluded from the township.\u201d <em>Sugarcreek I </em>at \u00b6 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 17} S.B. 5 was enacted in 2001. Among other things, the bill provided for an expedited type-2 annexation procedure. The section governing that form of annexation is R.C. 709.023. <em>Sugarcreek I </em>at \u00b6 97-98. The section is not analogous to any sections of the Revised Code enacted prior to 2001. Id. at \u00b6 98. R.C. 709.023 provides for an expedited annexation procedure in which the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>annexed may not be excluded from the township pursuant to the boundary-conformity provisions of R.C. 508.07, and therefore remains a part of the township. R.C. 709.023(A). R.C. 709.023(H) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">{\u00b6 18} <em>\u201cNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 503.07 of the Revised Code, </em>unless otherwise provided in an annexation agreement entered into pursuant to section 709.192 of the Revised Code or in a cooperative economic development agreement entered into pursuant to section 701.07 of the Revised Code, <em>territory annexed into a municipal corporation pursuant to this section shall not at any time be excluded from the township under section 503.07 of the Revised Code and, thus, remains subject to the toumship\u2019s real property taxes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 19} The issue in the present case is whether R.C. 709.023(H), and particularly its final clause, precludes Centerville from adopting a TIF plan that diminishes the tax revenue to which Sugarcreek is entitled from the outside millage that Sugarcreek imposes on land covered by the proposed Centerville TIF plan. It is undisputed that Centerville\u2019s TIF plan may not affect Sugarcreek\u2019s right to tax revenue from its share of the statutory inside millage, per <em>Sugarcreek I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 20} Townships, like municipalities, are taxing authorities, R.C. 5705.01(A) and (C), and, like municipalities, townships have authority to tax coextensively within their borders. R.C. 5705.03; <em>Roderer v. Miami Twp. Bd. of Trustees </em>(1983), 14 Ohio App.3d 155, 158, 14 OBR 172, 470 N.E.2d 183. R.C. 709.023(H) precludes a municipality that annexes land from a township through an expedited type-2 annexation from petitioning to conform its boundaries pursuant to R.C. 503.07, and further provides that the annexed land \u201cremains subject to the township\u2019s real property taxes.\u201d Because Sugarcreek may tax coextensively with its borders, Sugarcreek remains authorized after an expedited type-2 annexation to the revenue from the outside millage tax that Sugarcreek imposed on the two parcels of land that Centerville annexed. Consistent with Sugarcreek\u2019s right in that respect, Centerville may not adopt a TIF plan that diminishes the tax revenue from outside millage that Sugarcreek remains entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 21} Centerville argues that the plain language of R.C. 709.023(H) merely precludes Centerville from conforming the boundaries of Centerville and Sugar-creek under R.C. 503.07, and does not preclude Centerville from adopting a TIF ordinance under R.C. 5709.40 that limits Sugarcreek\u2019s ability to collect property taxes on the annexed property. As we explained in our prior opinion, however, \u201cR.C. 709.023(H) is not quite as narrow as Centerville contends. R.C. 709.023(H) does not merely indicate that boundaries may not be conformed; it also clearly states that the annexed property \u2018remains subject to the township\u2019s real property taxes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sugarcreek I </em>at \u00b6 134. We believe that the plain language of R.C. 709.023(H) precludes Centerville from enacting a TIF plan that would prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Sugarcreek from collecting the property taxes, whether in the form of inside millage or outside millage, to which it is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 22} Centerville argues that it should be able to adopt a TIF plan that affects Sugarcreek\u2019s voted outside millage because the legislature could have amended R.C. 5709.40(F) to prevent such a result, but it did not. R.C. 5709.40(C)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe legislative authority of a municipal corporation may adopt an ordinance creating an incentive district and declaring improvements to parcels within the district to be a public purpose and, except as provided in division (F) of this section, exempt from taxation as provided in this section * *</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 5709.40(F)(1) through (12) identifies 12 local tax levies that are excepted from the TIF plan tax exemption authorized by R.C. 5709.40(C)(1). Township real property taxes are not included among the 12 exceptions. According to Centerville, the failure of the legislature to include an exception for township real property taxes in R.C. 5709.40(F) demonstrates that the legislature did not intend to preclude municipalities from enacting TIF plans that interfere with the township\u2019s authority to tax property within its borders. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 25} In matters of statutory interpretation, expression of one thing generally suggests exclusion of others. The 12 exceptions in R.C. 5709.40(F) were not added until well after the passage of S.B. 5, authorizing expedited type-2 annexation. However, it was not necessary to include an exception for expedited type-2 annexations in R.C. 5709.40(F) because the saving clause in R.C. 709.023(H), specifying that land thus annexed \u201cremains subject to the township\u2019s real property taxes,\u201d served the same purpose. The expression of legislative intent is the same under either alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 26} Further, our interpretation of R.C. 709.023(H) is consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent to benefit townships. For example, pursuant to R.C. 709.19(C)(2), a municipality that conforms boundaries under R.C. 503.07 must continue to make tax payments to a township even after the municipality has exempted the annexed property from the township\u2019s real property taxes through a TIF plan adopted pursuant to R.C. 5709.40. <em>Sugarcreek I </em>at \u00b6 115-116; R.C. 709.19(C)(2). It would be an absurd result to then permit municipalities that are precluded by R.C. 709.023(H) from conforming boundaries to adopt a TIF plan that limits a township\u2019s ability to impose taxes on and receive tax payments for property within its borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">{\u00b6 27} Centerville also argues that, being a special provision, R.C. 5709.40(F) prevails over R.C. 709.023(H), which is the more general provision, pursuant to R.C. 1.51. However, R.C. 1.51 applies only when a \u201cconflict between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>provisions is irreconcilable.\u201d Id. Otherwise, the provisions \u201cshall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.\u201d Id. That outcome is readily available here.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 709.023(H) and 5709.40 should be read in pari materia to permit a municipal corporation to adopt a TIF ordinance affecting real property located within the municipality pursuant to R.C. 5709.40, except to the extent that the real property \u201cremains subject to the real property taxes,\u201d R.C. 709.023(H), of a township in which the real property likewise remains located following a type-2 annexation. Therefore, the TIF plan that Centerville enacts cannot diminish the outside millage taxes on the real property at issue imposed by Sugarcreek Township or the revenue therefrom to which the township is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 29} The assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Judgement affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-7\">Fain and Froelich, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
