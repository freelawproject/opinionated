Lena<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> died testate on February 24, 2010. Her will was admitted to probate on March 18, 2010, and Fred Profitt was appointed executor of her estate. In her will, Lena stated: \u201cMy spouse is Pleasie Woods, Jr. I deliberately make no provision in my will for my Spouse for reasons personal to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 3} On March 26, 2010, Pleasie was served with the court\u2019s \u201cCitation to Surviving Spouse to Exercise Elective Rights\u201d and a \u201cSummary of General Rights Of Surviving Spouse.\u201d Pleasie died on May 3, 2010. On May 12, 2010, the executor of his estate filed a motion requesting the probate court\u2019s approval of Pleasie\u2019s written election to take against Lena\u2019s will pursuant to R.C. 2105.06. The writing was purportedly signed by Pleasie on March 23, 2010, in the presence of his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 4} On October 20, 2010, the probate court found that Pleasie\u2019s election to take against Lena\u2019s will was valid and binding. The probate court awarded Pleasie\u2019s estate $40,000.00 from Lena\u2019s estate pursuant to R.C. 2106.13. The executor of Lena\u2019s estate filed a notice of appeal from that final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe court erred in its decision of October 20, 2010 by finding the purported election to take against the will to be valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 6} The executor of Lena\u2019s estate argues that the trial court erred in finding that Pleasie\u2019s election to take against the will pursuant to R.C. 2105.06 was valid and binding, because Pleasie failed to make the election in person before the probate judge as required by R.C. 2106.06. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">{\u00b6 7} Once an administrator or executor of an estate is appointed, the probate court must issue a citation to a surviving spouse to elect whether to take <em>under </em>the will pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2106, or to take <em>against </em>the will by exercising the surviving spouse\u2019s rights under R.C. 2105.06 when a decedent dies intestate. R.C. 2106.01(A). This election \u201cmay be made at any time after the death of the decedent, but the surviving spouse shall not make the election later than five months from the date of the initial appointment of an administrator or executor of the estate.\u201d R.C. 2106.01(E). \u201cIf no action is taken by the surviving spouse before the expiration of the five-month period, it is conclusively presumed that the surviving spouse elects to take under the will.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 2106.06 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe election of a surviving spouse to take under section 2105.06 of the Revised Code and thereby refusing to take under the will shall be made in person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>before the probate judge, or a deputy clerk who has been appointed to act as a referee, except as provided in sections 2106.07 and 2106.08 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cWhen the election is made in person before the judge or referee, the judge or referee shall explain the will, the rights under the will, and the rights, by law, in the event of a refusal to take under the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2106.07 authorizes the probate court to appoint a commissioner to take the surviving spouse\u2019s election to take against the will. R.C. 2106.08 provides for election by a spouse who is under a legal disability. The record does not reflect that either section applies in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 12} The requirement in R.C. 2106.06 to make the election in person before the probate judge or an appointed referee or a commissioner appointed by the court is reflected in Standard Probate Form 8.8, a copy of which was served on Pleasie along with the Citation to Surviving Spouse to Exercise Elective Rights (Probate Form 8.0). Probate Form 8.3 is entitled \u201cSummary of General Rights of Surviving Spouse,\u201d and states:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIf you elect to take under the Will, you may do so in writing if you wish, but you may also do so by taking no action.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIf you elect to take against the Will, you must do so in person before the Probate Judge or a Magistrate. This election must be exercised within five months from the date of the initial appointment of the administrator or executor of the estate or it is forfeited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 15} It is undisputed that Pleasie did not make an election in person before a probate judge, referee, or commissioner as required by R.C. 2106.06. Rather, Pleasie signed an election form in his attorney\u2019s office. The space on the form provided for the signature of the probate judge is blank. Pleasie therefore waived his right to take against Lena\u2019s will, and his estate is not entitled to the share of a surviving spouse who properly did elect to take against the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2106.04 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIf the surviving spouse dies before probate of the will, or, having survived the probate, thereafter either fails to make the election provided by section 2106.01 of the Revised Code or dies without having made an election within the times described in division (E) of that section, the surviving spouse shall be conclusively presumed to have elected to take under the will, and the surviving spouse and the heirs, devisees, and legatees of the surviving spouse, and those claiming through or under them, shall be bound by the conclusive presumption * *</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">{\u00b6 18} Pursuant to R.C. 2106.04 and 2106.01(E), Pleasie is conclusively presumed to have elected to take under the will. The probate court appears to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>acknowledged this fact when it stated: \u201cAt first glance, one would conclude that such election was invalid.\u201d But instead of finding that Pleasie\u2019s estate is now entitled to only his share under Lena\u2019s will, which is nothing, the probate court relied on <em>Martin v. Martin, </em>Allen App. No. 1-03-55, 2004-Ohio-1397, 2004 WL 549474, to find that Pleasie\u2019s written election in the presence of his attorney was a valid and binding election to take against the will pursuant to R.C. 2105.06. We believe that the probate court erred in its application of <em>Martin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 19} <em>Martin </em>involved a surviving spouse who signed a form in her attorney\u2019s office electing to take <em>under </em>the decedent\u2019s will. Subsequently, the surviving spouse sought to set aside that election and instead elect to take <em>against </em>the will. The court found that the surviving spouse executed the election to take under the will with full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances, and therefore could not revoke her election to take under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 20} The facts in <em>Martin </em>are inapposite to the case before us. <em>Martin </em>involved an election to take under the will, which may occur outside the presence of the probate judge. <em>Martin </em>did not address whether an election made in an attorney\u2019s office could satisfy the requirement in R.C. 2106.06 that the surviving spouse make an election to take against the will in person before a probate judge or other person qualified under R.C. 2106.06. The plain language of R.C. 2106.06 requires such an election to take place in person before a probate judge, a deputy clerk appointed to act as a referee, or a person to whom a commission has been issued by the probate court pursuant to R.C. 2106.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 21} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe court erred in finding that there was sufficient proof of a decision and intent to elect to take against the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">{\u00b623} Based on our disposition of the first assignment of error, the second assignment of error is moot. Therefore, we need not decide the error assigned. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">{\u00b6 24} The judgment of the probate court is reversed and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-13\">Donovan and Hall, JJ. concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\">.
