Anderson and Javarre J. Tate, appeals the trial court\u2019s July 15, 2010 judgment entry granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">{\u00b6 2} Appellees are the city of Massillon, Susan Toles, and Rick Annen.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">{\u00b6 3} This case concerns Ohio\u2019s statute on sovereign immunity for municipalities and their employees \u2014 specifically, whether a municipality and a member of the city\u2019s fire department have immunity when the employee causes an accident when responding to an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">{\u00b6 4} On the morning of May 6, 2008, an accident occurred at the intersection of Johnson Street and Walnut Street, when the vehicle being operated by Ronald <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Anderson collided with Massillon City Fire Aerial Ladder Truck 211, resulting in the deaths of Ronald Anderson and his grandson, Javarre Tate.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 5} On that morning, the following events transpired:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 6} At 8:30:32 a.m., Massillon resident Tammy Lockey called 9-1-1 to report a car fire she observed out her window. The call was received by the RED Center, the central dispatch for Massillon and other political subdivisions. Dispatcher Lynne Martin Joiner received the call. Joiner routed the call to Thomas Thornberry, the fire dispatcher, and he consulted his computer to dispatch the first available fire engine in Massillon. Thornberry, a 26-year veteran dispatcher, inquired of Joiner whether the fire was near a house.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 7} At 8:31:40, a tone was sounded in Station 1 of the Massillon Fire Department for Engine 214 to respond to the car fire. Pursuant to department policy, a single fire engine, such as Engine 214, and a separate truck would respond to car fires. However, also pursuant to policy, the dispatcher is required to inquire whether the car fire is near a building or structure in order to determine which vehicles to dispatch. Based on this policy, dispatcher Joiner called 9-1-1 caller Tammy Lockey back and inquired as to whether the fire was near a house. Joiner interpreted the information she received as indicating that the car fire was near a house, and she relayed this information to Thornberry. Based on this new information, Thornberry then toned Station 1 at 8:33:03 and dispatched the second engine, Engine 211, a 75-foot aerial ladder truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 8} At 8:33:43 engine 214 left Station 1, operated by Firefighter Greenwood, commanded by Captain Smith. Engine 214 proceeded down Erie Street to Walnut Street toward the dispatched location.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">{\u00b6 9} At 8:34:25, Ladder Truck 211, operated by Firefighter Susan Toles and commanded by Captain Rich Annen, left Station 1 and began to follow the same route as Engine 214 toward the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">{\u00b6 10} A school bus yielded to Engine 214 at Third Street, then traveled down Walnut and through the subject intersection before Ladder Truck 211 appeared. The bus then pulled over east of the intersection as Ladder Truck 211 approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">{\u00b6 11} At the same time that Ladder Truck 211 was travelling east on Walnut Street, SE, Ronald Anderson was travelling north on Johnson Street, SE, in Massillon, with his grandson Javarre Tate as a passenger in his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">{\u00b6 12} Walnut Street is a two-lane road in a residential area. The intersection of Walnut and Johnson is a three-way stop, with a red flashing light for all traffic. A large tree was located on the corner of Walnut and Johnson Streets. Appellant claims that this tree, along with a utility pole, a fence, bushes, and a house close to the street, obstructed a clear view of the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>{\u00b6 13} The posted speed limit in this area is 25 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 14} Toles stated that she exceeded the speed limit, but described the emergency run as a \u201cnormal call, a normal run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 15} As Ladder Truck 211 proceeded to the fire, lights, the wail siren, and the air horn were engaged. Additionally, Annen, who was seated in the passenger seat next to Toles, sounded the air horn at intersections.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 16} Toles stated that she could clearly see the intersection of Johnson and Walnut Streets as she approached. Annen stated that although there is a tree at that intersection, one can see through the branches to the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 17} Toles recalled that when she saw the school bus pulled over on Walnut Street in her lane of travel east of the intersection, she slowed down to make sure there were no children on the street and that the school-bus stop sign was not out. Toles stated that after she determined that the school bus was yielding, she moved left of center because of the presence of a parked car and the bus. Toles stated that she scanned the entire intersection to make sure the intersection was clear and determined that there was no one in the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">{\u00b6 18} According to Toles, as she approached the intersection, she saw the Anderson van \u201cshoot out in front\u201d of Ladder Truck 211. She stated that she began to move \u201cimmediate[ly] left even more, to try to avoid his vehicle and get around.\u201d Just prior to the moment that she saw the van pull out in front of Ladder Truck 211, Toles stated that she heard Annen say, \u201cHe\u2019s not stopping.\u201d Toles recalled seeing the Anderson van go \u201ccompletely through the stop sign right in front\u201d of Ladder Truck 211. Toles stated that she never saw the Anderson vehicle stopped at the stop sign. Ladder Truck 211 collided with Anderson\u2019s vehicle, resulting in the deaths of both Ronald Anderson and Javarre Tate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">{\u00b6 19} Eyewitnesses stated that appellees did not slow down or stop before proceeding through intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant Cynthia Anderson, the administrator of the estates of her husband, Ronald E. Anderson, and her grandson, Javarre Tate, filed a wrongful-death action, asserting claims against appellees Susan Toles, Richard Annen, and the city of Massillon.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">{\u00b6 21} On May 19, 2010, appellant filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">{\u00b6 22} On May 19, 2010, appellees also filed a motion for summary judgment asserting the affirmative defense of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>{\u00b6 28} On July 15, 2010, following the filing of response and reply briefs by the parties, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant now appeals to this court, assigning the following error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cI. The trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment to defendants/appellees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 26} Summary-judgment proceedings present the appellate court with the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. The Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212. Therefore, we must refer to Civ.R. 56, which provides: \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence or stipulation, and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">{\u00b6 27} Pursuant to the above rule, a trial court may not enter summary judgment if it appears that a material fact is genuinely disputed. The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The moving party may not make a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. The moving party must specifically point to some evidence that demonstrates that the nonmoving party cannot support its claim. If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">{\u00b6 28} It is based upon this standard that we review appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>{\u00b6 29} In her sole assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that appellee was immune from liability under R.C. 2744.01 et seq. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 30} The Supreme Court of Ohio has held:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cDetermining whether a political subdivision is immune from tort liability pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744 involves a three-tiered analysis. <em>Greene Cty. Agricultural Soc. v. Liming </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 551, 556-557, 733 N.E.2d 1141. The first tier is the general rule that a political subdivision is immune from liability incurred in performing either a governmental function or proprietary function. Id. at 556-557, 733 N.E.2d 1141; R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). However, that immunity is not absolute. R.C. 2744.02(B); <em>Cater v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 24, 28, 697 N.E.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe second tier of the analysis requires a court to determine whether any of the five exceptions to immunity listed in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply to expose the political subdivision to liability. Id. at 28, 697 N.E.2d 610. At this tier, the court may also need to determine whether specific defenses to liability for negligent operation of a motor vehicle listed in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a) through (c) apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cIf any of the exceptions to immunity in R.C. 2744.02(B) do apply and no defense in that section protects the political subdivision from liability, then the third tier of the analysis requires a court to determine whether any of the defenses in R.C. 2744.03 apply, thereby providing the political subdivision a defense against liability.\u201d <em>Colbert v. Cleveland, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 215, 2003-Ohio-3319, 790 N.E.2d 781, at \u00b6 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">{\u00b6 34} The three-tiered analysis of liability applicable to a political subdivision as set forth above does not apply when determining whether an employee of the political subdivision will be liable for harm caused to an individual. <em>Cramer v. Auglaize Acres, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 266, 2007-0hio-1946, 865 N.E.2d 9, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">{\u00b6 35} Pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A)(6), an employee of a political subdivision is immune from liability unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(a) The employee\u2019s acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope of the employee\u2019s employment or official responsibilities;</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(b) The employee\u2019s acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner * *</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">{\u00b6 38} Appellees herein claim that they are entitled to immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.02, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>{\u00b6 39} \u201c(B) Subject to sections 2744.03 and 2744.05 of the Revised Code, a political subdivision is liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or of any of its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in this division, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees when the employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority. The following are full defenses to that liability:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(b) A member of a municipal corporation fire department or any other firefighting agency was operating a motor vehicle while engaged in duty at a fire, proceeding toward a place where a fire is in progress or is believed to be in progress, or answering any other emergency alarm and the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct * *</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 43} Here, since the deaths of Ronald Anderson and Javarre Tate were caused by a municipal employee who is a member of a municipal fire department and who was proceeding toward a place where a fire was in progress, the question to be answered is whether the record establishes an issue of fact concerning whether Toles and/or Annen\u2019s actions constitute reckless, willful, and/or wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">{\u00b6 44} We therefore turn to the issue of what constitutes willful, wanton, and reckless conduct under R.C. 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cWanton\u201d conduct is the complete failure to exercise any care whatsoever. <em>Fabrey v. McDonald Village Police Dept. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 351, 356, 639 N.E.2d 31. Mere negligence will not be construed as wanton misconduct in the absence of evidence establishing a disposition of perversity on the part of the tortfeasor; the actor must be aware that his conduct will probably result in injury. Id., quoting <em>Roszman v. Sammett </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 94, 97, 55 O.O.2d 165, 269 N.E.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">{\u00b6 46} The \u201cwanton or reckless misconduct\u201d standard set forth in R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) and \u201cwillful or wanton misconduct\u201d standard set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a) are functionally equivalent. <em>Whitfield v. Dayton, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 172, 2006-Ohio-2917, 854 N.E.2d 532, at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c \u2018[W]illful misconduct\u2019 involves a more positive mental state prompting the injurious act than wanton misconduct, but the intention relates to the misconduct, not the result.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29. The <em>Whitfield </em>court defined \u201cwillful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>misconduct\u201d as \u201c \u2018an intentional deviation from a clear duty or from a definite rule of conduct, a deliberate purpose not to discharge some duty necessary to safety, or purposely doing some wrongful acts with knowledge or appreciation of the likelihood of resulting injury.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 30, quoting <em>Tighe v. Diamond </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 520, 527, 37 O.O. 243, 80 N.E.2d 122. In <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 312, 319, 662 N.E.2d 287, the Supreme Court defined the term \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d as the \u201cintent, purpose or design to injure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">{\u00b6 48} The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the definition of reckless misconduct set forth in Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 587, Section 500, which states that an actor\u2019s conduct is reckless if the following occurs: \u201c \u2018[Reckless disregard of the safety of others if he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brockman v. Bell </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 508, 516, 605 N.E.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 49} In <em>Marchetti v. Kalish </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 95, 100, 559 N.E.2d 699, the Supreme Court of Ohio again quoted the Restatement, contrasting intentional misconduct and recklessness and negligence and recklessness:</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c <em>\u2018f. Intentional misconduct and recklessness contrasted. </em>Reckless misconduct differs from intentional wrongdoing in a very important particular. While an act to be reckless must be intended by the actor, the actor does not intend to cause the harm which results from it. It is enough that he realizes or, from facts which he knows, should realize that there is a strong probability that harm may result, even though he hopes or even expects that his conduct will prove harmless. However, a strong probability is a different thing from the substantial certainty without which he cannot be said to intend the harm in which his act results.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c <em>\u2018g. Negligence and recklessness contrasted. </em>Reckless misconduct differs from negligence in several important particulars. It differs from that form of negligence which consists in mere inadvertence, incompetence, unskillfulness, or a failure to take precautions to enable the actor adequately to cope with a possible or probable future emergency, in that reckless misconduct requires a conscious choice of a course of action, either with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved in it or with knowledge of facts which would disclose this danger to any reasonable man. It differs not only from the above-mentioned form of negligence, but also from that negligence which consists in intentionally doing an act with knowledge that it contains a risk of harm to others, in that the actor to be reckless must recognize that his conduct involves a risk substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>greater in amount than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent. The difference between reckless misconduct and conduct involving only such a quantum of risk as is necessary to make it negligent is a difference in the degree of the risk, but this difference of degree is so marked as to amount substantially to a difference in kind.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 52} In <em>O\u2019Toole v. Denihan, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 374, 2008-Ohio-2574, 889 N.E.2d 505, \u00b6 73, the Supreme Court noted that in the context of R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b), recklessness is a perverse disregard of a known risk. The Supreme Court reminded us not to use 20-20 hindsight in viewing a situation and not to color our decision with a consideration of any tragic results. Id. at \u00b6 76. Our analysis must center upon the information and circumstances the actor had before him at the time he chose to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 53} <em>O\u2019Toole </em>held that even violations of agency policy do not rise to the level of recklessness unless the circumstances demonstrate a perverse disregard for the risks involved. Id. at \u00b6 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c \u2018Generally, issues regarding malice, bad faith, and wanton or reckless behavior are questions presented to the jury. <em>Fabrey, </em>[70 Ohio St.3d 351, 639 N.E.2d 31]. However, summary judgment is appropriate in instances where the alleged tortfeasor\u2019s actions show \u2018that he did not intend to cause any harm * * *, did not breach a known duty through an ulterior motive or ill will, [and] did not have a dishonest purpose * * *.\u2019 <em>Fox v. Daly </em>(Sept. 26, 1997), Trumbull App. No. 96-T-5453 [1997 WL 663670], (quoting <em>Hackathorn v. Preisse </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 768, 772, 663 N.E.2d 384).\u2019 <em>Henney </em>[v. <em>Shelby City School Dist., </em>Richland App. No.2005 CA 0064, 2006-Ohio-1382, 2006 WL 747475], at paragraphs 48-50.\u201d <em>Doe v. Jackson Local School Dist., </em>Stark App. No. 2006CA00212, 2007-Ohio-3258, 2007 WL 1840864, at \u00b6 38; <em>Sisler v. Lancaster, </em>Fairfield App. No. 09-CA-47, 2010-Ohio-3039, 2010 WL 2621472.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 55} Thus, when the facts presented show that reasonable minds could not conclude that the conduct at issue meets that high standard, a court may determine that the conduct is not willful, wanton, or reckless as a matter of law, and that determination is made considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>Ybarra v. Vidro, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-04-061, 2005-Ohio-2497, 2005 WL 1201224, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Reynolds v. Oakwood </em>(1987), 38 Ohio App.3d 125, 127, 528 N.E.2d 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">{\u00b6 56} In the case at bar, the trial court analyzed the totality of the circumstances and found that there was \u201cno evidence provided which demonstrates any willful or wanton misconduct by the [appellees] on May 6, 2008, including, but not limited to the operation of Engine 211.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">{\u00b6 57} Appellant argues that reasonable minds could find that under the totality of the circumstances, appellees\u2019 conduct was reckless, willful, and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>wanton. Appellant lists the following factors in support of whether appellees\u2019 conduct was willful, wanton, or reckless:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 58} (1) The failure of appellees to stop or slow at the stop sign, (2) The speed appellees were traveling, which was in excess of 50 m.p.h. in a 25 m.p.h. zone, (3) Any obstructions near the intersection which affected visibility, (4) The fact that appellees were traveling left of center, (5) Appellee\u2019s failure to apply the brakes prior to impact with Anderson\u2019s vehicle, (6) The fact that the aerial ladder truck appellee was driving was the second vehicle dispatched to a minor vehicle fire, (7) Whether appellee\u2019s speed caused the audible siren to be ineffective, (8) Whether the siren of the ladder truck was masked by the siren from the first emergency vehicle, (9) Whether Appellee violated certain Massillon ordinances and/or Massillon Fire Department policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 59} Initially, we will address appellant\u2019s argument that three independent witnesses opined that the appellees\u2019 conduct in this case was \u201creckless.\u201d However, upon review, we find that no definition of \u201creckless\u201d or \u201crecklessness\u201d as it applies to statutory-immunity cases pursuant to R.C. 2744.03 was provided to these witnesses prior to asking them to make such a legal determination. Thus, we do not find these opinions to be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 60} Therefore, our review turns to whether reasonable minds could conclude that appellees\u2019 conduct rose to the level of willful, wanton, or reckless misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\n<em>Analysis: Totality of the Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">{\u00b6 61} The facts in the ease sub judice are that at approximately 8:30 a.m. on May 6, 2008, firefighter Toles was traveling at approximately 52 m.p.h. down Walnut Street while operating Ladder Truck 211, did not stop as she crossed through the intersection with Johnson Street, and struck the vehicle in which Ronald Anderson and Javarre Tate were traveling.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">{\u00b6 62} Initially, we note that because appellees were responding to an emergency call, Toles was authorized by R.C. 4511.03 to proceed through the stop sign under the following conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cThe driver of any emergency vehicle or public safety vehicle, when responding to an emergency call, upon approaching a red or stop signal or any stop sign shall slow down as necessary for safety to traffic, but may proceed cautiously past such red or stop sign or signal with due regard for the safety of all persons using the street or highway.\u201d (Massillon Ordinance 331 mirrors this language.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">{\u00b6 64} In this case, appellant claims that appellees violated the above statute in addition to a number of Massillon Fire Department policies (307.01, 307.03(D) and 307.04(C)) and City of Massillon Ordinances (331.20(a) and 303.041).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>{\u00b6 65} Ordinance 303.041, which is modeled after R.C. 4511.45, addresses when an emergency vehicle may travel left of center and provides that operators must exercise \u201cdue regard\u201d for all other persons on the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 66} In this case, we do not find that the fact that appellees were left of center contributed to the accident. This is not a situation in which the accident was a head-on collision when the emergency vehicle was in the lane of travel of oncoming traffic, resulting in a collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 67} As to the Massillon Fire Department (\u201cMFD\u201d) policies:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 68} MFD 307.01 provides that \u201cif another vehicle fails to yield the right of way to an emergency vehicle, the emergency vehicle operator cannot force the right of way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 69} MFD Policy 307.03(D) provides that \u201c[djuring emergency response, the driver shall bring the vehicle to a complete stop for any of the following * * * blind intersections, when the driver cannot account for all lanes of traffic in an intersection, when other intersection hazards are present * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">{\u00b6 70} MFD 307.04(C) and (D) apply to Capt. Annen\u2019s duties as the officer on board the aerial ladder truck and provide that \u201cthe Officer must issue warnings about road conditions and physical hazards to the driver when necessary\u201d and \u201cshall assist the driver with intersection crossing, locating the scene, backing and any other necessary safety practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">{\u00b6 71} As stated above, it has been held that violations of internal departmental polices are not determinative as to the issue of whether the conduct herein constituted reckless behavior unless the circumstances demonstrate a perverse disregard for the risks involved. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 374, 2008-Ohio-2574, 889 N.E.2d 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">{\u00b6 72} In this case, appellant claims that a large tree, a utility pole, a fence, and bushes at or near the intersection created obstructions that required Toles to bring the vehicle to a complete stop, arguing that she could not \u201caccount for all lanes of traffic in an intersection\u201d and that \u201cother intersection hazards [were] present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">{\u00b6 73} Upon review, we find that at the summary-judgment stage, we must assume those facts in favor of appellant. Viewing the facts in this case in a light most favorable to appellant, specifically the high rate of speed at which appellee was traveling in conjunction with the claimed obstructions in the intersection that would interfere with a clear view of the whole intersection, we find that reasonable minds could find that appellees\u2019 actions in this case were reckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">{\u00b6 74} This ruling should not be interpreted to mean that we find that the conduct herein was, in fact, reckless. Rather, we are holding that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>should have an opportunity to present her case to a jury to make such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">{\u00b6 75} We therefore conclude that the trial court erred in determining that the facts material to the case are not in genuine dispute, and for this reason, summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 76} Therefore, we sustain appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 77} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Stark County, Ohio, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-8\">Gwin and Hoffman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
