We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On March 31, 2010, a complaint was filed in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, Family Division, alleging that R.J. appeared to be delinquent by reason of the offense of harassment by an inmate in violation of R.C. 2921.38(A), a fifth-degree felony if committed by an adult. The complaint was assigned Stark County case No. 2010JCR00664. The complaint stemmed from R.J.\u2019s alleged act of throwing urine upon Emily Harding, a corrections officer at the Indian River Detention Facility, as she walked past his detention cell on January 19, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">{\u00b6 3} On May 25, 2010, an adjudicatory hearing was held before Magistrate Priscilla Cunningham in Stark County, and R.J. was found to be delinquent. After R.J. indicated that he was a resident of Allen County, Magistrate Cunningham indicated upon the record that the case would be transferred to Allen County for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">{\u00b6 4} On June 29, 2010, Magistrate Cunningham issued a decision finding R.J. a juvenile delinquent offender. Under a bullet point entitled \u201cOther Orders,\u201d the decision reads: \u201cDisposition is certified to Allen County. Stark County Court costs are waived. Clerk: please prepare all necessary documentation to transfer/certify the case to Allen County for disposition.\u201d Under a section entitled \u201cDispositional Summary,\u201d the decision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">[R.J.], you are hereby ordered by the court to comply with the following orders:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">1.

Stucki approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, noting that \u201c[t]he parties having no objection timely filed herein; this Decision is to have immediate effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 6} On July 12, 2010, the Allen County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, sent an assignment notice to R.J., R.J.\u2019s mother, and the prosecutor, indicating that the matter was assigned Allen County case No. 2010 JG 27756 and was scheduled for a dispositional hearing on August 30, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 7} On July 14, 2010, R.J. filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision in Stark County alleging that the magistrate\u2019s decision was erroneous since his delinquency was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. A hearing on the objection was scheduled for August 3, 2010, but on July 29, 2010, R.J. filed a motion for a continuance of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 8} On August 27, 2010, R.J. filed a memorandum in support of his objection, to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On August 30, 2010, a hearing was held in Stark County on the objection, with the parties present, and the objection was withdrawn at that time. The trial court then ordered the clerk \u201cto certify this matter to the Allen County Juvenile Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">{\u00b6 9} The record indicates that R.J. and his mother also appeared before the Allen County Juvenile Court for a dispositional hearing on August 30, 2010, and the trial court ordered that disposition be deferred for six months to allow R.J. an opportunity to demonstrate compliance with the law and terms of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">{\u00b6 10} The dispositional hearing was then scheduled for September 22, 2010, in Allen County. On that day, R.J. appeared with counsel, and the trial court ordered that disposition be further deferred and the matter be set for pretrial conference on October 19, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">{\u00b6 11} On September 29, 2010, R.J. filed a motion in the Allen County Juvenile Court for a hearing and ruling on the objection that was filed in the Stark County Juvenile Court. On November 15, 2010, the Allen County Juvenile Court overruled the motion. On November 22, 2010, R.J. filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">{\u00b6 12} On December 16, 2010, a dispositional hearing was held before the Allen County Juvenile Court and the trial court ordered that R.J. be committed to DYS for an indefinite term for a minimum of six months and a maximum period not to exceed his attaining the age of 21 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">{\u00b6 13} On December 23, 2010, R.J. filed a notice of appeal. That same day, R.J. filed a motion for a stay pending appeal, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>{\u00b6 14} R.J. now appeals, raising four assignments of error for our review. We elect to address R.J.\u2019s third assignment of error out of the order that it was presented in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The Allen County Juvenile Court violated [R.J.\u2019s] right under the United States Constitution to freedom from being twice in jeopardy and twice punished for the same offense, an act done without jurisdiction to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, R.J. argues that the Allen County Juvenile Court improperly exercised jurisdiction over the case. Because Stark County had already made a disposition in the case, R.J. argues, nothing remained for Stark County to transfer to Allen County, and Allen County\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction and its disposition violated double jeopardy, because he was twice punished for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 16} Although juvenile proceedings are considered civil in nature, juvenile-delinquency proceedings have inherently criminal aspects; therefore, \u201ccertain basic constitutional protections afforded adults, for example the right to counsel, the privilege against self-incrimination, and freedom from double jeopardy, are applicable to juvenile proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Gillespie, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 502, 2002-Ohio-7025, 782 N.E.2d 140, \u00b6 20, citing <em>Schall v.

Jones </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 519, 528-529, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">{\u00b6 17} The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: \u201cNo person shall * * * be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d The bar against double jeopardy is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See, e.g., <em>Benton v. Maryland </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707. Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution also affords protection against double jeopardy for criminal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe primary purpose for the prohibition against double jeopardy \u2018is to preserve the finality or integrity of judgments.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re C.B., </em>2d Dist. No. 23615, 2010-Ohio-2129, 2010 WL 1932039, \u00b6 33, quoting <em>In re Kelly </em>(Nov. 7, 1995), 10th Dist. No. 95-APF05-613, 1995 WL 656944, citing <em>United States v. DiFrancesco </em>(1980), 449 U.S. 117, 128, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328. Therefore, any \u201c[a]pplication of the Double Jeopardy Clause depends upon the legitimacy of a defendant\u2019s expectation of finality in the judgment.\u201d Id., quoting <em>In re Burt, </em>5th Dist. NO.2006-CA-00328, 2007-Ohio-4034, 2007 WL 2269363, \u00b6 61, citing <em>Kelly </em>and <em>DiFrancesco.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>{\u00b6 19} The facts in this case are similar to those presented to this court in <em>In re C.E., </em>190 Ohio App.3d 85, 2010-Ohio-4072, 940 N.E.2d 990. In that case, C.E. was charged on December 31, 2008, and March 3, 2009, in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, Family Court, Juvenile Division, with a total of four counts of delinquency for assaulting DYS employees, fifth-degree felonies if committed by an adult (case Nos. 2008 JCR 03660 and 2009 JCR 00532). Id. at \u00b6 2. On March 5, 2009, C.E. admitted each count of delinquency, and the Stark County Family Court waived costs, ordered that C.E. be released to the custody of DYS, and certified the disposition of both cases to the Paulding County Juvenile Court, C.E.\u2019s county of residence. Id. at \u00b6 3. In addition to the foregoing, the magistrate\u2019s decisions included the following language under a portion of the decision entitled, \u201cDispositional Summary\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">You are hereby ordered by the court to comply with the following orders:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">2. You are now subject to Community Control by the Family Court subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">* Cooperate with the process necessary to provide a genetic DNA sample. Id. The magistrate\u2019s decisions were approved and adopted by the judge on March 9,2009. Id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 20} The cases were then certified to the Paulding County Juvenile Court, where they were consolidated into one case (case No. 20092020) and scheduled for a June 29, 2009 dispositional hearing. Id. at \u00b6 4. The court ordered that C.E. be committed to DYS on each count for a minimum period of six months to a maximum period not to exceed his attaining age 21 and further ordered that these periods of commitment run consecutively to one another for an aggregate minimum of two years to a maximum period not to exceed his attaining age 21. The court also ordered that C.E. be held in detention for 90 days. However, the court suspended both the commitments to DYS and the 90-day detention and placed C.E. on community control. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 21} On September 8, 2009, a motion to revoke C.E.\u2019s community control was filed, alleging that C.E. had violated the terms of his community control because he slashed the tires of a vehicle belonging to another person, which constituted a violation of the law. Id. at \u00b6 5. A hearing was held on this motion on September 15, 2009, wherein C.E. admitted violating the terms of his community control. Id. The court then revoked C.E.\u2019s community control and ordered that he be committed to DYS on two of his counts of delinquency for a minimum period of six months to a maximum until age 21 on each count and that these periods of commitment run consecutively to one another for an aggregate minimum of one year to a maximum period not to exceed his attaining age 21. Id. Thereafter C.E. filed a notice of appeal with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>{\u00b6 22} On appeal, C.E. argued that the trial court had erred by imposing a second disposition in the case, because the Stark County Family Court had already imposed a disposition of community control. Id. at \u00b6 7. C.E. further argued that nothing remained for the Stark County Family Court to certify to Paulding County, because it had already entered its disposition. Id. This court agreed with C.E. that the Stark County Family Court had entered a final disposition of community control, which is one of the dispositional orders that a court may make under R.C. 2152.19, and therefore Paulding County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, was without authority to issue a second disposition in the case. Id. at \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 23} The magistrate in this case, however, did not make a dispositional order under R.C. 2152.19, as the magistrate in <em>In re C.E. </em>had done. The magistrate sub judice simply ordered that R.J. \u201c[ajppear in and comply with the orders of the Allen County Juvenile Court.\u201d R.J. argues that this was an order that he abide by the terms set in Allen County that were previously imposed in his old case, the cause of his detention in Stark County. We do not read the magistrate\u2019s order that way; rather, we interpret this order to be an interim order to effectuate the transfer of disposition. Notably, unlike the community control imposed in <em>In re C.E., </em>R.C. 2152.19 does not provide for the type of order made by the magistrate herein as a dispositional order. Therefore, we find the facts of this case distinguishable from <em>In re C.E., </em>because the trial court did not make an order of disposition pursuant to R.C. 2152.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 24} R.J. further argues that the Stark County trial court judge intended to make an order of disposition, because the trial court\u2019s entry indicated that the judgment was a final, appealable order, and a final, appealable order in a delinquency case requires a disposition. The trial court\u2019s subjective \u201cintention\u201d or mere designation of \u201cfinal, appealable order\u201d is irrelevant, though, in determining whether, in fact, an order is final. <em>Summit Petroleum, Inc. v. K.S.T. Oil &amp; Gas Co., Inc. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 468, 470, 590 N.E.2d 1337 (\u201cA trial court cannot transform that which is not, by its nature, a final appealable order, into the same by mere appellation\u201d). This argument is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 25} Finally, R.J. argues that the Stark County magistrate\u2019s decision to waive court costs is a further indication that the magistrate entered a disposition. This argument lacks merit as well. The fact that the magistrate waived court costs indicates just the opposite \u2014 that the magistrate was not rendering disposition and was transferring disposition to Allen County \u2014 because the Stark County magistrate could have required R.J. to pay costs as a disposition \u201cin addition to any other disposition authorized or required by [R.C. Chapter 2152].\u201d R.C. 2152.20(A)(2). In fact, the Allen County Juvenile Court did impose costs as part of its disposition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Because the Stark County Juvenile Court did not issue a dispositional order in this case, R.J. was not twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense, and the Allen County Juvenile Court had the authority to impose disposition. We further note that the application of double-jeopardy protection would be inappropriate in this case, because R.J. did not have a legitimate expectation of finality in the Stark County Juvenile Court\u2019s judgment. <em>In re C.B., </em>2010-Ohio-2129, 2010 WL 1932039, at \u00b6 33, quoting <em>In re Burt, </em>2007-Ohio-4034, 2007 WL 2269363, at \u00b6 61, citing <em>Kelly </em>and <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328. R.J. was told at the adjudicatory hearing and in the magistrate\u2019s decision that the case was being transferred to Allen County, and this was not R.J.\u2019s first encounter with the juvenile court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 27} For all these reasons, R.J.\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. Ill</p>\n<p id=\"As\">[R.J.] was denied due process of law, a right assured to him by both the Ohio Constitution and the United States Constitution, when he was denied an opportunity to be heard on his objections to magistrate\u2019s decision and when two courts exercised simultaneous jurisdiction over the same controversy on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">{\u00b6 28} In his third assignment of error, R.J. argues that he was denied due process of law when the Stark County Family Court did not provide a hearing on his objections. R.J. argues that the Stark County Family Court improperly and incorrectly ruled that R.J. and his parents were present for the scheduled hearing (which R.J. claims is not true, since they were in Allen County for a scheduled hearing) and that the objections were withdrawn (which he also claims is not true). R.J. further argues that the Allen County Juvenile Court violated his due process rights by failing to rule upon the objections that were properly filed in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 29} The procedural history in this case is important. As noted above, the magistrate issued her decision on June 29, 2010, and the trial court adopted and approved this decision just one day later, noting that \u201c[t]he parties having no objection timely filed herein; this Decision is to have immediate effect.\u201d \u201cThe court may enter a judgment * * * during the fourteen days permitted by Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)\u00ae for the filing of objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision * * * \u201d; however, \u201cthe timely filing of objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision * * * operatefs] as an automatic stay of execution of the judgment until the court disposes of those objections and vacates, modifies, or adheres to the judgment previously entered.\u201d Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(e)\u00ae. Accordingly, R.J.\u2019s objections, filed July 14, 2010, in Stark County, stayed the trial court\u2019s June 30, 2010 judgment, ordering that disposition be transferred to Allen County, until the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>ruled upon the objections. Id. On August 30, 2010, the objections were withdrawn, rendering the trial court\u2019s June 30, 2010 judgment final; therefore, jurisdiction of the case was immediately vested in the Allen County Juvenile Court on August 30, 2010. <em>In re Talbert, </em>5th Dist. No. CT2008-0031, 2009-Ohio-4237, 2009 WL 2580097, \u00b6 20 (trial court\u2019s order was stayed under Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(e)(i) as a result of timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision being filed; and therefore, trial court\u2019s order could not become a final, appealable order until the trial court explicitly disposed of the objections); <em>In re N.C., </em>2d Dist. No. 09CA0023, 2009-Ohio-4603, 2009 WL 2855869, \u00b6 16 (same); <em>In re M.H., </em>9th Dist. No. 08CA0040, 2009-Ohio-669, 2009 WL 372043, \u00b6 8-10 (same). Therefore, the Allen County Juvenile Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the case on August 30, 2010, for purposes of its dispositional hearing. Because R.J. had withdrawn his objections, no objections remained for the Allen County Juvenile Court to rule upon. The only remaining issue for the Allen County Juvenile Court was disposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 30} Notwithstanding the record, R.J. argues that the Stark County Juvenile Court did not provide him with a hearing on his objections. R.J. also argues that the Stark County Juvenile Court\u2019s judgment entry inaccurately reflects that his parents and he were present at the hearing, when they were not, and the judgment entry inaccurately reflects that the objections were withdrawn, when they actually were overruled. For purposes of a direct appeal, however, this court is limited to reviewing the record provided under App.R. 9. App.R. 12(A)(1)(b). The record in this case demonstrates that a hearing was held on R.J.\u2019s objections, and the objections were withdrawn. Furthermore, we must presume regularity of the proceedings and that the trial court\u2019s judgment entries accurately reflect what occurred at the hearing since no transcript of the hearing was filed. <em>In re S.L., </em>3d Dist. Nos. 4-10-09 and 4-10-10, 2010-Ohio-6380, 2010 WL 5541119, \u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 31} Because the record fails to demonstrate error, we overrule R.J.\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Stark County erred in adjudicating [R.J.] a delinquent child, as the state did not meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">{\u00b6 32} In his second assignment of error, R.J. argues that the trial court\u2019s adjudication of delinquency was not supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>{\u00b6 33} As an initial matter, we note that R.J. failed to object to the magistrate\u2019s decision, since he withdrew his objections; therefore, he has waived all but plain error with respect to his sufficiency argument. Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)(iv). That being said, a conviction based upon insufficient evidence almost always results in plain error because it constitutes a denial of due process of law. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>170 Ohio App.3d 418, 2007-Ohio-1186, 867 N.E.2d 493, \u00b6 13, citing <em>State v. Coe, </em>153 Ohio App.3d 44, 2003-Ohio-2732, 790 N.E.2d 1222, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cAn appellate court\u2019s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, superseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds in <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668. Accordingly, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 35} R.J. was adjudicated a delinquent child for harassment by an inmate in violation of R.C. 2921.38(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">No person who is confined in a detention facility, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten, or alarm another person, shall cause or attempt to cause the other person to come into contact with blood, semen, urine, feces, or another bodily substance by throwing the bodily substance at the other person, by expelling the bodily substance upon the other person, or in any other manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU\">Emily Harding testified that on January 19, 2010, she was employed as a juvenile correctional officer at the Indian River facility in Massillon, Stark County, Ohio.

Harding further testified that she felt \u201charassed and taken advantage of\u2019 by R.J.\u2019s actions. Upon cross-examination, Harding testified that she was not facing R.J. when she was hit with the liquid and that the liquid had hit her on her right side. She further testified that another juvenile was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the cell with R.J. at the time, but she did not remember the identity of that juvenile. Harding testified that she had asked both juveniles who had done it and that R.J. had said, \u201cI did it bitch.\u201d Harding could not recall whether or not she had been spit upon that same night.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 36} Trooper Thomas W. Lemmon testified that he is assigned to investigate incidents that occur inside the Indian River facility and that he had discussed the incident with R.J. Trooper Lemmon testified that R.J. had told him that the liquid was water and that his roommate had thrown the water. Trooper Lemmon testified that he had not believed R.J., had not had any further discussions with R.J., and thereafter had submitted his report to the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 37} R.J. testified that his roommate at the facility that night was Deangelo Smith. R.J. testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">[The night of the incident] was [Smith\u2019s] last night and me and him were both clowning[.] * * * [T]he whole unit was clowning like every night doing other stuff. [Mrs. Harding] was * * * doing her door log for seclusion and we was having fun. [Smith] was in the room splashing with me like with * * * we\u2019re from the same City * * * he is from Lima and I am from Lima. He was splashing me * * * I\u2019m gonna miss you man and all that stuff. I guess it went through the crack cause I was kind of curled up * * * I guess some got through the crack of the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">R.J. testified that Smith had been splashing him with water from the water bottle they had in their room. R.J. testified that Smith and he had played around all the time. R.J. testified that after Harding was splashed, she \u201csaid oh my God you nasty mother fucker two nasty mother fuckers she was talking about both of us and she walked away. And then later on that night I then got a [write] up saying that I threw piss on a staff.\u201d R.J. testified that he had not been removed from his room and that he had stayed with Smith until the next morning, when Smith went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">{\u00b6 38} Thereafter, the trial court found R.J. delinquent based upon his violation of R.C. 2921.38(A). Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence presented demonstrated that R.J. threw urine upon Harding while he was confined in a detention facility with the purpose to harass, annoy, threaten, or alarm Harding. Harding testified that she knew the liquid R.J. threw on her was urine from its smell. R.J.\u2019s intent to act with the aforementioned purposes may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the event, particularly R.J.\u2019s response to Harding\u2019s accusation: \u201cI did it bitch.\u201d It can further be inferred that Harding was in fact alarmed by R.J.\u2019s act in light of her initial vulgar response, as previously mentioned. Harding testified that she felt \u201charassed and taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>advantage of\u2019 by R.J.\u2019s actions. Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court\u2019s delinquency finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 89} R.J.\u2019s second assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. IV</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">[R.J.] was denied the effective assistance of counsel when Stark County appointed counsel did not object to a custodial interrogation of her client and filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision in the Stark County Family Court after certification of the case to Allen County and/or withdrew the objections; alternatively, the certification of the case by the Stark County Juvenile Court was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">{\u00b6 40} In his fourth assignment of error, R.J. argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress statements he made to Harding without first being Mirandized. Next, R.J. argues that trial counsel was ineffective for filing objections in Stark County if those objections should have been filed in Allen County. Alternatively, R.J. argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for withdrawing the objections in Stark County if properly filed therein. Finally, R.J. argues that Stark County\u2019s certification to Allen County was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">{\u00b6 41} A defendant asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must establish that (1) the counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or unreasonable under the circumstances and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>State v. Kole </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 303, 306, 750 N.E.2d 148, citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Prejudice results when \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373, citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>at 142, 538 N.E.2d 373; <em>Strickland </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">{\u00b6 42} The \u201cfailure to file a suppression motion does not constitute <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 365, 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305, cited in <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 721 N.E.2d 52. To constitute ineffective assistance, there must also be a reasonable probability that the motion would have been successful. <em>State v. Pierce, </em>3d Dist. No. 11-09-05, 2010-Ohio-478, 2010 WL 530088, \u00b6 34, citing <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 428, 433, 670 N.E.2d 1077, and <em>State v. Ligon </em>(June 18, 2001), 3d Dist. No. 4-2000-25, 2001 WL 676377.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">{\u00b6 43} R.J. first argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress statements he had made to Harding while in custody when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>he had not been Mirandized. This argument lacks merit. <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not necessary here because Harding was conducting an on-the-scene investigation of a crime that R.J. was suspected of committing while in the detention facility, <em>and </em>\u201cthe circumstances of the interrogation [did not] create a change in [R.J.\u2019s] surroundings * * * that resulted] in an added imposition on [R.J.\u2019s] freedom of movement.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State v. Porter, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 304, 2008-Ohio-4627, 897 N.E.2d 1149, \u00b6 16. The record demonstrates that in response to getting splashed with urine, Harding stated, \u201cWho did it?\u201d and R.J. stated, \u201cI did it bitch.\u201d At the time of Harding\u2019s question, she did not know whether R.J. or his roommate had thrown the urine. Furthermore, R.J. and his roommate were both still inside their same room, with no further restraint upon their freedom. Because <em>Miranda </em>warnings were unnecessary prior to Harding\u2019s on-the-scene questioning of the juveniles, trial counsel was not ineffective for not filing a motion to suppress R.J.\u2019s statement to Harding based upon the lack of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, as R.J. argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 44} Next, R.J. argues that trial counsel was ineffective for filing objections in Stark County if the objections should have been filed in Allen County. We find no error in trial counsel\u2019s filing objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision in Stark County. As we noted above, trial counsel\u2019s filing of timely objections in Stark County stayed the Stark County Juvenile Court\u2019s judgment transferring the case to Allen County until the trial court ruled upon the objections. Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(e)(i). Furthermore, Stark County was the proper forum for filing the objections because the magistrate served in that county under the authority of the Stark County Juvenile Court. Furthermore, R.J. raised a sufficiency-of-the-evidence objection, and therefore, nothing would have remained to transfer to Allen County had the trial court agreed with R.J. and sustained the objection. Under these circumstances, we do not find that trial counsel was ineffective for filing the objections in Stark County.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b645} Alternatively, R.J. argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for withdrawing the objections in Stark County if they had been properly filed therein. We disagree. Even assuming that trial counsel was deficient for withdrawing the objections \u2014 which we cannot definitely conclude, since no transcript of the proceedings was filed for appeal purposes \u2014 we cannot conclude that R.J. was prejudiced by this decision. Because we have already concluded that the state presented sufficient evidence to establish R.J.\u2019s delinquency, we are not persuaded that the trial court would have sustained the objections had they not been withdrawn, or, in other words, that the result of the proceeding would have been different. Therefore, we cannot find that R.J. was denied effective assistance of counsel on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>{\u00b6 46} In the final sentence of his brief, R.J. argues that Stark County\u2019s certification to Allen County was improper. As we already mentioned, the juvenile court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate\u2019s decision without waiting for Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)(i)\u2019s 14-day objection period may have been ill-advised; nevertheless, the trial court was within its authority under R.C. 2151.271 and Juv.R. 11 to transfer the case to Allen County following adjudication. Therefore, this argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">{\u00b6 47} For all the aforementioned reasons, R.J.\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 48} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-7\">Shaw and Willamowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\">. We note that the procedural complications that arose in this case could have been avoided had the Stark County Juvenile Court simply waited 14 days before approving and adopting the magistrate's decision to allow for timely objections pursuant to Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
