The charges arose from allegations that appellant stole $10 from Darren Davis during the early morning hours of November 4, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">{\u00b6 2} On March 10 and 11, 2010, appellant was tried by a jury. Darren Davis, the state\u2019s key witness, testified that while he was taking trash into an alley behind his home, a man approached Davis from behind, placed his forearm around Davis\u2019s neck, and pulled him close. Davis testified that he then felt a \u201cpointy object\u201d in his lower back and that the man stated, \u201cDon\u2019t move or else I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d While restraining Davis, the man reached into Davis\u2019s pocket and removed a $10 bill. At that time, the man told Davis not to look back, or else he would be shot. As a result of this encounter, Davis called the Middletown Police Department to report an armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Officers Tim Meehan and Justin Camper were the first to respond to Davis\u2019s report. Camper testified that Davis appeared \u201cextremely shaken up\u201d and was hesitant to come outside until he realized that Camper was a police officer. Meehan, a tracking-dog handler, began tracking the suspect\u2019s scent from the alley where the alleged robbery had occurred. At trial, Meehan explained that his canine immediately picked up a fresh scent in the alley and led him directly to appellant, who had already been apprehended by another responding police officer. Subsequently, the officers brought Davis to appellant\u2019s location, where Davis positively identified appellant as the man who had robbed him. As a result, the officers arrested appellant, searched him, and discovered a $10 bill in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 4} During trial, appellant testified on his own behalf and denied having a gun or robbing Davis. Instead, appellant explained that he was walking in the neighborhood when Davis approached appellant in his vehicle. Appellant testified that he had entered Davis\u2019s vehicle, at which time Davis inquired where he could obtain crack cocaine in the area. After telling Davis that he could obtain the drugs, Davis gave appellant $10 and stated that if the \u201cdope was good, * * * he\u2019d spend more money.\u201d Upon exiting Davis\u2019s vehicle, appellant proceeded to a nearby house to purchase the drugs. Appellant testified that when he exited the house 15 to 25 minutes later, he was apprehended by police for reasons unknown to him at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 5} At the close of all evidence, the trial court instructed the jury regarding the elements of robbery. However, while appellant was indicted for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), the trial court instructed the jury regarding the elements of robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), a third-degree felony not listed in the indictment. Following deliberations, the jury returned a verdict form stating: \u201cWe, the jury, being duly impaneled, find the defendant * * * guilty of robbery, a felony of the <em>second </em>degree, as charged in count one of the indictment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As a result, appellant was sentenced to serve five years in prison and three years of mandatory postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant now appeals his conviction and sentence, raising three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 7} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court committed plain error under Criminal Rule 52(B) in providing an improper jury instruction for a lesser felony level than defendant/appellant had been indicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 9} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), a third-degree felony, when appellant was indicted for robbery under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>2911.02(A)(2), a second-degree felony. The difference between the two subsections is that under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), appellant must have either threatened to inflict, attempted to inflict, or actually inflicted physical harm on the victim, whereas, under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), appellant must only have used or threatened the immediate use of force against the victim. See <em>State v. Keeling, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-010610, 2002-Ohio-3299, 2002 WL 1393615, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 10} The record indicates that upon reviewing the evidence, the trial court found insufficient evidence to support a conviction under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), but sufficient evidence of the lesser included charge under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) to submit the case to the jury on the lesser included offense. Accordingly, the trial court properly instructed the jury to reflect a change in appellant\u2019s charge from R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) to the lesser included offense under subsection (A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 11} Moreover, the record reveals that the parties understood the trial court\u2019s decision to proceed under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) rather than subsection (A)(2). This understanding was first implicitly reflected when the parties accepted, without objection, the court\u2019s proposed jury instructions that included only the elements of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3). This understanding was further reflected during closing arguments, when, without objection from the defense, the state argued the elements of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c[THE STATE]: the evidence also shows that while committing the offense of theft or attempting to commit the offense of theft, the defendant used and threatened the immediate use of force against [Davis.] The defendant used force when he grabbed [Davis] and held him. The defendant used force while he reached into [Davis\u2019s] pocket and took his money. The defendant threatened the immediate use of force while doing this. Give me your money or I will shoot you. [Davis] told us he believed it. [Davis] told us there was something stuck in my back, accompanied by these words. I\u2019ll shoot you. It doesn\u2019t matter if a gun wasn\u2019t found. What matters is Mr. Davis believed that threat that [the defendant] gave to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 13} Under these circumstances, the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the elements of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), as follows: \u201cBefore you can find the Defendant guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that * * * while committing or attempting to commit a theft offense, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, <em>did use or threaten the immediate use of force </em>against Darren Davis. * * * <em>Force </em>means any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 14} If any doubt remained as to the specific charges appellant faced, it was eliminated during a bench conference following the jury instructions, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>court denied defense counsel\u2019s request to instruct the jury on the offense of petty theft by threat. In so holding, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE COURT: Well * * * the State of Ohio\u2019s position is this is a threat <em>by immediate use of force.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[THE STATE]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTHE COURT: Is that [the State\u2019s] position?</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[THE STATE]: Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 19} In sum, the record reveals a collective understanding of the trial court\u2019s decision to acquit appellant of second-degree robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) and to proceed under subsection (A)(3) as a lesser included offense. Because we find that robbery through the use or threatened use of immediate force under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) is a lesser included offense of robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), we are in no position to interfere with the court\u2019s decision on these grounds. See <em>State v. Watson, </em>154 Ohio App.3d 150, 2003-Ohio-4664, 796 N.E.2d 578; <em>State v. Scott, </em>Butler App. No. CA2008-06-149, 2009-Ohio-1450, 2009 WL 806759, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cAn offense may be a lesser included offense of another if (i) the offense carries a lesser penalty than the other; (ii) the greater offense cannot, as statutorily defined, ever be committed without the lesser offense, as statutorily defined, also being committed; and (iii) some element of the greater offense is not required to prove the commission of the lesser offense.\u201d <em>State v. Deem </em>(1988) 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b6 21} As previously discussed, a violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) is a second-degree felony, carrying with it a greater penalty than a violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), a third-degree felony. See <em>Watson, </em>154 Ohio App.3d 150, 2003-Ohio-4664, 796 N.E.2d 578, at \u00b6 11. Pursuant to the facts of this case, we further find that R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) cannot have been committed without also committing the offense in R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), when appellant placed Davis in a chokehold, held him in that position and pulled him back, implicating an attempt to inflict physical harm. Id. at \u00b6 20. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s jury instructions were a proper reflection of appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 acquittal and the subsequent change in appellant\u2019s charge. See R.C. 2945.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">{\u00b6 22} Despite the updated charge and resulting jury instructions, the trial court filed an entry the following week that sentenced appellant for \u201ca violation of Revised Code Section 2911.02(A)(2) a second degree felony.\u201d However, when the trial court submitted to the jury the lesser included offense under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), a third-degree felony, and the jury rendered its verdict based upon the instructions it received, it is clear that the court mistakenly sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>appellant for a second-degree felony. Because the evidence is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), it is necessary to remand this cause for resentencing in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained to the extent indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 24} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe trial court erred in refusing defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction for the lesser-included offense of theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 26} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of petty theft by threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cEven though an offense may be a lesser included offense, a charge on the lesser offense is required \u2018only where the evidence presented at trial would reasonably support both an acquittal of the crime charged and a conviction upon the lesser included offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 192, quoting <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cThe trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant when deciding whether to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense.\u201d <em>Trimble </em>at \u00b6 192. Moreover, an instruction on the lesser included offense is not warranted every time \u201csome evidence\u201d is presented to support the lesser offense. Id.; <em>State v. Shane </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 630, 632, 590 N.E.2d 272. Instead, a court must find \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to \u201c \u2018allow a jury to <em>reasonably </em>reject the greater offense and find the defendant guilty on a lesser included (or inferior degree) offense.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Trimble </em>at \u00b6 192, quoting <em>Shane </em>at 632-633.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 2913.02(A)(4), which proscribes theft by threat, states: \u201cNo person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or services * * * [b]y threat.\u201d As previously discussed, appellant was indicted for robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), but the jury was instructed on elements relating to robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">{\u00b6 29} The state does not contest that theft by threat is a lesser included offense of robbery. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 91, 95, 6 OBR 131, 451 N.E.2d 772. \u201cThe difference between theft by threat and robbery is the relative graveness of the threat.\u201d <em>State v. Gloss, </em>Stark App. No.2009 CA 00213, 2010-Ohio-4059, 2010 WL 3377784, \u00b6 47. The threat associated with theft by threat is of a lesser nature than the threat associated with robbery, and consists only of the threat of \u201cdisagreeable consequences.\u201d Id.; <em>Davis </em>at 95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 30} As previously discussed, there was testimony that appellant placed Davis in a chokehold and threatened to shoot him, which led Davis to believe that appellant had a gun. That testimony dealt solely with inflicting physical harm or the use of immediate force. There was no evidence of any other type of threat. Based upon the evidence presented, no reasonable jury could have both rejected a finding of guilty on the charged crime and returned a verdict of guilty on the lesser included offense of theft by threat. See <em>Shane, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 633, 590 N.E.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 31} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 32} Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cAppellant was denied effective assistance of counsel in violtion [sic] of Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 34} In his third assignment of error, appellant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during various stages of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">{\u00b6 35} To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must show that his trial attorney\u2019s performance was both deficient and prejudicial. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142, 538 N.E.2d 373, certiorari denied (1990), 497 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 768. Appellant must first show that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Second, appellant must show \u201cthere exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>at 143. Appellant bears the burden of establishing both prongs before a reviewing court will deem trial counsel\u2019s performance ineffective. <em>Strickland </em>at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 36} For the reasons previously given in finding error in appellant\u2019s sentence, we are also compelled to find error under the more lenient standard applicable to determining whether appellant received effective assistance of trial counsel. Clearly, counsel\u2019s failure to object to appellant\u2019s sentence pursuant to R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), rather than subsection (A)(3), was not the result of any defensible tactical choice. As a result, counsel failed to perform at the level necessary to afford effective assistance during all critical stages of the proceedings. <em>Gardner v. Florida </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (\u201csentencing is a critical stage of the criminal proceeding at which [the defendant] is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">{\u00b6 37} Having reviewed the record, we find no prejudice to appellant in his remaining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>{\u00b6 88} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained to the extent indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">{\u00b6 39} Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b442-6\">Powell, P.J., and Bressler, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
