Although the victim was apprehensive about engaging in sexual conduct, Parker used promises of commitment to overcome her reluctance. Parker was well aware of the wrongfulness of his conduct, telling the victim: \u201cBy the way, you know I can go to prison if we have sex. But damn, it would be worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">{\u00b6 6} On January 1 and 9, 2010, Parker met the victim in the parking lot of the Upper Valley Mall in Springfield, and from there Parker drove the victim to a motel in Dayton, where on both occasions Parker inserted his finger in the victim\u2019s vagina and performed cunnilingus on her. The victim firmly believed that she and Parker were in love and would eventually be together, even if he went to prison. When police interviewed Parker on January 11, 2010, Parker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>immediately confessed to engaging in sexual conduct with the victim on two separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">{\u00b6 7} Parker was indicted on four counts of sexual battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(7). Parker surrendered his Ohio teaching license and terminated all contact with the victim. Parker entered guilty pleas to all four charges and was sentenced to consecutive prison terms totaling 15 years. The court also classified Parker a Tier III sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 8} Parker appealed to this court. He challenges his sentence on multiple grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe consecutive sentences imposed on appellant are contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 10} The requirement in R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) that the trial court make certain findings before imposing consecutive sentences was found unconstitutional and severed from that statute in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470. Parker argues that Foster\u2019s holding was effectively overruled by <em>Oregon v. Ice </em>(2009), 555 U.S. 160, 129 S.Ct. 711, 172 L.Ed.2d 517, and that the judicial-findings requirement of R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) has therefore been revived.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>State v. Hodge, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768, the Ohio Supreme Court held that <em>Oregon v. Ice </em>does not revive R.C. 2929.14(E)(4). Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. See also <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23857, 2011-Ohio-752, 2011 WL 579204.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">{\u00b6 12} Parker\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe sentence of the trial court is contrary to law because it fails to reflect any consideration of the purposes and principles of felony sentencing contained in R.C. 2929.11 or the seriousness and recidivism factors of R.C. 2929.12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court erred and abused its discretion when it imposed more-than-minimum, maximum and consecutive sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">{\u00b6 15} In his second assignment of error, Parker argues that the trial court\u2019s sentence is contrary to law because the court failed to consider the principles and purposes of felony sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12. In his third assignment of error, Parker argues that, because he is a first-time offender, the trial court abused its discretion in imposing more than minimum sentences, instead imposing maximum sentences and consecutive sentences. In other words, the trial court abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>in imposing an overly harsh 15-year aggregate sentence that is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>State v. Barker, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 414, 2009-Ohio-3511, 917 N.E.2d 324, at \u00b6 36-37, we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c \u2018The trial court has full discretion to impose any sentence within the authorized statutory range, and the court is not required to make any findings or give its reasons for imposing maximum[,] consecutive, or more than minimum sentences. <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, at paragraph 7 of the syllabus. Nevertheless, in exercising its discretion the trial court must consider the statutory policies that apply to every felony offense, including those set out in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c \u2018When reviewing felony sentences, an appellate court must first determine whether the sentencing court complied with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence, including R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, in order to find whether the sentence is contrary to law. <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124. If the sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law, the trial court\u2019s decision in imposing the term of imprisonment must be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. Id.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 19} Parker contends that the trial court failed to apply the principles and purposes of felony sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12. In <em>State v. Miller, </em>Clark App. No. 09CA28, 2010-Ohio-2138, 2010 WL 1932041, at \u00b6 43, we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cAlthough the trial court did not specifically cite either statute during the sentencing hearing, its judgment entry stated that it had \u2018considered the record, oral statements, any victim impact statement and presentence report prepared, as well as the principles and purposes of sentencing under Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.11, and [had] balanced the seriousness and recidivism factors [under] Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.12.\u2019 Because a trial court speaks only through its journal entries, Miller\u2019s sentence is not contrary to law merely because the trial court failed to cite either statute during the sentencing hearing. <em>State v. Cave, </em>Clark App. No. 09-CA-6, 2010-Ohio-1237 [2010 WL 1138931], \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018Furthermore, even if there is no specific mention of those statutes in the record, \u201cit is presumed that the trial court gave proper consideration to those statutes.\u201d \u2019 Id., quoting <em>Kalish, </em>supra, at n. 4. We note too that Miller\u2019s five-year sentence is within the statutory range for a third-degree felony. See R.C. 2929.14(A)(3). Therefore, we have no basis for concluding that the sentence is contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>{\u00b6 22} In its journalized judgment entry of conviction, the trial court indicated that it had considered the record, oral statements by counsel and defendant, the presentence investigation report, the principles and purposes of felony sentencing, R.C. 2929.11, and the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12. The court also informed Parker during sentencing about postrelease-control requirements. The court complied with the applicable rules and statutes in imposing its sentence. Furthermore, the two-, three-, and five-year sentences the trial court imposed on the various counts of sexual battery, while the maximum sentence on some counts, are all nevertheless within the authorized range of available punishments for felonies of the third degree. R.C. 2907.03(B); 2929.14(A)(3). The court ordered all of the prison terms served consecutively, for a total sentence of 15 years. We have no basis for concluding that Parker\u2019s sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. <em>Kalish. </em>The further issue is whether the sentences the court imposed are an abuse of discretion. Id. We will consider that issue together with Parker\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 23} In his third assignment of error, Parker argues that his 15-year sentence is unduly harsh and not supported by the record and therefore constitutes an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Parker points to a number of different facts and circumstances that demonstrate that his offenses are not aggravated or a more serious form of the offense concerned. Parker asserts that had he not been a teacher at the same school the victim attended, his conduct with this 16-year-old victim, while perhaps morally repugnant, would not constitute a criminal offense. Parker argues that when all of the facts and circumstances of the case are viewed in their totality, the record does not justify the 15-year sentence the trial court imposed, which was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 has been defined as an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 126, 482 N.E.2d 1248, 1252. It is to be expected that most instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision. It is not enough that the reviewing court, were it deciding the issue <em>de novo, </em>would not have found that reasoning process to be persuasive, perhaps in view of countervailing reasoning processes that would support a contrary result.\u201d <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Redevelopment </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 2929.11 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201c(A) A court that sentences an offender for a felony shall be guided by the overriding purposes of felony sentencing. The overriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the need for incapacitating the offender, deterring the offender and others from future crime, rehabilitating the offender, and making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(B) A sentence imposed for a felony shall be reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of felony sentencing set forth in division (A) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar offenders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 29} During the sentencing hearing the prosecutor told the trial court that his conversations with the victim reveal that she is in love with Parker and believes that, regardless of the sentence imposed, they will wait for each other, so that after Parker serves his sentence they can be together. The prosecutor argued that in order to protect the victim from any further emotional harm at the hands of Parker, give her closure, and allow her to recover from this and move on with her life, the court\u2019s sentence has to \u201ccrush that victim\u2019s hope.\u201d Specifically, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u2018You could give a short prison sentence in this case, and you could fuel her fantasy that they are going to be together.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA prison sentence of two to three years gives her some hope that, \u2018Hey, look I\u2019ll be eighteen, nineteen. I can be with him. We can be together. He loves me. He\u2019s going to be with me. He\u2019s told me all those things. He\u2019s going to wait for me.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cAnd she won\u2019t get the closure, the emotional closure to get on with her life. You can see a short prison sentence having negative effects on her future, healthy relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cYou can see a situation where she would be like, she wouldn\u2019t date other boys her age, not go to prom, not engage in normal teenage dating patterns because she is Parker\u2019s girl, because she\u2019s waiting for Parker and that they\u2019re going to be together.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u2018You can also see where a short prison sentence would cause her to make significant life-changing decisions based on her belief or her fantasy that they are going to be together.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cAn example would be like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to go to an out-of-state college cause I need to be close to the prison or close to Ohio so I can be with him. Hey, I\u2019m not going to do this or that in my life because I\u2019m going to be with Parker.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cThis may sound harsh but part of protecting the victim, and part of protecting the community at large, is that your sentence has to crush that victim\u2019s hope. Your sentence has to crush that fantasy that they are going to be together so she can have some closure in her life and she can move on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 37} At Parker\u2019s sentencing the trial court addressed the victim, who had written a letter to the court on behalf of Parker, reaffirming that she is in love with Parker, that she was a willing participant in this sexual activity, and that Parker did not compel her to do anything she didn\u2019t want to do. The court told the victim:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cEverything that you wrote, I truly believe that it came from your heart and that you feel the way you feel about the defendant and about the situation; but what I would hope that you understand through this, this kind of ties into what the prosecutor was saying about the emotional and psychological manipulation and harm done here is that when you\u2019re sixteen and seventeen years old\u2014 And again, I think you\u2019re very mature.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cI\u2019m not saying that you are not mature and not thinking for yourself, but when you\u2019re young and you\u2019re in high school and you see somebody that\u2019s an adult that\u2019s showing interest in you and you\u2019re looking at this adult and they are in a place where you are eventually striving to be, in other words, you\u2019re striving to become an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cYou want to have a job to be able to make money and have a car and have freedoms to do certain things, and you see this person taking an interest in you, it\u2019s only natural that you\u2019re going to be sort of taken in by that.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cBut I think as time goes by, in the next three, five, ten years, fifteen years, you\u2019re going to look back and say, you know \u2014 and this is no disrespect to the defendant; I don\u2019t mean it that way \u2014 But you\u2019re going to look back and say, \u2018This guy was really nothing special or nothing unique he just happened to be in a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c \u2018He was an adult and he was showing me attention, and I was young and I was infatuated by that.\u2019 I think as time goes by you\u2019re going to see that there was nothing really unique or special about him to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cAs tough as this is for you to hear, it seems to me that he was just saying all the things to you that you wanted to hear so that he could get what he wanted, but he didn\u2019t mean those things and that he used you and manipulated you.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>{\u00b6 45} \u201cSo with that kind of backdrop and as a perspective, the Ohio General Assembly has made these offense felonies of the third degree, which are very serious offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThere is no language in the statute or nothing mitigating in the statute that says, well, if the student is in love with the teacher, or if the student feels like the teacher didn\u2019t make her do anything she didn\u2019t want to do, then it should be less serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cNo. The whole reason for the crime is that the adult is in a position to know that he cannot manipulate a child into engaging in this kind of behavior. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a crime. Because he\u2019s an adult and he knows.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why the legislature has had to enact a criminal statute to protect these young people because they don\u2019t have the perspective to protect themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">{\u00b6 50} In imposing sentence on the four counts of sexual battery, the trial court imposed maximum five-year prison terms on two counts, a three-year term on one count, and a two-year term on the other count, and ran all of the prison terms consecutively for a total sentence of 15 years. The trial court stated its reasons as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe legislature has directed the Court to consider punishment of the offender and protection of the community and when there is a minor involved\u2014 Not that I don\u2019t take protection of the community serious in all cases \u2014 but when there is a minor involved my responsibility in that area, I believe, is heightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe prosecutor is exactly right; I don\u2019t want there to be any glimmer of hope after today that somebody is going to wait for somebody. I want there to be finality today. I want it to be over with. I want the harm to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cI don\u2019t want Mr. Parker to harm any other children, and I don\u2019t want any other teachers in this community to think that they can engage in this behavior and walk away with a light sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cI agree with the prosecutor; I think the emotional and psychological conduct here is even greater than the physical acts. While the physical acts are horrific, I do think the psychological and emotional aspect of the crime is even greater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">{\u00b6 55} We begin our analysis by emphasizing that we in no way condone or wish to minimize the seriousness of Parker\u2019s conduct in this case. To be sure, Parker\u2019s conduct constitutes a serious criminal offense. As a teacher, Parker held a position of trust and authority over his students, and he misused that position of trust and authority to gain access to a vulnerable adolescent victim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The vulnerability that adolescents and children have when taken advantage of by adults who are in a position of trust and authority over them is plainly the reason why the General Assembly saw fit to make this particular offense a serious one, a felony of the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 56} Furthermore, an examination of the instant-messaging chats between Parker and the victim, which authorities obtained when they examined Parker\u2019s computer, reveals that over a period of months Parker emotionally groomed and manipulated this victim, seducing her so she would fall in love with him and believe that someday they would be together, in order to get the victim to submit to his emotional control and prepare her for what Parker wanted to do, engage in sexual activity with her. Additionally, we note that Parker was well aware of the wrongfulness of his conduct with this victim, telling her at one point: \u201cBy the way, you know I can go to prison if we have sex. But damn, it would be worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 57} Parker\u2019s conduct reasonably supports imposition of a sentence within the upper ranges of R.C. 2929.14(A)(3), which authorizes sentences of one, two, three, four, or five years for third-degree felony offenses. However, and with that said, the principles and purposes of felony sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 nevertheless require the trial court in imposing its sentence to also consider, among other things, rehabilitating the offender. Furthermore, a sentence imposed for a felony shall be consistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar offenders. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 58} In his fourth assignment of error, Parker argues that his 15-year sentence is contrary to law because it is inconsistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar offenders. In support of that claim, Parker has included in his appellate brief statistics that demonstrate that in the only case similar to this one in Clark County in recent times, <em>State v. Mattem, </em>Clark C.P. No. 00CR554, the defendant teacher received a three-year sentence after pleading guilty to three counts of sexual battery. Parker further argues that his internet research discloses that in 30 cases similar to this one across Ohio since 2007, the average sentence length is 2.7 years, with only two cases involving sentences that exceed five years. One, an eight-year sentence, involved 16 counts of sexual battery. The other one, a nine-year sentence, involved three separate victims. Parker\u2019s point, of course, is that his 15-year sentence is grossly disproportionate to sentences imposed upon similar offenders for similar crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">{\u00b6 59} In deciding this appeal, we cannot consider Parker\u2019s statistics because they were not presented to the trial court and are not a part of the record in this appeal. <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500. Nevertheless, we are mindful that the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting the sentencing laws in Senate Bill 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>was to introduce consistency and proportionality into felony sentencing. <em>Foster </em>at \u00b6 34. Furthermore, both the Ohio Supreme Court and this court have stated that consecutive sentences should be reserved for the worst offenses and offenders. <em>State v. Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473, at \u00b6 21; <em>State v. Myers, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 584, 2005-Ohio-447, 824 N.E.2d 1023. This case simply does not involve the worst form of the offense or the worst offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 60} Parker is a 36-year-old first-time offender with no prior criminal record of any kind. This case involves two separate incidents of consensual sexual activity with but one victim, who was of the age of consent at the time these offenses took place. There was no force, violence, physical harm, use of drugs or alcohol to impair judgment, and no exploitation of any mental or physical impairment. Although the victim\u2019s stepmother claimed in her victim-impact statement that the victim suffers from emotional and psychological problems as a result of Parker\u2019s conduct, there was no evidence in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 61} We additionally note that prior to engaging in this conduct Parker had always led a law-abiding life, earning awards as an outstanding teacher. Parker is married and has two special-needs children. When questioned by police about his conduct with this victim, Parker immediately confessed to engaging in sexual activity, digital penetration and cunnilingus, with this victim on two separate occasions, and took full responsibility for his actions. Parker surrendered his teaching license and ceased further contact with this victim, making recidivism unlikely, and expressed genuine remorse for his conduct at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 62} The trial court\u2019s own statement as to its reasons for the sentence it imposed discloses that the court imposed a 15-year sentence to eliminate any hope this victim had that she might wait for Parker while he served his sentence and after his release have a future with him. That is not a proper consideration or legitimate basis for the court\u2019s lengthy sentence in view of the fact that the victim was already of the legal age of consent at the time of this offense, and Parker had surrendered his Ohio teaching license after being charged. Because Parker was no longer a teacher, any future relationship he might have with this victim would not be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 63} By sentencing this 36-year-old first-time offender to 15 years in prison, the trial court failed to reasonably consider the concept of rehabilitation. <em>State v. Culp </em>(May 25, 2001), Champaign App. No. 2000CA17, 2001 WL 561288. Compared to this 15-year sentence, we note that many types of homicide offenses carry a lesser maximum penalty and that a murder conviction would result in an indefinite sentence of only 15 years to life. Simply put, there is no justification in this record for consecutive sentences on all of the counts, resulting in a 15-year sentence that is unreasonable and an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Parker\u2019s second and third assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Fourth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cBecause the sentence imposed by the trial court is disproportionate and inconsistent, it is contrary to law and constitutes plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 65} Parker argues that because his 15-year sentence is grossly disproportionate to and inconsistent with the sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar crimes, it violates R.C. 2929.11(B) and is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 66} With respect to Parker\u2019s contention that the trial court violated R.C. 2929.11(B) by failing to impose a sentence that was consistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar offenders, we addressed that argument in <em>State v. Miller, </em>Clark App. No. 09CA28, 2010-Ohio-2138, 2010 WL 1932041.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 67} We recognized that trial courts are limited in their ability to address the consistency mandate, and appellate courts are hampered in their review of this issue, by the lack of a reliable body of data upon which they can rely. <em>State v. York, </em>Champaign App. No. 2009-CA-03, 2009-Ohio-6263, 2009 WL 4268577, \u00b6 13. Although a defendant cannot be expected to produce his or her own database to demonstrate the alleged inconsistency, the issue must at least be raised in the trial court and some evidence, however minimal, must be presented to the trial court to provide a starting point for analysis and to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">{\u00b6 68} When the consistency issue is not raised in the trial court, a defendant cannot argue on appeal that the sentence imposed by the trial court was inconsistent with those imposed on similar offenders. Id. In the <em>Miller </em>case, the defendant failed to raise the consistency issue at sentencing and did not present any evidence below about similar offenders and their sentences. As a result, he forfeited his ability to raise the issue on appeal. Id.; see also <em>State v. Cantrell, </em>Champaign App. No. 2006 CA 35, 2007-Ohio-6585, 2007 WL 4305697, \u00b6 10-14; <em>State v. Rollins, </em>supra, Champaign App. No. 08CA003, 2009-Ohio-899, 2009 WL 498908, at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">{\u00b6 69} A review of the sentencing hearing in this case reveals that Parker did not raise the consistency issue and did not present any evidence about similar offenders and their sentences. As a result, Parker has forfeited his ability to raise the consistency issue <em>on </em>direct appeal. <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">{\u00b6 70} Parker\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Fifth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cBecause the trial court\u2019s sentence imposes an unnecessary burden on government resources it is contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">{\u00b6 72} Parker relies on R.C. 2929.13(A), which provides that, except for certain offenses not involved here, and absent a mandated sentence, \u201ca court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>imposes a sentence upon an offender for a felony may impose any sanction or combination of sanctions on the offender that are provided in sections 2929.14 to 2929.18 of the Revised Code. <em>The sentence shall not impose an unnecessary burden on state or local government resources. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 73} Parker argues that the aggregate 15-year sentence the court imposed on him imposes an unnecessary burden on governmental resources. We are not required to resolve that issue, however. Having sustained Parker\u2019s second and third assignments of error, we will modify the trial court\u2019s sentence to impose concurrent instead of consecutive terms. That resolution renders this assignment of error moot, and we exercise our discretion to decline to decide the error assigned. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 74} Parker\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Sixth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cBecause the trial court improperly employed the \u2018sentencing package\u2019 doctrine, the appellant\u2019s sentence is contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 76} Parker argues that in sentencing him the trial court improperly employed the \u201csentencing package\u201d doctrine to achieve a particular overall lengthy sentence which, in effect, considers the multiple offense as one group in order to impose an omnibus sentence for the group of offenses to satisfy the purposes and principles of felony sentencing in R.C. 2929.11. The Ohio Supreme Court, however, rejected the doctrine in <em>State v. Saxon, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824. The state responds that Parker\u2019s sentencing-package argument is misplaced because that doctrine is a rule that applies only to appellate review of sentences imposed for multiple offenses and not to the trial court\u2019s actual imposition of those sentences. A review of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Saxon, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus, readily reveals that there is no merit in the state\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">{\u00b6 77} In <em>State v. Bradley, </em>Champaign App. No. 06CA31, 2008-Ohio-720, 2008 WL 466793, at \u00b6 19-32, we discussed the sentencing-package doctrine as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cBradley argues that, in addition, the trial court\u2019s rationale for imposing harsher sentences, to achieve a particular aggregate sentence, violates the prohibition against sentence-packaging announced in <em>State v. Saxon, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245 [846 N.E.2d 824]. We approved the trial court\u2019s rationale in our decision of December 7, 2007. However, on reconsideration, we agree with Bradley.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cThe defendant in <em>Saxon </em>was convicted on his negotiated pleas of guilty of two counts of gross sexual imposition, R.C. 2907.05, one a fourth degree felony and the other a felony of the third degree because of the age of the victim. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>trial court imposed a sentence of four years on each count, to be served concurrently. On appeal, the defendant challenged the sentence for the fourth degree felony. The appellate court held that the trial court erred, because the maximum sentence for a fourth degree felony is eighteen months. R.C. 2929.14(A)(4). The court of appeals then vacated the sentences imposed for both the third and fourth degree felonies and remanded the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cThe state appealed, arguing that the court of appeals erred when it also vacated the four-year sentence for the third degree felony, which the trial court is authorized by R.C. 2929.14(A)(3) to impose. The Supreme Court agreed, and held:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 81} \u201c \u20181. A sentence is the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed for each separate, individual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">{\u00b6 82} \u201c <em>\u20182. </em>The sentencing-package doctrine has no applicability to Ohio sentencing laws: the sentencing court may not employ the doctrine when sentencing a defendant and appellate courts may not utilize the doctrine when reviewing a sentence or sentences. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 83} \u201c \u20183. An appellate court may modify, remand, or vacate only a sentence for an offense that is appealed by the defendant and may not modify, remand, or vacate the entire multiple-offense sentence based upon an appealed error in the sentence for a single offense.\u2019 Id., Syllabus by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cWriting for the court in <em>Saxon, </em>Justice O\u2019Connor explained that the \u2018sentencing package\u2019 doctrine is employed in federal courts and is a product of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which require federal courts to consider the sanctions imposed on multiple offenses as the components of a single, comprehensive sentencing plan. Therefore, \u2018an error within the sentencing package as a whole, even if only on one of multiple offenses, may require modification or vacation of the entire sentencing package due to the interdependency of the sentences for each offense.\u2019 Id., at \u00b6 6. For that purpose, a federal appellate court has the authority to vacate all sentences, even if only one is reversed on appeal. Id., citing \u00a7 2106, Title 28, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cIn contrast, and with respect to the particular error the court of appeals in <em>Saxon </em>committed, R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) authorizes Ohio\u2019s courts of appeals to \u2018increase, reduce, or otherwise modify <em>a </em>[felony] sentence that is appealed under this section,\u2019 or to \u2018vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing\u2019 if the sentence is contrary to law. Limiting the court\u2019s authority in that respect to the particular sentence tainted by error corresponds to R.C. 2929.14(A)(l)-(5), which sets out the range of available terms \u2018(f)or <em>a </em>felony\u2019 of each degree concerned. \u2018The statute makes no provision for grouping offenses together and imposing a single, \u201clump\u201d sentence for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>multiple felonies.\u2019 <em>Saxon, </em>\u00b6 8. (Emphasis supplied). The <em>Saxon </em>court further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">{\u00b6 86} \u201c \u2018Although imposition of concurrent sentences in Ohio may appear to involve a \u201clump\u201d sentence approach, the opposite is actually true. Instead of considering multiple offenses as a whole and imposing one, overarching sentence to encompass the entirety of the offenses as in the federal sentencing regime, a judge sentencing a defendant pursuant to Ohio law must consider each offense individually and impose a separate sentence for each offense. See R.C. 2929.11 through 2929.19. Only after the judge has imposed a separate prison term for each offense may the judge then consider in his discretion whether the offender should serve those terms concurrently or consecutively. See <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, paragraph seven of the syllabus, \u00b6 100, 102, 105; R.C. 2929.12(A); <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, paragraph three of the syllabus. Under the Ohio sentencing statutes, the judge lacks the authority to consider the offenses as a group and to impose only an omnibus sentence for the group of offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 87} \u201c \u2018This court has never adopted the sentencing-package doctrine, and we decline to do so now. The sentencing-package doctrine has no applicability to Ohio sentencing laws: <em>the sentencing court may not employ the doctrine when sentencing a defendant, and appellate courts may not utilize the doctrine when reviewing a sentence or sentences. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)\u2019 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 88} \u201c \u2018Because the sentencing judge must consider each individual offense, the logical conclusion is that a \u201csentence\u201d is the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed for each offense. Adopting the sentencing-package doctrine ignores the critical differences between the Ohio and federal sentencing schemes and implies that sentencing judges must disregard the law and focus on the entire array of offenses when imposing sentence. Ohio law has no mechanism for such an approach. Because Ohio does not \u201cbundle\u201d sentences, nothing is \u201cunbundled\u201d when one of several sentences is reversed on appeal.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cJustice O\u2019Connor further pointed out that R.C. 2929.01(F)(F) defines a sentence as \u2018the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense,\u2019 and that the \u2018combination\u2019 to which that section refers are those sanctions imposed on a single offense, such as a fine and incarceration. Justice Pfeifer filed a dissenting opinion, and viewed R.C. 2929.01(F)(F) as defining a sentence to mean the entire combination of sanctions imposed on an offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 90} Parker argues that the trial court\u2019s own statements at sentencing demonstrate that it employed the sentencing-package doctrine, that is, the court considered Parker\u2019s multiple offenses as a single group in order to impose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>particular overall and more lengthy sentence for the group of offenses in order to achieve a particular purpose. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 91} At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor told the trial court that he had talked to the victim and that she had said that she is in love with Parker and believes that, regardless of the sentence imposed, they will each wait for each other so that when the sentence is completed they can be together. The prosecutor argued that in order to protect this victim from further emotional harm, give her closure, and allow her to recover and move on with her life, the court\u2019s sentence \u201chas to crush that fantasy that they are going to be together.\u201d The prosecutor also stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cPd ask you to look at his actions as a whole, the emotional damage that he\u2019s done, and I\u2019d ask you to pass a sentence that protects the victim, that protects his family, protects the community and punishes him for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 93} In imposing its sentence in this case, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cThe prosecutor is exactly right; I don\u2019t want there to be any glimmer of hope after today that somebody is going to wait for somebody. I want there to be finality today. I want it to be over with. I want the harm to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cI don\u2019t want Mr. Parker to harm any other children, and I don\u2019t want any other teachers in this community to think that they can engage in this behavior and walk away with a light sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">{\u00b6 96} We agree that the trial court\u2019s own statements at sentencing demonstrate that it was motivated by a desire to achieve a particular purpose and ensure that this victim would not wait for Parker to complete his sentence so they could have a future together, and to that end the court sought to impose a particular overall and more lengthy sentence to cover the group of offenses to satisfy the purposes and principles of sentencing. In so doing, the trial court applied the sentencing-package doctrine and therefore erred. Any doubt in that regard is resolved by the fact that the court imposed three different terms for the same offenses, involving much the same conduct. The reason for doing that was to achieve the result that <em>Saxon </em>forbids.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">{\u00b6 97} Parker\u2019s sixth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Seventh Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cBecause all four counts of sexual battery are allied offenses of similar import, the trial court erred in imposing sentences, let alone consecutive sentences, on all four counts of the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">{\u00b6 99} Parker argues that the trial court erred by failing to merge all four counts of sexual battery for purposes of sentencing because they are allied offenses of similar import.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>{\u00b6 100} R.C. 2941.25 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 101} \u201c(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 102} \u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 103} In its most recent pronouncement on allied offenses, the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, held that when determining whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar import subject to merger under R.C. 2941.25, the conduct of the accused must be considered. Id. at syllabus. The Supreme Court further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cIn determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25(A), the question is whether it is possible to commit one offense <em>and </em>commit the other with the same conduct, not whether it is possible to commit one <em>without </em>committing the other. <em>[State v.] Blankenship [ </em>(1988) ], 38 Ohio St.3d [116] at 119, 526 N.E.2d 816 (Whiteside, J., concurring) (\u2018It is not necessary that both crimes are always committed by the same conduct but, rather, it is sufficient if both offenses <em>can be </em>committed by the same conduct. It is a matter of possibility, rather than certainty, that the same conduct will constitute commission of both offenses.\u2019 [Emphasis sic]). If the offenses correspond to such a degree that the conduct of the defendant constituting commission of one offense constitutes commission of the other, then the offenses are of similar import.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 105} \u201cIf the multiple offenses can be committed by the same conduct, then the court must determine whether the offenses were committed by the same conduct, i.e., \u2018a single act, committed with a single state of mind.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, at \u00b6 50 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cIf the answer to both questions is yes, then the offenses are allied offenses of similar import and will be merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cConversely, if the court determines that the commission of one offense will <em>never </em>result in the commission of the other, or if the offenses are committed separately, or if the defendant has separate animus for each offense, then, according to R.C. 2941.25(B), the offenses will not merge.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>at \u00b6 48-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>{\u00b6 108} The four counts of sexual battery in this case stem from two separate incidents. On January 1, 2010, Parker digitally penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina (count one) and performed cunnilingus on her (count two). On January 9, 2010, Parker once again digitally penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina (count three) and performed cunnilingus on her (count four).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 109} Because the same statutory offense, committed multiple times, can be committed with the same conduct, the multiple offenses that result are allied offenses of similar import for purposes of R.C. 2941.25(A). -Their merger is required unless, per R.C. 2941.25(B), the offenses were committed separately or with a separate animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 110} As it is used in R.C. 2941.25(B), \u201canimus\u201d means animus malus, or evil intent. Parker\u2019s intent when he engaged in sexual activity with the victim was his own, and perhaps the victim\u2019s, sexual gratification. Conduct to obtain either result, when prohibited by R.C. 2903.07(A), is evil or wrong. Parker\u2019s offenses were not committed with a separate animus as to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 111} Counts one and two do not merge with counts three and four because the sexual conduct involved occurred on separate dates, January 1, 2010, and January 9, 2010, and accordingly those offenses were \u201ccommitted separately.\u201d R.C. 2941.25(B); <em>Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 51. The further issue that remains is whether count one should merge with count two and count three should merge with count four. We have previously held that allied offenses involving distinct, different kinds of sexual activity each constitute a separate crime and do not require merger, even when they are committed in the course of the same encounter. <em>State v.

Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">{\u00b6 114} On each of two separate occasions, January 1 and 9, 2010, Parker engaged in two different, distinct types of sexual conduct with this victim, digital penetration of her vagina and cunnilingus. Digital penetration of the victim\u2019s vagina does not result in cunnilingus, and vice versa. Because these offenses involve different, distinct types of sexual activity, they each constitute a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>crime and their merger is not required by R.C. 2941.25. <em>Garrison; Grant; Nicholas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">{\u00b6 115} Parker\u2019s seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 116} Having sustained Parker\u2019s second assignment of error, in part, and his third and sixth assignments of error, we will exercise the discretion conferred on us by R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) to modify the trial court\u2019s judgment.
