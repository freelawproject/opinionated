At the same time it suspended him, it ordered him to submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation by a specific psychologist and placed him on involuntary paid leave pending that evaluation. Following the fitness-for-duty evaluation, the city continued him on involuntary leave, but changed it to unpaid leave, and told him he could not return to work until the psychologist released him for duty. At the conclusion of the unpaid leave, it discharged him because his leave had expired and the psychologist had not released him for duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>While Yoder was on paid leave, his collective-bargaining representative, Local 1662 of the International Association of Firefighters, filed a grievance on his behalf, challenging the suspension, the order that he submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation, and the involuntary leave. After the union filed that grievance, but before the arbitrator heard it, the city placed Yoder on unpaid leave. He reached the end of his unpaid leave and the city discharged him after the arbitrator heard the grievance, but before he issued his opinion. The union filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>a second grievance challenging the discharge. This opinion addresses the first grievance. The second grievance is addressed in an opinion in a companion case, <em>Stow Firefighters, IAFF Local 1662 v. Stow, </em>Case No. 25090, 2011-Ohio-1558, 2011 WL 1197657, which is also being filed today.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">{\u00b6 3} The arbitrator who heard the first grievance reduced Yoder\u2019s three-day suspension to one day, determined that the city had reasonable cause for ordering him to submit to the fitness-for-duty evaluation, determined that the city had acted unreasonably by placing him on paid leave pending the fitness-for-duty evaluation, determined that the fitness-for-duty evaluation itself was tainted and, therefore, void, and directed the city to reinstate him with full back pay and benefits. The union applied to the Summit County Common Pleas Court for an order confirming the arbitration award, and the city applied to that same court for an order vacating, modifying, or correcting the award. Although the city did not challenge the arbitrator\u2019s reduction of Yoder\u2019s three-day suspension to one day, it did challenge the other aspects of his opinion and award, arguing that he had exceeded his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">{\u00b6 4} The common pleas court determined that the arbitrator had not exceeded his authority or jurisdiction by addressing the order that Yoder submit to the fitness-for-duty evaluation or the city\u2019s placing him on paid leave pending that evaluation. It, therefore, affirmed the parts of the opinion and award that dealt with those matters. It further determined, however, that the fitness-for-duty evaluation itself and Yoder\u2019s unpaid leave following that evaluation were not properly before the arbitrator and vacated the parts of the opinion and award dealing with those matters, along with the order that the city reinstate Yoder with back pay and benefits. The union appealed, and the city cross-appealed. This court reverses the trial court\u2019s judgment because the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the union\u2019s grievance was arbitrable did not draw its essence from the collective-bargaining agreement and the trial court, therefore, should have vacated the entire arbitration award as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 5} The parties agree that Yoder made a sarcastic comment to a parks department employee, Neil Winnen, about some safety-town buildings that Winnen was helping to move into the fire station where Yoder was working. After someone complained of harassment, the Stow fire chief, William Kalbaugh, opened an investigation into the incident. Chief Kalbaugh talked to the park employees and the firefighters who had been present at the time of the incident. Chief Kalbaugh concluded that Yoder and two other firefighters were lying about what had happened. As a result, he suspended all three for three days. At the same time that Chief Kalbaugh informed Yoder of his three-day suspension, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>chief also notified him that he was being placed on involuntary paid leave pending the results of a fitness-for-duty evaluation to be conducted by Dr. Alfred Grzegorek. The union filed a grievance on behalf of the firefighters. Yoder\u2019s grievance proceeded separately and is the only grievance at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">{\u00b6 6} After notifying Yoder about the evaluation, the chief continued gathering collateral information from other firefighters about other alleged incidents Yoder had been involved in over the years. In preparation for the evaluation, the chief disclosed the information to Dr. Grzegorek, but refused to share it with Yoder or the union. On the first day of the arbitration hearing, the city was required to disclose the information in response to a subpoena duces tecum.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">THE ARBITRATION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 7} The union filed the grievance on Yoder\u2019s behalf, using a preprinted grievance form. On the part of the form captioned \u201cAlleged Contract Violation,\u201d it wrote: \u201cArticle XII, and all other applicable Articles of Collective Bargaining Agreement.\u201d Article XII deals with disciplinary procedure and, among other things, provides that \u201c[discipline shall be imposed only for just cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 8} On the part of the form captioned \u201cBrief Description of Violation,\u201d it wrote, in part, that Chief Kalbaugh had suspended Yoder for three days without pay \u201cstemming from a complaint filed by a City Parks Department employee against Firefighter Yoder and Chief Kalbaugh\u2019s investigation of the complaint\u201d and \u201cChief Kalbaugh has also placed Firefighter Yoder on Administrative Leave and ordered him to undergo a fitness for duty examination.\u201d In that same part, after reciting that the chief had alleged that Yoder had harassed Winnen and had been untruthful and evasive during the chiefs investigation, it asserted that the chiefs allegations \u201care without basis, and are the result of a biased, unfair investigation engineered to support the charges against Firefighter Yoder,\u201d and that \u201cFirefighter Yoder did not harass Winnen, nor was he untruthful or evasive in responding to Winnen\u2019s allegations.\u201d The union concluded the \u201cBrief Description\u201d by asserting that Yoder was \u201cdenied a fair and impartial investigation of the claims against [him].\u201d The union completed the part of the form captioned \u201cRemedy Requested\u201d by asking that Yoder\u2019s three-day suspension be rescinded, that he be compensated for any wages or benefits lost because of the suspension, that he be compensated for any wages or benefits lost \u201cas a result of being taken off shift and subjected to a fitness for duty examination by a psychologist; that all records relating to the discipline be expunged; and any other remedies deemed equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">{19} An arbitrator chosen by the city and the union conducted a four-day hearing spread over four months. He heard testimony from 16 witnesses and issued a 74-page opinion and award. In that opinion and award, he listed three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>issues. The first, he described as the stipulated issue: \u201c1. Did the Employer have just cause to discipline grievant Rod Yoder? If not, what shall be the remedy?\u201d The other two, he described as issues also presented by the evidence: \u201c2. Whether or not the City\u2019s order that the grievant submit to a psychological fitness for duty evaluation is arbitrable?\u201d and \u201c3. Whether or not the City had reasonable cause to refer the grievant for a psychological fitness for duty evaluation and its placement of the grievant on involuntary leave?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">{\u00b6 10} The arbitrator found that the city had failed to prove that Yoder had committed most of the offenses with which it had charged him. Specifically, while he was convinced that some kind of exchange took place between Yoder and the parks-department employee, he was not convinced that that exchange had amounted to harassment as charged by the city. He did find that the city had shown that Yoder had been discourteous and unprofessional, thereby violating Fire Department Rules and Regulations 600.01.01. The arbitrator further determined that the city had failed to show that Yoder was untruthful or attempted to mislead the chief in his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 11} The arbitrator noted that the city had argued that the chiefs order that Yoder submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation was not arbitrable. But he rejected that argument: \u201cThe record reveals that the section of the instant grievance entitled \u2018Brief Description of Violation\u2019 specifically mentions the placement of the grievant on administrative leave and the order that he undergo a fitness for duty evaluation. Furthermore, the grievance specifically requests that the grievant \u2018 * * * be compensated for any wages and/or benefits lost as a result of being taken off shift and subjected to a fitness for duty examination by a psychologist; * * *.\u2019 Based upon the content of the grievance language describing the alleged contractual violation by the City and the Union\u2019s requested remedy in this case, the arbitrator determines the instant grievance constitutes a challenge to the exercise of management\u2019s rights and responsibilities set forth under Article IV of the collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, the City\u2019s order that the grievant submit to a psychological fitness for duty evaluation is, in fact, arbitrable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 12} Having determined that the city\u2019s order for the fitness-for-duty evaluation was arbitrable, the arbitrator further determined that the city had a reasonable basis for giving that order: \u201cThe arbitrator finds that [Mr.] Smith\u2019s reporting of a physical altercation involving the grievant, as well as the \u2018collateral information\u2019 concerning the grievant which was collected by Chief Kalbaugh, is sufficient to find reasonable cause for the City to order the grievant to submit to a psychological fitness for duty examination.\u201d But he concluded that it was unreasonable to place Yoder on administrative leave pending that evaluation: \u201cThe arbitrator determines that it was unreasonable for the City to place the grievant on involuntary administrative leave [before the evaluation] without \u2018more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>substantial or probative evidence\u2019 giving the City a reasonable basis to place the grievant on involuntary leave, paid or unpaid. No exigent circumstances were shown to exist. Such action by the City in this case was arbitrary and capricious, and constituted an abuse of managerial discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">{\u00b6 13} Despite having determined that the city had reasonable cause for ordering the fitness-for-duty evaluation, the arbitrator found that the evaluation itself was fatally flawed. In part, he reached that conclusion based on the fact that Dr. Grzegorek\u2019s description in his report of the two written statements from other firefighters that the city had provided was inaccurate. According to the arbitrator, Dr. Grzegorek had asserted that both statements accused Yoder of \u201cphysical aggressiveness beyond shoving or pushing\u201d although, according to the arbitrator, neither did. He also reached that conclusion based upon the city\u2019s refusal to provide the union or Yoder copies of the materials it had given Dr. Grzegorek until required to do so by subpoena during the arbitration hearing: \u201cThe examiner\u2019s reliance, in part, on the \u2018collateral information\u2019 consisting of multiple levels of hearsay and for which the grievant and Union were without adequate notice and an opportunity to respond to for the examiner\u2019s benefit, undermined and severely tainted Dr. Grzegorek\u2019s psychological evaluation.\u201d The arbitrator further wrote that he found \u201cthe probative value of the grievant\u2019s fitness for duty evaluation was seriously undermined due to the fact that Dr. Grzegorek did not question the grievant during the interview process concerning any of the incidents contained in the City\u2019s collateral information.\u201d The arbitrator concluded that the city \u201cdid not have reasonable cause to place or maintain the grievant on administrative leave following the issuance of Dr. Grzegorek\u2019s report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">{\u00b6 14} In his opinion and award, the arbitrator sustained the union\u2019s grievance in part: \u201cThe grievance is sustained in part. The grievant\u2019s three-day suspension was without just cause, and the same is hereby modified to a one-day suspension without pay. The City\u2019s placement of the grievant on involuntary leave pending and subsequent to his fitness for duty examination shall be set aside as void and without effect for lack of reasonable cause, and the grievant shall be reinstated to his position with full back pay and benefits.\u201d The union applied to the Summit County Common Pleas Court for an order affirming the arbitrator\u2019s opinion and award, and the city applied to the same court for an order vacating, modifying, or correcting that opinion and award.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">THE COMMON PLEAS COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">{\u00b6 15} The city did not challenge the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the three-day suspension was without just cause or his modification of that suspension to one day. Therefore, the part of the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>addressed the incident with the parks-department employee and Yoder\u2019s subsequent suspension are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">{\u00b6 16} The city has argued that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by addressing the parts of the grievance that challenged the city\u2019s order that Yoder submit to the fitness-for-duty evaluation and the leave dispute flowing from it, by determining that the city acted unreasonably by placing Yoder on leave pending and subsequent to the fitness-for-duty evaluation, by determining that the evaluation was \u201cfatally flawed,\u201d and by determining that Yoder should be reinstated with full back pay and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 17} The common pleas court refused to vacate, modify, or correct the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the contested parts of the grievance were arbitrable under the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement. According to the court, that part of the arbitrator\u2019s order and award \u201cdrew its essence\u201d from the collective-bargaining agreement and there was a \u201crational nexus between the agreement and [that] portion of the arbitrator\u2019s findings.\u201d It also refused to vacate, modify, or correct the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the city had a reasonable basis for ordering Yoder to submit to the fitness-for-duty evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 18} The court further refused to vacate, modify, or correct the part of the arbitrator\u2019s opinion and award that determined that the city\u2019s order placing Yoder on paid leave pending the fitness-for-duty evaluation was void. It held that the arbitrator acted \u201cwithin his authority to weigh the conflicting opinions and testimony before him and to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses\u201d in determining that the city had abused its \u201cmanagerial discretion\u201d by placing him on leave pending the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, however, the court vacated the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the city acted without reasonable cause when it placed Yoder on unpaid leave following the fitness-for-duty evaluation and his direction that the city reinstate him with full back pay and benefits. According to the court, the issue of whether the fitness-for-duty evaluation was fatally flawed was not properly before the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 20} The union appealed and has assigned two errors. The city cross-appealed and has assigned two errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">ARBITRABILITY OF THE GRIEVANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">{\u00b6 21} The city\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly denied its application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award because the union\u2019s grievance is not arbitrable under the collective-bargaining agreement. The city has argued that the parts of the grievance involving the city\u2019s order that Yoder submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation and its placement of him on involuntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>leave pending that evaluation are not arbitrable under the contract because the parties did not bargain for any limitations on the city\u2019s otherwise unrestricted right to evaluate its employees\u2019 fitness for duty. It has also argued that there is no rational nexus between the arbitrator\u2019s award and the collective-bargaining agreement because the agreement says nothing about the city\u2019s right to make decisions regarding an employee\u2019s fitness for duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">{\u00b6 22} Neither party has suggested that the question of arbitrability was not a question to be decided by the arbitrator in the first instance. For purposes of this decision, therefore, this court has assumed, without deciding, that it was. Contra <em>Council of Smaller Ents. v. Gates, McDonald &amp; Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 661, 666, 687 N.E.2d 1352, quoting AT <em>&amp; T Technologies, Inc. v.

Ohio Civil Serv. Emps. Assn, Local 11 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 177, 572 N.E.2d 71, syllabus. The court in <em>Piqua </em>explained that \u201c[t]he word \u2018support\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>has many senses. Here, we understand the Supreme Court\u2019s use of the word in the sense of \u2018justify,\u2019 that the agreement must justify the arbitrator\u2019s award: the agreement must give grounds for, make legitimate, or provide justification for, the award.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26. \u201cSimilarly, the word \u2018derive\u2019 can be used in different senses. We understand the court\u2019s use of the word here to be in the sense that the award may be \u2018deduced\u2019 from the agreement, that it may be obtained by reasoning, or reasoned from the agreement.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The Arbitrator\u2019s Decision and Award</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 28} The collective-bargaining agreement at issue in this case provides that \u201c[a] grievance is a dispute between the City and the Union or an employee or group of employees, as to the interpretation, application or violation of any terms or provisions of this Agreement, excluding those terms or provisions, or any part thereof governed by ordinances, Charter or those terms or provisions, or any part thereof, under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.\u201d The agreement provides that \u201c[a]ny grievance shall be remedied\u201d through the procedure described in Article XIII. Step Four of that procedure permits the union to appeal an unfavorable decision to arbitration. The agreement also provides that \u201c[t]he decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties. The arbitrator shall not have the power to add or subtract from or modify any of the terms of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 29} Although the arbitration provision is broadly worded, only disputes regarding \u201cterms or provisions of [the] Agreement\u201d may be arbitrated. The city has argued that issues related to fitness-for-duty evaluations are not subject to the arbitration clause because such evaluations are not included in the terms or provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement. In fact, the arbitrator determined that \u201cthere is no provision contained in the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement which specifically pertains to fitness for duty evaluations or otherwise limits the City\u2019s right to conduct such evaluations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 30} Despite finding no mention of fitness-for-duty evaluations in the agreement, the arbitrator went on to determine that the grievance language \u201cconstitute[d] a challenge to the exercise of management\u2019s rights and responsibilities set forth under Article IV of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d In support of this conclusion, however, the arbitrator cited only the language of the grievance form itself rather than language of the collective-bargaining agreement. The only part of the collective-bargaining agreement the arbitrator mentioned was the language defining grievance, which requires that in order to be grievable and, therefore, arbitrable, the disputed issue must be a term or provision of the contract. The arbitrator did not point to any term or provision of the management rights and responsibilities section of the agreement that in any way affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the employer\u2019s right to conduct fitness-for-duty evaluations. Although acknowledging that the city had consistently argued that the grievance regarding the order to submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation was not arbitrable, he rejected that argument based on an analysis of the grievance language under the heading of \u201cBrief Description of Violation\u201d and the remedy requested. The arbitrator acknowledged that he \u201c[biased * * * [his decision on] the grievance language\u201d rather than on any language or requirements of the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Piqua, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 496, 2009-Ohio-6591, 924 N.E.2d 876, at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 31} As the arbitrator did not explain how his arbitrability decision is rationally supported by the collective-bargaining agreement, this court must determine whether his decision could be rationally derived from the collective-bargaining agreement in order to determine whether the trial court should have vacated the arbitrator\u2019s decision in this regard. See <em>Piqua </em>at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>Dayton v. Fraternal Order of Police, </em>2d Dist. No. 20863, 2006-Ohio-1129, 2006 WL 574307, at \u00b6 11. The question is whether the arbitrator\u2019s decision that the fitness-for-duty evaluation \u201cproperly falls under those actions of management which are covered by Article IV of the collective bargaining agreement\u201d can be rationally derived from the contract. Article IV of the agreement is entitled \u201cManagement Responsibilities.\u201d Section 4.03 provides that \u201c[t]he City hereby retains and reserves unto itself all rights, power, authority, duty and responsibility conferred on and vested in it by the laws and constitution of the State of Ohio and the Charter of the City of Stow.\u201d Section 4.04 lists certain \u201cexclusive rights and responsibilities of the City\u201d \u201c[n]ot by way of limitation,\u201d but \u201conly to indicate the type of rights retained by the City.\u201d The list includes the right and responsibility \u201c[t]o direct, supervise, evaluate, or hire and select employees.\u201d Section 4.05 of the agreement provides that \u201cthe Union agrees that all of the functions, rights, powers, responsibilities and authority of the Employer in regard to the operation of its work and business and the direction of its workforce which the Employer has not specifically abridged, deleted, granted or modified by the express and specific written provisions of this Agreement are, and shall remain, exclusively those of the Employer.\u201d The plain language of the agreement seems to indicate that the city has reserved for itself the right to evaluate its employees\u2019 fitness for duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 32} The union has not pointed to any term or provision of the collective-bargaining agreement that modifies the city\u2019s reserved right to order an employee to submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation so as to subject disputes regarding such evaluations to arbitration. The union has argued, however, that management-rights clauses are not exempt from the grievance-and-arbitration process unless there is forceful evidence that the parties agreed to exclude them. The city has argued that Supreme Court precedent supports its position that manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ment-rights clauses in collective-bargaining agreements generally operate to reiterate the statutory reservation of rights to the employer rather than subjecting those rights to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">{\u00b6 33} Under R.C. 4117.08(C)(2), a public employer retains the right to \u201cevaluate\u201d employees \u201c[u]nless [it] agrees otherwise in a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d In <em>State ex re\u00ed Bardo v. Lyndhurst </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 106, 524 N.E.2d 447, the Ohio Supreme Court explained that R.C. 4117.08(C) removes the itemized reserved powers from the scope of a collective-bargaining agreement \u201cunless the parties affirmatively address that subject in their negotiations.\u201d Id. at 113, 524 N.E.2d 447, fn. 5. The arbitrator in this case agreed with the parties that this collective-bargaining agreement did not include terms or provisions dealing with fitness-for-duty evaluations. Under <em>Bardo, </em>the city\u2019s right to evaluate its employees did not become a \u201cterm or provision\u201d of the contract, subject to arbitration, simply by being included in the listing of reserved rights in the management-responsibilities provision. Both the plain language of R.C. 4117.08(C) and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bardo </em>run directly contrary to the union\u2019s position that \u201c[i]f an employer seeks to prohibit management right terms from being subject to arbitration, it must negotiate terms into the labor agreement excluding such from arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 34} The narrow standard of judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision requires courts to overlook an arbitrator\u2019s legal errors and misinterpretations of the contract. <em>Summit Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities, </em>39 Ohio App.3d 175, 176, 530 N.E.2d 962, quoting <em>United Paperworkers, </em>484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286. In order to misinterpret the contract, however, the arbitrator must first attempt to interpret the contract and he \u201cmay not ignore the plain language of the contract.\u201d Id., quoting <em>United Paperworkers, </em>484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286. In order to avoid being vacated, an arbitrator\u2019s decision challenged under R.C. 2711.10(D) must be rationally supported by the collective-bargaining agreement or, at least, be capable of being rationally derived from it. See <em>Piqua, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 496, 2009-Ohio-6591, 924 N.E.2d 876, at \u00b6 24, citing <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 177, 572 N.E.2d 71, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">{\u00b6 35} It does not appear that the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement in this matter can \u201cgive grounds for, make legitimate, or provide justification for, the [arbitrator\u2019s] award\u201d in regard to the arbitrability of the grievance. <em>Piqua, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 496, 2009-Ohio-6591, 924 N.E.2d 876, at \u00b6 26. Furthermore, \u201cthe award may [not] be \u2018deduced\u2019 from the agreement [or] * * * obtained by reasoning, or reasoned from the agreement.\u201d Id. Having reviewed the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the collective-bargaining agreement, the arguments of the parties, and the entirety of the record in this case, this court is unable to point to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>rational nexus between the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement and the arbitrator\u2019s decision regarding the arbitrability of the Union\u2019s grievance. See id., quoting <em>Dayton v. Fraternal Order of Police, </em>2d Dist. No. 20863, 2006-Ohio-1129, 2006 WL 574307, at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, the arbitrator\u2019s award failed to draw its essence from the collective-bargaining agreement, and the arbitrator exceeded the power the agreement afforded him. See R.C. 2711.10(D). Under R.C. 2711.10(D), when an arbitrator exceeds his power, \u201cthe court of common pleas shall make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration.\u201d In this case, the statute required the trial court to grant the city\u2019s motion to vacate the part of the arbitrator\u2019s award that addressed the arbitrability of the grievance. The city\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained to the extent that it addressed the arbitrator\u2019s decision that the union\u2019s grievance was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">MERITS OF THE ARBITRATOR\u2019S DECISION REGARDING LEAVE</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 37} The second part of the city\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court should have vacated the part of the arbitrator\u2019s award that ruled that the city breached the management-rights article of the collective-bargaining agreement by placing Yoder on paid administrative leave pending the fitness-for-duty evaluation. This court has determined that the trial court should have vacated the arbitrator\u2019s decision that the city\u2019s placement of Yoder on leave pending the fitness-for-duty evaluation was arbitrable under the collective-bargaining agreement. Therefore, this part of the city\u2019s first assignment of error has been rendered moot and is overruled on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">ARBITRABILITY REVISITED</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 38} The city\u2019s second assignment of error is that the grievance is not arbitrable because R.C. 4117.10(A) requires that if the collective-bargaining agreement is silent regarding the employees\u2019 fitness-for-duty, the parties are governed by Ohio civil-service law rather than the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement. In this assignment of error, the city has not argued that the arbitrator exceeded his authority under R.C. 2711.10(D). This argument is merely an attack on the legal foundations of the arbitrator\u2019s decision, which this court is unable to review. <em>Summit Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities, </em>39 Ohio App.3d 175, 176, 530 N.E.2d 962, quoting <em>United Paperworkers, </em>484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286. Furthermore, since this court has determined that the trial court should have vacated the arbitrator\u2019s decision that the dispute flowing from the fitness-for-duty evaluation was arbitrable, this assignment of error is moot and is overruled on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>THE UNION\u2019S ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">{\u00b6 39} The union\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly modified the part of the arbitration award dealing with Yoder\u2019s involuntary leave following the fitness-for-duty evaluation because it determined the issue was not before the arbitrator. The union\u2019s second assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly modified the arbitration award based on its conclusion that the arbitrator\u2019s remedy failed to draw its essence from the collective-bargaining agreement. As this court has determined that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and the award should have been vacated in its entirety, these assignments of error are moot and are overruled on that basis. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 40} The city\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained because the arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding that the grievance was arbitrable and, therefore, should not have reached the merits of the dispute over whether the city breached the collective-bargaining agreement by placing Yoder on leave pending the fitness-for-duty evaluation. Thus, the trial court should have granted the city\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award under R.C. 2711.10(D). The city\u2019s second assignment of error and both of the union\u2019s assignments of error are moot based on this court\u2019s disposition of the city\u2019s first assignment of error. The judgment of the Summit County Common Pleas Court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-8\">Whitmore, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b196-9\">Moore, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b196-10\">Moore, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8g\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">{\u00b6 41} I respectfully dissent, as I would conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s award draws its essence from the collective-bargaining agreement.

However, it fails to give the arbitrator\u2019s award the appropriate level of deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">{\u00b6 42} Because arbitration is favored as an alternative method of dispute resolution, we encourage its practice and give the decision of the arbitrator a great deal of deference so long as the award \u201cdraws its essence\u201d from the collective-bargaining agreement. <em>Technigraphics, Inc. v.
