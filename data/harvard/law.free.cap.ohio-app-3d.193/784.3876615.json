The count of burglary contained a firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">{\u00b6 2} After a jury trial held on January 11 and 12, 2010, Simons was found guilty of the above offenses and sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 19 years in prison. Simons filed a timely notice of appeal with this court on March 11, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">{\u00b6 3} On September 2, 2009, Simons was indicted in case No. 2009-CR-227 for two counts of breaking and entering, two counts of theft of property valued between $500 and $5,000, one count of burglary accompanied by a one-year firearm specification, one count of grand theft, one count of theft, one count of having weapons while under disability, one count of intimidation of a witness in a criminal case, and one count of complicity to receive stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">{\u00b6 4} All of the appealed counts against Simons stem from three separate incidents in which he was accused of breaking into and stealing from two businesses and a residence located in Urbana, Ohio. The first incident occurred at the Rock-n-Robin Diner during the night of December 6, 2008. The following morning, an employee arrived at the diner and discovered that the cash register had been emptied and money had been stolen from a bank bag left in the office by the owner. There was no evidence of forced entry into the diner, and no windows were broken. An accounting revealed that between $500 and $600 was stolen from the diner.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">{\u00b6 5} The second incident occurred on or about the evening of December 28, 2008, when an officer from the Urbana Police Department discovered an open door at White\u2019s Ford Auto Dealership. Other than the open door, the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>found no other evidence that a break-in had occurred and left the premises. The next morning, on December 29, 2008, police were called to the dealership by-employees after a report of a break-in. Once again, there was no sign of forced entry, but police discovered that mud had been tracked through the building and a dolly had been used to remove car batteries and other auto parts totaling approximately $2,277 in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">{\u00b6 6} The third incident occurred sometime between June 29 and July 6, 2009, when the residence of George Jumper, located at 613 College Way in Urbana, Ohio, was burglarized. While he was away on vacation, Jumper\u2019s house was broken into and approximately 19 firearms, $350 in cash, and a check made payable to Jumper were stolen. Upon investigation, Urbana police discovered that the front door to the residence had been forced open. Jumper\u2019s neighbor neither saw nor heard anything unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">{\u00b6 7} As part of their investigation into the thefts, Urbana police interviewed a woman named Tonia Justice. Justice was an employee at the Rock-n-Robin Diner during this time frame. The owner of the diner provided Justice\u2019s name to the police when she was asked about persons she suspected of committing the robbery. Justice had called in sick on the day that the diner was broken into and robbed. Furthermore, Justice was Jumper\u2019s tenant at the time that his residence was burglarized. We note that Justice was evicted from Jumper\u2019s rental property in mid-July of 2009 for failure to pay rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">{\u00b6 8} Upon being interviewed, Justice implicated Simons in all three incidents. Justice informed the police that Simons and her ex-boyfriend, Terry Current, had broken into Jumper\u2019s residence and stolen the firearms. Based on information provided by Justice, police were able to recover six of the stolen firearms at the residence of Carl Pullins Sr., who told police that he bought the guns from Terry Current. Carl Pullins Jr. made statements to police that implicated Simons in the burglary at the Jumper residence, as well. Evidence was also adduced that Simons contacted Justice and left a threatening voicemail regarding statements she had made to Urbana police regarding his and Current\u2019s involvement in the three incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">{\u00b6 9} After a two-day jury trial, Simons was found guilty of two counts of breaking and entering, two counts of theft of property valued between $500 and $5,000, one count of burglary accompanied by a one-year firearm specification, one count of grand theft, one count of theft, one count of having weapons while under disability, and one count of intimidation of a witness in a criminal case. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the count of complicity to receive stolen property, and the state ultimately dismissed the count with prejudice. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>sentencing hearing held on February 25, 2010, the trial court ordered Simons to serve an aggregate sentence of 19 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">{\u00b6 10} It is from this judgment that Simons now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">{\u00b6 11} Simons\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error because appellant\u2019s convictions on counts one, two, six, seven, eight, and nine were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">{\u00b6 13} In his first assignment, Simons argues that his convictions for counts I, II, VI, VII, VIII, and IX were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, Simons asserts that the state relied heavily on the testimony of Tonia Justice and Terry Current in order to convict him on those counts. Simons contends that the testimony provided by Justice and Current was so inconsistent and contradictory that the jury must have lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cWhen an appellate court analyzes a conviction under the manifest weight standard it must review the entire record, weigh all of the evidence and all the reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses and determine whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the fact finder clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. Only in exceptional cases, where the evidence \u2018weighs heavily against the conviction,\u2019 should an appellate court overturn the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>State v. Dossett, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20997, 2006-Ohio-3367, 2006 WL 1793245, \u00b6 32, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">{\u00b6 15} The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are matters for the trier of facts to resolve. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231, 39 0.0.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212. \u201cBecause the factfinder * * * has the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, the cautious exercise of the discretionary power of a court of appeals to find that a judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence requires that substantial deference be extended to the factfinder\u2019s determinations of credibility. The decision whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses is within the peculiar competence of the factfinder, who has seen and heard the witness.\u201d <em>State v. Lawson </em>(Aug. 22, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">{\u00b6 16} This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of facts on the issue of witness credibility unless it is patently apparent that the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>fact lost its way in arriving at its verdict. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(Oct. 24, 1997), Champaign App. No. 97-CA-03, 1997 WL 691510.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">A. Counts I and II</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">{\u00b6 17} In counts I and II of the indictment, Simons was charged with breaking and entering and theft from the Rock-n-Robin Diner on the night of December 6, 2008. At trial, Current testified that he and Simons, accompanied by Justice, went to a Speedway gas station located near the diner on the night that the break-in occurred. Current testified that Justice encouraged Simons to break into the diner and told him where the money was located, as well as how to open the cash register. Current also testified that while they were at the gas station, Simons was out of his sight for approximately seven to ten minutes. When Simons reappeared, Current testified that he had a cigar box, a cup of change, and a wad of money in his pocket. Current further testified that Simons stated that \u201cthe money was easy to find and that he had a little bit of trouble with the cash register, something about a key where she [Justice] had told him where to turn the key to get in the cash register.\u201d Current testified that even though Simons had attempted to enlist his assistance in breaking into the diner, he did not help and was unaware of what had transpired until after Simons reappeared at the gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">{\u00b6 18} Justice testified that on the night that the diner was broken into, she was at home all evening. Justice testified that Current and Simons were at her house that night, but left to go to the Speedway gas station near the diner. Justice further testified that the two men were gone for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Justice testified that Simons told her upon his return that it was easy to get inside the diner because someone had left the door unlocked. Additionally, Justice testified that she observed in Current\u2019s possession a box that the owner of the diner had kept underneath the register at the diner. Justice denied any involvement in the break-in at the diner.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">{\u00b6 19} Justice\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with Current\u2019s testimony insofar as they disagree over their respective levels of involvement in the break-in. Simply put, Justice denied any involvement, while Current testified that she encouraged Simons to break into the diner, told him how to do it, and accompanied both men when they went to the Speedway near the diner on the night of the break-in. We also note that Current denied any active involvement in the break-in at the diner. Both witnesses\u2019 testimony, however, place Simons in the close vicinity of the diner on the night of the break-in, and both Current and Justice testified regarding statements Simons made to them implicating himself in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>B. Counts VI, VII, VIII, and IX</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">{\u00b6 20} In counts VI, VII, and VIII, Simons was charged with burglary, grand theft, and theft at the residence of George Jumper in Urbana between the dates of June 29, 2009, and July 6, 2009. In count IX, Simons was charged with having weapons while under disability arising out of his grand theft of firearms from Jumper\u2019s residence, having previously been convicted of complicity to robbery in 2006. Current and Justice testified that Simons broke into Jumper\u2019s house and stole money and firearms. Once again, however, both witnesses denied any involvement in the burglary and thefts from Jumper\u2019s residence. Moreover, Current and Justice implicated each other in the crimes. Specifically, Justice testified that Current had asked her whether there were any alarms at the Jumper residence. Current testified that he had heard Justice ask Simons to break into Jumper\u2019s residence. We also note that Carl Pullins Sr. told police that Current sold him six firearms that were later found to have been stolen from Jumper. Carl Pullins Jr., however, implicated Simons in the thefts of the Jumper residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">{\u00b6 21} More importantly, however, Current and Justice both testified that they observed Simons in possession of a black suitcase containing several firearms wrapped in a black and white diamond-patterned afghan blanket. Justice further testified that Simons told her that he was surprised that he did not find any jewelry in Jumper\u2019s house when he burglarized the residence. Jumper corroborated the testimony of Current and Justice when he testified that one of the items stolen from his residence was a black suitcase that contained several firearms wrapped in a diamond-patterned black, white, and tan afghan that his wife had given him.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 22} Upon review, the only instances where Current and Justice\u2019s testimony are inconsistent occur where one attempts to implicate the other while exculpating himself or herself. In all other instances, both witnesses\u2019 testimony consistently implicate Simons as the person who committed the offenses for which he was charged and convicted in counts I, II, VI, VII, VIII, and IX. The jury did not lose its way simply because it chose to believe the testimony of Current and Justice as it related to Simons\u2019s culpability for the burglaries and thefts at the diner and Jumper\u2019s residence. Having reviewed the entire record, we cannot clearly find that the evidence weighs heavily against a conviction or that a manifest miscarriage of justice has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">{\u00b6 23} Simons\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">{\u00b6 24} Simons\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe trial court erred by convicting appellant under R.C. 2921.04(B) because the alleged intimidation occurred before the commencement of any proceedings in a court of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">{\u00b6 26} Simons was convicted of intimidation of a witness in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cNo person, knowingly and by force or by unlawful threat of harm to any person or property, shall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder the victim of a crime in the filing or prosecution of criminal charges or an attorney or witness involved in a <em>criminal action or proceeding </em>in the discharge of the duties of the attorney or witness.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">{\u00b6 28} In the instant case, the alleged intimidation occurred when Simons called Justice and left a threatening message on her cell phone regarding comments she made to police regarding the break-ins at the diner, White\u2019s Ford, and the Jumper residence. Simons argues that he should not have been convicted of the offense of intimidation of a witness because at the time that he left the message, he had not been charged or indicted for any crime, nor had any court proceedings been initiated against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">{\u00b6 29} In support of his argument, Simons relies on <em>State v. Malone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614, in which the Supreme Court held that a \u201cconviction for intimidation of a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B) is not sustainable when the intimidation occurred after the criminal act but prior to any proceedings flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">{\u00b6 30} We recently discussed <em>Malone </em>in <em>State v. Davis, </em>193 Ohio App.3d 130, 2011-Ohio-1280, 951 N.E.2d 138, \u00b6 28, wherein we stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe State makes a strong argument that Malone\u2019s use of the word \u2018investigation\u2019 in its first and last paragraphs implies that an investigation of a reported crime is a \u2018criminal action or proceeding\u2019 so as to be within the prohibition of R.C. 2921.04(B). However, in Gooden<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (in which the [Eighth Appellate District] found insufficient evidence of witness intimidation), there had been a crime and an investigation. Further the <em>Malone </em>court states the question before it to be whether an R.C. 2921.04 conviction is \u2018sustainable where the intimidation occurred after the criminal act but prior to any police investigation of the criminal act, and thus also prior to any proceeding flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice.\u2019 Id. at \u00b6 9. Its answer is that such conviction \u2018is not sustainable when the intimidation occurred after the criminal act but prior to any proceedings flowing from the criminal act <em>in a court of justice. </em>\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Id.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>{\u00b6 32} In <em>Davis, </em>we interpreted <em>Malone </em>to require a holding that \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d as used in R.C. 2921.04 requires \u201c\u2018proceedings flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 29, quoting <em>Malone </em>at \u00b6 9. Accordingly, we held that since there had only been an offense reported and a police investigation initiated, there was insufficient evidence of a \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d to sustain a conviction of witness intimidation in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B). <em>Davis, </em>193 Ohio App.3d 130, 2011-Ohio-1280, 951 N.E.2d 138, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">{\u00b6 33} In the instant case, the alleged intimidation occurred after the offenses had been reported and a police investigation initiated, but before any \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d had been initiated against Simons. Thus, pursuant to our holding in <em>Davis, </em>\u201cthere [is] insufficient evidence of a \u2018criminal action or proceeding\u2019 to sustain a conviction for witness intimidation in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B),\u201d and Simons\u2019s conviction for that offense is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 34} Simons\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">{\u00b6 35} Simons\u2019s third and final assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe trial court erred by overruling appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">{\u00b6 37} In his final assignment, Simons contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it overruled his motion for mistrial made by defense counsel after the following testimony was elicited from Terry Current during direct examination by the state:</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe State: Are you familiar with the Defendant Carl Ray Simons?</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cCurrent: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ: How long have you known Mr. Simons?</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA: Approximately probably four or five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cQ: Is that because you lived near him or just came in contact with him through mutual friends or something else?</p>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cA: <em>I was incarcerated with him, at London Correctional Institution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cQ: And\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b826-18\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe Court: Excuse me. Counsel approach the bench, please.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-19\">{\u00b6 46} (Bench Conference Held)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-20\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t recall any conversation about that incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-21\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe State: I was not expecting him to testify to that particular fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-22\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cThe Court: So my question is correct. I didn\u2019t recall that we had\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>{\u00b6 50} \u201cThe State: Yes. That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe Court: Was the incarceration for the Clark County conviction that makes him disabled to have a firearm or a different offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe State: I believe based on this statement just now from the witness that it was [a] prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cThe Court: Do you have any information?</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cDefense Counsel: I don\u2019t have different information, but I believe it\u2019s in regard to a prior offense that occurred ten years or more ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cThe Court: I believe that the instruction that was going to be given about the conversation between Padolik will be given to the jury now.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It will be modified slightly saying: \u2018Evidence has been presented about the location of the individuals when they were acquainted with each other. Such testimony about location does not directly relate to any issue in the present case. Such testimony about location does not have any bearing on the character of the Defendant and shall not be \u2014 and you shall not consider the location of the statement as any indication of guilt of the Defendant.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cDefense Counsel: Your Honor, I would respectfully have to ask that I would have to move for mistrial based upon the witness\u2019 response.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cI think it prejudices my client because it elicited a response that he was previously in prison. The jury could infer that he has prior felony convictions that he was sentenced to prison for, and I think there\u2019s a direct difference between being in prison and being in local jail; and I think the jury probably has that general knowledge and that would prejudice my client.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cThe Court: Does that State agree to mistrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cThe State: No. State would oppose mistrial. The Court has already indicated that it would accept the testimony regarding statements made in a local jail, and the jury has already been made aware of a prior felony conviction by way of State\u2019s Exhibit 22, which indicated the prior felony conviction for complicity to robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cGiven that the jury either already knows or will know of those two facts, the State does not believe that that knowledge is sufficient basis for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cThe Court: Motion for mistrial is not granted. In the absence of granting that, do you have any objection to the statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>{\u00b6 62} \u201cDefense Counsel: No, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 63} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c(In Open Court)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cThe Court: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you\u2019ve just heard testimony about the location of the individuals when they were acquainted with each other. Such testimony about location does not directly relate to any issue in the present case. Such testimony about location does not have any bearing on the character of the Defendant and you shall not consider the location of the statement as any indication of the guilt of the Defendant in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cWith that admonition, we\u2019ll continue with the testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">{\u00b6 67} Initially, we note that the incarceration to which Current referred in his direct testimony apparently did not stem from the conviction that gave rise to Simons\u2019s disability. Simons argues that although a reference had been made to a prior conviction through the introduction of State\u2019s Exhibit 22, he was unfairly prejudiced by Current\u2019s disclosure regarding their meeting while incarcerated at London Correctional Institution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, Simons asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it overruled his motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\"> {\u00b6 68} The grant or denial of a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242. \u201cHowever, a trial court need not declare a mistrial unless \u2018the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.\u2019 \u201d Id., citing <em>State v. Franklin </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 127, 580 N.E.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">{\u00b6 69} Upon review, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled Simons\u2019s motion for mistrial. In the instant case, Current\u2019s disclosure of Simons\u2019s prior incarceration was a brief, isolated remark and was promptly followed by a curative instruction. For purposes of mistrial analysis, there is a presumption of the efficacy of curative instructions with regard to improper comments made by a witness or prosecutor. <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 65, 69, 619 N.E.2d 80. We also note that although Current testified that he first met Simons while incarcerated, no further testimony was adduced regarding the nature of the conviction or the term of imprisonment. Furthermore, the record reveals that the state was surprised by Current\u2019s response and did not intentionally attempt to elicit a prejudicial response. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>fact, the jury was already aware that Simons had been previously convicted and incarcerated based on the introduction of State\u2019s Exhibit 22. We note that no objection was made to the introduction of State\u2019s Exhibit 22. In light of the trial court\u2019s decisive action in calling a bench conference out of the hearing of the jury to discuss Current\u2019s disclosure immediately after it occurred, as well as the court\u2019s curative instruction to the jury, we find that Simons did not suffer any prejudice as a result of the court\u2019s decision to overrule his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 70} Simons\u2019s final assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 71} In light of the foregoing, Simons\u2019s conviction and sentence for intimidation of a witness is vacated.
