Myers asserts that applying the proper standard of \u201cdomicile\u201d to the facts of this case would have resulted in his acquittal, because the evidence established that his Middletown residence was merely a \u201ctemporary abode\u201d rather than his domicile, since he did not have the requisite intent to remain at his Middletown residence for an indefinite time. In support of his argument, Myers points out that the trial court made no analysis or express finding on the question whether he was domiciled in Middletown for tax years 2003 and 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 3} Initially, the state incorrectly argued at trial that the MMC does not mention \u201cdomicile.\u201d Section 890.02(a)(36) of the MMC defines \u201cresident\u201d as \u201can individual domiciled in the City\u201d and further provides that \u201c[a]ny person who maintains a place of abode within the City for a total of 90 days or more within a 12-month period shall be deemed a resident.\u201d Section 890.02(a)(6) of the MMC defines \u201cdomicile\u201d as \u201c[a] principle residence that the taxpayer intends to use for an indefinite time and to which whenever he or she is absent he or she intends to return,\u201d and further provides that \u201c[a] taxpayer has only one domicile even though he or she may have more than one residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cDomicile\u201d has traditionally been defined as a \u201cresidence in fact, combined with the intention of making the place of residence one\u2019s home for an indefinite period.\u201d <em>Cleveland v. Surella </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 302, 305, 572 N.E.2d 763. \u201cIn determining domicile * * * [i]t is necessary to look not only at the acts and declarations of the person but to the surrounding circumstances, such as \u2018family relations, business pursuit and vocation in life, mode of life, means, fortune, earning capacity, conduct, habits, disposition, age, prospects, residence, lapse of time, voting and payment of taxes[.]\u2019 \u201d Id. at 305, 572 N.E.2d 763, quoting <em>State ex rel. Kaplan v. Kuhn </em>(C.P.1901), 8 Ohio N.P. 197, 202, 11 Ohio Dec. 321, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The prosecutor\u2019s misstatements of law were not prejudicial, because this case was tried to the bench, and a trial judge, unlike a jury, is presumed to know the law unless the record shows to the contrary. <em>E. Cleveland v. Odetellah </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 787, 794, 633 N.E.2d 1159, citing <em>State v. Eubank </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 183, 187, 14 O.O.3d 416, 398 N.E.2d 567. See also <em>State v. Olah, </em>146 Ohio App.3d 586, 593, 2001-Ohio-1641, 767 N.E.2d 755, \u00b6 26. In this case, Myers has failed to point to any evidence that overcomes this presumption. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 6} Furthermore, the evidence presented in this case overwhelmingly established that Myers\u2019s residence in Middletown was also his domicile. The evidence showed that Myers received and paid for the city\u2019s water service during 2003 and 2004, and that he filed and paid income taxes for tax year 2002 and for tax years 2005, 2006, and 2007. Myers testified that he ate, breathed, and slept at his Middletown residence during all of 2003 and 2004. During his testimony, Myers claimed that his Middletown residence was merely a \u201ctemporary abode,\u201d that his domicile was \u201cGod\u2019s earth,\u201d and that he had no intent to establish his domicile in Middletown. However, Myers\u2019s testimony was insufficient to prove that it was not his intent to make his Middletown residence his domicile, particularly in light of the overwhelming evidence presented in this case demonstrating otherwise. See <em>Surella, </em>61 Ohio App.3d at 305, 572 N.E.2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 7} Additionally, there was no dispute that Myers lived at his self-described \u201ctemporary abode\u201d for more than 90 days during tax years 2003 and 2004, and thus was a resident of Middletown under Section 890.02(a)(36) of the MMC. Therefore, Myers was obligated under Section 890.05(a) of the MMC to file his municipal income tax returns for those years. Consequently, there was ample evidence presented to support Myers\u2019s conviction for failure to file his income tax returns for tax years 2003 and 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 8} Myers also requests that we \u201cdeclare the Municipal Tax Ordinance null and void to the extent that they [sic] attempt to convert the legal concept of residency into domicile.\u201d However, Myers failed to raise this argument at trial, and therefore, has waived it for purposes of appeal. See <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 122-124, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 9} In light of the foregoing, Myers\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">{\u00b6 10} In his second assignment of error, Myers argues that the trial court erred by not ruling on his pretrial motion to dismiss the case under Crim.R. 12 and by not taking judicial notice of the facts he proffered in support of the motion, thereby depriving him of his due process rights. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">{\u00b6 11} Myers filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the charge against him and to take judicial notice of certain facts, including that he was not subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>taxation by Middletown. However, a pretrial motion to dismiss must not be based on an argument that requires an evidentiary hearing, but instead must be based on a claim that can be determined from the face of the indictment. <em>State v. Serban, </em>Stark App. No.2006 CA 00198, 2007-Ohio-3634, 2007 WL 2050315, \u00b6 26-28. Moreover, the record must indicate that a defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected. <em>Lyndhurst v. McGinness </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 617, 619-620, 741 N.E.2d 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 12} Here, Myers has failed to explain how the trial court\u2019s failure to rule on his motion to dismiss the charge against him affected his substantial rights. Consequently, any error the trial court may have committed by failing to rule on his motion to dismiss was harmless. See Crim.R. 52(A) and <em>Akron v. Biehl </em>(Apr. 14,1999), Summit App. No. 19054, 1999 WL 241207, *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 13} Myers has also failed to explain how the trial court\u2019s failure to take judicial notice of any of the facts he proffered in his pretrial motion to dismiss affected his substantial rights. Myers did ask the trial court in his motion to dismiss to take judicial notice of the fact that he \u201cis not subject to taxation by the City of Middletown.\u201d However, this clearly is not the type of fact that is \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Evid.R. 201(B). Thus, any error that the trial court may have committed by failing to rule on his pretrial motion to take judicial notice of certain facts was harmless. See Civ.R. 52(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, Myers\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b670-9\">Powell, P.J., and Ringland, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
