The underlying dispute in this case is whether appellees are obligated to dredge a portion of the Pipe Creek waterway to provide appellants/cross-appellees boat access to Sandusky Bay and Lake Erie. Upon consideration of the assignments of error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">{\u00b6 2} The undisputed facts of this case are as follows. On July 21, 2001, appellants/cross-appellees, Victor and Evon N\u00e1demenos, purchased waterfront property in the Harbour Lagoons Subdivision (\u201csubdivision\u201d) located along Pipe Creek in Sandusky, Ohio. By virtue of this ownership, the Nademenoses became members of appellee, the Harbour Lagoons Association (\u201cLagoons Association\u201d), a homeowners association.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">{\u00b6 3} On May 30, 1992, the original developer of the subdivision, Admiral\u2019s Harbour, Inc. (\u201cAHI\u201d), entered into an agreement (\u201cAHI-HOA Agreement\u201d) with a neighboring homeowners association, Harbour Homeowners Association (\u201cHOA\u201d), appellee and cross-appellant, that stated, \u201c[HOA] shall dredge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>canals and waterways adjoining the Harbour and the Harbour Lagoons Subdivision, as it may from time to time be expanded, as needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 4} Later, on July 31, 1996, AHI and the Lagoons Association entered into the Pipe Creek Channel Operating Agreement (\u201cPCCO\u201d), which created the Pipe Creek Channel Association, for the purpose of \u201cmaintaining, dredging, and preserving the channel constructed in Pipe Creek and a portion of East Sandusky Bay (\u2018Channel\u2019).\u201d In the PCCO, \u201cChannel\u201d is defined as \u201cSections A and G as shown in the \u2018Master Dredging Plan\u2019 \u201d \u2014 a document provided by the Army Corps of Engineers that was incorporated into the PCCO, and which provides a map of all of the relevant waterways. AHI and the Lagoons Association are the only members of the Pipe Creek Channel Association. HOA is a nonmember owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 5} This dispute is over the rights and duties created by paragraph 2(a) of the PCCO, which provides for contributions from nonmember owners, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cUnder an agreement dated as of May 30, 1992 between AHI and HOA * * * HOA agreed to assume responsibility for dredging the canals and waterways adjoining the Harbour Properties and the Lagoons Subdivision as expanded, including Sections C and D as shown on the Master Dredging Plan (and Sections B and E if such sections are created as part of the Lagoons Subdivision) #$\u00bf</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 7} Further, paragraph 7 of the PCCO provides: \u201cThe Owners acknowledge that several of the Harbour Properties and other Properties contain separate canal systems that provide access to Pipe Creek but are not considered to be part of the Channel for purposes of this agreement. The Owners acknowledge and agree that * * * [iii] HOA is solely responsible for the maintenance, dredging, and preservation of Sections C and D of the Master Dredging Plan (and Sections B and E if such sections are created as part of the Lagoons Subdivision) as provided in the [AHI-HOA Agreement].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">{\u00b6 8} The subdivision, as originally contemplated by AHI, would be comprised of lots located along four canals, referred to as Sections B, C, D, and E, respectively, which would feed into the main channel, referred to as Section A. Section A, which runs along Pipe Creek on the side opposite from the Kademenoses\u2019 property, provides boat access to Sandusky Bay and Lake Erie. As identified in the Master Dredging Plan, only Sections C and D were existing canals; Sections B and E were \u201cto be dry excavated.\u201d In December 1996, AHI sold its remaining property in the subdivision to Harbour Lagoons Ltd., now known as 4920 Milan Investments, Ltd. (\u201cMilan\u201d). Milan redesigned the subdivision, and in so doing eliminated the plans to create Section B. The Kademenoses\u2019 property is located on land that would have been excavated had Section B been created.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The events that led to this action involve a July 3, 2003 letter that Victor H\u00e1demenos wrote, requesting that HOA dredge the waterway adjoining his property to provide access to Sandusky Bay and Lake Erie. HOA responded by a letter dated September 3, 2004, in which HOA refused to dredge the waterway, stating that it had no such obligation. Consequently, on October 29, 2008, the Kademenoses filed a complaint against HOA, Lagoons Association, Milan, Pipe Creek Channel Association, and John Does 1 through 5 containing claims for breach of contract for \u201cfailing to dredge and maintain [Section] B,\u201d and for declaratory judgment that \u201c[defendants are responsible to dredge [Section] B of the Pipe Creek Channel.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 10} After the initial pleadings were received, the trial court ordered that dispositive motions were to be filed by March 15, 2010. HOA, Lagoons Association, and Milan timely filed motions for summary judgment. The Kademenoses did not respond to these motions. On April 28, 2010, the trial court, in two separate judgment entries, granted summary judgment for HOA, Lagoons Association, and Milan, holding that Section B was never created and therefore no obligation to dredge or maintain Section B arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 11} Shortly thereafter, on April 30, 2010, the Kademenoses filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of the Court\u2019s Decisions Entered April 28, 2010\u201d and a \u201cMotion for Leave to File Brief in Opposition and Cross Motion for Summary Judgment <em>Instanter.\u201d </em>The trial court granted both motions on June 3, 2010, setting aside the April 28, 2010 judgments, and allowing the Kademenoses to file a brief in opposition and cross-motion for summary judgment. In addition, on August 2, 2010, the Kademenoses filed a \u201cMotion for Relief from Judgment Entered April 28, 2010.\u201d The trial court, in judgment orders dated August 17, 2010, August 19, 2010, and August 25, 2010, granted the Kademenoses\u2019 \u201cMotion for Relief from Judgment Entered April 28, 2010,\u201d but at the same time granted HOA\u2019s, Lagoon Association\u2019s, and Milan\u2019s motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court again based its decisions on the grounds that Section B was never created and therefore, under the clear and unambiguous terms of the contract, no obligation to dredge Section B arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 12} The Kademenoses now appeals these three summary-judgment orders. HOA cross-appeals the June 3, 2010 order granting the Kademenoses\u2019 motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>reconsideration and the August 17, 2010 order granting the Kademenoses\u2019 motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 13} The Kademenoses asserts the following single assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court erred in its interpretation of the Pipe Creek Channel Agreement wherein it found that the natural existing waterway portion of Channel B was not \u2018created\u2019 and therefore gave rise to no obligation on the part of the defendants to \u2018dredge the waterways adjoining the harbour and the Harbour Lagoons Subdivision as expanded\u2019 and thereby granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 15} We note at the outset that an appellate court reviews summary-judgment rulings de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198; <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Applying Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate where (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact exists, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">{\u00b6 16} The case before us turns on the interpretation of terms in a contract. \u201cIf a contract is clear and unambiguous, then its interpretation is a matter of law and there is no issue of fact to be determined.\u201d <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 321, 322, 15 OBR 448, 474 N.E.2d 271. Contractual language is ambiguous only when its meaning cannot be derived from the four corners of the agreement, or when the language is susceptible of two or more reasonable interpretations. <em>Wolf v. Miller Diversified Consulting, L.L.C., </em>6th Dist. No. WD-07-049, 2008-Ohio-1233, 2008 WL 726535, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIn construing any written instrument, the primary and paramount objective is to ascertain the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Community Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 51, 53, 544 N.E.2d 920. \u201cThe intent of the parties to a contract is presumed to reside in the language they chose to employ in the agreement.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 132, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411. Common words appearing in the agreement \u201care to be given their plain and ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results or unless some other meaning is clearly intended from the face or overall contents of the instrument.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 245-246, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146. If the terms are clear and unambiguous, the court cannot interpret the contract in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>inconsistent with the intent of the parties as expressed by their clear language. Id. at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">{\u00b6 18} The Kademenoses essentially make two arguments in support of their assignment of error. The first argument is that Section B is comprised of two parts \u2014 an existing natural waterway that crosses Pipe Creek and an artificial canal that would be created by excavating dry land. Indeed, as illustrated in the Master Dredging Plan, a portion of Section B starts from Section A, crosses Pipe Creek, and then runs inland approximately at the site of the Kademenoses\u2019 property. The Kademenoses argue that although the artificial-canal portion of Section B was never constructed, Section B nonetheless exists to the extent of the natural-waterway portion crossing Pipe Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 19} Paragraph 2(a) of the PCCO states that \u201cHOA agreed to assume responsibility for dredging the canals and waterways * * * including Sections C and D as shown on the Master Dredging Plan (and Sections B and E if such sections are created as part of the Lagoons Subdivision).\u201d This language indicates that the creation of Section B is a condition precedent to HOA\u2019s obligation to dredge, in that the obligation arises only if Section B is created. See <em>Polek v. Tillimon </em>(Mar. 1, 2002), 6th Dist. No. L-01-1354, 2002 WL 313401 (\u201cA condition precedent is an occurrence that must take place before a contractual obligation becomes effective\u201d). Under the Kademenoses\u2019 view, because the natural-waterway portion of Section B exists directly adjacent to their property, and because their property is within the subdivision, Section B must necessarily have been created as part of the subdivision. Thus, the condition precedent was satisfied, and HOA has an obligation to dredge the portion of Section B adjacent to their property. However, we disagree with the Kademenos\u2019 characterization of Section B.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 20} The clear understanding and intent of the parties was that Section B was not comprised of two different parts but rather was a single unit that was not in existence at the time of the agreement. A plain reading of the conditional language in paragraph 2(a) \u2014 \u201cand Sections B and E <em>if such sections are created </em>as part of the Lagoons Subdivision\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 indicates that the parties understood that Section B was a unitary concept, and that it was not currently part of the Lagoons Subdivision. In addition, the Master Dredging Plan states: \u201cSections B and E to be dry excavated.\u201d The use of the future tense \u201cto be\u201d indicates that Section B did not exist at the time and would be created by digging the artificial canal out of the dry land. Finally, correspondence from the United States Army Corps of Engineers that states that construction of Section B was completely voluntary and that deciding not to construct Section B did not violate the permit further supports the conclusion that Section B is a single unit and that it has not been constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>{\u00b6 21} The Kademenoses base their argument on the drawing in the Master Dredging Plan that shows Section B crossing Pipe Creek and then running inland. However, this argument ignores the accompanying text in the drawing stating that Section B is \u201cto be dry excavated.\u201d The natural effect of this language is to indicate the manner in which Section B would be created and therefore recognizes implicitly that Section B did not currently exist. To conclude that part of Section B already existed as a natural waterway would be contrary to the plain meaning of this text.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 22} In addition, the Kademenoses\u2019 interpretation of Section B fails because it would render a portion of paragraph 2(a) meaningless. \u201c \u2018In the interpretation of a promise or agreement or a term thereof * * * an interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pokorny v. Pecsok </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 260, 268, 4 O.O.3d 434, 364 N.E.2d 241, quoting what is currently Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981), Section 203. Here, if the parties had understood and intended that Section B was composed of a natural-waterway portion and an artificial-canal portion, then the use of conditional language would have been meaningless as to the waterway portion because the condition would have already been satisfied at the time the agreement was created. Instead, we choose to give full effect to the condition of creation by concluding that the parties intended that Section B is a single unit that would be created only upon the dry excavation of an artificial canal. The parties agree that the canal portion of Section B was never dry excavated. Thus, because Section B was never dry excavated, it was never created. Therefore, the condition precedent was not satisfied, and consequently HOA\u2019s obligation to dredge and maintain Section B never arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 23} The Kademenoses\u2019 second argument is that even independent of the creation of Section B, HOA has an obligation to dredge the waterway adjacent to their property. To support this, the Kademenoses cite the portion of paragraph 2(a) of the PCCO that states that \u201cHOA agreed to assume responsibility for dredging the canals and waterways adjoining the Harbour Properties and the Lagoons Subdivision as expanded.\u201d The Kademenoses argue that because the portion of Pipe Creek that adjoins their property is a waterway, and because their property is within the Lagoons Subdivision, HOA has a responsibility under the PCCO to dredge the waterway adjacent to their property. However, the Kademenoses\u2019 interpretation again runs counter to the clear intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 24} Paragraph D of the PCCO indicates that construction of the \u201cChannel\u201d and any maintenance, dredging, or preservation thereof will be subject to permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers or other governmental agencies. In this case, the permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers authorizes dredging in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>accordance with the Master Dredging Plan. Thus, the clear intent of the parties is that any obligation to dredge must be limited to those areas authorized by the Master Dredging Plan. This intent is further evidenced by the parties\u2019 use of the sections as identified in the Master Dredging Plan to describe the respective dredging obligations. For example, paragraph C creates the Pipe Creek Channel Association for the purpose of \u201cmaintaining, dredging, and preserving the channel constructed in Pipe Creek and a portion of East Sandusky Bay (\u2018Channel\u2019),\u201d and defines \u201cChannel\u201d as \u201cSections A and G of the Master Dredging Plan\u201d; paragraph 2 provides that HOA shall have sole responsibility for dredging Sections C and D (and B and E if they are created); and paragraph 7 states that the Marina shall have sole responsibility to dredge Section F, JHW shall have sole responsibility to dredge Section I, and HOA shall have sole responsibility to dredge Sections C and D (and B and E if they are created). Therefore, the Kademenoses\u2019 argument that the language in paragraph 2(a) requires HOA to dredge all canals and waterways that adjoin the subdivision, even if those waters are not considered part of a section in the Master Dredging Plan, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">{\u00b625} In conclusion, we hold that based on the four corners of the PCCO agreement, the only reasonable interpretation of paragraph 2(a) is that HOA\u2019s obligation to dredge is limited to the extent consistent with the Master Dredging Plan. Further, because Section B \u2014 as identified in the Master Dredging Plan\u2014 was never dry excavated, it was never created, and therefore HOA has no obligation to dredge the waterway in front of the Kademenoses\u2019 property. Accordingly, the Kademenoses\u2019 assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 26} On cross-appeal, HOA asserts the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 27} 1. \u201cThe trial court erred when it granted appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 28} 2. \u201cThe trial court erred when it granted appellants\u2019 motion for relief from judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 29} Because we uphold the lower court\u2019s award of summary judgment, these assignments of error are rendered moot. Accordingly, HOA\u2019s first and second assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 30} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Costs are assessed to appellants pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-11\">Pietrykowski and Singer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">. The original term used in the Kademenoses\u2019 complaint is \"Channel B.\" However, in paragraph 15 of the complaint, the Kademenoses note that \"Section B\u201d is also referred to as \"Channel B.\u201d We will therefore consider the terms to be interchangeable, but for simplicity will refer to it only as Section B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. On August 31, 2010, the trial court issued a judgment clarifying its rulings in the earlier judgments and dismissing the matters against Pipe Creek Channel Association and John Does 1 through 5 as moot. The Kademenoses do not appeal from this judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
