As Robinson and Hunt were leaving Hunt\u2019s residence, defendant pulled up in her vehicle. Defendant and Hunt have a five-year-old child. Defendant exited her vehicle and immediately began arguing with Hunt, questioning why he was with Robinson. Before long, defendant and Robinson were arguing with each other over Hunt. The verbal altercation included cussing and name calling and soon turned physically violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">{\u00b6 3} According to Robinson, after she called defendant a felon, defendant punched her in the face. Robinson fell to the ground, and there was no further physical contact between her and defendant. Robinson was having difficulty breathing and used Hunt\u2019s phone to call 9-1-1. By the time police arrived, defendant had fled. Robinson was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital for treatment of her injuries, which included bruises on her jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">{\u00b6 4} According to Hunt and defendant, Robinson started the physical altercation by trying to hit defendant, who struck Robinson in self-defense. Robinson managed to pull defendant\u2019s hair, causing defendant to fall and injure her knee. When Hunt restrained Robinson, defendant left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Defendant was charged by complaint filed in Dayton Municipal Court with one count of assault, R.C. 2903.13(A), a misdemeanor of the first degree. At Robinson\u2019s request, the trial court issued a criminal protection order, R.C. 2903.213, as a pretrial condition of defendant\u2019s release, prohibiting defendant from having any contact with Robinson. Following a trial to the court, defendant was found guilty of assault. The trial court sentenced defendant to pay a $100 fine plus costs and continued the protection order already in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 6} Defendant timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe cumulative effect of errors denied appellant a fair trial and the right to effective representation of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 8} Defendant argues that due to the cumulative effect of the trial court\u2019s multiple errors, she was denied a fair trial. <em>State v. DeMarco </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 31 OBR 390, 509 N.E.2d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">{\u00b6 9} With respect to the alleged multiple errors committed by the trial court to which defendant refers, defendant first argues that the trial court erred on two separate occasions by unduly limiting the scope of cross-examination of Robinson, which defendant claims denied her due process and her right to a fair trial. The first occasion involved the following exchange between defense counsel and Robinson:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cQ. Well, you stated that your relationship began in December?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cA. That is correct</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cQ. And Mr. Hunt and Miss Cash share a child together, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cQ. So their relationship has lasted much longer than your relationship with Mr. Hunt?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE COURT: You know I\u2019m going to sua sponte to stop this questioning because you, yourself objected to anything outside of the particular incident, so don\u2019t go there.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTHE DEFENSE: O.K.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">{\u00b6 17} Evid.R. 611 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-18\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(A) Control by court. The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>{\u00b6 19} \u201c(B) Scope of cross-examination. Cross-examination shall be permitted on all relevant matters and matters affecting credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>State v. Ross, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22958, 2010-Ohio-843, at \u00b6 9, we observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cOn cross-examination, a party may inquire into all matters pertinent to the case that the party calling the witness would have been entitled or required to raise. <em>In re Fugate </em>(Sept. 22, 2000), Darke App. No. 1512 [2000 WL 1370329], citing <em>Smith v. State </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 137, 180 N.E. 695, paragraph one of the syllabus. However, the trial court has broad discretion in imposing limits on the scope of cross-examination. <em>State v. Cobb </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 179, 183, 610 N.E.2d 1009. Trial judges have wide latitude \u2018to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u2019 <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674. An appellate court will not interfere with a trial court\u2019s decision about the scope of cross-examination absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Fugate, </em>supra. The term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 \u2018connotes more than an error in * * * judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219 [5 OBR 481], 450 N.E.2d 1140.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 22} Defense counsel\u2019s question during cross-examination of Robinson concerning the nature and length of her relationship with Jerome Hunt was not relevant to any fact of consequence in determining whether defendant knowingly caused physical harm to Robinson. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s sua sponte exclusion of that evidence was not an unreasonable exercise of the court\u2019s discretion in limiting questioning of the witnesses to relevant matters. No abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion has been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 23} The second alleged instance of trial-court error involved the following exchange between defense counsel and Robinson:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cQ. And, could you explain to the court because you didn\u2019t \u2014 what happened to Miss Cash\u2019s purse?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA. I don\u2019t know what happened with her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cQ. You didn\u2019t throw her purse?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA. No, I did not. My purse \u2014 her purse and my purse, my belongings\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cTHE COURT: You know, I\u2019m going again, because the prosecution is not objecting, sua sponte this was not part of direct so could we limit cross to what addressed in direct? Maybe you can bring it up in your case in chief?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>{\u00b6 29} \u201cTHE DEFENSE: OK, well \u2014 Your Honor, you\u2019re saying that I can\u2019t ask her any other questions? I\u2019m stuck with the answers that she gave during direct?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cTHE COURT: Well, that is the rule isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b631} \u201cTHE DEFENSE: Ah\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cTHE COURT: Your cross is limited to what was asked in direct. He did not open the door with regards to a purse. If there\u2019s a purse of significant (sic) to the defense, you may do that in your case in chief, in this instance I don\u2019t see it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTHE STATE: your Honor, if I may\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cTHE COURT: Yes, please.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cTHE STATE: I know that defense counsel is allowed to ask questions to impeach the witness. I guess at this point based on similar questions that were asked, I would\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cTHE COURT: Is that an impeachment, Miss Vernekar?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cTHE DEFENSE: Ah \u2014 Well Your Honor, I\u2019m just trying to get the whole story. I think that the story she gave was limited to the questions that she was asked on direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cTHE COURT: Alright.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cTHE DEFENSE: So, I can\u2019t impeach her because she wasn\u2019t asked the question on direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cTHE COURT: I will give you some latitude with regards to that. Let\u2019s just try to keep a focus, OK?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. Let me ask my question in a different way, did you ever throw Miss Cash\u2019s purse?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. Did you ever see Mr. Hunt with a flashlight trying to find Miss Cash\u2019s keys so that she could leave?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-19\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-20\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ. So, that didn\u2019t happen according to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-21\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA. Nope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-22\">{\u00b6 47} In limiting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination to matters that were raised on direct examination, the trial court may have confused Fed.Evid.R. 611(B), which includes that limitation, with its Ohio counterpart, Ohio Evid.R. 611(B), which has no such requirement. Both rules permit cross-examination on matters affecting credibility. In that regard, the state suggested that defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>counsel might be asking questions about whether Robinson ever threw defendant\u2019s purse, causing the contents including her car keys to spill, in order to impeach Robinson. At that point the trial court reversed its own ruling and allowed defense counsel some leeway in asking about the purse. Defense counsel then asked whether Robinson threw defendant\u2019s purse and whether Robinson ever saw Hunt with a flashlight looking for the contents of defendant\u2019s purse. While the trial court\u2019s initial sua sponte ruling may have been error, the court clearly corrected itself and allowed defense counsel to ask about the purse. No abuse of discretion has been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 48} Defendant next argues that the trial court erred by questioning one of the state\u2019s witnesses, Officer Jennifer Stack. That exchange was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cTHE COURT: I have a question, through the process of your brief investigation, did you have an opportunity to learn who if anyone had been \u2014 who was attacked and who was the attacker?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cOFFICER STACK: Yes, when I went to the hospital. I actually went to Grandview? Good Sam after I left Silven and spoke with the victim at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cTHE COURT: And is that person who is the alleged perpetrator in the courtroom today?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cOFFICER STACK: I never\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cTHE COURT: You wouldn\u2019t know. Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cOFFICER STACK: Right, I never had any contact with her that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cTHE COURT: Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">{\u00b6 56} Evid.R. 614 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(A) Calling by court. The court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all parties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(B) Interrogation by court. The court may interrogate witnesses, in an impartial manner, whether called by itself or by a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c(C) Objections. Objections to the calling of witnesses by the court or to interrogation by it may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">{\u00b6 60} At the outset, we note that defendant did not object to the trial court\u2019s questioning of Officer Stack. Therefore, defendant has waived all but plain error. Plain error does not exist unless it can be said that but for the error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 61} The trial court has the authority to question witnesses called by the parties. Evid.R. 614(B). The defense in this case was that defendant hit Robinson in self-defense after Robinson attacked defendant. Defense counsel had previously inquired during cross-examination of Robinson whether she had hit defendant. The court\u2019s questioning of Officer Stack was simply designed to determine who the initial aggressor had been in the physical altercation between defendant and Robinson, an important factor in a self-defense claim. The court\u2019s question was relevant and proper. No error, much less plain error, has been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 62} Finally, defendant argues that certain statements the trial court made suggest that the court applied incorrect legal standards. For instance, in overruling defendant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case, the trial court stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to deny your motion. I think that it\u2019s the court\u2019s opinion that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that Miss Robinson was in fact hit. I acknowledge that it was only her word. She was credible and therefore I find that this crime did occur.\u201d Based upon that statement, defendant argues that the trial court improperly used determinations that are reserved for the trier of facts concerning the credibility of the witnesses as a basis to overrule defendant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 63} A Crim.R. 29 motion challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence. A sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument challenges whether the state has presented adequate evidence on each element of the offense to allow the case to go to the jury or sustain the verdict as a matter of law. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541. When considering a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, the trial court must construe the evidence in a light most favorable to the state and determine whether reasonable minds could reach different conclusions on whether the evidence proves each element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Bridgeman </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 261, 9 O.O.3d 401, 381 N.E.2d 184. The motion will be granted when reasonable minds could only conclude that the evidence fails to prove all the elements of the offense. <em>State v. Miley </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 738, 684 N.E.2d 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 64} The trial court\u2019s statement in its entirety demonstrates that in overruling defendant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal the court relied upon its conclusion that the state presented <em>sufficient evidence </em>to prove that defendant assaulted Robinson. Furthermore, as the trier of facts in this case, it was up to the trial court to determine the credibility of the witnesses. The trial court did not apply an incorrect legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>{\u00b6 65} Defendant additionally argues that the trial court applied an incorrect burden of proof when at the end of the trial the court stated: \u201cI find for the prosecution and find probable assault.\u201d The court\u2019s entire statement was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cTherefore, I find for the prosecution and find probable assault. Excuse me before I say that, I don\u2019t, it\u2019s my opinion that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that there was a self-defense; all within the testimony of Miss Cash. Therefore, I find that assault was committed. I find for Miss Robinson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">{\u00b6 67} Subsequently, the trial court stated: \u201cI find you guilty of assault,\u201d and \u201cI find you guilty and your fine will be a hundred dollars plus court costs.\u201d The court\u2019s journal entry reflects that the court found defendant guilty following trial. Although the court does not specifically state that it found defendant guilty \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d we will not presume from a silent record that the court applied an incorrect legal standard. To the contrary, we must presume the regularity and validity of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and that it applied the correct legal standard, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. <em>State v. Carroll </em>(Sept. 23, 1980), Montgomery App. No. 6532, 1980 WL 352539. No error on the part of the trial court has been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 68} Because defendant has failed to demonstrate that multiple errors were committed by the trial court, the cumulative-error doctrine is not applicable in this case. <em>State v. Whitfield, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22432, 2009-Ohio-293, 2009 WL 161336.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 69} Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cThe trial court erred by continuing in effect the protection order issued in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">{\u00b6 71} On July 28, 2009, the trial court issued a criminal protection order pursuant to R.C. 2903.213, prohibiting defendant from having any contact with Robinson, as a condition of defendant\u2019s pretrial release. The court reaffirmed that order on August 7, 2009, when it imposed defendant\u2019s sentence. Defendant argues that the trial court lacked authority to continue that protection order as part of her sentence, because R.C. 2903.213(E)(2) states that such protection orders terminate as a matter of law upon disposition of the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">{\u00b6 72} The state concedes in its appellate brief that pursuant to R.C. 2903.213(E)(2) the trial court lacked authority to continue the protection order as part of defendant\u2019s sentence, and that the protection order issued in this case terminated as a matter of law when the trial court found defendant guilty of assault and sentenced her accordingly. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>{\u00b6 73} Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 74} Pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), that portion of the trial court\u2019s sentence continuing the protection order issued pursuant to R.C. 2903.213 is reversed and vacated. As so modified, the trial court\u2019s judgment and sentence is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-7\">Hall, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b267-8\">Fain, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b267-9\">Fain, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 75} I concur fully in the judgment and the reasoning of the court. I write separately merely to renew my objection to the \u201cmore than an error of law\u201d formulation for abuse of discretion. See <em>State v.
