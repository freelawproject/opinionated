For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 2} On November 16, 2000, appellant, Mary Fratilla, was injured while riding in a car driven by her husband, Terry Fratilla. In 2005, appellant brought suit against Terry and her insurer, appellee, Owners Insurance Company. Appellee alleged that her injuries were the result of Terry\u2019s negligence and that as the result of appellee\u2019s denial of liability coverage, Terry was an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 3} In this proceeding, the trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s claim on appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, declaring that appellee\u2019s decision to deny coverage was proper based on the household-exclusion clause in the insurance policy. Appellant\u2019s appeal of this ruling was dismissed for want of a final, appealable order, because other claims remained pending. <em>Fratilla v. Fratilla </em>(Apr. 19, 2007), 6th Dist. No. L-07-1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 4} When the matter returned to the trial court, appellee and the administrator of the estate of the now deceased Terry Fratilla negotiated an agreement under which the estate conceded Terry\u2019s negligence in the accident and agreed to a consent judgment against the estate in the amount of $75,000 in compensation for appellant\u2019s injuries. On June 11, 2009, appellant filed a \u201cSupplemental Complaint for Payment of Consent Judgment\u201d and for a declaratory judgment of coverage against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">{\u00b6 5} The matter was eventually submitted to the trial court on cross motions for summary judgment. On consideration, the trial court concluded that the household-coverage exclusion in appellee\u2019s policy precluded coverage on these facts. The court granted appellee\u2019s summary-judgment motion and denied appellant\u2019s. From this judgment, appellant now brings this appeal. Appellant sets forth the following single assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant when it found that the intrafamily exclusion contained in the appellee\u2019s policy of insurance was valid and enforceable under Ohio law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">{\u00b6 7} On review, appellate courts employ the same standard for summary judgment as trial courts. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198. The motion may be granted only when it is demonstrated:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 67, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 9} In this matter, the facts are stipulated. The only issue is the legal effect of the provisions in appellee\u2019s contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant was the named insured in an automobile insurance policy issued by appellee for the vehicle in the 2000 collision. Under \u201cLiability Coverage,\u201d the policy provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWe will pay damages for bodily injury and property damage for which you become legally responsible because of or arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of your automobile as an automobile. We will pay such damages:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(1) on your behalf;</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) on behalf of any relative using your automobile * *</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">{\u00b6 14} A \u201crelative\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who resides with you and who is related to you by blood, marriage or adoption. * * *.\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">{\u00b6 15} Ordinarily then, as appellant\u2019s spouse, bodily injury damages for which Terry became responsible while using appellant\u2019s automobile would be covered to the limits of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">{\u00b6 16} The policy, however, has an endorsement titled \u201cExclusion of Injury to Family Members.\u201d This endorsement states, \u201cIt is agreed: SECTION II\u2014 LIABILITY COVERAGE does not apply to bodily injury to you or any relative. All other policy terms and conditions apply.\u201d (Boldface and capitalization sic.) It is this household-exclusion provision that is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">{\u00b6 17} As the trial court noted, we have upheld the household exclusion with respect to uninsured/underinsured-motorist\u2019s coverage. <em>Wertz v. Wertz, </em>6th Dist. No. H-06-036, 2007-Ohio-4605, 2007 WL 2553419, \u00b6 21, citing <em>Snyder v. Am. Family Ins. Co., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 239, 2007-Ohio-4004, 871 N.E.2d 574. Appellant concedes that point, but suggests that with respect to liability coverage, even though such provisions have been found permissible, see <em>O\u2019Connor-Junke v. Estate of Junke, </em>8th Dist. No. 91226, 2008-Ohio-5874, 2008 WL 4885046, \u00b6 11, such an exclusion is against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Appellant premises her argument on a portion of R.C. Chapter 4509, the financial-responsibility act, specifically R.C. 4509.101, concerning proof of financial responsibility. R.C. 4509.101(A)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cNo person shall operate, or permit the operation of, a motor vehicle in this state, unless proof of financial responsibility is maintained continuously throughout the registration period with respect to that vehicle, or, in the case of a driver who is not the owner, with respect to that driver\u2019s operation of that vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c \u2018Proof of financial responsibility\u2019 means proof of ability to respond in damages for liability, * * * arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle in the amount of [$12,500 per person, $25,000 per accident].\u201d R.C. 4509.01(E). Any automobile insurance policy that fails to provide the coverage required in R.C. 4509.01(E) must contain a conspicuous warning of that fact on its face. R.C. 4509.104.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant maintains that it is the clear legislative intent of these and similar provisions that a motor vehicle should not be operated on Ohio highways unless proof of financial responsibility is maintained in the type and amount mandated. Because a household exclusion, such as the one in appellant\u2019s policy, negates a facet of that coverage, appellant insists, it is contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 22} While appellant\u2019s argument is inventive, we, like the trial court, find it unpersuasive. Wfiien interspousal tort immunity was abolished in 1985, <em>Shearer v. Shearer </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 94, 18 OBR 129, 480 N.E.2d 388, paragraph two of the syllabus, the court neutrally, if not favorably, discussed the possibility of intrafamilial exclusions as a device to minimize \u201ccollusive fraud.\u201d In the end, the court concluded that the viability of such exclusionary clauses \u201cis for the marketplace * * * to decide.\u201d Id. at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">{\u00b6 23} Moreover, appellant\u2019s reliance on the proof-of-financial-responsibility statutes is problematic. The act provides for a two-tier honor system that permits a driver to choose from a menu of means to assure his or her financial responsibility. <em>Geico Gen. Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>1st Dist. No. CD-070733, 2008-Ohio-4117, 2008 WL 3544921, \u00b6 11, not accepted for review, 120 Ohio St.3d 1490, 2009-Ohio-278, 900 N.E.2d 200; <em>Safe Auto Ins. Co. v. Koroma, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 747, 2006-Ohio-6742, 864 N.E.2d 703, \u00b6 9; <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Kramer </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 528, 532, 632 N.E.2d 1333. Under tier one, the least-restrictive category, it is permissible for an insured to purchase a policy with any variety of exclusions. <em>Koroma </em>at \u00b6 20; <em>Geico </em>at \u00b6 24; <em>Kramer </em>at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">{\u00b6 24} The record contains no suggestion that appellant had been classified as anything other than a tier-one reporter. Consequently, she was at liberty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>purchase an insurance policy, or provide \u201cproof of ability to respond in damages for liability\u201d in the required amount pursuant to R.C. 4509.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 26} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. It is ordered that appellant pay the court costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-8\">Osowik, P.J., and Pieteykowski, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
