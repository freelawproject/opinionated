Thompson, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas imposing a prison sentence for his community-control violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">{\u00b6 2} In March 2000, appellant was indicted by the Franklin County Grand Jury on 15 counts of gross sexual imposition, nine counts of rape, one count of kidnapping, and one count of attempted rape. In June 2002, appellant entered a guilty plea to three counts of gross sexual imposition and one count of sexual battery. The court accepted appellant\u2019s plea, found him guilty, and entered a nolle prosequi on the remaining counts in the indictment. On July 24, 2002, the trial court held a sentencing hearing, at which time it imposed a four-year prison sentence on the sexual-battery count. The court further imposed a five-year period of community control on the gross-sexual-imposition counts, to be served upon completion of the prison term. At the hearing, the trial court cautioned appellant that if he violated the terms of his community control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>[The court] can add additional conditions, or [the court] can revoke the community control and impose a sentence on each of these counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">If the court has to impose a sentence ' on these counts because of a revocation, the sentence will be the maximum sentence of 18-months, and those sentences would run consecutive to each other. The total would be four-and-a-half years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court journalized the sentence in a judgment entry filed July 26, 2002. That entry included language that \u201c[s]hould the Defendant violate the terms of community control, as to [the gross sexual imposition counts], the Court may impose a sentence of 18 months * * * as to each count; said sentences to run consecutive to each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">{\u00b6 4} On February 26, 2010, a probation officer filed a request for revocation of probation. The trial court conducted a revocation hearing on June 10, 2010, during which appellant argued that the trial court\u2019s sentencing entry did not include essential language informing appellant of the specific prison term that would be imposed in the event of a community-control violation as mandated by R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) and <em>State v. Brooks, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 134, 2004-Ohio-4746, 814 N.E.2d 837. Appellant specifically argued that the court\u2019s statement in the sentencing entry that it \u201cmay impose\u201d an 18-month term of imprisonment on each count for violation of community control did not sufficiently apprise him of the specific prison term to be imposed. Acknowledging that the use of the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in the sentencing entry did not comport with the use of the definite \u201cwill\u201d at the sentencing hearing, the trial court nonetheless declined to address appellant\u2019s argument, finding it unnecessary because appellant was currently serving a 10-year prison term on a Pickaway County conviction that formed the basis for his community-control violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">{\u00b6 5} After the probation officer testified regarding the Pickaway County conviction, the trial court revoked community control upon a finding that appellant had violated the conditions. The court imposed a 12-month prison term on each of the gross-sexual-imposition counts to run consecutive with each other and with the sentence in the Pickaway County case. On July 7, 2010, the trial court filed a revocation entry journalizing its oral pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal, appellant assigns the following error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">The trial court erred by imposing a prison sentence for a violation of community control sanctions when the original sentencing entry failed to indicate the specific prison term Appellant faced for such violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">{\u00b6 7} Under his single assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court could not impose a prison term for his community-control violations because it did not notify him at sentencing of the specific prison term that it would impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>if he violated the sanctions. Conceding that the trial court\u2019s oral notification at the 2002 sentencing hearing complied with both R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) and <em>Brooks, </em>appellant argues, as he did in the trial court, that the trial court\u2019s judgment entry did not sufficiently apprise him of the specific prison term to be imposed. Appellant again takes issue with the trial court\u2019s statement in the sentencing entry that it \u201cmay impose\u201d an 18-month term of imprisonment on each count for violation of community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 2929.15(A)(1) authorizes trial courts to impose community-control sanctions on certain felony offenders. R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) provides that if a sentencing court decides to impose an authorized community-control sanction at a sentencing hearing, that court \u201cshall notify the offender that, if the conditions of the sanction are violated, [or] if the offender commits a violation of any law, * * * the court may impose a longer time under the same sanction, may impose a more restrictive sanction, or may impose a prison term on the offender and shall indicate the specific prison term that may be imposed as a sanction for the violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2929.15(B) reiterates the three options available to the sentencing court and further provides that if a prison term is imposed upon an offender for violating a community-control sanction, the prison term specified \u201cshall be within the range of prison terms available for the offense for which the sanction that was violated was imposed and shall not exceed the prison term specified in the notice provided to the offender at the sentencing hearing pursuant to [R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Brooks, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 134, 2004-Ohio-4746, 814 N.E.2d 837, the Supreme Court of Ohio noted that there are two main variables to consider in evaluating a trial court\u2019s compliance with the notification requirement of R.C. 2929.19(B)(5): timing and content. Id. at \u00b6 13. As to the timing of the notification, the court held that \u201c[p]ursuant to R.C. 2929.15(B)(5), a trial court sentencing an offender to a community control sanction is required to deliver the statutorily detailed notifications at the sentencing hearing.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. The court specifically averred that \u201cnotification given in a court\u2019s journal entry issued after sentencing does not comply with R.C. 2929.19(B)(5).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">{\u00b6 11} Regarding the content of the notification, the court, noting R.C. 2929.19(B)(5)\u2019s use of the term \u201cspecific\u201d to modify \u201cprison term,\u201d held that to strictly comply with the statute, a trial court must, \u201cin straightforward and affirmative language, inform the offender at the sentencing hearing that the trial court will impose a definite term of imprisonment of a fixed number of months or years, such as \u2018twelve months\u2019 incarceration,\u2019 if the conditions are violated.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>at \u00b6 19. The court emphasized that a trial court could not simply notify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>an offender that he or she will receive \u201cthe maximum,\u201d or a range, such as \u201csix to twelve months,\u201d or some other indefinite term, such as \u201cup to 12 months.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19, 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 12} In the present case, appellant concedes that the trial court sufficiently informed him at the sentencing hearing that it would impose a definite term of imprisonment of 18 months on each of the three gross-sexual-imposition counts if he were to violate the conditions of community control. Appellant, however, cites a number of cases in which appellate courts have held that a trial court must notify an offender of the specific prison term it will impose for a community-control violation both at the sentencing hearing and in the subsequent journal entry as a prerequisite to imposing a prison term. See, e.g., <em>State v. McWilliams, </em>9th Dist. No. 22359, 2005-Ohio-2148, 2005 WL 1026633; <em>State v. Waite, </em>8th Dist. No. 92895, 2010-Ohio-1748, 2010 WL 1610496; <em>State v. Goforth, </em>8th Dist. No. 90653, 2008-Ohio-5596, 2008 WL 4748657; <em>State v. Hobdy, </em>9th Dist. No. 22645, 2005-Ohio-4944, 2005 WL 2292818; <em>State v. Wilson, </em>8th Dist. No. 89988, 2008-Ohio-1943, 2008 WL 1822395; <em>State v. Miller-Nelson, </em>3d Dist. No. 14-07-04, 2007-Ohio-4495, 2007 WL 2473253.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">{\u00b6 13} We decline appellant\u2019s invitation to follow the foregoing case law for several reasons. First, decisions of other appellate districts are not controlling authority for this court. <em>Hewitt v. Columbus, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-1087, 2009-Ohio-4486, 2009 WL 2759735, \u00b6 21. Second, the <em>Brooks </em>court expressly averred that R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) is not satisfied by notification in a journal entry filed after sentencing. <em>Brooks, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 134, 2004-Ohio-4746, 814 N.E.2d 837, at \u00b6 18. Finally, in <em>State v. Shamblin, </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-716, 2007-Ohio-1172, 2007 WL 778608, this court held that when a trial court properly apprises an offender at the sentencing hearing of the specific prison term that will be imposed upon violation of community control, the written notification in a subsequent journal entry need not be as specific:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">[W]hile the written notices, standing alone, may have been insufficient to comply with <em>Brooks, </em>supra, the court\u2019s oral notification at the sentencing hearing sufficiently apprised appellant of the specific term. See <em>State v. Kelly, </em>Butler App. No. CA2005-06-149, 2006-Ohio-1664 [2006 WL 846002] (despite fact that judgment entry utilized terms \u201cup to\u201d when referring to potential term of imprisonment, transcript of sentencing hearing clearly reflects that trial court informed appellant of specific imprisonment to be imposed for violating conditions of community control, and, therefore, notification was in compliance with relevant sentencing statutes and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Brooks); <em>State v. Moffit, </em>Summit App. No. C.A. 22957, 2006-Ohio-3340 [2006 WL 1791298] (where defendant was notified, at sentencing hearing, of specific prison term he would receive if he violated terms of community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>control, court\u2019s statements at sentencing hearing also served to clarify trial court\u2019s judgment entry containing \u201cup to\u201d language; \u201c[consistent with the <em>Brooks </em>Court, \u2018[i]t would be overly rigid in [this] case to find that the offender\u2019s knowledge of the maximum term for the offense [does] not satisfy the notice requirement of R.C. 2929.19(B)(5)\u2019 \u201d). Id., at \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Brooks, </em>at \u00b6 32.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYW\">Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">{\u00b6 14} Moreover, even if the trial court were required to include a <em>Brooks </em>notification in the sentencing entry, the entry in this case sufficiently apprised appellant of the specific prison term for violation of community control. As noted above, the sentencing entry notified appellant that if he violated the terms of community control, \u201cthe Court may impose a sentence of 18 months * * * as to each count; said sentences to run consecutive to each other.\u201d Appellant contends that the court\u2019s use of the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in the entry is insufficient to satisfy <em>Brooks, </em>as it \u201cmerely stated the maximum penalty instead of the specific term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">{\u00b6 15} This court rejected a similar argument in <em>State v. Point, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-1162, 2010-Ohio-3032, 2010 WL 2637916. There, the trial court placed the defendant on community control and advised him at the sentencing hearing that if he violated the terms of community control, \u201cthe ultimate sentence <em>could </em>be your four-year prison sentence that I impose.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 9. The defendant argued that the notification violated <em>Brooks </em>and R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) because the trial court did not specifically inform him that it <em>would </em>impose a four-year prison term for a violation. Id. at \u00b6 10. This court disagreed, explaining how it is both unnecessary and less than accurate to use \u201cwill\u201d rather than \u201cmay\u201d when apprising an offender about the specific prison term to be imposed upon violation of community control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">First, both <em>Brooks </em>and R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) describe the prison term that an offender must be notified of as the term that \u201cmay be imposed\u201d for a violation of community control. Neither <em>Brooks </em>nor R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) require the trial court to inform the offender of the prison term that the trial court \u201cwill\u201d impose upon a community control violation. Indeed, it would be pure speculation for a trial court to advise an offender, without knowing the facts and circumstances of the future violation, what prison term, if any, it would impose. The <em>Brooks </em>court expressly noted this concern and stated that the specific prison term, if any, the offender is advised of \u201cis not necessarily what the offender will receive if a violation occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">Second, requiring a trial court to notify an offender of the specific term it may impose for a community control violation is consistent with the dominant purpose of current sentencing procedures: truth in sentencing. <em>Brooks </em>at \u00b6 25. A trial court has the discretion to impose a prison term less than the term it notified the offender of at sentencing. The <em>Brooks </em>notification require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ment sets the maximum prison term a trial court may impose for a community control violation. A trial court could choose a lesser term, or no prison term at all, depending on the facts and circumstances involved. R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). As noted, this is consistent with the use of the permissive term \u201cmay\u201d in R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) and in <em>Brooks </em>when describing a trial court\u2019s power to impose a prison term. Thus, it is more accurate to notify offenders of the specific prison term that the offender could receive, which informs the offender of the maximum prison term the trial court could impose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Id. at \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">{\u00b6 16} In so concluding, this court cited <em>State v. Reed, </em>3d Dist. No. 4-05-22, 2005-Ohio-5614, 2005 WL 2709536, and <em>State v. Hall, </em>5th Dist. No. 07CA40, 2007-Ohio-6471, 2007 WL 4248286, noting that each court had previously rejected the defendants\u2019 interpretation of <em>Brooks. </em>As we noted in <em>Point, </em>the <em>Reed </em>court rejected the argument that a trial court is required to notify a defendant of the specific prison term that \u201cwill\u201d be imposed for a community control violation. Similarly, the court in <em>Hall </em>rejected the argument that a trial court, in referring to a prison term, must use the words \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cwould\u201d as opposed to \u201ccan\u201d or \u201ccould.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">{\u00b6 17} The present case illustrates why trial courts are permitted to use the term \u201cmay\u201d when notifying offenders about the specific prison term to be imposed for future community-control violations. When sentencing appellant on the community-control violation, the trial court did not impose the maximum prison sentence of three consecutive 18-month prison terms; rather, the court determined that the facts and circumstances of the case warranted something less than the maximum, choosing instead to impose three consecutive 12-month prison terms. Appellant wrongly contends that the trial court was required to speculate as to the exact prison term it would impose for future community-control violations. As we stated in <em>Point, </em>\u201c[t]he syllabus in <em>Brooks, </em>coupled with a reasonable reading of the entire <em>Brooks\u2019 </em>decision, indicates that the court was emphasizing the need to notify the offender at sentencing of a specific prison term, not that the trial court would necessarily impose that specific prison term if the offender violated community control.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, even if the trial court were required to include a <em>Brooks </em>notification in its sentencing entry, the language utilized there satisfied R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) and <em>Brooks. Point.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">{\u00b6 19} For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s single assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-11\">French and Dorrian, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
