Matthews.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On August 18, 2010, D\u2019Amore initiated an action seeking to recover compensation that she claimed decedent, J. Harvey Crow, owed her pursuant to a written contract. D\u2019Amore\u2019s initial complaint named Matthews, in his capacity as executor of Crow\u2019s estate, as the sole defendant. Subsequently, on October 6, 2010, D\u2019Amore filed an amended complaint in which she named the \u201cEstate of J. Harvey Crow\u201d as an additional defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">{\u00b6 3} D\u2019Amore\u2019s claims originate from the following facts, which were disclosed in the complaint. On September 15, 1995, D\u2019Amore and Crow signed a written contract (\u201cthe 1995 agreement\u201d), in which Crow promised to compensate D\u2019Amore for services she would perform in connection with the development of various properties controlled by Crow. The 1995 agreement provided that D\u2019Amore would be compensated as follows: (1) $300,000 in property, cash, or services for the years between 1995 and 1998, (2) a vested interest in the profits derived from the operation, which could not be less than 15 percent, and (3) reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 4} In 1998, Crow organized Parkwood Ltd. (\u201cParkwood\u201d), an Ohio limited-liability company, for the purpose of developing the aforementioned properties. Subsequently, Crow transferred title to several of these properties to Parkwood. However, Crow did not at any time grant D\u2019Amore an equity interest in Parkwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 5} In December 2003, Crow, as grantor/settlor, and Matthews, as trustee, executed a trust agreement for the \u201cJ. Harvey Crow Trust.\u201d Crow transferred various assets to the trust, including his interest in Parkwood, at which time the trust became the majority owner of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">{\u00b6 6} On August 18, 2004, Crow passed away at the age of 101. On September 14, 2004, the trial court appointed Matthews the executor of Crow\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 7} On October 6, 2010, D\u2019Amore filed her amended complaint, alleging breach of contract and promissory estoppel. D\u2019Amore sought relief against Matthews and Crow\u2019s estate \u201cin order to recover non-estate assets, or estate assets should fraudulently transferred assets be ordered to revert to the Estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">{\u00b6 8} On September 22, 2010, Matthews moved to dismiss D\u2019Amore\u2019s complaint on the grounds that D\u2019Amore\u2019s claims were time barred by R.C. 2117.06, which requires that all claims against an estate be presented within six months after the death of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">{\u00b6 9} On October 29, 2010, the trial court granted Matthews\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon a finding that D\u2019Amore\u2019s claims were time barred by R.C. 2117.06(B) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">{\u00b6 10} D\u2019Amore timely appeals, raising four assignments of error. For ease of discussion, we will address the assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Assignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s contract and promissory estoppel claims on statute of limitations grounds where 2117.06(G) clearly excludes these claims from the general six month limitations period under R.C. 2117.06U\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 13} In her fourth assignment of error, D\u2019Amore argues that her breach-of-contract and promissory-estoppel claims are not governed by R.C. 2117.06, but are instead governed by the limitation periods in R.C. Chapter 2305. Specifically, D\u2019Amore argues that contract claims need not be brought within the time limitations of R.C. 2117.06, provided that the plaintiff \u201cultimately seeks to recover assets <em>not </em>made part of the debtor\u2019s estate.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 14} Under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See, e.g., <em>Marchetti v. Blankenburg, </em>Butler App. No. CA2010-09-232, 2011-Ohio-2212, 2011 WL 1782115, \u00b6 9. In order to prevail on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, \u201cit must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling relief.\u201d Id. Our review of a dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) is de novo. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 15} First, while D\u2019Amore fails to specify the subsection allegedly governing her promissory-estoppel claim, our review of her responsive pleadings reveals she relied on R.C. 2305.07. Cf. <em>Cully v. St. Augustine Manor </em>(Apr. 20, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67601, 1995 WL 237129, at *5 (appellant\u2019s breach-of-implied-contract claim arising from oral employment-at-will agreement was subject to time limitations of R.C. 2305.07). R.C. 2305.07 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cExcept as provided in sections 126.301 and 1302.98 of the Revised Code, an action upon a contract not in writing, express or implied, or upon a liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty, shall be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">{\u00b6 17} Secondly, D\u2019Amore argues that R.C. 2305.06 governs her breaeh-ofcontract claim, thus the appropriate statute of limitations is 15 years. R.C. 2305.06 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cExcept as provided in sections 126.301 and 1302.98 of the Revised Code, an action upon a specialty or an agreement, contract, or promise in writing shall be brought within fifteen years after the cause thereof accrued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">{\u00b6 19} We hold that D\u2019Amore\u2019s reliance on these statutes is misplaced. As Matthews correctly states, D\u2019Amore\u2019s claims arise out of a contract formed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>between her and Crow in 1995. Thus, the cornerstone, and relevant consideration, of D\u2019Amore\u2019s cause of action is simply a claim for money due based upon a contract formed with a person now deceased. Following Crow\u2019s death, his contractual obligations became a debt of the estate. See <em>In re Estate of Cooke, </em>Ashland App. No. 10-COA-024, 2011-Ohio-1637, 2011 WL 1233222, \u00b6 15 (\u201cObligations incurred by a deceased during [his] lifetime become debts of [his] estate by operation of law.\u201d <em>Osborne v. Osborne </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 412, 414, 683 N.E.2d 365. Both kinds of debts must be presented in claims to the deceased\u2019s personal representative); <em>Willis v. McDermott </em>(June 30, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 53820, 1988 WL 87625, at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, unless D\u2019Amore timely asserted and proved her claims against Crow\u2019s estate, it is irrelevant what underlying assets D\u2019Amore seeks to recover. In other words, D\u2019Amore could not pursue <em>any </em>assets without first obtaining a judgment rendering Crow\u2019s estate liable for the breach. Because D\u2019Amore\u2019s claims accrued against Crow\u2019s estate, we find that they fall within the purview of R.C. 2117.06(B), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cExcept as provided in section 2117.061 of the Revised Code, all claims shall be presented within <em>six months </em>after the death of the decedent, whether or not the estate is released from administration or an executor or administrator is appointed during that six-month period. Every claim presented shall set forth the claimant\u2019s address.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 22} Because D\u2019Amore did not file her complaint until August 18, 2010 (and subsequently October 6, 2010), over six years after Crow\u2019s death, D\u2019Amore was barred from commencing action on her claims pursuant to R.C. 2117.06(B) and (C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Matthews, </em>2011-Ohio-2038, 2011 WL 1639263, at \u00b6 9-12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 23} Based upon the foregoing, the trial court properly dismissed D\u2019Amore\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">{\u00b6 24} D\u2019Amore\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s amended complaint without permitting appellant to file a brief in' opposition within the time allotted by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 27} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s contract and promissory estoppel claims against Matthews as executor and the Crow estate claiming Matthews has been discharged as executor}.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 29} Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that \u201creal estate\u201d was the subject of this complaint}.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">{\u00b6 31} Of the remaining assignments of error, assignments one and three are so intertwined with our resolution of the fourth assignment of error that they are rendered moot. Although the second assignment of error is also rendered moot, we will nevertheless address it because it involves a matter that is capable of repetition, yet will continue to evade review. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lovely, </em>Butler App. No. CA2003-06-063, 2004-Ohio-701, 2004 WL 292099, fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">{\u00b6 32} In her second assignment of error, D\u2019Amore argues that the trial court erred in sua sponte deciding that personal jurisdiction was lacking in this case. Specifically, D\u2019Amore argues that Matthews waived personal jurisdiction by his voluntary appearance and failure to raise the defense in his pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">{\u00b6 33} As an initial matter, we note that at no time did Matthews object on the grounds that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. In such a case, we agree with D\u2019Amore to the extent she argues that Matthews waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. See Civ.R. 12(H)(1). See also <em>U.S. Bank Natl. Assn. v. Golf Course Mgt, Inc., </em>Clermont App. No. CA2008-08-078, 2009-Ohio-2807, 2009 WL 1655395, \u00b6 48, quoting <em>Gliozzo v. Univ. Urologists of Cleveland, Inc., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 141, 2007-Ohio-3762, 870 N.E.2d 714, \u00b6 13 (\u201cIn civil cases, the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction usually must be raised either in the defendant\u2019s answer or in a pre-answer motion. * * * The failure to timely raise this defense constitutes a waiver thereof\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">{\u00b6 34} We further agree with D\u2019Amore\u2019s argument that once the lack of personal jurisdiction was waived, the trial court could not sua sponte address the issue of personal jurisdiction in its judgment entry. See, e.g., <em>Snyder Computer Sys., Inc. v. Stives, </em>175 Ohio App.3d 653, 2008-Ohio-1192, 888 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b6 17 (once defendant waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cproeedurally incorrect for the trial court to raise it on its own motion\u201d); <em>Weiss, Inc. v. Pascal, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82565, 2003-Ohio-5824, 2003 WL 22456728, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b615-6\">Powell, P.J., and Ringland, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-12\">. \"Promissory estoppel is a quasi-contractual or equitable doctrine.\u201d <em>HAD Ents. v.
