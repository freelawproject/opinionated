Celebrezze Jr., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">{\u00b6 1} Appellants, Republic Services, Inc. (\u201cRepublic\u201d), Republic Services of Ohio I, L.L.C. (\u201cRepublic Ohio\u201d), Republic Services of Ohio Hauling, L.L.C. (\u201cOhio Hauling\u201d), James Bowen, and Ronald Krall, appeal from an adverse judgment and the largest retaliatory discharge jury award in Ohio history \u2014 over $46 million. We affirm the jury\u2019s verdict, but remand for imposition of statutory punitive-damage limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee Ronald Luri was employed as the general manager in charge of the Cleveland division of Ohio Hauling. His direct supervisor, Bowen, was employed by Republic Ohio. Luri also reported to Bowen\u2019s supervisor, Krall, who was employed by Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">{\u00b6 3} According to Luri, sometime in November 2006, Bowen approached him with an action plan that called for, among other things, the termination of three employees. Luri testified that Bowen instructed him to fire Frank Pascuzzi, George Fiser, and Louis Darienzo, Luri\u2019s three oldest employees. Luri testified that he informed Bowen that Pascuzzi had strong performance evaluations, and terminating him without reason could result in a discrimination lawsuit. He also informed Bowen that Pascuzzi had a medical condition that could result in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>disability-discrimination suit. Luri testified that he refused to fire the three individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, Luri\u2019s performance evaluations were worse than in previous years, and Bowen instituted \u201cimprovements directives\u201d for Luri to complete, including conducting weekly meetings and providing more information to Bowen. Appellants claim that these directives were not accomplished, and as a result, Luri was terminated on April 27, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 5} Luri then filed suit on August 17, 2007, alleging claims of retaliatory discharge under R.C. 4112.02(1). After receiving notice of the litigation as a named party, it appears from the evidence presented at trial that Bowen had altered at least one piece of evidence to justify Luri\u2019s termination. Luri claims that as many as three pieces of evidence were altered or fabricated and submitted to him during discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 6} Appellants twice moved to bifurcate the trial pursuant to the Ohio Tort Reform Statutory provisions in R.C. 2315 et seq., as well as Civ.R. 42(B). The court denied these motions, and trial commenced on June 24, 2008. This lengthy trial concluded with a jury verdict finding against all defendants and awarding Luri $3.5 million in compensatory damages, jointly and severally against all defendants, and $43,108,599 in punitive damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants moved for remittitur, a new trial, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. These motions were all denied. Luri sought an award for attorney fees and for prejudgment interest on the compensatory damages from the date of his termination. The trial court awarded Luri over $1 million in attorney fees and prejudgment interest on the entire compensatory-damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"Aon\">Bifurcation</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 7} Appellants first argue that the trial court \u201cerred by failing to apply R.C. 2315.21(B)(1), which requires mandatory bifurcation.\u201d Appellants assert that bifurcation is mandatory upon motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Barnes v. Univ. Hosps. of Cleveland, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 87247, 87285, 87710, 87903, and 87946, 2006-Ohio-6266, 2006 WL 3446244, \u00b6 34, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>affirmed in part and reversed in part on other grounds 119 Ohio St.3d 173, 2008-Ohio-3344, 893 N.E.2d 142, we held that a court retains discretion to determine whether bifurcation is appropriate even in the face of R.C. 2315.21(B) and its mandatory language. Generally, a court\u2019s jurisdiction is set by the legislature, but as the Ohio Supreme Court noted, \u201cthe Modern Courts Amendment of 1968, Section 5(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution, empowers this court to create rules of practice and procedure for the courts of this state. As we explained in <em>Proctor v. Kardassilaris, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 71, 2007-Ohio-4838, 873 N.E.2d 872, Section 5(B), Article IV \u2018expressly states that rules created in this manner \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u201d \u2019 Id. at \u00b6 17. \u2018Thus, if a rule created pursuant to Section 5(B), Article IV conflicts with a statute, the rule will control for procedural matters, and the statute will control for matters of substantive law.\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>Erwin v. Bryan, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 519, 2010-Ohio-2202, 929 N.E.2d 1019, \u00b6 28. Since bifurcation is a procedural matter, the trial court retains discretion in determining whether such an action is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 9} This determination is further buttressed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Havel v. Villa St. Joseph, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 94677, 2010-Ohio-5251, 2010 WL 4308208,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which we held that R.C. 2315.21(B)(1) is an unconstitutional usurpation of the judiciary\u2019s ability to control procedural matters because it conflicts with Civ.R. 42(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id. at \u00b6 9. The Fifth District Court of Appeals has agreed with this determination. <em>Myers v. Brown, </em>192 Ohio App.3d 670, 2011-Ohio-892, 950 N.E.2d 213; <em>Plaugher v. Oniala, </em>Stark App. No. 2010 CA 00204, 2011-Ohio-1207, 2011 WL 883984, \u00b6 19-20. However, the Tenth District, in <em>Hanners v. Ho Wah Genting Wire &amp; Cable SDN BHD, </em>Franklin App. No. 09AP-361, 2009-Ohio-6481, 2009 WL 4698618, \u00b6 30, held that R.C. 2315.21 is substantive law in a procedural package. This interpretation deprives courts of the power granted under the constitution of this state. \u201cIf then the courts are to regard the constitution; and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature; the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.\u201d <em>Marbury v. Madison </em>(1803), 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 178, 2 L.Ed. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 10} Appellants also argue that their motion was unopposed and therefore should have been granted whether based on R.C. 2315.21 or Civ.R. 42(B). However, under the above cases, the trial court retains discretion to decide the issue. To constitute an abuse of discretion, the ruling must be unreasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 11} <em>Barnes </em>found that \u201c[t]he issues surrounding compensatory damages and punitive damages in this case were closely intertwined. [Appellant\u2019s] request to bifurcate would have resulted in two lengthy proceedings where essentially the same testimony given by the same witnesses would be presented. Knowing that bifurcation would require a tremendous amount of duplicate testimony, the presiding judge determined it was unwarranted.\u201d Id., 2006-Ohio-6266, 2006 WL 3446244, at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 12} Here, the malice evidence required for punitive damages was also the evidence used to rebut appellants\u2019 arguments that Luri was terminated for cause. The manufacture of evidence was intertwined in arguments relating to both compensatory and punitive damages. Appellants also argue that the trial court should not have allowed testimony about the financial position of appellants, but it was Krall, while on cross-examination, who introduced this line of questioning without prompting from Luri. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 bifurcation motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Application of Other Ohio Tort Reform Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 13} In their second and third assignments of error, appellants argue that the trial court committed plain error when it failed to apply various provisions of R.C. Chapter 2315. First, appellants claim that the trial court failed to instruct the jury pursuant to R.C. 2315.18(C).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, appellants never requested such an instruction and specifically agreed to their propriety before submission to the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">{\u00b6 14} We must first determine whether these provisions apply to an action based on R.C. 4112. In analyzing whether the punitive-damages caps within R.C. 2315.21 applied to a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty under R.C. 1701.59, Ohio\u2019s Southern District Court determined that they do not apply based on the language in R.C. 1701.59 and the intent of the legislature. <em>Kramer Consulting, Inc. v. McCarthy </em>(Mar. 8, 2006), S.D.Ohio No. C2-02-116, 2006 WL 581244. While the same reasoning would appear to apply to claims under R.C. 4112, the same court later held that \u201can action brought under Ohio Rev.Code 4112 is a \u2018tort action\u2019 as it is \u2018a civil action for damages for injury or loss to person or property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Geiger v. Pfizer, Inc. </em>(Apr. 15, 2009), S.D.Ohio No. 2:06-CV-636, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>2009 WL 1026479, quoting <em>Ridley v. Fed. Express, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82904, 2004-Ohio-2543, 2004 WL 1119591, \u00b6 89, citing former R.C. 2315.21(A)(1). This finding would include such actions within the umbra of Ohio\u2019s tort-reform provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">{\u00b6 15} The Ohio Supreme Court has also noted the types of actions to which R.C. 2315.18 does not apply and held them to include \u201ctort actions in the Court of Claims or against political subdivisions under R.C. Chapter 2744, * * * actions for wrongful death, medical or dental malpractice, or breach of contract. R.C. 2315.18(A)(7) and (H)(1) through (3).\u201d <em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 27, fn. 3. Absent from this list are actions based on statutory remedies, including, among others, discrimination suits. When coupled with the holdings above, R.C. 2315 et seq. applies to retaliatory-discharge actions brought under R.C. 4112, and the trial court was required to apply its provisions if appropriately asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2315.18(C) provides, \u201cIn determining an award of compensatory damages for noneconomic loss in a tort action, the trier of fact shall not consider any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(1) Evidence of a defendant\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, misconduct, or guilt;</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(2) Evidence of the defendant\u2019s wealth or financial resources;</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(3) All other evidence that is offered for the purpose of punishing the defendant, rather than offered for a compensatory purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">{\u00b6 20} Because appellants never requested instructions based on R.C. 2315.18, we review this assigned error under a plain-error analysis. \u201cIn appeals of civil cases, the plain-error doctrine is not favored and may be applied only in the extremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no objection was made at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process itself.\u201d <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 679 N.E.2d 1099, syllabus. Therefore, to constitute plain error, the error must be \u201cobvious and prejudicial error, neither objected to nor affirmatively waived,\u201d and \u201cif permitted, would have a material adverse effect on the character and public confidence in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hinkle v. Cleveland Clinic Found., </em>159 Ohio App.3d 351, 2004-Ohio-6853, 823 N.E.2d 945, \u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">{\u00b6 21} Here, appellants collaborated with the court and Luri in crafting the jury instructions given. Several courts of appeals have held that an agreed-upon jury instruction that forms the basis for error on appeal is invited error. See <em>State v. Briscoe, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89979, 2008-Ohio-6276, 2008 WL 5084720, \u00b6 33 (objection to an agreed jury instruction on appeal constituted invited error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>which was not grounds for reversal); <em>Merkl v. Seibert, </em>Hamilton App. Nos. C-080973 and C-081033, 2009-Ohio-5473, 2009 WL 3323621, \u00b6 48 (\u201cNot only did Merkl fail to object to the court\u2019s instruction, but she collaborated with the court and defense counsel on its wording and specifically agreed to the instruction as given. Merkl cannot take advantage of an error that she invited or induced the court to make\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">{\u00b6 22} Appellants did not submit such a limiting instruction or even mention R.C. Chapter 2315 when proposing jury instructions. Appellants\u2019 initial proposed jury instructions for compensatory damages stated, \u201c[Y]ou will decide by the greater weight of the evidence an amount of money that will reasonably compensate [Luri] for the actual damage proximately caused by the conduct of [appellants]. In deciding this amount, if any, you will consider the nature, character, seriousness, and duration of any emotional pain, suffering or inconvenience [Luri] may have experienced.\u201d The amended proposed instructions are substantially the same. Appellants never raised this issue before the trial court when it could have been addressed, and their oversight should not result in reversal. See <em>Friedland v. Djukic, </em>191 Ohio App.3d 278, 2010-Ohio-5777, 945 N.E.2d 1095, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">{\u00b6 23} Similarly, appellants\u2019 issue with the failure of the court to provide a jury interrogatory detailing findings on noneconomic damages was invited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The invited-error doctrine equally applies here where the jury instructions, verdict forms, and jury interrogatories were approved by appellants without even suggesting the now complained-of error. See <em>Siuda v. Howard, </em>Hamilton App. Nos. C-000656 and C-000687, 2002-Ohio-2292, 2002 WL 946188.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2315.18(D) states, \u201cIf a trial is conducted in a tort action to recover damages for injury or loss to person or property and a plaintiff prevails in that action, * * * the jury in a jury trial shall return a general verdict accompanied by answers to interrogatories, that shall specify all of the following: (1) The total compensatory damages recoverable by the plaintiff; (2) [t]he portion of the total compensatory damages that represents damages for economic loss; (3) [t]he portion of the total compensatory damages that represents damages for noneconomic loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Faieta v. World Harvest Church, </em>Franklin App. No. 08AP-527, 2008-Ohio-6959, 2008 WL 5423454, \u00b6 84-85, the Tenth District Court of Appeals noted that \u201cdefendants not only failed to object to the jury interrogatories and verdict forms, they invited the alleged error. Defendants drafted verdict forms and interrogatories and submitted them to the trial court. Like those actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>submitted to the jury, defendants\u2019 drafts asked the jury to determine the amount of damages awarded to \u2018plaintiffs\u2019 collectively, not individually, and they did not ask the jury to apportion each type of damages between each defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 26} In the present case, appellants submitted interrogatories and agreed upon the final versions submitted to the jury. Those interrogatories did not separate past and future economic damages, nor economic and noneconomic damages. Appellants\u2019 failure to raise the issue and their proffering of the relied-upon interrogatories invited the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 27} Appellants never sought the application of Ohio tort-reform provisions during trial, apart from bifurcation. It was only in postverdict motions that appellants asked the trial court for their application. This error on appellants\u2019 part should not serve as the basis for obtaining a new trial when it could have so easily been addressed and corrected if properly raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">{\u00b6 28} By failing to request an interrogatory distinguishing noneconomic damages, the trial court could not apply the damages limits set forth in R.C. 2315.18(B)(2),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which appellants requested in their posttrial motions. This failure was precipitated by appellants\u2019 submission of interrogatories and jury instructions that did not provide for such details. Appellants failed to raise these issues at the proper time, and their nescience should not result in a new trial. Accordingly, these assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Punitive-Damage Caps</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">{\u00b6 29} Appellants next argue that, when presented with a proper posttrial motion, the trial court \u201cfail[ed] to apply the Ohio Tort Reform provision in R.C. 2315.21(D)(2)(a), which require[d] the trial court to apply a cap on punitive damages equal to twice the amount of compensatory damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 2315.21(D)(2)(a) provides, \u201cIn a tort action, the trier of fact shall determine the liability of any defendant for punitive or exemplary damages and the amount of those damages. * * * Except as provided in division (D)(6) of this section, all of the following apply regarding any award of punitive or exemplary damages in a tort action: (a) The court shall not enter judgment for punitive or exemplary damages in excess of two times the amount of the compensatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>damages awarded to the plaintiff from that defendant, as determined pursuant to division (B)(2) or (3) of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 31} Our holding above, that Ohio tort reform provisions apply to discrimination actions, means that upon proper motion, the trial court was required to limit the award of punitive damages to two times the amount of compensatory damages. In this case, the trial court was not prevented from applying this provision by appellants\u2019 failure to call it to the court\u2019s attention when it had the ability to address such a request. This is because the trial court could apply the limit without engaging in the type of guessing game required in applying the compensatory-damage provisions. See <em>Srail v. RJF Internatl Corp. </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 689, 702, 711 N.E.2d 264. Therefore, the trial court erred in failing to limit the amount of punitive damages to $7 million. Luri argues that the amount of punitive damages should be calculated for each defendant, meaning that each would be subject to punitive damages up to $7 million. While there may be cases where Luri\u2019s calculation would apply, that is not the case here, where Luri advanced a single-employer theory of liability to impute wrongdoing to multiple business entities in this case. Because Luri can collect at most $3.5 million in compensatory damages, the trial court should have limited the amount of punitive damages to $7 million. Its failure to do so necessitates reversal and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 32} In their fifth assignment of error, appellants argue that the award of $43 million in punitive damages violates their due process rights under the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While our holding above limits this argument, it does not completely dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>BMW v. Gore </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809, the Supreme Court attempted to outline the permissible bounds of punitive-damage awards under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. It recognized, \u201cPunitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State\u2019s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition. In our federal system, States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case. Most States that authorize exemplary damages afford the jury similar latitude, requiring only that the damages awarded be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State\u2019s legitimate interests in punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>and deterrence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 568, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">{\u00b6 34} The court set forth three factors it used to analyze the punitive-damages award before it: The reprehensibility of the conduct, the disparity between the harm or potential harm suffered and the amount of the award, and the difference between the award and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. Id. at 575, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809. See also <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell </em>(2003), 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585. The Ohio Supreme Court has directed this court to apply the <em>Gore </em>factors to independently determine whether an award is excessive. <em>Barnes, </em>2006-Ohio-6266, 2006 WL 3446244, at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 35} Appellants demonstrated reprehensible conduct in this case. After Luri refused to engage in what he thought was discriminatory conduct, Bowen devised a plan to terminate him, fabricated evidence, and submitted this evidence during discovery to justify his actions. Krall then used this fabricated evidence for the same justification. After terminating Luri from a job in a specialized, consolidated industry, appellants refused to waive the noncompete clause in his employment contract, which further hampered Lurf s ability to support himself and his family. This conduct weighs heavily in favor of a large punitive-damage award and is the most important factor in the <em>Gore </em>analysis. See <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 575, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809. The trial court also found that this conduct demonstrated a pattern of repeated retaliatory and discriminatory conduct. Nothing in the record demonstrates to this court that this finding was incorrect. From an action plan calling for the termination or demotion of some of appellants\u2019 oldest employees, to fabricating evidence in an attempt to justify Luri\u2019s termination, there is evidence in the record supporting a pattern of conduct justifying substantial punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 36} The harm suffered by Luri was also significant in this case. Appellants would have this court determine that a ratio of compensatory to punitive damages of one-to-one is appropriate in this case because the harm was economic, and Luri was a well-paid executive who was not economically vulnerable. While Luri did earn a substantial salary, as the trial court noted, citing <em>Wightman v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 431, 715 N.E.2d 546, a \u201cpunitive damages award is more about a defendant\u2019s behavior than the plaintiffs loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">{\u00b6 37} Here, comparable jury verdicts imposed where a pattern of persistent conduct was shown demonstrate that a two-to-one ratio is not beyond the bounds of due process. <em>Merrick v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co. </em>(D.Nev.2008), 594 F.Supp.2d 1168, 1190; <em>Burns v. Prudential Secs., Inc., </em>167 Ohio App.3d 809, 2006-Ohio-3550, 857 N.E.2d 621. This court has also upheld a five-to-one ratio in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>an employment-discrimination case. <em>Griffin v. MDK Food Serv., Inc., </em>155 Ohio App.3d 698, 2004-Ohio-133, 803 N.E.2d 834, \u00b6 49, 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">{\u00b6 38} In this case, appellants\u2019 behavior speaks to an award of punitive damages in the full amount authorized by the legislature. On remand, the trial court should feel free to enter an amount of punitive damages up to the bounds imposed by R.C. 2315.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Prejudgment Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 39} Appellants finally argue that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest on the full amount of compensatory damages when that amount included pay Luri would not have yet earned, or \u201cfuture damages.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 1343.03(C)(1) states, \u201cInterest on a judgment, decree, or order for the payment of money rendered in a civil action based on tortious conduct and not settled by agreement of the parties, shall be computed from the date the cause of action accrued to the date on which the money is paid if, upon motion of any party to the action, the court determines at a hearing held subsequent to the verdict or decision in the action that the party required to pay the money failed to make a good faith effort to settle the case and that the party to whom the money is to be paid did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">{\u00b6 41} This statute encourages the \u201csettlement of meritorious claims, and the compensation of a successful party for losses suffered as the result of the failure of an opposing party to exercise good faith in negotiating a settlement.\u201d <em>Lovewell v. Physicians Ins. Co. of Ohio </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 143,147, 679 N.E.2d 1119. \u201cTherefore, an injured party in a tort action is, under appropriate circumstances, entitled to recover interest from the date the cause of action accrues.\u201d <em>Andre v. Case Design, Inc., </em>154 Ohio App.3d 323, 2003-Ohio-4960, 797 N.E.2d 132, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">{\u00b6 42} Appellants did not request that the jury parse the amount of compensatory damages into any categories. As with the application of provisions of Ohio\u2019s tort-reform statutes, appellants invited this error by submitting instructions and interrogatories that did not separate out future damages. Appellants\u2019 error will not induce this court \u201cto speculate concerning the specifics of the jury\u2019s award.\u201d <em>Srail, </em>126 Ohio App.3d at 702, 711 N.E.2d 264. This assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">{\u00b6 43} Appellants caused a great many of the supposed errors complained of in this case, which should not result in reversal. However, on proper motion, the trial court should have applied the damages caps set forth in R.C. 2315.21(D)(2)(a). Accordingly, this case must be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">{\u00b6 44} This cause is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b729-7\">Gallagher, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b729-8\">Kilbane, A.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\">.

I would conclude that plaintiff is entitled to $7 million in punitive damages <em>from each defendant </em>rather than $7 million in total punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">{\u00b6 46} R.C. 2315.21(D) sets forth certain limits on punitive damages and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-12\">(2) Except as provided in division (D)(6) of this section, all of the following apply regarding any award of punitive or exemplary damages in a tort action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuL\">(a) The court shall not enter judgment for punitive or exemplary damages in excess of two times the amount of the compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff from that defendant, as determined pursuant to division (B)(2) or (3) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">{\u00b6 47} The defendants maintain that because the trial court determined that they were jointly and severally liable to Luri in the amount of $3.5 million, this is the amount \u201cawarded to the plaintiff.\u201d Therefore, defendants claim that plaintiffs recovery of punitive damages is limited to two times this amount or a total of $7 million in punitive damages. This interpretation omits key terms of the statute, however, which calculates the punitive damages as \u201ctwo times the amount of the compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff <em>from that defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420 (\u201cThe statute limits punitive damages in tort actions to a maximum of two times the total amount of compensatory damages awarded to a plaintiff per defendant\u201d). The determination of joint and several liability does not alter this analysis, as plaintiff has been awarded compensatory damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u201cfrom that defendant.\u201d There is no provision for limiting the awards where there are joint and several tortfeasors. I therefore dissent insofar as the majority has limited plaintiffs recovery to punitive damages in this matter to $7 million.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
