In December, 1943, one O\u2019Brien, the plaintiff\u2019s president and treasurer, talked with one Stafford, the defendant\u2019s real estate representative. O\u2019Brien said that he had a customer he believed the defendant\u2019s building would suit, and tried to get Stafford to name a price. Stafford said they would want at least $200,000. At this meeting \"no business was accomplished.\u201d Later in that month O\u2019Brien wrote Stafford that one Bowe, president of the Herrick Company, \"was seriously interested in the building\u201d; to which Stafford replied, \"Unfortunately, we are not equipped for the filing of names of prospects with us and it is our policy not to accept the filing of names of prospects unless they are accompanied by bona fide offers and reasonable amounts of earnest money.\u201d On March 11, 1944, O\u2019Brien wrote the defendant: \"It has come to my attention that there are changes contemplated in the handling of your real estate and I would like very much to discuss with you the handling of your Mt. Vernon Street, Boston, property. We have two corporations now definitely interested in the purchase of the property and believe we can handle it to your decided advantage.\u201d On March 13, 1944, the defendant replied: \u201cYour letter of March 11th refers to the 'handling\u2019 of our Mt. Vernon Street, Boston, property. We presume you refer to the sale thereof. We are willing to consider sale of this property, but as stated in letter dated April 14, 1943, from . . . our Boston office to you, we do not care to list the property or create an agency with respect thereto. We will be glad to consider sympathetically any firm offer you have for the property and you can see the writer in New York at practically any time.\u201d In \"the early part of 1944, it may have been May,\u201d O\u2019Brien again saw Stafford and tried to get him to name a definite price, \"but it then appeared that any price would have to exceed $250,000.\u201d O\u2019Brien personally never showed the property to anyone with the possible exception of Bowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>One Olinder, a real estate broker employed by the plaintiff, showed the outside of the property to one Appel, president of the A &amp; P Corrugated Box Company, and arranged with the defendant \u201cto get inside\u201d after' September 15, 1944, but did not show Appel the inside. He told Appel the price would have to be over $200,000. In June, 1945, Stafford told Olinder that \u201cthe price would have to be better than $285,000.\u201d On June 11 Olinder wrote Stafford for plans of the property, which were subsequently received. In the meantime he telephoned Stafford that his customer was the A &amp; P Corrugated Box Company. He took the plans to Appel, who said he was not interested in $285,000, and as a consequence he had no further dealings with him. Previously, on September 20, 1944, Olinder had written' Stafford that he had a prospective buyer, the B &amp; B Box Company, and asked for permission to inspect the premises. On the following day the defendant had responded, granting permission to inspect, and concluding, \u201cYou will understand of course that your letter as well as this reply do not constitute the registering of the name of your client with us.\u201d Later Olinder telephoned Stafford that there was a typographical error in his letter, and that he knew of no B &amp; B Box Company. In September, 1945, the A &amp; P Corrugated Box Company purchased the property through another broker for $225,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\">The foregoing is the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The judge was right in directing a verdict for the defendant. The property was not listed with the plaintiff, nor was the plaintiff employed by the defendant as a broker to sell. See <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Kazajian, </em>255 Mass. 459, 461; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>256 Mass. 555, 557; <em>Corleto </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>320 Mass. 612, 616. In accordance with the correspondence, the plaintiff, at most, could have submitted \u201cany firm offer,\u201d but it never did even that. Indeed, it would seem that it never had one to submit. It is plain that the plaintiff could not rightly have been found entitled to a commission from the defendant. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>9 Allen, 350. <em>McKeon </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>254 Mass. 142, 144-145. <em>McAuslan </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>254 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Mass. 363. <em>Yurgelun </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>282 Mass. 571. <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>306 Mass. 202, 210. In <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Ivers &amp; Pond Piano Co. </em>317 Mass. 478, the only case cited by the plaintiff, there was an express employment of the broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
