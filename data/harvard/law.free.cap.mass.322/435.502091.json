Lack of consent is shown by the allegation that the plaintiff never intended to convey the land in Franklin. That the alteration preceded the defendant\u2019s certificate is found in the allegation that the defendant falsely certified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>plaintiff appeared and acknowledged the deed a copy of which in the allegedly altered form is annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">The acknowledgment was necessary to enable the deed to be recorded. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 183, \u00a7 29. <em>McOuatt </em>v. <em>McOuatt, </em>320 Mass. 410, 413, and cases cited. But neither acknowledgment nor recording could confer validity upon an invalid instrument. <em>New England Bond &amp; Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>270 Mass. 107, 111. The deed did not take effect as the deed of the plaintiff because, on the allegations, after signing and before the purported acknowledgment there was inserted the description of the land in Franklin. This would not bind the plaintiff even without fraud. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>2 Gray, 556, 557. <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>Greenman, </em>283 Mass. 601, 609, and cases cited. Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 1913. See 2 Am. Jur., Alteration, of Instruments, \u00a7 55; 26 C. J. S., Deeds, \u00a7 68. Compare <em>Moelle </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>148 U. S. 21, 27; <em>Havens </em>v. <em>Osborn, </em>9 Stew. (N. J.) 426. The making of a false certificate as notary public, as alleged, would be a violation of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 267, \u00a7 1. Under the general averment of damages the plaintiff can recover such damages as are the direct result of the defendant\u2019s wrongful act. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>223 Mass. 568, 573. <em>Antokol </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>248 Mass. 393, 395. <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Maffei, </em>309 Mass. 237, 238. See <em>Sherlag </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>200 Mass. 232, 236; <em>Damiano </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Liability Co. </em>316 Mass. 626, 629. Upon the allegations, the plaintiff has sustained as damage the expense' of removing a cloud from the record title. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Loud, </em>115 Mass. 94, 97. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>188 Mass. 163, 170. <em>Solis </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>205 Mass. 350, 352. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>42 W. Va. 465. This would include any necessary steps to acquire possession of the land. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 240, \u00a7 1. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>208 Mass. 391, 392. <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>300 Mass. 17, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">It is unnecessary to consider other grounds of damage argued by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The order sustaining the demurrer is- reversed, and an order is to be entered overruling the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
