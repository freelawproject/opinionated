After verdicts for the defendant, the plaintiffs bring their bill of exceptions to the admission of certain evidence and to the denial of their motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">There was evidence tending to show these facts: The vessel was new, the hull having been launched at Essex only a week before the injury to the minor plaintiff. During the launching, when the hull was partly in the water, it suddenly tipped toward the starboard side and struck a rock a few feet from the water\u2019s edge but righted itself. The \u201conly visible damage to be observed\u201d was some injury to sheathing where the hull came in contact with the rock. The vessel was towed to Gloucester, where the owner, according to his testimony, informed the defendant\u2019s manager of the accident at the launching and of the visible damage and arranged with him to have the vessel hauled out upon the defendant\u2019s, railway for repair of the visible damage and \u201cdetermination of any further and additional damage to the bottom of the vessel.\u201d The hauling out was entirely in the control of the defendant. Hauling out is accomplished by means of an engine and a chain attached to a cradle which is lowered into the water beneath the vessel and then pulled up the track with the vessel upon it. Before the cradle is lowered \u201ckeel blocks\u201d are placed upon it upon which the \u201cshoe\u201d at the bottom of the vessel is to rest. These \u201ckeel blocks\u201d bear, or should bear, practically the entire weight of the vessel, but \u201cbilge blocks\u201d are also provided to be pulled in against the sides of the vessel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>after the entire \"shoe\u201d is \"grounded\u201d firmly upon the \"keel blocks,\u201d in order to prevent the vessel from tipping over. Upon the occasion in question, when the vessel had been hauled approximately two thirds of the way up the railway, it suddenly tipped over on it's port side, apparently forcing out the \"bilge blocks.\u201d The minor plaintiff, who was employed by the owner to work on the completion of the vessel, was permitted by the defendant to remain on board while the vessel was hauled out. When the vessel tipped, a stack of lumber fell upon him, causing the injuries complained of. After the accident it was discovered that a section of the \"shoe\u201d about fourteen feet long near the stern was \"twisted and bent up \u00b0to the side of the keel.\u201d There was evidence that the \"shoe\u201d was insufficiently bolted; that the bolts were pulled out or bent; that about half of them were rusty and half were not; that a small piece that had been set into the \u201cshoe\u201d was missing; and that the space so left and \u201cthe top of the shoe\u201d were full of dirt and mud.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">Further details of the evidence need not be stated. The plaintiffs\u2019 case rested upon the contention that the tipping of the vessel upon the railway was caused by negligence of the defendant in blocking and handling the vessel. The defendant contended that it was the result of defective construction of the \u201cshoe\u201d and of a previous injury to the \"shoe\u201d at the time of the launching which was not visible until the vessel was hauled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The evidence to the admission of which the plaintiffs excepted consisted of testimony both of observed physical facts and of opinions from an amply qualified ship builder and foreman whose position required him to supervise carpentry and to look after haulings and launchings. In substance this evidence consisted of a description of the condition of the \u201cshoe\u201d as observed by the witness a few hours after the accident and of the witness\u2019s opinions that the \u201cshoe\u201d was not properly fastened in the first place; that when the vessel went over at the launching \u201cshe started that-shoe\u201d and as a result of that it canted when grounded in the cradle; that the \"shoe\u201d was on an angle of probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>forty-five degrees and \"tripped and threw the boat\u201d; that when the weight came on the \"shoe\u201d \"it let go\u201d; that \"she started that shoe when she went over in launching\u201d at Essex; and that it- remained partly detached until the vessel was hauled out on the railway at Gloucester.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">In the course of receiving this evidence many exceptions were taken to particular questions and answers. We have examined these, but it would be unprofitable to discuss them in detail. Clearly the witness\u2019s own observation of the condition of the \u201cshoe\u201d was competent. There was no error in admitting the opinion evidence of the same witness. There is no prescribed formality for the admission of expert testimony. All that is necessary is that the subject matter be one about which special knowledge beyond that possessed by the ordinary juryman will aid the jury in their deliberations, and that a person possessing such knowledge give opinions pertinent to the issues of the case founded upon facts which either are conceded or could warrantably be found upon other evidence. The judge may order or permit the use of any proper method that conforms to these requirements. This whole subject was fully treated by Rugg, C.J., in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, at pages 72 to 78. There is no occasion to repeat what was there said. The record in this case discloses no failure to observe the foregoing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">There was no error in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for a new trial. They presented no new question of law. No abuse of discretion appears. <em>Kinnear </em>v. <em>General Mills, Inc. </em>308 Mass. 344, 348-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We have not considered whether this was a case of a maritime tort, since even if it was, the jurisdiction of the court was not affected and no question of comparative negligence or other question peculiar to maritime law was presented. <em>Thorneal </em>v. <em>Cape Pond Ice Co. </em>321 Mass. 528, 532-534.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
