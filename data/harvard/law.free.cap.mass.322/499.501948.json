The bill alleges that the workers\u2019 union was engaged in an unlawful strike and that it had entered into an unlawful combination and conspiracy with the fishermen\u2019s union to interfere with and injure the plaintiff\u2019s busi-n\u00e9ss, and sought an injunction against interference with its business by picketing or otherwise. From interlocutory and final decrees enjoining the defendants, the defendants appealed. The judge made findings of material facts and the evidence is reported. The defendants also bring certain questions here by exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">The findings of the judge included the following: The plaintiff is a corporation which operates a fish cannery in Gloucester. The workers\u2019 union is an unincorporated labor organization, the members of which are employed in processing and canning fish. The fishermen\u2019s union is a labor organization embracing workmen who constitute the crews of fishing boats operating out of Gloucester. Both unions are affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. On September 16, 1942, the plaintiff and the workers\u2019 union entered into an agreement which ceased to be operative after March 31, 1943.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the expiration of this agreement no contract existed between the plaintiff and the workers\u2019 union.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The defendant White, a business agent of the workers\u2019 union and'the officer in charge of its affairs, was desirous of entering into a new agreement with the plaintiff. The contract proposed by him was to include provisions that the workers\u2019 union was to be the exclusive bargaining agent of the plaintiff\u2019s employees, that all of its employees be required to join the union,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that he (White) be given unrestricted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>rights of visitation to the plaintiff\u2019s factory. There was no dispute between the plaintiff and the workers\u2019 union with respect to working conditions and wages. The wages paid by the plaintiff were for the most part higher than the union schedule. At the time that these negotiations were being conducted the vast majority of the plaintiff\u2019s employees were not members of the workers\u2019 union and the plaintiff was unwilling to recognize it as the exclusive bargaining agency of its employees. The workers\u2019 union at all times refused to permit an election to be conducted by either the state or national labor relations board for the purpose of determining whether the employees wished it to be their exclusive bargaining agent. \u201cThe great majority of the employees of the plaintiff did not wish to be represented by . . . [the workers\u2019 union] and did not wish it to be the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of the plaintiff\u2019s employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">Failing to reach an agreement with the plaintiff, the workers\u2019 union in accordance with the war labor disputes act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> gave notice of the existence of a labor dispute which threatened to interrupt war production, and upon the expiration of the statutory period of thirty days the national labor relations board caused a vote of the plaintiff\u2019s employees to be taken by secret ballot to determine whether they desired to permit an interruption of war time production. Fifty-one employees voted in the negative and five in the affirmative. Immediately upon learning of the vote, the workers\u2019 union called a strike and proceeded to picket the plaintiff\u2019s premises. On the first day of the strike all of the plaintiff\u2019s employees crossed the picket line. Thereafter only five employees, all members of the workers\u2019 union, stayed out on strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">During the period that picketing continued no Gloucester boat manned by crews which were members of the fishermen\u2019s union delivered any fish to the plaintiff. Due to the fact that the crews of practically all of the fishing boats operating out of Gloucester were members of the fishermen\u2019s union, that union had a monopoly of such labor and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>captain or owner of a fishing boat could attempt to deliver fish to the plaintiff without being faced with labor trouble with that union. The judge ruled that the strike called by the workers\u2019 union was illegal and that the action of the fishermen\u2019s union \u201cconstituted an illegal combination in the nature of a sympathetic strike or boycott.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\">No evidence was introduced touching the issue of damages, and it was stipulated by the parties that the failure to present any evidence on this issue was without prejudice to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover damages in an action at law. There is no evidence that the picketing at any time was other than peaceful, or that the number of pickets employed was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Facts in addition to those hereinbefore stated will be mentioned hereinafter as occasion requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The findings of the judge establish that one of the purposes, if not the principal one, of the strike was to obtain a closed shop. This finding is supported by evidence. But even if we assume, as the defendants argue, that the evidence required a finding that the workers\u2019 union sought a union shop (one where the employees who have been hired by the plaintiff must join the union after they have been in its employ a specified period of time), it would not affect the result. It is settled by our decisions that a strike either for a closed shop or for a union shop is illegal. This subject has been fully discussed in the recent case of <em>Colonial Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>321 Mass. 495, where the authorities are collected. What was said there need not be repeated. That decision is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On behalf of the workers\u2019 union, however, it is urged that to enjoin it from picketing in the circumstances here disclosed would violate its right of free speech under the Constitution of the United States. In support of this contention several recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States are relied on.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to a similar con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tention in <em>Colonial Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>321 Mass. 495, we said at page 501, \u201cWe do not understand, however, that that court has held that picketing in support of an unlawful objective cannot be enjoined. See <em>Carpenters &amp; Joiners Union of America, Local No. 213 </em>v. <em>Ritter\u2019s Cafe, </em>315 U. S. 722, 727-728; <em>Bakery &amp; Pastry Drivers &amp; Helpers Local 802 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Wohl, </em>315 U. S. 769, 775; 56 Harv. L. Rev. 180, Teller, Picketing and Free Speech; 56 Harv. L. Rev. 513, 529, Dodd, Picketing and Free Speech: A Dissent. Until there is an unequivocal pronouncement to that effect we adhere to the view of the law laid down in our own decisions.\u201d See <em>Saveall </em>v. <em>Demers, ante, </em>70, 73-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\">That part of the decree which enjoins the fishermen\u2019s union is based upon the findings that both unions were engaged in an unlawful conspiracy to achieve an unlawful purpose and that the action of the fishermen\u2019s union constituted \u201can illegal combination in the nature of a sympathetic strike or boycott.\u201d Since the fishermen\u2019s union earnestly challenges these findings, it becomes necessary to consider whether they are supported by the evidence. The pertinent evidence touching this issue was as follows: The defendant White told O\u2019Hara, an officer of the plaintiff, that if he did not sign a contract with his union (the workers\u2019 union) the plaintiff would not get any fish. The agents representing the fishermen\u2019s union at Gloucester at the time of the strike were Gomes and Sparrow. On the day the strike began the defendant White met Sparrow and informed him that the plaintiff\u2019s premises were being picketed and asked what he (Sparrow) could do about it. Sparrow said that a boat, the \u201cCatherine,\u201d was in, that he thought the captain was a union member, and that he would go down to see him. When he got to the wharf the \u201cCatherine\u201d had not arrived so he wrote a message on a card and gave it to a picket who subsequently delivered it to one Clark, the captain of the \u201cCatherine.\u201d The message was as follows: \u201cCapt. Clark. Don\u2019t land any fish at Davis Brother wharf by order Fishermens Union. John Sparrow, Delegate.\u201d The captain, who was a member of the fisher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>men\u2019s union, upon receiving the message regarded it as an order and went elsewhere. Sparrow testified that members of the fishermen\u2019s union were not permitted to cross a picket line and if they did they could \u201cbe brought up on charges.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gomes while the strike was on told O\u2019Hara that if he signed a contract with the workers\u2019 union he would be \u201call right\u201d but otherwise he was \u201cnot going to get fish.\u201d McHugh, Who was secretary-treasurer of the fishermen\u2019s' union, said to O\u2019Hara while the trial of the case'was in progress, \u201cWell, Jack, haven\u2019t we put you out of business yet?\u201d McHugh stated that the position of the fishermen\u2019s union in a case of picketing by another union was that it's members were \u201cnot to reason why\u201d and that those who crossed a picket line would be expelled. A few days after the strike started Sparrow at a hearing in court authorized a stipulation to be entered into on behalf of himself, Gomes and the fishermen\u2019s union that \u201cin lieu of an injunction the said union and the said delegates will withdraw and cancel all stop orders and instructions heretofore issued directing or requesting the crews or captains of any fishing vessels not to deliver or unload fish at the plaintiff\u2019s wharf or premises, and that they will notify such captains and crews hereof as the plaintiff may request, and that the said union and the said delegates will not in any manner hereafter interfere with any delivery of fish to the plaintiff.\u201d The finding of the judge that this stipulation was not lived up to by Sparrow or Gomes was supported by the evidence. Until the picketing was enjoined no Gloucester boat with crews who were members of the fishermen\u2019s union brought fish to the plaintiff\u2019s wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\">We are of opinion that the judge could find \u2014 as in effect he did \u2014 that the officers and members of the fishermen\u2019s union conspired and combined with the workers' union to accomplish an unlawful purpose and that he rightly ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief against both unions. He also could find that wh\u00e1t the officers did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>on behalf of their respective unions was not in excess of their authority. <em>National Overall Dry Cleaning Co. </em>v. <em>Yavner, </em>321 Mass. 434, 437. Doubtless the members of the fishermen\u2019s union were at liberty to refuse to deliver fish to the plaintiff if they saw fit. See <em>Robitaille </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>283 Mass. 27, 33; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Shubert Holding Co. </em>316 Mass. 470, 475; <em>Boylston Housing Corp. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>321 Mass. 538, 548-551; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 762 and \u00a7 765, comment a. But they could not by concerted action refuse to deliver fish where the purpose of such refusal was to injure the plaintiff and to assist the workers\u2019 union in its strike for an unlawful objective, namely, the obtaining of a closed shop. A concerted refusal to deal under such circumstances cannot be said to have been in \"the exercise of an equal and competing right\u201d <em>(Saveall </em>v. <em>Demers, ante, </em>70, 72.) or to \"have the justification of competition or of self-interest\u201d <em>(Robitaille </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>283 Mass. 27, 33) and is tortious. Teller, Labor Disputes &amp; Collective Bargaining (1940) \u00a7 147. <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Carpenter Contractors\u2019 Association of Chicago, </em>305 Ill. 331. See <em>Carew </em>v. <em>Rutherford, </em>106 Mass. 1; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>217 Mass. 351; <em>Cornellier </em>v. <em>Haverhill Shoe Manufacturers\u2019 Association, </em>221 Mass. 554, 559-561; <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>242 Mass. 471, 479-481; <em>Armstrong Cork &amp; Insulation Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>276 Mass. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\">There can be no doubt that the controversy between the plaintiff and the workers\u2019 union falls within the definition of a labor dispute contained in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 149, \u00a7 20C, inserted by St. 1935, c. 407, \u00a7 3. Consequently the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 9A, inserted by St. 1935, c. 407, \u00a7 4, relative to injunctions in labor disputes are applicable. The judge, as the findings set forth in the footnote indicate, found that there had been compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 9A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Some of these findings are chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>lenged by the defendants. They contend that the plaintiff failed to make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute as required by \u00a7 9A (4). This section provides that \u201cNo . . . injunctive relief shall be granted to any complainant' . . . who has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle such dispute either by negotiation or with the aid of any available governmental machinery of mediation or voluntary arbitration.\u201d We assume in favor of the defendants, without decision, that there must be a reasonable effort to settle the dispute by all of the methods mentioned and not merely by one of them. See <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, Enterprise Lodge, No. 27 </em>v. <em>Toledo, Peoria &amp; Western Railroad, </em>321 U. S. 50, construing a similar provision (U. S. C. [1940 ed.] Title 29, \u00a7 108) in the Norris-LaGuardia act. The judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiff \u201chas made every reasonable effort to settle . . . [the] dispute\u201d satisfied the requirements of the statute and was not plainly wrong. We have examined the evidence with care relating to this aspect of the case and are of opinion that it was sufficient to suplport the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\">The finding that \u201csubstantial and irreparable injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property will follow\u201d was supported by the evidence, which shows that from eighty to ninety per cent of the plaintiff\u2019s supply of fish comes from Gloucester and that while the picketing continued none of the Gloucester boats which customarily supplied the plaintiff with fish docked at the plaintiff\u2019s wharf. These facts, taken together with the admissions in pleadings of the defendants to the effect that they would \u201cfind it difficult\u201d to respond in money damages, were sufficient, we think, to support the judge\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The defendants contend that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief because of failure to comply with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 9A (2), which provides that the hearing at which an injunction is sought \u201cshall be held after due and personal notice thereof has been given, in such manner as the court shall direct, to all known persons against whom relief is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>sought, <em>and also to the chief of those public officials of the city or town within which the unlawful acts have been threatened or committed charged with the duty to protect the complainant's property\" </em>(emphasis supplied). The public officials mentioned in the statute were not made parties nor does it appear that they were notified. The statute, however, does not require that they be made parties; it requires only notice. In the circumstances obtaining here no notice was necessary. Obviously the purpose of such notice is to make certain in cases where an injunction is sought to prevent physical damage to the plaintiff\u2019s property that there will be proof that those charged with the duty of protecting such property are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection. See \u00a7 9A (1) (e). Where, as here, there was no evidence of acts involving a breach of the peace or violation of the criminal law warranting an arrest, the public officials charged with the duty to protect the plaintiff\u2019s property were obviously unable to be of any assistance. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Schwachman, </em>301 Mass. 573, 582. Notice in these circumstances would have been an empty formality. <em>Boise Street Car Co. </em>v. <em>Van Avery, </em>61 Idaho, 502, 516. <em>Weist </em>v. <em>Dirks, </em>215 Ind. 568, 570-571.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\">The defendants urge that the bond filed by the plaintiff did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 9A (2) and (3). But it is not necessary to decide this question. \u201cThe \u2018undertaking with adequate security \u2019 required from a plaintiff by subdivisions (2) and (3) is a condition of a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, but not of in-junctive relief given after a final determination of the merits establishing that the issuance of the injunction is neither \u2018improvident\u2019 nor \u2018erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Schwachman, </em>301 Mass. 573, 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The plaintiff argues that there was no labor dispute between it and the fishermen\u2019s union within the meaning of those words in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 149, \u00a7 20C, and that therefore compliance with the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 9A, was not necessary. But we need not decide this question inasmuch as we have already held that the requirements of \u00a7 9A have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>A few minor points remain for consideration. The defendants pleaded in abatement that after the bill was filed the plaintiff had caused the controversy to be taken over by the national war labor board; that this board assumed full jurisdiction; and that its jurisdiction was exclusive. The judge rightly overruled the plea. \u201cThe National War Labor Board is not, under the law, vested with judicial functions, nor does it have the power to enforce its determinations, called \u2018directives/ upon the parties to a controversy before it. It is. not a substitute for the courts, and the pendency of a controversy before it is not a bar to a suit in the courts.\u201d <em>Oil Workers International Union, Local No. 463 </em>v. <em>Texoma Natural Gas Co. </em>146 Fed. (2d) 62, 65 (C. C. A. 5). To the same effect are <em>American Brake Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Grybas, </em>63 Fed. Sup. 414 (D. C. D. of Mass.), and <em>Pearson Candy Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Waits, </em>27 Cal. (2d) 615, 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">The defendants\u2019 exceptions must be overruled. These seek to raise the question that the judge who issued the preliminary injunction was without jurisdiction to do so. When a final decree has been entered a preliminary injunction has served its purpose, and ordinarily on an appeal from a final decree there is no occasion to consider whether the granting of such an injunction was proper. <em>Lowell Bar Association </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 176, 189-191. But in view of the remedy given to a defendant by \u00a7 9A (2) and (3) in the event of an erroneous or improvident issuance of a preliminary injunction, it becomes necessary for us to consider whether it was properly granted. See also \u00a7 9A (6). It appears that the judge who granted the preliminary injunction heard the case in Essex County where the bill was filed. The case was heard in open court on the testimony of witnesses with opportunity for cross-examination in compliance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 9A (1). Upon a report of the case to a justice of this court under \u00a7 9A (6), the interlocutory decree granting the preliminary injunction was reversed because there was no express finding as required by \u00a7 9A (1) (c) that as to each item of relief granted greater injury would be inflicted upon the plaintiff by the denial of relief than would be inflicted upon the defendants by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>granting of relief. The case was remanded to the Superior Court \u201cwithout decision upon the question whether the Superior Court may, upon evidence already heard, make new findings and enter a new interlocutory decree, or whether it must, before entering any new interlocutory^, decree, hear evidence de nova.\u201d The judge who was then sitting in another county reconsidered the case upon the evidence already heard and made new findings of fact, and a new interlocutory decree granting a preliminary injunction was entered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon a report to a justice of this court that decree was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\">The judge could reconsider the case in chambers on the evidence already heard. Rule 47 of the Superior Court (1932). <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 601-602. He . was not obliged to hear the case de nova. Nor was he without jurisdiction to reconsider the case because of the fact that he was then sitting in another county. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 213, \u00a7 5. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 18. Rule 68 of the Superior Court (1932). See <em>Ripley </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>162 Mass. 450, 452-453. This conclusion is not at variance with anything decided in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Handren, </em>261 Mass. 294, and <em>Stoneman </em>v. <em>Coakley, </em>266 Mass. 64, on which the defendants rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Questions of evidence have not been argued and are treated as waived. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>243 Mass. 472, 508. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>317 Mass. 274, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">We have considered all of the questions argued by the defendants and have dealt with such of them as require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-5\"> In this agreement, which is before us as an exhibit, the plaintiff recognized the workers\u2019 union as the exclusive bargaining agency for all of its employees, with certain exceptions not here material.
