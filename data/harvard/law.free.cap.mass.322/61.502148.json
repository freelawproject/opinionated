L. (Ter. Ed.) e. 152, \u00a7 65, as most recently amended by St. 1943, c. 367, which in part reads, \u201cFor every case of personal injury resulting in death covered by this chapter, except silicosis or other occupational pulmonary dust disease, when there are no dependents, the insurer shall pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>into the treasury of the commonwealth five hundred dollars. Such payments shall constitute a special fund in the custody of the state treasurer, who shall make payments therefrom upon the written order of the department [of industrial accidents] for the purposes set forth in section thirty-seven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The reviewing board aflirmed and adopted the findings of the single member. John Fallon received an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment as a laborer in the service of the city of Worcester by being struck by an automobile owned by one Wagner. The injury resulted in death, and he left no dependents.. The administrator of his estate was paid a sum in full settlement of all claims against Wagner by an insurance company under an automobile liability policy. The city, having accepted the provisions of St. 1913, c. 807, was required to pay the compensation provided by the workmen\u2019s compensation act. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 69, as amended. This includes payments into the special fund provided in \u00a7 65, as amended. <em>Hurley\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 46. <em>Greena-way\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The city contends that it should not be required to make payment in the present case, because the words \u201ccovered by this chapter\u201d in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 65, as amended, make applicable the provisions of c. 152, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 432, the purpose of which is \u201cto compel the employee to elect whether he will proceed against the person who caused his injury or accept compensation, and if he accepts compensation to preserve for the benefit of the insurer the cause of action against such person.\u201d <em>Reidy </em>v. <em>Old Colony Gas Co. </em>315 Mass. 631, 632. Accordingly, it is urged that the settlement of the tort claim was an election which precludes payment into the State fund under \u00a7 65, as amended. See <em>Tocci\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 221, 224; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>305 Mass. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">This argument wholly overlooks the purpose of \u00a7 65, which is to provide a fund to help pay the compensation for a second serious injury of certain specified types to the same employee. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 37, as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>by St. 1937, c. 321. See <em>Branconnier\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 273; <em>Hebron\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 427, 430. Sections 65 and 37 had their origin in \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 2, respectively, of St. 1919, c. 272, entitled \u201cAn Act to establish a special fund in the custody of the treasurer and receiver general for the purpose of paying additional compensation' to certain injured employees.\u201d In \u00a7 1 of that act the reference was to \u201cevery case of personal injury resulting in death, covered by the provisions of chapter seven hundred and fifty-one of the acts of nineteen hundred and eleven and acts in amendment thereof and in addition thereto.\u201d In G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65, these words assumed their present form, \u201cevery case of personal injury resulting in death covered by this chapter.\u201d The provisions of St. 1919, c. 272, were recommended in the report of a special recess committee on workmen\u2019s compensation (Sen. Doc. No. 334, Feb. 1919, pages 12-16, 48), and were based upon a New York statute (N. Y. Laws of 1916, c. 622, \u00a7 15, subdiv. 7, as amended by N. Y. Laws of 1917, c. 705, \u00a7 3) under which the obligation to make payment to the special fund was absolute and bore no relation to the amount of compensation for the injury resulting in death. <em>State Industrial Commission </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>222 N. Y. 363. <em>State Treasurer </em>v. <em>West Side Trucking Co. </em>233 N. Y. 202, 205. <em>Stemffler </em>v. <em>J. Rheinfrank &amp; Co. </em>190 App. Div. (N. Y.) 163. In recommending the Massachusetts provision, which originally required a payment of $100 to the fund,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the special recess committee computed the probable adequacy of the aggregate of such payments by using as a multiplier the total number of deaths of employees, who were covered by workmen\u2019s compensation but who left no dependents, which occurred during a five year period. Sen. Doc. No. 334 (Feb. 1919) pages 14-16. Obviously no deduction was then contemplated in any case, including one where the personal representatives of the deceased employee might elect to sue a third person responsible for the death. This legislative purpose was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>reasonable, as in every case of death without dependents the insurer receives something in the nature of a windfall. By St. 1939, c. 465, \u00a7 3, the Legislature for the first time included in \u00a7 65, as amended, an exception in cases of death occasioned by \u201csilicosis or other occupational pulmonary dust disease.\u201d The absence of any other exception impresses us as significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The words \u201ccovered by this chapter\u201d in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 65, as amended, embrace all deaths of employees by reason of injuries arising out of. and in the course of the employment except those occasioned by \u201csilicosis or other occupational pulmonary dust disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-3\"> The amount of payment was increased to $250 by St. 1935, c. 395, to $500 by St. 1936, c. 162, and to $1,000 bv St. 1937, c. 394, and was reduced to $500 by St. 1943, c. 367.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
