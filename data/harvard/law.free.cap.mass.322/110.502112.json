L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">The defendant filed a motion, which was allowed, that the plaintiff be ordered to file a replication stating what part, if any, of the answer she admitted or denied. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 34. The plaintiff filed a replication, in which she denied that she was an employee of the defendant at the time of the accident, and alleged that for that reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>she was not required to give notice in writing to the defendant that she reserved her right of action at common law; and in which she admitted that she gave no such notice, and that her injury occurred on premises owned and controlled by the defendant while she was leaving the premises after finishing her day\u2019s work for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">The defendant filed a motion that judgment be entered for the defendant on the pleadings. The following indorsement was made on the motion by order of the judge: \"The plaintiff admitting that the defendant was insured for workmen\u2019s compensation in accordance with G. L. c. 152, the within motion is allowed and it is ordered that judgment for the defendant be entered.\u201d The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The allegations in pleadings \"shall bind the party making them.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 87. That means that they are conclusive upon him. <em>Snowling </em>v. <em>Plummer Granite Co. </em>108 Mass. 100, 101. <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 424. Findings contrary to facts admitted in pleadings cannot be made. <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>264 Mass. 343, 348. <em>Markus </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>317 Mass. 1, 7. If upon the facts thus admitted a party cannot prevail, it is an appropriate case for an order for judgment against him on the pleadings. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 235, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In the case at bar the facts alleged in the declaration and admitted by the replication required a ruling that the injury to the plaintiff arose out of and in the course of her employment by the defendant. See <em>Rogers\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 308, 309. The plaintiff was on her employer\u2019s premises, which she was in the act of leaving at the close of work, and was using, at the employer\u2019s suggestion, a freight elevator in common with other employees. <em>Sundine\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 1. <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 380. <em>Hallett\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 326, <em>S. C. </em>232 Mass. 49. <em>White </em>v. <em>E. T. Slattery Co. </em>236 Mass. 28, 33-34. <em>Latter\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 326. <em>Nagle\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 193. See <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>290 Mass. 448, 450; <em>Mannering\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 517, 519; <em>Milliman\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 451, 453; <em>Bradford\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 621; <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 710-711. In <em>White </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>284 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>73, there was an issue of fact as to where the injury was sustained. The plaintiff relies upon <em>Bell\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 46, and <em>Babineau\u2019s Case, </em>254 Mass. 214, which are plainly distinguishable from the case at bar. That the stairway to the street had been removed and that it was a freight elevator, not regularly used by the employees, rather than a passenger elevator, seems to us to be of no significance whatsoever, particularly in view of the advice of the employer to use this means of departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\">That the employer was a subscriber under the workmen\u2019s compensation act was admitted by the failure of the replication to deny this allegation of the answer. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Equitable Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>7 Allen, 239, 240-241. <em>Friend </em>v. <em>Pettingill, </em>116 Mass. 515, 518. That the plaintiff had given no notice of reservation of her right of action at common law was expressly admitted by the replication. It follows that the plaintiff cannot maintain this action and must rely upon her remedies under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen, </em>317 Mass. 633, 635, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"pAEP\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
