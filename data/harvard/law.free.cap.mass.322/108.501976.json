Since we think these contentions cannot be maintained, we need not consider whether a bill in equity is the proper remedy. See <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Mayor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>of Fitchburg, </em>219 Mass. 121, 127; <em>Shuman </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>229 Mass. 225, 227-228; <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>320 Mass. 528, 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">Prior to March 10, 1947, the General Ordinances of Cambridge provided in c. 34, \u00a7 28, that the \u201cmaximum price or rates of fare which drivers . . . may charge and demand\u201d for \u201cmotor taxicabs\u201d should be forty cents for the first half mile or fraction thereof and ten cents for each quarter mile thereafter. On that date the plaintiff established a lesser rate for its cabs, which it could properly do, since the ordinance then fixed only the maximum rate. But on March 31, 1947, the city amended the ordinance by striking out the word \u201cmaximum\u201d and providing that the \u201cprice or rates of fare which drivers . . . may charge and demand\u201d should be twenty-five cents for the first two fifths of a mile or fraction thereof and five cents for each one fifth of a mile thereafter. This was a higher rate than that established by the plaintiff for its cabs. The plaintiff desires to continue its lower rates in effect. The defendants insist that the ordinance as amended establishes a fixed rate to which all cab operators must conform, and that none is at liberty to charge either higher or lower rates than that established.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">As a matter of construction of the amended ordinance we think that the defendants\u2019 position is sound. The amendment expressly struck out the word \u201cmaximum\u201d and established a single rate without qualification of any kind. The plaintiff argues that the word \u201cmay\u201d implies a discretion to charge a lower rate, but we think that taking that word with its context, and in view of the striking out of the word \u201cmaximum,\u201d the meaning is that cab operators \u201cmay\u201d charge the fixed rate and may <em>not </em>charge any other rate. The word \u201cmay\u201d does not always imply discretion. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>16 Gray, 166, 168. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>258 Mass. 203. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Election Commissioners of Boston, </em>310 Mass. 784, 785-786.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The city had power to enact the ordinance fixing the single rate from which cab operators cannot deviate in either direction. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 40, \u00a7 22, enabling a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>city or town to make ordinances \"for the regulation of carriages and vehicles used therein\u201d and referring to a fee of $1 annually \"for each license granted\u201d has been construed broadly to authorize the city or town to set up licensing systems for hackneys and taxicabs and to fix the rates to be charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>114 Mass. 328. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Page, </em>155 Mass. 227. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>261 Mass. 340, 344. There is nothing in the statute or in the decisions limiting the power of the city or town to the fixing of maximum rates only. There may be important reasons for fixing a single rate below which the operator cannot go. Among such reasons might be the prevention of cutthroat rates, the assurance that the field would not be monopolized by a few concerns, and the making of the business sufficiently lucrative to attract an adequate number of well maintained and safely operated cabs.</p>\n<p id=\"A9o\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
