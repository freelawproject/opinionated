In awarding compensation upon review, the board affirmed and adopted the findings and the decision of the single member. The latter\u2019s decision contains the following: \u201cI further find, from his [the employee\u2019s]] appearing at the hearing and his testimony, that he is vague, poorly oriented and rambling as to any statement of facts or business matters. The impression I gained from his testimony was accurately summarized by the impartial physician, Doctor Donald Munro, and therefore I adopt his summary as a finding of fact, to wit: \u2018There is no question in my mind but what this patient cannot do gainful labor at this time and I think that on the evidence at present available it must be assumed that his present condition is until proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>otherwise at least the indirect result of the alleged injury.\u2019 \u201d General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 8, provides, so far as here material, that \u201cthe decision of the member, together with a statement of the evidence, his findings of fact, rulings of law, and other matters pertinent to questions arising before him, shall be filed with the department.\u201d Section 9 provides in part that the report of the impartial physician \u201cshall be admissible as evidence in any proceeding before the department or a member thereof; provided, that the employee and the insurer have seasonably been furnished with copies thereof.\u201d We are of opinion that the mere excerpt, set forth above, from the report of the impartial physician is not a sufficient compliance with \u00a7 8 and that for a proper consideration of the case his complete report, which apparently was considered in evidence by the single member and the board, should be set out at least in narrative form. <em>Bean\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">\n<em>Decree to be entered in the Superior Court recommitting the case to the Industrial Accident Board for inclusion therein of the report of the impartial physician Dr. Donald Munro and further certification to the Superior Court.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
