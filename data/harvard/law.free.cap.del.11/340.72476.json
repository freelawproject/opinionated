Brinton had obtained before a justice of the peace a judgment, by confession, on a judgment-note for sixteen dollars, against John D. Coverdale, on the 17th day of September, 1872, on which <em>&amp; ji.fa. </em>execution, with a clause of attachment, was issued on the 30th day of January, 1873, returnable on the 5th of May following, and returned on that day <em>nulla bona, </em>and on which an <em>alias fi. fa. </em>execution, with a clause of attachment, was afterwards issued on the 9th day of July, 1879, returnable on the 26th day of September following, and returned that day, and which in the meantime had been laid in the hands of George Carey, as garnishee, who appeared and answered on the 2d day of August, 1879, that he owed the defendant, John D. Coverdale, seventeen dollars and ten cents, and for which judgment was thereupon rendered against him as garnishee in favor of the plaintiff, Jeremiah G. Brinton, and upon which <em>fi. fa. </em>execution, with clause of attachment was issued against the said garnishee; whereupon, the writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this case was sued out by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b338-8\">The exceptions were, that the <em>alias ji.fa. </em>execution in the case was improperly issued, as more than three years had elapsed be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tween the date of it and the issuing and return of the <em>formerjfi.fa. </em>execution in the case; that the justice of the peace had no authority to issue the said <em>alias fi. fa. </em>execution more than three years after the issuing and return of the former <em>fi.fa. </em>execution issued in the case, without a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the judgment on which they were issued; and for the same reason, that the said George Carey was illegally required to answer as garnishee on the said <em>alias fi.fa. </em>execution attachment, and that the judgment thereupon rendered against him was, therefore, illegal and void.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-4\"><em>Walcott, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa1\">cited Rev.
