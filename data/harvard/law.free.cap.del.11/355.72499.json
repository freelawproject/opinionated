Blackiston. Eben Burrows, the defendant, was the tenant of Benjamin F. Blackiston, of a farm situated in Kent County, for one year commencing March 1, 1879, and ending March 1, 1880. The rent reserved was one-third part of the grain produced payable in kind. As outgoing tenant he sowed a crop of wheat thereon in the fall of 1879, and on the 23d day of October, 1879, after the same was sown, the plaintiff issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>attachment out of the Superior Court on a judgment against Benjamin F. Blackiston, the landlord, which was served upon the defendant prior to the October Term, 1879, and whereby he was duly summoned as garnishee. On the 18th day of December, 1879, the farm of Blackiston, of which the said Burrows was tenant, was sold by the sheriff of Kent County, and at said sale Anne Blackiston became the purchaser, and the sale was confirmed at the April Term, 1880. Prior to the attachment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the plaintiff as aforesaid, another attachment after judgment had been issued out of said court against Benjamin F. Blackiston, at the suit of William Knabe and the same Eben Burrows had been summoned as garnishee, and on that attachment answered that he was indebted in the sum of two hundred and thirty-two dollars and eighty-four cents, it being the value of the corn rent for the year 1879, ending March 1, 1880. Of this amount the sum of one hundred and eighty-six dollars and forty-two cents was paid to the said Knabe as attaching creditor, and the residue, forty-four dollars and twenty-six cents, was paid to the said Anne Blackiston, the purchaser, they being the several amounts to which they were respectively entitled according to the apportionment prescribed by the statute, which appear by Garnishee Docket, No. 2, p. 250.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-4\">There was no other rent arising out of the said tenancy except the wheat crop sown as aforesaid. At the harvest of 1880, Eben Burrows cut and saved the wheat sown in 1879, and on a sale thereof made by him the proceeds of the share thereof payable as rent was three hundred and twelve dollars and eighty-seven cen ts, which sum has been in his hands, or in the hands of the purchaser ever since, to whom he paid it over on taking a bond from him for the amount of it. Of this money, the plaintiff in this attachment claims that he is entitled to receive from the said Eben Burrows, as garnishee, the sum which bears the same proportion to the whole sum of three hundred and twelve dollars and eighty-seven cents, as the time which had elapsed between the first day of March, 1879, and the day of sale, bears to the whole time between the first day of March, 1879, and the first day of March, 1880, with interest thereon for one year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">The plaintiff and defendant respectively submit to the court the adjudication of the whole question as to how much of said money, if any, the plaintiff is entitled under the said attachment, and that for whatsoever sum the court shall be of opinion the said plaintiff is entitled to, judgment shall be entered in his favor against the defendant, with interest as aforesaid and costs; but if the court shall consider that the plaintiff is not entitled to any part thereof, then judgment for the defendant, with costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Smithers </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az\">It is a question of apportionment of the rent mentioned in the case stated, between the parties to this suit, under Section 22 of the statute on the subject.
