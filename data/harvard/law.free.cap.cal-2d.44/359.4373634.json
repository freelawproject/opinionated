The sole issue in controversy is whether plaintiff\u2019s complaint stated a cause of action.  In determining this point, plaintiff\u2019s allegations must be accepted as true. Upon this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>premise, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in holding that his \u201caction has no merit\u201d and in entering judgment in favor of defendants. The record sustains plaintiff\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Plaintiff alleged, among other things, that defendants \u201cwithout warrant or other process of any kind\u201d arrested him upon the \u201csole charge of failing, neglecting, and refusing to exhibit upon demand a California fishing license, thus violating section 403 of the Fish and Game Code, a misdemeanor\u201d; that he \u201chad not violated said section ... in the presence of the defendants or either of them, or otherwise\u201d; that he was thereafter imprisoned by defendants for said purported violation; that by reason of such arrest and imprisonment, he was deprived of his liberty for approximately six hours and thereby suffered damage in the sum of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Defendants\u2019 demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint was overruled. Defendants then answered, denying generally plaintiff\u2019s allegations and asserting as an affirmative defense that they were \u201cat all times mentioned . . . acting in their official capacities as' law enforcement officers of the California Department of Fish and Game\u201d; that when they arrested plaintiff, they \u201chad reasonable grounds and/or probable cause to believe that plaintiff in [their] presence . . . was violating section 403 of the Fish and Game Code\u201d; that they were then \u201cacting within the course and scope of their employment\u201d and, as such, were \u201cshielded by the cloak of immunity from civil liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">At the hearing of defendants\u2019 motion for a summary judgment, which was made solely on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s complaint failed to state a cause of action, plaintiff stipulated that defendants were \u201cFish and Game Wardens,\u201d were \u201cin uniform,\u201d and were \u201con duty at the time\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s arrest. Thereupon the court granted the summary judgment, and plaintiff appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> Plaintiff properly maintains that his complaint stated a cause of action, for while defendants were admittedly acting as law enforcement officers and were in uniform, they were not immune from civil liability for false arrest and imprisonment.  As was stated in <em>Oppenheimer </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 545, at page 549 [232 P.2d 26]: \u201cA police officer is without right to arrest an individual, without a warrant, for a misdemeanor not committed in his presence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 836; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>77 Cal.App.2d 713, 718 [176 P.2d 372].)  Where a complaint is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>upon an arrest made without a warrant, for a misdemeanor not committed within the presence of an officer, as it is here, all that need he alleged to charge the unlawful arrest is (1) the arrest without process, (2) the imprisonment, and (3) the damage. <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>Owens, supra, </em>p. 718; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 508, 511-512 [209 P.2d 156].) While other matters not necessary to a cause of action for false imprisonment are here alleged, the complaint contains the vital allegations. As against a general demurrer the surplus allegations must be disregarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Relying upon <em>White </em>v. <em>Towers, </em>37 Cal.2d 727 [235 P.2d 209, 28 A.L.R.2d 636], and <em>Coverstone </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>38 Cal.2d 315 [239 P.2d 876], defendants contend that since they admittedly were law-enforcing officers, acting within the scope of their employment at the time of their alleged wrongful arrest and imprisonment of plaintiff, they are immune from civil liability for such acts. Neither of the cited cases sustains defendants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In <em>White </em>v. <em>Towers, supra, </em>the alleged cause of action was for malicious prosecution, rather than for false arrest and imprisonment. It was held that the policy of \u201cpromoting the fearless and effective administration of the law\u201d required that officers who institute criminal proceedings in pursuance of their official duties should not be liable to \u201cvindictive and retaliatory damage suits\u201d for alleged malicious prosecution. (37 Cal.2d 729.) Different principles govern actions for false arrest and imprisonment, for the law expressly limits the arresting officer\u2019s authority. When the arrest is without a warrant, the misdemeanor must have been \u201ccommitted or attempted in his presence.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 836.)  In a malicious prosecution action, malice and lack of probable cause are essential elements of pleading and proof. (16 Cal. Jur. \u00a7 2, p. 728.) They have no bearing, however, on charges of false arrest and imprisonment (see 12 Cal.Jur., \u00a7 2, p. 429; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 508, 512 [209 P.2d 156]) except in the single instance, which is not involved on this appeal from the summary judgment, predicated solely on the claimed insufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s complaint: that where the offense is apparently being committed in the presence of the arresting officer, he may invoke by way of defense the doctrine of probable cause to justify the arrest without a warrant. (5 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7 10, p. 158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\"><em>Coverstone </em>v. <em>Davies, supra, </em>involved an alleged false arrest, but there a misdemeanor was being committed in the officers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>presence, and they were therefore authorized to make an arrest without a warrant.\" (Pen. Code, \u00a7 836.) In such circumstances, it was held that the arresting officers, arriving upon the scene, were \u201centitled to act on reasonable appearances in determining who were parties to the offense\u201d (38 Cal.2d 320), and that the \u201cdoctrine of probable cause\u201d would protect them. (38 Cal.2d 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Neither <em>White </em>v. <em>Towers, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d 727, nor <em>Coverstone </em>v. <em>Davies, supra, </em>38 Cal.2d 315, supports the broad claim that a law-enforcement officer may not be held liable for an arrest, without a warrant, for a misdemeanor not committed in his presence. Such holding would do violence to the provisions of Penal Code, section 836, prescribing the conditions of a lawful arrest, and would be contrary to the settled rules established by the cases dealing with false arrest and imprisonment. (See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>77 Cal.App.2d 713 [176 P.2d 372]; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 508; <em>Oppenheimer </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 545.) The trial court therefore erred in concluding that plaintiff\u2019s complaint failed to state a cause of action and in granting defendants \u2019 motion for a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Edmonds, J., Traynor, J., and Schauer, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b387-9\">CARTER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_E\">I concur in the reversal of the judgment but disagree with the holding in the majority opinion that <em>White </em>v. <em>Towers, </em>37 Cal.2d 727 [235 P.2d 209, 28 A.L.R.2d 636], and <em>Coverstone </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>38 Cal.2d 315 [239 P.2d 876], were correctly decided. I am firmly of the opinion that these cases were erroneously decided as clearly pointed out in my dissenting opinions therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
