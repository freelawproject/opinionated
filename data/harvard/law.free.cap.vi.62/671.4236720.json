(\u201cBCI\u201d), from blocking the Hodges access to the road. On appeal, the United States District Court of the Virgin Islands \u2014 sitting in its former appellate capacity \u2014 vacated the Superior Court\u2019s order and remanded. On remand, the Superior Court changed course, finding that the road is not a public right-of-way. The Hodges now appeal to this Court, arguing that we should reverse the District Court and reinstate the Superior Court\u2019s 2002 order. Because we agree that the District Court misapplied Virgin Islands law in vacating the Superior Court\u2019s 2002 order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and remanding for further proceedings, we vacate the District Court\u2019s order and the Superior Court\u2019s post-remand orders, and reinstate the Superior Court\u2019s original 2002 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">1. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Bluebeard\u2019s Castle Hotel \u2014 owned by BCI \u2014 is on Bluebeard\u2019s Hill on St. Thomas. To the west of the hotel is Frederiksberg Gade, a public road, and to the south is Beltjen Road, another public road. The hotel is connected to Frederiksberg Gade by a road running up Bluebeard\u2019s Hill that is referred to in the record alternatively as \u201cVy til Frederiksberg,\u201d or the entrance road to Bluebeard\u2019s Castle. This road connects with a road running directly south of the hotel through the hotel parking lot, which in turn connects with a road leading down the other side of the hill to meet Beltjen Road. The road leading down the other side of the hill connecting with Beltjen Road is referred to in the record as the \u201ccable TV road,\u201d or the hotel exit road. This right-of-way in its entirety from Frederiksberg Gade to Beltjen Road is referred to in the record as \u201cthe disputed road.\u201d The disputed road provides the only access to Parcel 39C in Estate Taameberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Parcel 39C was created in July 1917, when the larger Parcel 39A was divided in two, creating a new Parcel 39C to the north accessible only through the disputed road, and leaving the remainder of Parcel 39A to the south accessible through Beltjen Road. The West Indian Company then bought Parcel 39C in 1919. In 1939, it built a house and garage on the property, where its employees lived until the house burned down in 1981, leaving only the garage intact. The company then sold the property to Maria Hodge and Lawrence Hodge in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Lawrence Hodge used the garage to store equipment, accessing it from Frederiksberg Gade through the disputed road without incident until 1994, when BCI constructed a gate across the entrance road near the intersection with Frederiksberg Gade, preventing the Hodges from reaching Parcel 39C from Frederiksberg Gade when closed. Initially, BCI closed the gate daily between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., but closed it permanently in 1996, forcing the Hodges to approach from Beltjen Road by taking the exit road and driving through the hotel parking lot to reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Parcel 39C from the east. In 1997, BCI blocked this route as well, placing a chain and a \u201cdo not enter\u201d sign where the hotel parking lot met the entrance road, rendering Parcel 39C and the entire length of the entrance road inaccessible.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">After BCI blocked access to Parcel 39C entirely, the Hodges filed a complaint against BCI in the Superior Court on November 26, 1997, alleging that the disputed road is, and always has been, a public road, used for over 80 years to access Parcel 39C, and that BCI created a nuisance by blocking access to the road. Alternatively, the Hodges asserted that because the disputed road provided them the only access to their property, they had the right to an easement by prescription. On October 18, 2001, the Government of the Virgin Islands filed a motion to intervene \u201cin order to protect its interest and that of the people of the Virgin Islands in what the Government deems as a public road known as Frederiksberg Gade or Fredericksberg Vy in Estate Taarneberg.\u201d The Superior Court granted this motion on October 29, 2001. The Government then filed its own complaint, alleging that \u201c[f]or decades, said road served as a public access road to [the Hodges\u2019] and other privately owned parcels . . . and as a public means of access to [BCI\u2019s] property,\u201d and that the Government maintained the road and posted signs regulating traffic. The Government alleged that BCI did not have the right to block off the road and did not have permission from the Virgin Islands Department of Public Works (\u201cDPW\u201d) to do so. In a survey map later introduced by the Government at trial, Bluebeard\u2019s Hill was depicted as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\">The portion of the parcel labeled \u201c39a\u201d marked in pink is Parcel 39C. The blue line near the intersection of Frederiksberg Gade and the entrance road indicates where BCI erected the gate in 1994, and the blue line to the right indicates where BCI placed the chain and \u201cdo not enter\u201d sign in 1997, preventing access to the entrance road from the hotel parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">After the Government\u2019s intervention, the Superior Court denied BCI\u2019s motion for summary judgment on April 17, 2002, holding that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding the status of the road and rejecting BCI\u2019s argument that the statute of limitations barred the Hodges\u2019 action. <em>Hodge v. Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>44 V.I. 242, 247-55 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The Superior Court held trial from May 28, 2002, to June 3, 2002. In accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation, the Superior Court determined the road\u2019s status, with a jury sitting in an advisory capacity on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>question, but serving as the finder of fact regarding the Hodges\u2019 nuisance claims. Following trial, the jury found that the disputed road is a public right-of-way and that BCI maintained a public and private nuisance when it blocked the road. The jury awarded the Hodges $6,000 in compensatory damages and $1.00 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In its June 17, 2002 findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Superior Court agreed with the jury\u2019s advisory finding that the disputed road is a public right-of-way and has been since at least 1912. The Superior Court held that even without evidence that the road was established as a public right-of-way as provided in the Virgin Islands Code, the road was public because it was a public right-of-way before the transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States in 1917, and there was \u201cno convincing evidence [that] the disputed roadway [was] conveyed to a private party.\u201d The Superior Court also credited evidence that the road is widely regarded as public by the community and has been for decades, and that DPW paved and maintained the road and regulated traffic by posting street signs and establishing speed limits. As a result, the Superior Court ruled in the Hodges\u2019 favor, issuing a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction preventing BCI from blocking the road. The Superior Court later awarded the Hodges $116,008.90 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs in a July 22, 2002 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">BCI appealed the Superior Court\u2019s ruling to the Appellate Division of the United States District Court of the Virgin Islands on July 26, 2002, which issued an opinion nearly seven years later on April 1, 2009. <em>Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, Inc. v. Hodge, </em>51 V.I. 672 (D.V.I. App. Div. 2009). In its opinion, the Appellate Division affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment, but noted that \u201cwe cannot be certain that [the Hodges and the Government] were held to their burden of proof\u2019 in establishing that the disputed road is public, because \u201cabsent from the [Superior Court\u2019s] opinion is a clear articulation and application of the legal standard governing the establishment of a public road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690. The Appellate Division found \u201cno support for the [Superior Court\u2019s] conclusion that the [disputed [r]oad[] is public because it was public at the time of the transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States,\u201d and \u201c[t]o the extent that conclusion derives from the testimony of the Hodges\u2019 expert witness, Robert Muman\u201d \u2014 who testified at trial as an expert in real estate law \u2014 \u201cthe record offers us no basis on which to determine whether Muman was appropriately qualified as an expert or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>whether the methods he used were reliable\u201d under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. <em>Id. </em>at 693-94. The Appellate Division also held that the Superior Court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\">Because of these perceived deficiencies, the Appellate Division vacated<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order, as well as the July 22, 2002 order awarding attorney\u2019s fees, and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 694-95 &amp; n.15. BCI attempted to appeal the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, seeking an outright reversal of the Superior Court without remand, but the Third Circuit dismissed the appeal because the Appellate Division\u2019s remand order was not \u201cfinal\u201d as required for the Third Circuit to exercise jurisdiction under 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613a(c). <em>Hodge v. Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>392 Fed. Appx. 965, 971-76 (3d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">On remand, the Superior Court issued an April 16, 2012 opinion and order in response to the Appellate Division\u2019s mandate. <em>Hodge v. Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>56 V.I. 59 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2012). The 2012 opinion \u2022\u2014 issued by a different Superior Court judge \u2014 reexamined the evidence from the 2002 trial and concluded that there was no evidence that the road was formally dedicated to public use under 20 V.I.C. \u00a7 3a or implicitly dedicated at common law. <em>Id. </em>at 65-72. The Superior Court also found that the Hodges and the Government failed to establish the existence of a public or private prescriptive easement over the road. <em>Id. </em>at 72-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">After the Superior Court denied the Hodges\u2019 motion to set aside the judgment on August 24, 2012, they filed a timely notice of appeal with this Court on August 27, 2012. <em>See </em>V.I.S.Ct.R. 5(a)(4). BCI then filed a timely cross-appeal challenging the Superior Court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment in 2002 and the Appellate Division\u2019s order that remanded the case instead of ordering an outright reversal of the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order. BCI later filed a timely notice of appeal challenging the Superior Court\u2019s October 4, 2012 order denying its motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs against the Hodges and the Government on November 5, 2012. <em>See Hodge v. Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>Inc., </em>Super. Ct. Civ. No. 125/1997 (STT), 2012 V.I. LEXIS 51 (V.I. Super. Ct. Oct. 4, 2012) (unpublished). This Court then granted the Government\u2019s motion to be excused from participating in the Hodges\u2019 appeal of the Superior Court\u2019s April 16, 2012 order and consolidated these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In the 1984 amendments to the Revised Organic Act of 1954 \u2014 the <em>de facto </em>constitution for the Virgin Islands<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 Congress authorized the Virgin Islands Legislature to end the District Court\u2019s role as a territorial court by divesting it of jurisdiction over actions brought under Virgin Islands law that do not fall within the District Court\u2019s federal question, diversity, or supplemental civil and criminal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1612(a)-(c). These amendments also created the Appellate Division of the District Court to review decisions of the Superior Court in three-judge panels, but provided that the District Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction over the Superior Court would end once the Legislature created a local appellate court to assume jurisdiction over appeals from the Superior Court. 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611(a), 1613a(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The Legislature implemented the 1984 amendments incrementally. On September 5, 1990, it passed Act No. 5594, granting the Superior Court \u201coriginal jurisdiction in all civil actions regardless of the amount in controversy,\u201d effective October 1, 1991. 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 76(a); 1990 V.I. Sess. Laws 271. The Legislature then passed Act No. 5890 on September 30, 1993, granting the Superior Court \u201coriginal jurisdiction in all criminal actions,\u201d effective January 1,1994. 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 76(b); 1993 V.I. Sess. Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>214. Finally, in Act No. 6687 on October 29, 2004, the Legislature provided for the creation of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands, which officially assumed jurisdiction on January 29, 2007. <em>Hypolite </em>v. People, 51 V.I. 97, 101 (V.I. 2009); 2004 V.I. Sess. Laws 179; 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611(a) (\u201cThe judicial power of the Virgin Islands shall be vested . . . in such appellate court and lower local courts as . . . established by local law.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\">By creating this Court, the Legislature completed the process of establishing a local judicial system to operate independently of the District Court and Third Circuit. And with the exception of the Third Circuit\u2019s temporary certiorari jurisdiction over this Court, Congress intended for the relationship between Virgin Islands courts and federal courts to mirror that between state and federal courts. 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613; <em>Edwards v. HOVENSA, LLC, </em>497 F.3d 355, 360, 49 V.I. 1133 (3d Cir. 2007) (\u201cNow that [48 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1613 mandates that the relations between [federal] courts . . . and [Virgin Islands] courts . . . mirror the relations between state and federal courts,... \u00a7 1613 makes the <em>Erie </em>doctrine and the Rules of Decision Act applicable to the District Court of the Virgin Islands.\u201d); <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Fawkes, </em>61 V.I. 416, 437-45 (V.I. 2014) (outlining the relationship between local and federal courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">So when BCI appealed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment in 2002, that appeal went to the Appellate Division of the District Court. And because \u201cCongress provided that the Appellate Division would retain jurisdiction over any appeal filed with it before this Court assumed jurisdiction,\u201d the Appellate Division was able to issue its order vacating and remanding the case to the Superior Court in 2009. <em>Percival </em>v. <em>People, </em>62 V.I. 477, 487 n.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>(V.I. 2015) (citing 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613a(d)). After the Appellate Division orders a remand, determining whether the appeal remains pending in the Appellate Division under 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613a(d) \u2014 and accordingly must return there after the Superior Court complies with the remand mandate \u2014 depends on whether the Appellate Division ordered a case remand or a record remand. As we explained in Hypolite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">In a record remand, . . . jurisdiction over the case remains with [the appellate] court, but the record [alone] is returned to the trial court. In those circumstances, the trial court may be directed to clarify or amplify some portion of the record, to make additional findings, to hear further testimony, or to explain a ruling. The point of such a remand is to give the trial judge the opportunity to complete or clarify the record so that [the appellate] court will have an adequate basis for review of the trial court\u2019s rulings. The trial court does not, however, have the authority to amend the ruling that is on appeal. A \u201ccase\u201d remand, on the other hand, returns the case to the trial court for all purposes. [The appellate] court retains no jurisdiction over the case and the appeal is terminated. If, after a case remand, a party is dissatisfied with the action of the trial court, the only course available to obtain review in [the appellate] court, is to file a new notice of appeal, once a final order or judgment is entered. That appeal is a new appeal, separate from the previous appeal that was terminated when the case was remanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\"><em>Hypolite, </em>51 V.I. at 102-03 <em>(quoting Hodge v. McGowan, </em>50 V.I. 296, 305 n.4 (V.I. <em>2008)); see also Simon v. Gov\u2019t of the V.I., </em>679F.3d 109, 113-14, 56 V.I. 990 (3d Cir. 2012) (\u201cA case remains \u2018pending\u2019 before the District Court [for the purposes of 48 U.S .C. \u00a7 1613a(d)] if the remand was a record remand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">As this Court previously explained, \u201cafter it issued its <em>Bluebeard\u2019s Castle </em>opinion, the Appellate Division . . . issued a mandate and closed the case on June 5, 2009, which is consistent with a case remand and not a record remand.\u201d <em>Martinez v. Stridiron, </em>S. Ct. Civ. No. 2011-0014, 2011 V.I. Supreme LEXIS 22, *15 (V.I. Mar. 22, 2011) (unpublished); <em>see also V.I. Narcotics Strike Force </em>v. <em>Pub. Emps. Relations Bd., </em>60 V.I. 204, 218 (V.I. 2013) (expressly setting aside a decision on appeal and remanding for further proceedings \u201cis the quintessential hallmark of a case remand\u201d). Therefore, in seeking review of a final judgment issued in the Superior Court\u2019s post-remand proceedings, the parties were required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>to file new appeals, over which only this Court has jurisdiction. 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613a(d) (\u201cUpon the establishment of the [Supreme Court,] all appeals from the decisions of the courts of the Virgin Islands established by local law not previously taken must be taken to that appellate court.\u201d). And since the Superior Court\u2019s April 16, 2012 order was a final order \u201cdisposing of all . . . claims submitted ... for adjudication,\u201d for the purposes of 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 32(a), this Court has jurisdiction over the Hodges\u2019 and BCI\u2019s appeals. <em>St. Croix, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>60 V.I. 468, 472-73 (V.I. 2014). Likewise, the Superior Court\u2019s October 4,2012 order denying BCI\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees was a final order over which we have jurisdiction. <em>Kalloo v. Estate of Small, </em>62 V.I. 571, 577 (V.I. 2015) (citing <em>In re Guardianship of Smith, </em>58 V.I. 446, 449 (V.I. 2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\">In addition to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over all final judgments of the Superior Court entered after January 29, 2007, this Court \u201cmay reverse or affirm, wholly or in part . . . each interlocutory judgment or intermediate or other order that it is authorized to review.\u201d 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 32(c). Thus, \u201c[i]t is well established that prior interlocutory orders\u201d \u2014 such as a remand order \u2014 \u201cmerge with the final judgment... and... may be reviewed on appeal from the final order.\u201d <em>In re Estate of George, </em>59 V.I. 913, 919 (V.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Gov\u2019t of the V.I. v. Crooke, </em>54 V.I. 237, 245 (V.I. 2010) (explaining that an order remanding a case is not a final order).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Despite this, BCI asserts that this Court does not have the authority to review the Appellate Division\u2019s remand order. BCI raised a similar argument with the Third Circuit, insisting that \u201cafter the Superior Court decides this matter on remand, the Virgin Islands Supreme Court will have no authority to review the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling,\u201d rendering it \u201ceffectively unreviewable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 392 Fed. Appx. at 973 (recounting BCI\u2019s arguments). In rejecting this argument, the Third Circuit noted that 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 32(c) authorizes this Court to review all interlocutory orders on appeal of a final judgment, including the Appellate Division\u2019s April 1, 2009 order remanding this case. 392 Fed. Appx. at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>We agree that we have jurisdiction over the Appellate Division\u2019s remand in this case, as nothing prevents this Court from reviewing it like any other interlocutory order under section 32(c). We recognize that 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613 incorporates principles of federalism into the Virgin Islands Judiciary \u2014 the same federalism that would typically prevent a state court from setting aside an order issued by a federal district court. <em>See Bryan, </em>61 V.I. at 456 (setting aside an order of the District Court only after concluding that it exceeded its jurisdiction in granting relief directly contrary to orders from this Court denying the same relief to the same party); <em>cf. Faulkner v. State, </em>226 S.W.3d 358, 363 (Tenn. 2007) (stating the general principle that a federal judgment cannot be challenged in state court). But unlike the constitutional federalism governing the relationship between state and federal courts, federalism in the Virgin Islands \u201cis administrative rather than constitutional.\u201d <em>Parrott </em>v. <em>Gov\u2019t of the V.I., </em>230 F.3d 615, 621, 43 V.I. 277 (3d Cir. 2000); see <em>Bryan, </em>61 V.I. at 438 (explaining that this Court and the District Court are both Article IV courts deriving their authority ultimately from Congress). And \u201cwhile Congress has generally chosen to treat the Virgin Islands as the equivalent of a state ... the Virgin Islands territorial government is a subdivision of the United States government.\u201d <em>Rivera-Moreno v.

IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"> Because the Virgin Islands is not a state, the administrative federalism imposed by 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613 does not prevent a Virgin Islands court from \u201cexercising its revised jurisdiction to review a judgment of the District Court made under territorial law.\u201d <em>Parrott, </em>230 F.3d at 621-24 (holding that the Superior Court can vacate a conviction entered under local law by the District Court after assuming the District Court\u2019s former jurisdiction over local actions); <em>see also Rivera-Moreno, </em>61 V.I. at 306-07; <em>Callwood v.

Just as the District Court sat as a territorial trial court in actions brought under Virgin Islands law before the Legislature expanded the Superior Court\u2019s jurisdiction, it sat as a territorial court when it heard appeals from decisions of the Superior Court. And \u2014 like the Superior Court before us \u2014 this Court has assumed the jurisdiction once exercised by the District Court. Thus, nothing prevents this Court from \u201cexercising its revised jurisdiction to review a judgment of the District Court made under territorial law.\u201d <em>Parrott, </em>230 F.3d at 621-24. Accordingly, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the Appellate Division\u2019s remand was an interlocutory order that \u201cmerge[s] with the final judgment,\u201d we have jurisdiction to review the Appellate Division\u2019s April 1, 2009 remand order as part of this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The Hodges argue that the Appellate Division erred in vacating the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order and remanding for further proceedings, urging us to set aside the Appellate Division\u2019s order and reinstate the Superior Court\u2019s original order. In the alternative, they assert that the Superior Court failed to comply with the Appellate Division\u2019s mandate on remand by disregarding the original findings of fact without conducting a new trial, and that the Superior Court erred in finding on remand that the road is private property. <em>See </em>56 V.I. at 72. BCI urges us to affirm the Superior Court\u2019s remand proceedings, and argues in the alternative that the Superior Court committed error in 2002 by finding that both the entrance road and the exit road are public, when only the entrance road connecting Frederiksberg Gade and the hotel parking lot was at issue during trial. Finally, BCI argues that we should reverse the Superior Court\u2019s October 4, 2012 order denying its motion for attorney\u2019s fees because BCI is the prevailing party in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>A. Appellate Division Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The Hodges argue that the Appellate Division erred in disregarding the Superior Court\u2019s 2002 finding that the disputed road was public before 1917 because that finding was not clearly erroneous. The Hodges also fault the Appellate Division for holding that the Superior Court erred in allowing Muman to testify as an expert at trial without conducting a hearing to determine the reliability of his testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. We agree on both points. But before reaching the merits of the Hodges\u2019 arguments, we must first clarify that, as the Third Circuit stated in dismissing BCI\u2019s appeal, this Court is not \u201crequired to abide by the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling ... as [the] law of the case\u201d in this appeal. 392 Fed. Appx. at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">1. <em>Law of the case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u201cwhen a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\u201d <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>562 U.S. 476, 506, 131 S. Ct. 1229, 179 L. Ed. 2d 196 (2011) (quoting <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S. Ct. 1382, 75 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1983)); <em>see also Milgard Tempering, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selas Corp. of Am., </em>902 F.2d 703, 715 (9th Cir. 1990) (\u201c[A] court is generally precluded from reconsidering an issue previously decided by the same court, or a higher court in the identical case.\u201d). \u201cThis doctrine directs a court\u2019s discretion, [but] it does not limit the tribunal\u2019s power,\u201d <em>Pepper, </em>562 U.S. at 506 (internal quotation marks omitted), and this Court has yet to examine the extent to which this doctrine applies in Virgin Islands courts. <em>But see Dow dye v. People, </em>60 V.I. 806, 818 (V.I. 2014) (Moore, J., concurring in result only). But even if we were to adopt some form of the law-of-the-case doctrine with regard to this Court\u2019s decisions, treating the Appellate Division\u2019s remand as the law of the case would be inappropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">This is because the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands, as the Territory\u2019s court of last resort, is the successor to the Third Circuit in the Virgin Islands Judiciary. <em>Defoe v. Phillip, </em>702 F.3d 735, 743 (3d Cir.) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has assumed our erstwhile role as the final authority on territorial law.\u201d), <em>aff\u2019g </em>56 V.I. 109 (V.I. 2012). By contrast, the role of the Appellate Division of the District Court in the Virgin Islands Judiciary \u2014 that of an intermediate appellate court \u2014 \u201cwill cease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>existence when the last [Appellate Division] case pending is decided.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>497 F.3d at 359 n.2;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>see also BA Properties, Inc. v.

But that is not the case, as parties could appeal by right from the Appellate Division to the Third Circuit, with the Third Circuit exercising plenary review over the Appellate Division\u2019s decisions on both federal and local law, <em>see BA Properties Inc., </em>299 F.3d at 212 \u2014 in the same manner any federal court of appeals reviews a federal district court. On the other hand, the Third Circuit\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction over this Court was much more limited, as it is \u201cthe role of the Virgin Islands Supreme Court to say what the law of the [Territory is,\u201d leaving the Third Circuit with the ability to \u201creverse a decision of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands that is based upon territorial law only if it is inescapably wrong.\u201d <em>Pichardo v.

Thus, notwithstanding this limited certiorari jurisdiction to review this Court\u2019s decisions on local law for manifest error, \u201cit is plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>that Congress intended for [the Third Circuit\u2019s] certiorari jurisdiction vis-\u00e1-vis the Virgin Islands Supreme Court to mirror the United States Supreme Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction vis-a-vis any of the fifty state courts of last resort.\u201d <em>People of the V.I. v.

Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 816, 108 S. Ct. 2166, 100 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1988), the Appellate Division of the District Court cannot be considered a \u201ccoordinate court\u201d of this Court. And \u201c[t]he law of the case principle is not applied to prevent a higher court from considering the correctness of a ruling by an intermediate appellate court.\u201d <em>Levine v. First Nat.

The Appellate Division further explained that it found \u201cno support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the [disputed [r]oad[ ] is public because it was public at the time of the transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693. The Hodges assert that the Appellate Division\u2019s holding was erroneous because the Superior Court properly found the road to be public based on its historical status as a public right-of-way.

Armstrong, </em>365 F.3d 204, 208 (3d Cir. 2004), examining the Superior Court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact only for clear error. <em>Malloy v. Reyes, </em>61 V.I. 163, 173 (V.I. 2014) (citing <em>Brunn v. Dowdye, </em>59 V.I. 899, 904 (V.I. 2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">This Court recently explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">when a territory is transferred to the United States by a foreign country, ownership of public property transfers to the U.S. government, while private property rights remain unaffected____[T]he 1916 treaty transferring the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States clearly followed this longstanding legal principle, providing that \u201c[t]his cession includes the right of property in all public, government, or crown lands... and all other public property of every kind or description now belonging to Denmark.\u201d... And following the transfer, Congress provided in the Organic Act of 1936 that \u201c[a]ll property which may have been acquired by the United States from Denmark in the Virgin Islands under the convention... is placed under the control of the Government of the Virgin Islands.\u201d 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1405c(a). Later, in a 1974 amendment to the Revised Organic Act of 1954, Congress provided that \u201c[a]ll right, title, and interest of the United States in the property placed un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>der the control of the government of the Virgin Islands by section 1405c(a) of this title ... is hereby conveyed to such government.\u201d 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1545(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><em>Malloy, </em>61 V.I. at 174-75 (footnotes and citations omitted). The Superior Court based its finding that the disputed road is public squarely on this principle of law, explaining in its June 17,2002 findings of fact and conclusions of law that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">While the Government does not have a deed, there is substantial evidence that the disputed roadway is and has always been public. The testimony offered at trial proved that the disputed roadway has been in existence and has been used to access several parcels of land since at least 1912 \u2014 that is, before the Virgin Islands [was] ceded to the United States. Accordingly, the fact that there is no deed, proof of dedication, or evidence of condemnation proceedings is not dispositive, as urged by [BCI]. To the contrary, the evidence clearly shows that the road was already public when these local laws governing the acquisition of public lands were promulgated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">It is clear that, even before 1917, some lands on St. Thomas were public. The public status of these lands was preserved . . . when the Virgin Islands [was] ceded, and title passed, to the United States of America. Later, all such property was placed under the control of, and finally was transferred to the Virgin Islands government. Because there was no convincing evidence of the disputed roadway having been conveyed to a private party, and in light of the abundant evidence of long-term use, the Court concludes that the disputed roadway was, and remains, a public road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">So even though the Appellate Division correctly observed that the Superior Court\u2019s decision \u201cdid not explicitly rely on any of the traditional ways in which a public road may be created,\u201d we agree with the Superior Court\u2019s original holding that this is irrelevant where a road was public before 1917 and was never conveyed to a private party. <em>Malloy, </em>61 V.I. at 180-81 (holding that a road remained public where it was public before 1917 and the Government never abandoned it).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">In holding that there was \u201cno support\u201d for this conclusion \u2014 a determination that appeared to constitute the primary reason for the remand \u2014 the Appellate Division took issue with the admission of Robert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Murnan\u2019s testimony, holding that the Superior Court erred in admitting this testimony without conducting a hearing under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), leaving \u201can unreviewable record.\u201d 51 V.I. at 693-94 &amp; n.13. Such a hearing, often conducted before admitting expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 \u2014 which the Appellate Division stated applied in the Superior Court through Superior Court Rule 7 \u2014 \u201cembodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability and fit,\u201d that must be assessed by a trial judge before expert testimony reaches the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 693-94; <em>but see Malloy, </em>61 V.I. at 183 (the Superior Court \u201cis not obliged to look into the questions posed by Rule 702 when neither side either requests or assists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\">But just three weeks before the Appellate Division issued its opinion, this Court explained that the Federal Rules of Evidence did not, at that point, apply in the Superior Court because \u201cthe Legislature of the Virgin Islands . . . adopted virtually all of the 1953 version of the [Uniform Rules of Evidence]\u201d in 1957, which must control the admission of evidence in the Superior Court. <em>Phillips v. People, </em>51 V.I. 258, 272-76 (V.I. 2009); <em>see </em>Former 5 V.I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 771-956 (repealed 2010). Although the Legislature later repealed the Uniform Rules of Evidence, replacing them with the Federal Rules of Evidence, <em>see V.I. Waste Mgmt. Auth. v. Bovoni Invs., LLC, </em>61 V.I. 355, 368 n.13 (V.I. 2014), that change does not apply retroactively to trial proceedings that concluded before the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence on April 7, 2010. <em>Chinnery v. People, </em>55 V.I. 508, 525 (V.I. 2011). At the time of the 2002 trial, 5 V.I.C. \u00a7911(3) expressly provided that \u201c[u]nless the judge excludes the testimony he shall be deemed to have made the finding requisite to its admission.\u201d This provision was based on Rule 56 of the 1953 Uniform Rules of Evidence, which was meant to \u201cremove[ ] the necessity of cumbersome preliminary findings and resulting delay [by] presuming] that the judge finds the conditions fulfilled unless he excludes the testimony.\u201d Comment to 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 911 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The Appellate Division also overlooked 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 4927, which has provided since 1965 that \u201c[i]n determining the law of any jurisdiction or governmental unit thereof outside this territory, the court may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the rules of evidence.\u201d 1965 V.I. Sess. Laws 58. Under this section, to the extent that Muman\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>concerned Danish law, it was testimony on foreign law, and a court hearing testimony on foreign law \u201cneed not determine whether [it] would be admissible under ... Daubert\u201d in order to admit the testimony. <em>HFGL Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alex Lyon &amp; Son Sales Managers &amp; Auctioneers, Inc., </em>264 F.R.D. 146, 148-49 (D.N.J. 2009) (discussing the requirements of the nearly identical Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1); <em>see </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1 Advisory Committee Notes (1972) (\u201c[T]he purpose of the provision is to free the judge, in determining foreign law, from any restrictions imposed by evidence rules.\u201d); <em>see also Gov\u2019t of the V.I. v.

Therefore, under either section 911(3) or 4927 of title 5, the Superior Court was not required to conduct a <em>Daubert </em>hearing before admitting Muman\u2019s testimony at the 2002 trial, and the Appellate Division misapplied Virgin Islands law in holding otherwise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Perhaps more importantly though, regardless of whether Murnan\u2019s testimony was properly admitted, the Superior Court didn\u2019t even rely on this testimony in finding that the road is public. Muman testified that every road in existence in the Virgin Islands before 1917 was a \u201cKing\u2019s Road\u201d owned by the Danish government that remained public after 1917, while the Superior Court \u2014 relying on the Danish Colonial Law of April 6, 1906<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 expressly recognized that land on St. Thomas was divided between public and private ownership before 1917, and then went on to make findings of fact specific to the disputed road based on the evidence in the record. Furthermore, these findings \u2014 leading the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>to conclude that the Hodges and the Government had established that the disputed road is public by clear and convincing evidence \u2014 were not clearly erroneous. <em>Malloy, </em>61 V.I. at 181 (indicating that whether a particular road was public before 1917 is a finding of fact). In order for such a finding to be clearly erroneous, the party challenging the finding must demonstrate that it was \u201ccompletely devoid of minimum evidentiary support or [had] no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.\u201d <em>Yusuf v. Hamed, </em>59 V.I. 841, 857 (V.I. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\">As the Superior Court explained in its detailed findings of fact, the disputed road was included in a 1912 map and identified as \u201cStreet to Frederiksberg,\u201d and was later depicted in a July 1917 boundary map with the description of \u201c[t]o the Policemaster St. Thomas.\u201d According to the testimony of DPW commissioner Wayne Callwood, these maps indicate that the road was public at the time the Virgin Islands became part of the United States. He also testified that the Government of the Virgin Islands has treated the disputed road as public property since that time, marking it as a public road on official DPW maps and maintaining the road at public expense \u2014 something Callwood testified DPW would not do for a private road. A number of DPW employees supported Callwood\u2019s testimony, recounting the extensive work done at taxpayer expense on the road \u2014 including filling potholes, restricting it to a one-way street, posting signs that set a speed limit of 10 miles per hour, along with other street signs to regulate traffic on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Further, while it was undisputed that some of this work occurred at BCI\u2019s request, there was also evidence that much of it occurred without BCI\u2019s permission or knowledge. There was testimony that DPW did this because the disputed road was often used as a bypass for motorists seeking to avoid traffic on Beltjen Road, which is consistent with the testimony of several other witnesses, including a former BCI employee, who agreed that the road has been considered a public right-of-way by the general public and used as such for much of the twentieth century \u2014 all without objection from BCI. The conclusion that the general public and surrounding property owners considered the disputed road to be public and relied on it as such is also supported by evidence that in 1917, Parcel 39A was divided into smaller parcels, leaving Parcel 39C accessible only through the disputed road. And after the West Indian Company purchased Parcel 39C in 1919, it used the disputed road to access the house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>garage it built on the property without incident until the Hodges bought the property in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In light of this substantial evidence that the disputed road was public before 1917 and remained a public right-of-way after that time, we cannot say that the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion in this regard was clearly erroneous. And while we recognize that there was evidence supporting the opposite conclusion, such as DPW maps from the 1930s that did not appear to include the disputed road, it is not the function of this Court to second-guess the findings of fact of the Superior Court judge who presided over the trial, nor to reweigh the evidence based on nothing more than a trial transcript.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Tutein v. Arteaga, </em>60 V.I. 709, 720-21 (V.I. 2014) (citing <em>Allen </em>v. <em>People, 59 </em>V.I. 631, 638-39 (V.I. 2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division misapplied Virgin Islands law in vacating the Superior Court\u2019s 2002 judgment that found the disputed road to be a public right-of-way since at least 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">B. Metes and Bounds of the Public Road</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Due to the Appellate Division\u2019s errors, the Hodges urge this Court to vacate the Appellate Division\u2019s order and reinstate the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order in full. Yet this Court typically will not disturb an order under review if any legal errors were ultimately harmless. <em>See </em>V.I.S.Ct.R. 4(i); <em>St. Croix, Ltd., </em>60 V.I. at 477 n.3; <em>Brunn, 59 </em>V.I. at 908; <em>see also Tyler, </em>365 F.3d at 212 (addressing alternate grounds for affirming an Appellate Division order). So if the Appellate Division\u2019s order vacating and remanding this case was appropriate under alternate grounds, we may still affirm. BCI argues \u2014 as an alternative to the arguments that the Appellate Division did not err and that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review its order in any case \u2014 that the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order should not be reinstated because its findings on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>dimensions of the public right-of-way went beyond what the Hodges and the Government claimed was public. BCI raised this same argument before the Appellate Division in its first appeal in this case, but the Appellate Division did not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\">In its 2002 findings of fact, the Superior Court found that the public right-of-way includes the entrance road, \u201ccontinues along the southern portion of the hotel,\u201d and includes the exit road leading to Beltjen Road, and provided in the permanent injunction that BCI was \u201cpermanently enjoined from impairing or obstructing the road known as Frederiksberg Gade beginning at the end of Norre Gade and leading up to Bluebeard\u2019s Castle Hotel and abutting 39c Estate Taameberg, continuing along the southern portion of the hotel and then onto the Beltjen Road.\u201d BCI asserts that this description of the road was erroneous because the Hodges\u2019 complaint only sought to establish the public\u2019s right to access the entrance road in order to reach Parcel 39C, and the Government\u2019s complaint similarly only challenged the constmction of the gate blocking access to the entrance road from Frederiksberg Gade. We cannot agree with BCI that the Superior Court \u201cimproperly expanded\u201d the disputed road in its 2002 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The Hodges\u2019 complaint stated that they were seeking a \u201cdeclaratory judgment that the public at large enjoys a permanent easement of access, over Frederiksberg Gade, for access to Bluebeards Castle Hotel, parcel 39c Taameberg, and other abutting parcels.\u201d The Government\u2019s complaint similarly alleged that BCI obstructed access to Parcel 39C when it constmcted the gate across this road. Although these complaints were not models of clarity, the Hodges\u2019 complaint expressly stated that they sought \u201caccess\u201d to Parcel 39C by the only means available \u2014 the disputed road. As the Superior Court found in its 2002 findings of fact, the Government designated the entrance road as a one-way street before this litigation began in 1997 \u2014 a fact that appears undisputed in the trial record. So with access to the entrance road alone, the Hodges would be able to travel to Parcel 39C, yet would be unable to leave without committing a trespass or a traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Thus, the Hodges\u2019 action for \u201caccess\u201d necessarily encompassed the entire road between Frederiksberg Gade and Beltjen Road, as the right of access is one \u201cof <em>ingress and egress </em>[that] attaches to the land. It is a property right, as complete as ownership of the land itself.\u201d <em>City of Memphis </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>345 S.W.2d 887, 889 (Tenn. 1961) (emphasis added); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>see also State Dep\u2019t of Transp. </em>v. <em>Kreider, </em>658 So. 2d 548, 549 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1995) (\u201c[W]here all or part of access to an abutting road is destroyed, a taking occurs when a property owner\u2019s right of access has been substantially diminished.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>Malloy, </em>61 V.I. at 180 n.16 (noting that a property owner cannot be denied access to her property). This principle of property law \u2014 that \u201c[t]he right of an abutting owner to access a public street or highway is a private property right in the nature of an easement and is an interest in land\u201d \u2014 appears to be universally recognized among other United States jurisdictions, and by fundamental notions of common sense. 46 Am. Jur. proof OF Facts 3d 493 \u00a7 14 (1998); <em>see also Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Taylor, </em>264 Ga. 18, 440 S.E.2d 652, 654 (1994) (\u201cWhen property is contiguous to a public road, the right of access or easement of access to such public road is a property right arising from the ownership of such land.\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In addition to the notice given by the very nature of the action itself, we note that BCI must have been aware that the right-of-way in dispute at trial encompassed the entire road running between Frederiksberg Gade and Beltjen Road. There was ample testimony in the trial record defining the disputed road as encompassing the entire right-of-way from the entrance road to the exit road, and recounting its public use. Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>cannot agree with BCI that the Superior Court expanded the scope of the property that was in dispute during the 2002 trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\">Because the Appellate Division misapplied Virgin Islands law in vacating the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order, and BCI presents no alternative grounds that would allow us to affirm the Appellate Division, we vacate the Appellate Division\u2019s April 1, 2009 order vacating the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order and remanding the case for further proceedings, reinstate the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order, and further vacate the Superior Court\u2019s April 16, 2012 order issued in response to the Appellate Division\u2019s remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">C. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In BCI\u2019s appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s October 4, 2012 order denying its motion for attorney\u2019s fees, BCI argues that the Superior Court was required to award attorney\u2019s fees under 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541. The Government counters that section 541 contains permissive language, placing the award of attorney\u2019s fees entirely within the Superior Court\u2019s discretion, which the Superior Court properly exercised here by denying attorney\u2019s fees altogether. Section 541 provides that, except in non-frivolous personal-injury actions, \u201cthere shall be allowed to the prevailing party in the judgment such sums as the court in its discretion may fix by way of indemnity for his attorney\u2019s fees in maintaining the action or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>defenses thereto.\u201d 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541(b); <em>see generally Kalloo, </em>62 V.I. at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">But the parties fail to acknowledge that this Court\u2019s precedent establishes that a motion for attorney\u2019s fees is not ripe for adjudication while an appeal is pending. <em>V.I. Gov\u2019t Hosps. &amp; Health Facilities Corp. v. Gov\u2019t of the V.I., </em>50 V.I. 276, 280-81 (V.I. 2008) (for \u201cprudential reasons\u201d the Superior Court must \u201crefus[e] to exercise jurisdiction\u201d over an attorney\u2019s fees motion that is not ripe). The reason for this rule is obvious: the Superior Court has no way to determine which party is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d while the litigation is ongoing. <em>Id. </em>at 281. This case presents the perfect example of why this rule exists, since we are vacating the post-remand Superior Court proceedings in which BCI prevailed. <em>See In re Reynolds, </em>60 V.I. 330, 336-37 (V.I. 2013) (stressing the importance of promoting judicial economy in Superior Court proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Given that BCI\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees was not ripe, and we vacate the judgment in which BCI prevailed, we also vacate the Superior Court\u2019s October 4, 2012 order. <em>V.I. Gov\u2019t Hosps., </em>50 V.I. at 280 (\u201cWhen an appellate court concludes that a motion for attorney\u2019s fees was not ripe before the trial court, it must vacate the [trial] court\u2019s decision.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). For this same reason, we do not disturb the portion of the Appellate Division\u2019s April 1, 2009 order vacating the Superior Court\u2019s original July 22, 2002 order awarding attorney\u2019s fees, <em>see </em>51 V.I. at 695-700, but express no opinion at this juncture on the Appellate Division\u2019s stated reasons for doing so. If any of the parties now wish to seek attorney\u2019s fees as a prevailing party, they may do so in the Superior Court as provided for by the rules of this Court. <em>See </em>V.I.S.Ct.R. 30(b) (\u201c[I]f a party seeks attorney\u2019s fees as among the costs to be taxed, the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded \u2014 if any \u2014 shall be determined by the Superior Court on remand.\u201d); <em>Kalloo, </em>62 V.I. at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The Appellate Division of the District Court misapplied Virgin Islands law in vacating the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order, which held that the disputed road providing access to the Hodges\u2019 property is a public right-of-way. The Superior Court did not err in admitting the testimony of Robert Murnan at trial without conducting a <em>Daubert </em>hearing because the Federal Rules of Evidence did not apply in the Superior Court during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>2002 trial. Furthermore, the Superior Court did not err in finding that the disputed road was public before 1917 and remains public today. We therefore vacate the April 1, 2009 order of the Appellate Division of the District Court vacating and remanding the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order, and reinstate the Superior Court\u2019s June 17, 2002 order granting the Hodges a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment. We further vacate the Superior Court\u2019s April 16, 2012 order issued in response to the Appellate Division\u2019s remand. Finally, the Superior Court erred in ruling on BCI\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees while the Hodges\u2019 appeal was pending because that motion was unripe, and so we also vacate the Superior Court\u2019s October 4,2012 order deciding the motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-12\"> Before October 29,2004, the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands was named the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands. <em>See </em>2004 V.I.

Nov. 13, 2014) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b699-5\"> BCI made this argument specifically with regard to its statute-of-limitations defense, which the Superior Court rejected in denying BCI\u2019s motion for summary judgment in 2002, <em>see </em>44 V.I. at 251-55, aruling the Appellate Division affirmed in the first appeal. 51 V.I. at 683-89. Despite this, BCI does not make any arguments regarding the statute of limitations in this appeal, and therefore this issue is waived. V.I.S.Ct.R. 22(m).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b701-5\"> BCI also argues that only the Government has standing to claim that the disputed road is public, and because the Government is no longer participating in this case, the Hodges lack standing to bring this appeal. But as the Hodges correctly point out, standing is at best a non-jurisdictional claims-processing rule in Virgin Islands courts, since Article III of the United States Constitution does not apply to local courts and no provision of Virgin Islands law includes a case-or-controversy requirement. <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>61 V.I. 163, 171 n.4 (V.I. 2014) (rejecting any standing concerns on appeal in a case brought against the Government by a landowner seeking access to a public right-of-way). Therefore, by failing to raise this issue \u201cat the first opportunity prior to the case becoming fully briefed,\u201d BCI has waived it. <em>In re Guardianship of Smith, </em>54 V.I. 517, 524 n.5 (V.I. 2010); <em>see also V.I. Narcotics Strike Force, </em>60 V.I. at 212 (\u201c[B]y failing to raise the standing issue until this appeal, [the appellant] has waived its argument.\u201d). BCI also insists that the Superior Court implicitly held that the Hodges did not have standing when it granted the Government\u2019s motion to intervene as of right, claiming that because the Hodges failed to appeal the Superior Court\u2019s order granting the Government\u2019s motion to intervene, this Court somehow lacks appellate jurisdiction. But it should go without saying that simply allowing the Government\u2019s intervention had nothing to do with the Hodges\u2019 ability to bring this case. <em>See generally In re Q.G., </em>60 V.I. 654, 659 n.5 (V.I. 2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b703-4\"> The District Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction over the Superior Court ended more than eight years ago, but many appeals remain pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b703-5\"> Originally, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613 provided that the Third Circuit would exercise certiorari jurisdiction over this Court \u201cfor the first fifteen years following [its] establishment.\u201d But on December 28,2012 \u2014 following the recommendation of the Third Circuit Judicial Council \u2014 President Barack Obama signed H.R. 6116 into law, ending the Third Circuit\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction 10 years early.

A.2, the Appellate Division misapplied Virgin Islands law in vacating and remanding the Superior Court\u2019s June 17,2002 order. So even if we treated the Appellate Division\u2019s order as the law of the case, it would not change our conclusion. <em>See </em>392 Fed.

The Appellate Division failed to acknowledge that the rationale of <em>Daubert </em>was premised primarily on preventing unreliable expert testimony from improperly influencing the jury, a concern that is not implicated when the judge is the finder of fact. <em>See In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Products Liab.

BCI acquired the hotel property through a quitclaim deed from a private party in 1974, who in turn acquired title through a quitclaim deed from the United States in 1954. The United States acquired title to the property through the will of James Buchanan Nies in 1933. This chain of title was undisputed at trial, and the Superior Court found that it was \u201cclear that the United States merely conveyed whatever it had received from its predecessor in interest, and there has been no evidence to suggest that its predecessor in interest, or anyone in the chain of title, owned the disputed roadway.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> <em>D.M.
