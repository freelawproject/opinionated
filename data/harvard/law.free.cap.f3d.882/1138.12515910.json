In Case No. 15-1115, petitioner South Coast Air Quality Management District (\"South Coast\") contends that the EPA incorrectly concluded that precedent of this Court requires emissions reductions that demonstrate reasonable further progress all come from within the nonattainment area. In Case No. 15-1123, petitioners Sierra Club, Conservation Law Foundation, Downwinders at Risk, and Physicians for Social Responsibility (Los Angeles) (\"Environmental Petitioners\") contend that in enacting the Final Rule, the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its revocation of 1997 National Ambient Air Quality Standards and relaxation of previously applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the reasons stated below, we deny South Coast's petition for review, and grant in part and deny in part that of the Environmental Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Clean Air Act Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Clean Air Act (\"CAA\" or \"Act\") directs the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\"NAAQS\") for air pollutants \"allowing an adequate margin of safety ... requisite to protect the public health.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207409\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The CAA also requires the EPA to establish air quality control regions and designate them as \"attainment\" for \"any area ... that meets\" the NAAQS, \"nonattainment\" for \"any area that does not meet\" the NAAQS, and \"unclassifiable\" for \"any area that cannot be classified on the basis of available information.\" \u00a7 7407(d)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The EPA must classify each area \"designated nonattainment for ozone\" as \"marginal,\" \"moderate,\" \"serious,\" \"severe,\" or \"extreme\" based on the degree to which the ozone level in the area exceeds the NAAQS. \u00a7 7511. \"An area that exceeds the NAAQS by a greater margin is given more time to meet the standard but is subjected to progressively more stringent emissions controls for ozone precursors, namely, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO\n   <sub>\n    x\n   </sub>\n   ).\"\n   <em>\n    Natural Res.

Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Act places on the states \"the primary responsibility for assuring air quality\" by submitting state implementation plans (\"SIPs\") that specify how they will achieve and maintain compliance with the NAAQS.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). States must formally adopt SIPs through state notice and comment rulemaking and then submit the SIPs to the EPA for approval. \u00a7 7410(a). For those areas designated as \"nonattainment,\" SIPs must show how the areas will achieve and maintain the relevant NAAQS.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment if the EPA (1) has determined that the area has attained the applicable NAAQS; (2) has fully approved the applicable SIP under \u00a7 7410(k); (3) has determined that the attainment is due to permanent and enforceable emissions reductions; (4) has fully approved a \u00a7 7505a \"maintenance plan,\" which demonstrates that the area will maintain the NAAQS for at least 10 years after the redesignation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7505a(a); and (5) has determined that the state containing the area seeking redesignation has met all applicable SIP requirements. \u00a7 7407(d)(3)(E). Areas redesignated as attainment are referred to as \"maintenance areas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SIPs for Nonattainment Areas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As is relevant to this case, the Clean Air Act requires SIPs for nonattainment areas to include the following provisions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Reasonable Further Progress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   SIPs for nonattainment areas \"shall require reasonable further progress.\" \u00a7 7502(c)(2). \"Reasonable further progress\" is defined as \"such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutants as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by [the EPA] for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable [NAAQS] by the applicable date.\" \u00a7 7501(1). The Clean Air Act requires an area in a moderate or greater degree of nonattainment to reduce emissions of VOCs by fifteen percent in the first six years after November 15, 1990. \u00a7 7511a(b)(1)(A). For areas in a serious or greater degree of nonattainment, subsequent reductions in VOC emissions must average three percent per year over each consecutive three-year period until the area reaches attainment. \u00a7 7511a(c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Reasonably Available Control Technology\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   SIPs for ozone nonattainment areas must also \"provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures as expeditiously as practicable (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology).\" \u00a7 7502(c)(1). For nonattainment areas classified as moderate and above, SIPs must \"require the implementation of reasonably available control technology\" with respect to all major sources of VOCs in the area and any sources that emit VOCs in the area that are covered by a control technique guideline. \u00a7 7511a(b)(2). The reasonably available control technology requirement also applies to major sources of NO\n   <sub>\n    x\n   </sub>\n   . \u00a7 7511a(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3. New Source Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   SIPs governing nonattainment areas must require permits for the construction of new or modified sources of air pollution. \u00a7\u00a7 7502(c)(5), 7503, 7410(a)(2)(C). The goal of New Source Review is to require permits to ensure that new or modified sources will not exacerbate the pollution problem in the nonattainment area. \u00a7 7503(a)(1)(A), (a)(2), (c). New Source permits for major sources of VOCs require the proposed source (1) to comply with the lowest achievable emissions rate and (2) to obtain pollution offsets representing equal or greater reductions of a pollutant at issue in the area.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Conformity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Act mandates that nonattainment and maintenance areas are subject to \"conformity requirements,\" so that \"[n]o department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government shall engage in, support in any way or provide financial assistance for, license or permit, or approve, any activity which does not conform to an implementation plan.\" \u00a7 7506(c)(1), (5). Federally funded projects must \"conform\" to SIPs, meaning that the projects will not \"cause or contribute to any new violation,\" \"increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation,\" or \"delay timely attainment of any standard or any required interim emission reductions or other milestones in any area.\" \u00a7 7506(c)(1)(B). These areas are also subject to the more specific transportation conformity requirements, whereby federal agencies may not \"approve, accept or fund any transportation plan, program or project unless\" it conforms to an applicable SIP. \u00a7 7506(c)(2). With respect to transportation conformity requirements, the EPA is responsible for promulgating, and periodically updating, \"criteria and procedures for demonstrating and assuring conformity in the case of transportation plans, programs, and projects.\" \u00a7 7506(c)(4)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Contingency Measures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   SIPs must include contingency measures that take effect automatically \"if the area fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the [NAAQS] by the attainment date.\" \u00a7\u00a7 7502(c)(9), 7511a(c)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Anti-Backsliding Measures for Revoked NAAQS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to \"complete a thorough review\" of each NAAQS every five years and \"make such revisions ... and promulgate such new standards as may be appropriate.\" \u00a7 7409(d)(1). In promulgating new standards, if the EPA relaxes a NAAQS, it shall promulgate anti-backsliding measures for all areas that have not attained that standard as of the date of the relaxation. \u00a7 7502(e). The anti-backsliding measures \"shall provide for controls which are not less stringent than the controls applicable to areas designated nonattainment before such relaxation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

SOUTH COAST'S PETITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We begin with the simpler of the two petitions, that of South Coast. South Coast petitions this Court to invalidate the EPA's interpretation of the CAA in the Final Rule that \"states may not take credit for VOC or NO\n   <sub>\n    x\n   </sub>\n   reductions occurring from sources outside the nonattainment area for purposes of meeting the 15 percent [rate-of-progress] and 3 percent [reasonable further progress] requirements.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C264\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. at 12,273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . South Coast argues that the EPA was not required to interpret \"in the area\" in the context of the reasonable further progress requirement to mean \"in the nonattainment area.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(b)(1)(B). In promulgating the Final Rule, the EPA explained that in light of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    NRDC 2009\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3543019,3668487\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/1245/\">\n    571 F.3d at 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"there is no legal basis\" for \"allowing states to credit reductions achieved at sources outside the nonattainment area.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C264\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. at 12,273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . South Coast counters that our decision in\n   <em>\n    NRDC 2009\n   </em>\n   does not mandate the EPA's interpretation. Instead, South Coast contends that because downwind nonattainment areas are impacted by emissions from upwind areas, the EPA could reasonably interpret \"in the area\" in the context of the reasonable further progress requirement to mean the \"transport couple area\"-\"a larger area consisting of the nonattainment area in question plus the upwind area from which emission reductions would be obtained.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The text here is unambiguous. The Clean Air Act requires nonattainment areas that are classified as moderate or above to plan for \"reasonable further progress\" measured from \"baseline emissions,\" which are defined as \"the total amount of actual VOC or NO\n   <sub>\n    x\n   </sub>\n   emissions from all anthropogenic sources in the area during the\" baseline year. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (c)(2)(B), (d), (e). These statutory provisions refer to only one area, \"the area.\" Further, the term appears in a section entitled \"Moderate Areas,\" not a greater area. \u00a7 7511a(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7511(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   South Coast contends that limiting the phrase \"in the area\" to nonattainment areas would produce absurd results. According to South Coast, it may be impossible for certain areas to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Where the purpose of the Clean Air Act is served by interpreting \"in the area\" to mean \"transport couple area,\" South Coast argues that the statutory language is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   However, the Clean Air Act provides for an alternative to reducing emissions of pollutants by fixed percentages. \u00a7 7511a(b)(1)(A)(ii), (c)(2)(B).

The EPA responds that states must continue implementing all such measures in previously approved SIPs unless the EPA approves requests to amend SIPs to convert such requirements into contingency measures.

Unlike orphan nonattainment areas, these areas have met the statutory requirements for redesignation under \u00a7 7407(d)(3)(E). Therefore, these areas have shown, for example, that \"the[ir] improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions resulting from implementation of the applicable implementation plan.\" \u00a7 7407(d)(3)(E)(iii). Although these areas may not have been redesignated with respect to the 1997 NAAQS, by meeting the statutory requirements for redesignation with respect to the 2008 NAAQS, they necessarily also meet the less restrictive requirements for redesignation under the 1997 NAAQS. Accordingly, it is reasonable for these areas to shed their anti-backsliding controls by virtue of meeting the five statutory criteria for redesignation.

The Clean Air Act unambiguously requires nonattainment areas to satisfy all five of the conditions under \u00a7 7407(d)(3)(E) before they may shed controls associated with their nonattainment designation. The redesignation substitute lacks the following requirements of \u00a7 7407(d)(3)(E) : (1) the EPA has \"fully approved\" the \u00a7 7410(k) implementation plan; (2) the area's maintenance plan satisfies all the requirements under \u00a7 7505a; and (3) the state has met all relevant \u00a7 7410 requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C264\">\n    80 Fed.

Nonattainment areas must reduce emissions of pollutants by fixed percentages compared to the pollutant level in a baseline year. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(b)(1)(A), (B). The initial baseline year under the statute is 1990,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C264\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , but the statute does not define baseline years for future NAAQS.

While an initial baseline year of 1990 is specified by statute, the Clean Air Act is silent regarding future baseline years. Therefore, this question is governed by\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step two. The Reasonable Further Progress requirement ensures that states make regular emissions reductions to achieve timely attainment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7511a. To monitor their progress in achieving regular emissions reductions, states are required to prepare an emissions inventory every three years. \u00a7 7511a(a)(3)(A). The EPA's selection of 2011 as the baseline year is reasonable because it is tied to the three-year statutory cycle for emissions inventories.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, we deny Environmental Petitioners' challenge to the setting of 2011 as the baseline year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   With respect to selection of an alternative baseline year between 2008 and 2012, the EPA has failed to provide a statutory justification.

The EPA based its creation of the alternative baseline year option on the convenience of allowing nonattainment areas to receive credit for emissions reduction measures adopted prior to the baseline year.

Section 7506(c)(5) provides that conformity requirements apply to \"(A) a nonattainment area and each pollutant for which the area is designated as a nonattainment area; and (B) an area that was designated as a nonattainment area but that was later redesignated ... as an attainment area\n   and that is required to develop a maintenance plan under section 7505a.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   We previously explained that the EPA lacks the authority to revoke transportation conformity for orphan nonattainment areas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section IV.B.1(a),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The EPA argues that it is permitted to remove conformity requirements for orphan maintenance areas because such areas became attainment areas for the 1997 NAAQS prior to the date on which it was revoked. As a result, the EPA argues that these areas are not subject to anti-backsliding requirements, so there is no statutory requirement that they maintain the transportation conformity requirement. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In contrast to nonattainment areas, which \u00a7 7506(c)(5) references by their status as \"nonattainment area[s],\" maintenance areas are referenced by previous events: \"an area that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   designated as a nonattainment area but that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   later redesignated ... as an attainment area and that is required to develop a maintenance plan under section 7505a.\" \u00a7 7506(c)(5) (emphases added). Although the Final Rule revoked the 1997 NAAQS, it cannot revoke the statutory status of orphan maintenance areas. Even after revocation of the 1997 NAAQS, an orphan maintenance area is \"an area that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   designated as a nonattainment area but that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   later redesignated ... as an attainment area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It is irrelevant that this previous designation and redesignation occurred before the prior NAAQS was revoked because nothing in the Clean Air Act allows the EPA to waive this unambiguous statutory requirement. Moreover, the Act clearly contemplates new NAAQS being promulgated within ten years of an area's redesignation to attainment because the statute requires the EPA to review NAAQS every five years and to \"promulgate such new standards as may be appropriate.\" \u00a7 7409(d)(1). Therefore, the revocation of the 1997 NAAQS does not waive the unambiguous mandate that conformity requirements apply to orphan maintenance areas. Accordingly, we grant Environmental Petitioners' petition as to the elimination of transportation conformity in orphan maintenance areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

As with orphan nonattainment areas, with respect to orphan maintenance areas, the EPA adequately explained why no additional measures beyond the \u00a7 7505a(a) maintenance plans and the Prevention of Significant Deterioration plans for the 2008 NAAQS are necessary to provide for maintenance of the 2008 NAAQS. Therefore, we deny Environmental Petitioners' petition with respect to the \u00a7 7410(a)(1) maintenance requirement's application to \"orphan maintenance areas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Elimination of Second Maintenance Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Environmental Petitioners challenge the Final Rule's elimination of the requirement that orphan maintenance areas prepare a second maintenance plan under \u00a7 7505a(b).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C264\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. at 12,301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 7505a(b) provides that \"8 years after redesignation of any area as an attainment area,\" states \"shall submit ... an additional revision of the\" maintenance plan \"for 10 years after the expiration of the 10-year period referred to in subsection (a).\" The EPA argues that the requirement for a second 10-year maintenance plan is based on an area's designation status under an operative NAAQS. When the 1997 NAAQS was revoked, the orphan maintenance areas' designations as maintenance under the 1997 NAAQS were revoked as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The statutory requirement for a second maintenance plan is unambiguous. \u00a7 7505a(b). And the Clean Air Act clearly contemplates new NAAQS being promulgated within eight years of an area's redesignation to attainment because the statute requires the EPA to review NAAQS every five years and to \"promulgate such new standards as may be appropriate.\" \u00a7 7409(d)(1). Therefore, the revocation of the old NAAQS does not waive the unambiguous requirement for second maintenance plans under \u00a7 7505a(b). Accordingly, we grant Environmental Petitioners' petition and vacate the Final Rule provision waiving the second 10-year maintenance plan for \"orphan maintenance areas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we deny South Coast's petition for review and grant in part and deny in part the Environmental Petitioners' petition. Specifically, we grant Environmental Petitioners' petition and vacate as to (1) waiver of the statutory attainment deadlines associated with the 1997 NAAQS; (2) removal of New Source Review and conformity controls from orphan nonattainment areas; (3) grant of permission to states to move anti-backsliding requirements for orphan nonattainment areas to their list of contingency measures based on initial 2008 designations; (4) waiver of the requirement that states adopt outstanding applicable requirements for the revoked 1997 NAAQS; (5) waiver of the \u00a7 7505a(a) maintenance plan requirement for orphan nonattainment areas; (6) creation of the \"redesignation substitute\"; (7) creation of an alternative baseline year option; (8) elimination of transportation conformity in orphan maintenance areas; and (9) waiver of the\n   requirement for a second 10-year maintenance plan for orphan maintenance areas. In all other respects, Environmental Petitioners' petition is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
