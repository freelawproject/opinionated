Folkens (\"Folkens\") alleges that Defendant Robert T. Wyland (\"Wyland\") infringed on his pen and ink depiction of two dolphins crossing underwater. Folkens contends that Wyland's depiction of an underwater scene infringes on his drawing by copying the crossing dolphins, and that the similar element of two dolphins crossing underwater is protectable under copyright law, entitling him to proceed to trial on the issue of whether Wyland's painting violates his copyright. We consider whether two dolphins crossing underwater is a protectable element under the objective standard of this Court's extrinsic test for substantial similarity. We hold that the depiction of two dolphins crossing underwater in this case is an idea that is found first in nature and is not a protectable element. We note, as we did in\n   <em>\n    Satava v. Lowry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9347873\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/805/\">\n    323 F.3d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2003), that a collection of unprotectable elements-pose, attitude, gesture, muscle structure, facial expression, coat, and texture-may earn \"thin copyright\" protection that extends to situations where many parts of the work are present in another work. But when, as here, the only areas of commonality are elements first found in nature, expressing ideas that nature has already expressed for all, a court need not permit the case to go to a trier of fact. We affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Folkens states he is a \"world-renowned wildlife artist, illustrator, photographer, researcher, and author best known for his work in the field of marine mammals.\" He is the author and copyright owner of a pen and ink illustration titled \"Two Tursiops Truncatus\" also known as \"Two Dolphins,\" which he created in 1979. Two Dolphins is a black and white depiction of two dolphins crossing each other, one swimming vertically and the other swimming horizontally. No other subjects appear in the pen and ink illustration.

Folkens further alleges that Defendants have created other unauthorized copies of Two Dolphins for use in advertising on the internet. Folkens alleges that Defendants currently display the infringing works at galleries around the country. Folkens states that he found out about the infringement in October 2013, and that he informed Defendants about their infringing works on or about September 18, 2014. This lawsuit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants after applying the Ninth Circuit's extrinsic test of substantial similarity to assess whether the Defendants' work infringed Folkens's copyright. Copyright protection only extends to original works and the district court had to first dissect the works, Two Dolphins and Life in the Living Sea, to determine what elements were original and protectable, and what elements were unprotectable. Then, under the extrinsic test, the district court properly only compared the works' protectable elements to determine if the works were substantially similar as measured by external, objective criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court found that \"the main similarity between Wyland's 'Life in the Living Sea' and Folkens's 'Two Dolphins' is two dolphins swimming underwater, with one swimming upright and the other crossing horizontally.\" The district court concluded that \"this idea of a dolphin swimming underwater is not a protectable element\" because natural positioning and physiology are not protectable under Ninth Circuit precedent, citing\n   <em>\n    Satava\n   </em>\n   . The district court commented that \"the cross-dolphin pose featured in both works results from dolphin physiology and behavior since dolphins are social animals, they live and travel in groups, and for these reasons, [dolphins] are commonly depicted swimming close together.\" The district court further found that Folkens had not identified any elements of his work that are not commonplace or dictated by the idea of two swimming dolphins. The district court concluded that no reasonable juror could find substantial similarity between the two works because the element of similarity between Two Dolphins and Life in the Living Sea was not a protectable element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review a district court's decision to grant summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    L.A.

Folkens contends that the dolphins here do not exhibit behavior shown in nature because the dolphins in the photos that Two Dolphins was based upon were posed by professional animal trainers in an enclosed environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Folkens contends that Defendants offered no evidence that the crossing of two dolphins in this way occurs in nature, and that fact alone should have precluded summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants argue that the district court correctly concluded that scenes found in nature, such as dolphins crossing in the wild, are not protected by copyright laws and that there were no protectable elements that were similar based on the shared subject matter. Defendants further argue that Folkens's reliance on the fact that the dolphins were posed is a red herring because animal trainers can pose animals to capture positions that naturally occur in the wild.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To prove copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show: \"(1) ownership of a valid copyright and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\"\n   <em>\n    Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v.

The parties do not dispute that Folkens owns a valid copyright, but instead focus on element two-whether Wyland copied constituent elements of the work that are original.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because direct evidence of copying is often not available, a plaintiff can establish copying by showing (1) that the defendant had access to the plaintiff's work and (2) that the two works are substantially similar.\n   <em>\n    L.A.

Folkens contends that his expression of two dolphins crossing is a protectable element,\n   while Defendants argue, and the district court concluded, that it was a naturally occurring element and therefore not protectable under copyright law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, we observe that the fact that a pose can be achieved with the assistance of animal trainers does not in itself dictate whether the pose can be found in nature. For example, an animal trainer may be used to get a dog to sit still while a photograph is taken or a painting is done, but no one would argue that the position of a dog sitting was not an idea first expressed in nature. In that case, the trainer's purpose was not to create a novel pose, but to induce the dog to hold that pose for a period of time. Similarly, here, the dolphin trainer got one dolphin to swim upwards while its photo was taken, and got another to swim horizontally while its picture was taken. Neither of these swimming postures was novel. The positioning of the dolphins by a trainer does not entitle Folkens to survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Further, we have held that ideas, \"first expressed in nature, are the common heritage of humankind, and no artist may use copyright law to prevent others from depicting them.\"\n   <em>\n    Satava\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9347873\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/805/\">\n    323 F.3d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reaffirm that basic principle. An artist may obtain a copyright by varying the background, lighting, perspective, animal pose, animal attitude, and animal coat and texture, but that will earn the artist only a narrow degree of copyright protection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9347873\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/805/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no question that the other aspects of Two Dolphins and Life in the Living Sea, beyond the two dolphins crossing, are different-Life in the Living Sea is in color, includes a third dolphin, has different lighting, and includes several species of fish and marine plants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Satava\n   </em>\n   , we considered a case where a plaintiff attempted to assert a copyright infringement claim for glass-in-glass sculptures of jellyfish rising in the ocean.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9347873\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/805/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9347873\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/805/\">\n    at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Satava\n   </em>\n   , we made clear that those protectable elements could not be ideas expressed in nature subject to a thin copyright that may extend only to the pose, attitude, gesture, muscle structure, facial expression, coat, or texture of the animal. Because the depictions of two dolphins crossing here share no similarities other than in their non-protectable elements\n   of the dolphins crossing, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Folkens also filed a claim for infringement based on Defendants' sculpture known as the Wyland Dolphin, but the grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants on that claim is not at issue on this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Appellant and Appellees submitted black and white copies of Wyland's Life in the Living Sea to this court in their excerpts of records. Both parties agree, however, that Life in the Living Sea is a color painting. We retrieved the color depiction of the painting reproduced above from the district court's docket as the exhibit submitted to the district court on summary judgment was in color.\n    <em>\n     See Folkens v. Wyland Worldwide, et al.\n    </em>\n    , 2:14-cv-02197-JAM-CKD, Docket 33-13, Ex. J at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Wyland, Wyland Worldwide, LLC, Wyland Galleries, Inc, and Signature Gallery Group, Inc., d/b/a Wyland Galleries are collectively referred to as Defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Both parties offer other arguments that are not relevant to the main issue and this Court's decision in this case. Folkens contends that Life in the Living Sea is a mere enlargement of Two Dolphins, and Defendants contend that Wyland drew dolphins crossing prior to when Folkens created Two Dolphins.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
