Levy is a native and citizen of Jamaica. His father acknowledged paternity at birth but never married Levy's mother. Levy's father became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 1978, obtained full custody of Levy in 1984, and became a naturalized citizen in 1985. Levy became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 1985 and resided with his father. Levy's mother never resided nor acquired immigration status in the United States and died in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a jury convicted Levy for conspiracy to commit mail fraud,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Department of Homeland Security began proceedings to remove him from the country. The Immigration Judge sustained the removal charge. Levy moved to terminate the proceedings, contending that he is a United States citizen by way of his father's naturalization.

According to him, if his mother instead of his father had been a United States citizen, he would derive citizenship. Levy misreads the statute. As a legitimated child, Levy could derive citizenship under \u00a7 1432(a) only if: both parents are naturalized,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201432\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1432(a)(1); the surviving parent is naturalized,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201432\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1432(a)(2); or both parents legally separate and the one having legal custody is naturalized,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201432\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1432(a)(3). None of those conditions turns on gender. Had the situation been reversed-if Levy's mother had become a lawful permanent resident, was naturalized, and raised him in the United States while his father remained in Jamaica-Levy still would not have derived citizenship because his parents never legally separated. As a result, \u00a7 1432(a) does not discriminate based on gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Levy next argues that \u00a7 1432(a) unconstitutionally discriminates based on legitimacy. Levy asserts that \u00a7 1432(a)(3)'s first clause violates the \"concept of illegitimacy\" relevant to the equal protection analysis: classifications targeting children born out of wedlock. But that clause does not distinguish between children born in\n   wedlock and those born out of wedlock. Instead, it distinguishes between children whose parents married and legally separated and those whose parents did not. The clause does not require that a child be born into wedlock: a child born out of wedlock whose parents later marry and legally separate qualifies under \u00a7 1432(a)(3). At bottom, the classification rests on two parental choices-whether to marry and legally separate-not on an \"immutable characteristic determined solely by accident of birth.\" Pet. Br. at 24 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Frontiero v. Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10299\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/677/#p686\">\n    411 U.S. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10299\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/677/#p686\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1770,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10299\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/677/#p686\">\n    36 L.Ed.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Alternatively, assuming without deciding that \u00a7 1432(a)(3)'s distinction based on marital choice is a legitimacy based classification, the statute passes constitutional muster. Legitimacy based statutory classifications usually receive intermediate scrutiny, which requires that the classification \"be substantially related to an important governmental objective.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

When reviewing equal protection challenges to immigration statutes, however, we require only a \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Fiallo v. Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127943\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/787/#p794\">\n    430 U.S. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 794,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127943\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/787/#p794\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127943\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/787/#p794\">\n    52 L.Ed.2d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). The Supreme Court has not decided whether that standard applies to naturalization statutes (as opposed to immigration statutes), but some of our sister circuits have applied that relaxed standard to \u00a7 1432(a).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

We need not resolve that question because the classification at issue is substantially related to an important government interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pierre v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695445\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/39/#p51\">\n    738 F.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51-54 (2d Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Ayton v.

The government interest at issue is respect for parental rights, namely the \"rights of an alien parent who may not wish his child to become a U.S. citizen.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695445\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/39/#p51\">\n    738 F.3d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Subsections 1432(a)(2) and (3) provide for single parent derivative naturalization. Because derivative naturalization automatically changes a child's citizenship and can effectively extinguish an alien's parental rights,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barthelemy v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9130205\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/1062/#p1066\">\n    329 F.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1066 (9th Cir. 2003), Congress limited single parent derivative citizenship to instances where it is fair to assume the alien parent was out of the picture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695445\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/39/#p51\">\n    738 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   53 ;\n   <em>\n    Catwell v.

That rationale is reflected most clearly in \u00a7 1432(a)(2), where the non-naturalizing parent is deceased. But it also animates \u00a7 1432(a)(3), both clauses of which safeguard an alien parent's rights. The first clause, which applies to married parents, permits the naturalizing parent's rights to trump the alien parent's only when the couple is legally separated and the naturalizing parent has legal custody.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201432\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). The second clause, involving parents who never married, permits a naturalizing mother's rights to trump an alien father's rights only when paternity is not established.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In both situations, it is fair to assume that the alien parent has a lesser interest in the child's citizenship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We cannot fault Congress for conditioning single parent derivative naturalization on the naturalizing parent having legal custody of the child and legally separating from the alien parent. Legal separation is a bright line marking the disunion of a married couple, and no analogous legal event marks the disunion of an unmarried couple. Perhaps Congress could have drafted \u00a7 1432(a) to provide an avenue for derivative citizenship for children like Levy-whose paternity was established, whose unmarried parents lived separately, and whose non-custodial alien parent was\n   out of the picture. But the Equal Protection Clause did not obligate Congress to create that avenue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nguyen v.

For those reasons, we agree with our sister circuits that \u00a7 1432(a) is substantially related to protecting parental rights.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695445\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/39/#p51\">\n    738 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   53 ;\n   <em>\n    Ayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050641\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/331/#p339\">\n    686 F.3d at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, Levy argues that \u00a7 1432(a) unconstitutionally burdens his fundamental right to maintain a family unit. Levy's argument seems to proceed in two parts. First, Levy asserts that \u00a7 1432(a)(3) permits people like him, who have deep roots to the United States, to be \"deported based on [their] father's gender and marital status.\" Contrary to Levy's assertion, he is being deported because he was convicted of a deportable crime-not because of his \"father's gender and marital status.\" Second, Levy asserts that \u00a7 1432(a)(3)\"can lead to a child's separation from their naturalized parent.\" But by that logic, any statute that fails to rescue an alien from removal after he commits a deportable crime violates due process. We decline to adopt such a rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    PETITION DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    When a person claims derivative citizenship, the BIA applies the law in effect when the last material condition was met.\n    <em>\n     In Re Rodriguez-Tejedor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20153\">\n     23 I&amp;N Dec. 153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 163 (B.I.A. 2001).
