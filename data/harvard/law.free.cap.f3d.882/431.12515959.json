He contends that the Court wrongly attributed to him illicit financial gains actually attributable to someone with whom he was not acting in concert and to whom he did not provide inside information. Because the District Court's factual findings are insufficient to support the sentence, we will vacate and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Insider Trading Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Metro, a former managing clerk at a prominent New York City law firm, engaged in a five-year insider trading scheme in which he abused his position at the firm by disclosing material nonpublic information to his close friend Frank Tamayo. The pattern of Metro's criminal activity remained fairly constant throughout the multi-year scheme. Between February 2009 and January 2013, he used his position at the law firm to obtain material nonpublic information concerning thirteen distinct corporate transactions. In each instance, after obtaining the inside information, he would meet with Tamayo and tell him which stocks to purchase and when. Tamayo would then write down the stock symbols of the companies whose stock he was about to acquire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Tamayo left those meetings with Metro, he would call his personal stockbroker, Vladimir Eydelman, and arrange to meet him, typically at Grand Central Station. Tamayo would show Eydelman the stock symbols he had written down and Eydelman would commit them to memory. Tamayo would then tell Eydelman when to make the trades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Eydelman made such trades not only for Tamayo but also on behalf of himself, his family, his friends, and other brokerage clients. Metro, by and large, did not hold the involved stocks himself and did not collect proceeds from the trades. Rather, he relied on Tamayo to reinvest the proceeds from their unlawful trades in future insider trading. When all was said and done, the insider trading by Eydelman, Tamayo, and Metro, based on Metro's tips, resulted in illicit gains of $5,673,682. The District Court attributed that entire sum to Metro in determining the length of his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Metro denies being aware of Eydelman's existence until one year after he relayed\n   his last tip to Tamayo, and he contends that he never intended any of the tips he provided to Tamayo to be passed to a broker or any other third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Tamayo Cooperates with the Government\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trading activity based on Metro's inside information did not go unnoticed by the government. Eventually, an investigation was launched and government agents executed a search warrant at Tamayo's home in or around December 2013. Tamayo promptly admitted his role in the scheme and began cooperating with the government. That cooperation included recording a January 28, 2014, meeting with Metro in which Metro expressed his desire to liquidate some of the gains that had accrued since 2009, so he could fund a real estate transaction. Tamayo responded that he had asked his stockbroker-who was unnamed in the conversation-to help liquidate some of the assets held in Tamayo's retirement account. A portion of that conversation follows, as set forth in a transcript created by the government and provided to the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   TAMAYO: [M]y stock broker ...

He might be the cheapest bastard around.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (App. at 175-77 (non-italicized alterations in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Metro also told Tamayo during that conversation that \"[i]f anything comes up, I'll let you know about it for sure.\" (Presentence Report \u00b6 97.) The government arrested Metro less than two months after that meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Presentence Report and Metro's Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After he was caught, Metro pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the securities laws\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and insider trading in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78ff. The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") set forth an analysis of Metro's sentencing exposure under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\" or \"guidelines\"). Specifically, the PSR applied \u00a7 2B1.4 of the guidelines, the provision relevant to insider trading, to calculate the offense level that would determine, in part, the appropriate sentencing range. Pursuant to that section, Metro's base offense level was 8. Because the gain resulting from his conduct exceeded $6,500, the guidelines, under \u00a7 2B1.4(b)(1), called for an \"increase by the number of levels from the table in \u00a7 2B1.1[.]\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.4(b)(1). As the PSR attributed all $5.6 million in illicit gains to Metro, an 18-level increase was directed by \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J). An additional 2-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2 was added because Metro had abused his position of trust as an employee with management responsibilities at the law firm. Finally, because Metro pled guilty and acknowledged his criminal behavior, the PSR credited him with accepting responsibility and hence allowed a 3-level reduction in his offense level, pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b). Based on a total offense level of 25 and Metro's criminal history category of I, the recommended guidelines range was 57 to 71 months of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Metro objected to the attribution to him of all the gains realized as a result of Eydelman's trades. He argued in a presentence filing with the District Court that he was not, in the language of commentary to guidelines \u00a7 2B1.4, \"acting in concert\" with Eydelman such that Eydelman's gains should be attributed to him for purposes of sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Sentencing Hearing and Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, Metro renewed his objection to the PSR's 18-level\n   enhancement based on all $5.6 million of illicit gains from the scheme. In response, the government described for the District Court its theory of the case: namely, that this was \"a three-party scheme[,]\" with Metro as the insider, Tamayo as the middleman, and Eydelman as the stockbroker. (App. at 79.) After the District Court asked whether the law requires that Metro \"know of Mr. Eydelman in order to have\" responsibility for Eydelman's gains, the government answered that the law only requires that Metro \"know that there is somebody else that is obtaining the inside information that he is passing on. And [the government has] to show that all three gentlemen were acting in concert.\" (App. at 81-82.) The government then argued that it had met those requirements because Eydelman, the ultimate recipient of Metro's tips, was critical to the insider trading, and that the January 28, 2014, conversation demonstrated Metro's awareness of Eydelman's existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Metro disputed the government's characterization of the January 28 conversation, arguing that it did not support a finding that he had acted in concert with Eydelman because the conversation took place one year after the last time Metro provided an inside tip. According to Metro, he first learned that a broker (i.e., Eydelman) was involved with the scheme shortly before that conversation, and no fair interpretation of his responses shows that he had been aware of Eydelman when he (Metro) was passing information to Tamayo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The District Court overruled Metro's objection to the PSR's attribution of the full $5.6 million to him. Without making any explicit factual findings on the record, the Court stated that \"[t]he commentary [to \u00a7 2B1.4 ] unequivocally attributes all the gains made by Tamayo and Eydelman to Metro. ... So with that, the Court also finds that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kluger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/549/\">\n    722 F.3d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2013) is also on point and analogous[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. at 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   When handing down Metro's sentence, the District Court used the PSR's guideline imprisonment range of 57 to 71 months as a starting point. It then granted a two-level downward variance because of Metro's \"strong family ties\" and \"redeemable qualities,\" resulting in a guideline imprisonment range of 46 to 57 months. The Court sentenced Metro to a 46-month term of imprisonment, a three-year term of supervised release, a $10,000 fine, and a $200 special assessment. Metro now appeals that sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The District Court rightly looked to the insider trading-specific guideline, \u00a7 2B1.4, in sentencing Metro. As already noted, that section provides for a base offense level of 8, and then says that \"[i]f the gain resulting from the offense exceeded $6,500, increase by the number of levels from the table in \u00a7 2B1.1 ....\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.4(b)(1). The commentary to the section explains that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   ... Insider trading is treated essentially as a sophisticated fraud. Because the victims and their losses are difficult if not impossible to identify, the gain, i.e.,\n   <em>\n    the total increase in value realized through trading in securities by the defendant and persons acting in concert with the defendant or to whom the de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fendant provided inside information\n   </em>\n   , is employed instead of the victims' losses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.4 cmt. background (emphasis added). Relying on that commentary, the District Court attributed to Metro all of the gains realized from Eydelman's illegal trades, which amounted to approximately $5.6 million. Metro argues that the Court failed to make sufficient factual findings to support that attribution and gave too broad a meaning to the phrase \"acting in concert.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

That of course was also the government's position, but the only evidence offered by the government to establish that Metro had any knowledge of Eydelman, or that Metro had any awareness that his insider tips were received by anyone other than Tamayo, was the January 28, 2014, transcript. Metro objected throughout sentencing to the conclusion in the PSR that he acted \"in concert with\" or \"provided inside information\" to Eydelman, and he disputed that the January 28, 2014, transcript established that he had. The District Court, at Metro's sentencing hearing, neither resolved those factual disputes nor made any other factual findings with regard to Metro's relationship with, or knowledge of, Eydelman. The Court appears to have concluded either that, in light of\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   , Metro's guilty plea to a conspiracy count naming Eydelman was a sufficient basis to establish the \"in concert with\" or the \"provide inside information to\" requirements for the attribution of gains, or that\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   requires that courts hold tippers accountable at sentencing for all downstream trading resulting from that tipper's inside information. Both interpretations take\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   too far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Metro pled guilty to Count 1 of the indictment, which charged him with conspiring with \"Tamayo, Eydelman, and others\" to violate the securities laws. (App. at 26.) It is clear, however, that the guidelines do not consider a defendant's criminal liability to be co-extensive with sentencing accountability. The commentary to the guidelines' \"Relevant Conduct\" provision, \u00a7 1B1.3, is explicit that \"[t]he principles and limits of sentencing accountability\n   under this guideline are not always the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability,\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. 1, and further that, \"[b]ecause a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many participants over a period of time, the scope of\" a defendant's conduct for sentencing purposes \"is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy,\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. 3(B).

The 2015 version of \u00a7 1B1.3 amended subsection (a)(1)(B), the provision containing guidance on when a court is to hold a defendant accountable for the conduct of others \"in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity[.]\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). In the pre-2015 version of the guidelines that\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   interpreted, that specific subsection instructed courts to hold defendants responsible \"in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor,\n   or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy)[ ] [for] all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity[.]\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (2011). Following the 2015 amendments, \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) now instructs courts to hold a defendant responsible,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), [for] all acts and omissions of others that were-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The amendment placed within the text of the guideline three distinct factors for courts to consider when conducting the \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) analysis. By its own account, the Sentencing Commission amended the guideline to \"clarify the use of relevant conduct in offenses involving multiple participants.\" U.S.S.G.

While the amendment did not signal a \"substantive change in policy,\" it did clarify that courts should go through a three-step analysis before attributing the conduct of others to a defendant facing sentencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346250\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1215/#p1223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That analysis requires courts to \"(1) identify the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; (2) determine whether the conduct of others in the jointly undertaken criminal activity was in furtherance of that criminal activity; and (3) determine whether the conduct of others was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346250\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1215/#p1223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The main point of the amendment was to take the \"scope\" step of the analysis out of the commentary and place it \"in the text of the guideline itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346250\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1215/#p1223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   had no occasion to address the \"scope\" of the jointly undertaken criminal activity because it was not disputed that the defendant was aware of, and acting with, the stockbroker.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062714\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/549/\">\n    722 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   559 n.13. Rather, the\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   Court's analysis focused on whether conduct that was admittedly within the scope of and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity also had to be foreseeable to be attributable to an insider-trading defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062714\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/549/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062714\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/549/\">\n    at 557-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Before attributing gains to a defendant under \u00a7 2B1.4's gain analysis, a sentencing court should first identify the scope of conduct for which the defendant can fairly be held accountable for sentencing purposes under \u00a7 1B1.3. After identifying the scope of conduct, the court should then analyze that conduct to determine whom the defendant \"act[ed] in concert with\" and to whom he \"provided inside information[.]\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.4 cmt. background. That may lead the court to attribute to a defendant gains realized by downstream trading emanating from the defendant's tips, but, depending on the facts established at sentencing, it may not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   does not impose, as the government suggests, \"what amounts to strict liability\" on tippers, regardless of whether or not the tipper had any knowledge at the\n   time he was providing the inside information that it would reach an individual other than the individual to whom he provided it. (Answering Br. at 26.) In fact, the government's own argument to the District Court undercuts the position it has taken before us. When asked by the District Court whether Metro had to \"know of Mr. Eydelman in order to have\" responsibility for Eydelman's gains, the government answered that the law requires that Metro \"know that there is somebody else that is obtaining the inside information that he is passing on. And [the government has] to show that all three gentlemen were acting in concert.\" (App. at 81-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because \"the attribution of gains to a defendant can be critical in a guidelines sentencing range calculation,\"\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062714\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/549/\">\n    722 F.3d at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the \"strict liability\" position now taken by the government runs the risk of sentences being imposed on defendants that are excessive in relation to their criminal conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our holding today avoids that risk but remains fully in line with\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   .

The District Court Did Not Address Critical Factual Disputes Relevant to the Scope of Metro's Conduct for Sentencing Purposes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Since we have concluded that district courts must look to \u00a7 1B1.3 to determine the scope of conduct for which a defendant can be held accountable for sentencing purposes, we must now consider whether the District Court made \"a searching and individualized inquiry into the circumstances surrounding [Metro's] involvement in the conspiracy ... to ensure that [Metro's] sentence accurately reflect[ed] his ... role.\"\n   <em>\n    Collado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517698\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/985/#p997\">\n    975 F.2d at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Metro, for his part, clearly objected to the government's position that he \"acted in concert with\" or \"provided inside information\" to Eydelman. The District Court never resolved those factual disputes on the record; it simply overruled Metro's objection and concluded that\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   was controlling. Had the Court's assessment of\n   <em>\n    Kluger\n   </em>\n   been correct, it may have been justified in viewing as moot the factual disputes raised by Metro.

Because the District Court here did not resolve the key factual dispute raised by Metro, or otherwise provide a factual basis to support its gain analysis, there was not the \"searching and individualized inquiry\" necessary to ensure Metro's sentence matched his role in the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    D. A Guilty Plea Alone Is Not Necessarily Determinative of Sentencing Accountability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In reaching our conclusion, we do not imply that a defendant can contest at sentencing the factual averments contained in an indictment to which he pled guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That issue is not before us today because the indictment to which Eydelman pled guilty contains no facts actually linking Metro to Eydelman. Though it charged Metro with \"knowingly and willfully combin[ing], conspir[ing] and agree[ing] with Tamayo, Eydelman, and others\" to violate the securities laws, (App. at 26-27,) the indictment did not set out any factual basis showing that Metro \"acted in concert with\" or \"provided inside information\" to Eydelman for purposes of sentencing accountability. Similarly, the PSR does not contain any facts linking Metro to Eydelman, other than referring to the fact that Metro was charged with conspiring with Eydelman. And although the government could have elicited facts from Metro at his plea hearing to tie him to Eydelman, it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On the contrary, at the plea hearing, the government established only that Metro learned about Eydelman after the insider trading activity had ended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It asked Metro whether he \"enter[ed] into an agreement with Frank Tamayo to engage in securities transactions based on material nonpublic information,\" to which Metro responded, \"Yes,\" but it did not ask whether he entered into an agreement with Eydelman. (App. at 67.) The government next asked whether Metro \"disclose[d] the inside information to Tamayo,\" to which Metro responded, \"Yes.\" (App. at 67.) It did not ask if he disclosed information to Eydelman. The government asked whether, between February 2009 and January\n   2013, Metro \"provide[d] Tamayo inside information related to at least 13 different corporate transactions so that Tamayo could profit by trading on the inside information[,]\" to which Metro responded, \"Yes.\" (App. at 69.) The government did not ask whether he provided that information with the intent that it reach Eydelman. The government further asked, \"[w]ith respect to the overt acts charged in the indictment, do you acknowledge that you and Frank Tamayo each had a defined role to perform certain specific acts in furtherance of your agreement to [violate the securities laws],\" to which Metro replied, \"Yes.\" (App. at 69.) The government did not ask about Eydelman's role, if any, in that agreement. The only fact the government did elicit from Metro concerning Eydelman was that \"[a]fter [his] arrest,\" Metro \"learn[ed] that Tamayo used a broker named Vladimir Eydelman[.]\" (App. at 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The government must prove facts supporting a sentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
