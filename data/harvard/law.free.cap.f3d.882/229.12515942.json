The District Court rejected Chichakli's argument that the State Department's disclosure of an additional piece of identifying information-his Australian driver's license number-somehow changed the calculus because \" 'identification media (such as passports, residence, or driver's license information),' ... are among the types of information about an individual maintained in [the State Department's] Security Records.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2048\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2048\">\n    at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C277\">\n    78 Fed.

As an alternative ground for dismissal, the District Court held that Chichakli had also failed to plead \"concrete and quantifiable damages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C277\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C277\">\n    at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The District Court also held that the purported disclosures were within the scope of routine-use notices published by the agencies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2048\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   for Chichakli argues, in the main, that the purpose of OFAC's and the State Department's disclosures of Chichakli's personal identifying information was incompatible with the reasons the information was collected. Without deciding the precise definition of \"compatibility,\" we agree with the District Court that under any reasonable interpretation, the purposes of OFAC's and the State Department's disclosures were compatible with the purposes for which each agency collected the information. The purpose for collecting Chichakli's identifying information-to investigate whether to designate him for economic sanctions and to implement the sanctions-is precisely aligned with the purpose of disclosure-to implement\n   the sanctions by publishing the information to the public. This is true for OFAC, as well as the Department of State.\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   relies on\n   <em>\n    Sussman v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sussman\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that when a U.S. Marshal disclosed personal information by \"yelling and screaming\" at a group of individuals being questioned in an investigation, the disclosure was not compatible with the purpose of disclosing information \"to the extent necessary to obtain information or cooperation\" in an investigation.\n   <em>\n    Sussman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565051,6047422\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1106/\">\n    494 F.3d at 1122-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is a far cry from the situation here. The purpose of the purported disclosures was in no way incidental-the information was published by OFAC and transmitted by the State Department to implement the sanctions regime. As in\n   <em>\n    Ames\n   </em>\n   , the disclosure here was compatible with the purpose of collection \"under any reasonable formulation of the compatibility test....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ames\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276134\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/238/#p240\">\n    861 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   240 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the routine-use exception to apply, the disclosure must also be covered by a routine-use notice published by the agency. The State Department published a routine-use notice in 2005, which covers the publication of personal identifying information to foreign entities and \"other public authorit[ies]\" for law-enforcement purposes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%203%2C430\">\n    70 Fed.

To the extent the problematic disclosures occurred after 2010, OFAC has had a routine-use notice published in the Federal Register, which also covers disclosure of personal identifying information \"to the general public ... regarding individuals and entities whose property and interests in property are ... affected by ... OFAC economic sanctions programs[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2061%2C853\">\n    75 Fed.

In any event, an argument about OFAC disclosures in violation of the 2005 OFAC regulations would be barred by the two-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(5).

The answer turns not on the tension between the Privacy Act and the IEEPA, but on whether the release of the information is compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected.
