Stolz, II, who does business under the name Royce International Broadcasting Company, owned radio station KUDL (FM) in Sacramento, California and held an FCC broadcast license for the station. This regulatory saga starts in February 1996 when Stolz signed a letter of intent to sell the radio station's assets and to transfer the FCC license to Entercom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Business relations between the two soured, however, before the sale and license transfer were completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Entercom sued Royce International in California state court seeking to enforce the agreement. In April 2002, the California Superior Court ordered specific performance of the radio station's sale and directed Stolz to sign a license transfer application to be submitted to the FCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November 2002, Entercom filed the necessary license transfer application with the FCC. Stolz did not sign it though. Instead, Stolz filed a petition with the FCC asking it to deny the application. Stolz argued that the FCC's methodology for measuring the size of the Sacramento local media market was flawed and that, if an accurate standard were employed, market concentration rules would bar Entercom from acquiring any more radio stations in that market (including, specifically, KUDL).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2003, the FCC's Media Bureau granted the license application and assigned the KUDL (FM) broadcast license to Entercom, finding that the transfer was permissible and in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Letter to Andrew S. Kersting,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Esq., and Brian M. Madden, Esq.,\n   </em>\n   FCC File No. BALH-20021120ACE, Ref. 1800B3-BSH (May 12, 2003). Under FCC regulations, the Media Bureau's decision was not the last agency word. FCC regulations allowed Stolz to seek review of the Bureau's decision by the FCC itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.115\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Within a month of the Media Bureau's decision, the FCC adopted the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   redefined the Sacramento local market along the lines for which Stolz had been arguing. As a result, if the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   were applied to Entercom's license application, the transfer would have to be denied because Entercom already held the maximum number of broadcast licenses permitted within the Sacramento market. Stolz promptly petitioned the Media Bureau for reconsideration, arguing that the transfer application was still \"pending\" and thus subject to the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   's new local-market definition. After a two-year delay, the Bureau denied reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Stolz then sought review by the full FCC. The FCC inexplicably delayed ten years before finally affirming the Bureau's decision in September 2015. Stolz sought reconsideration by the FCC, arguing that this court's intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Kidd Communications v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241142,3446319\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1/\">\n    427 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2005), rendered the involuntary transfer unlawful. The full FCC denied the petition\n   for reconsideration, reasoning that Stolz should have raised his arguments under\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   earlier by seeking to reopen briefing on his petition to the full FCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We have exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from FCC decisions granting or denying the assignment of a radio broadcast license.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) &amp; (b)(6). We dismiss Stolz's appeal in part as moot and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Stolz's central argument on appeal is that the FCC should have applied the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   's new local-market definition to Entercom's license transfer application because this case was still pending within the administrative process at the time the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   took effect. The parties do not dispute that, had the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   's market definition been applied, Entercom's application would have been denied because it would at the time have owned too many radio stations within the Sacramento market. Under the regulatory scheme that predated the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, Entercom could obtain the KUDL license without exceeding the local-market ownership rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2073.3555\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(ii) (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As events have unfolded, we need not untangle the less-than-pellucid definition of \"pending\" administrative actions to determine whether the grandfather clause in the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   applies to this license transfer application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is because, during the pendency of this case, Entercom relinquished its broadcast license for and ceased to operate one of its preexisting FM radio stations in the Sacramento market.\n   <em>\n    Entercom License, LLC\n   </em>\n   , FCC 17M-09,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201088491\">\n    2017 WL 1088491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (March 16, 2017) (\"On February 8, 2017, Entercom forwarded the station license for KDND(FM) * * * and other KDND instruments of authorization to the Commission for cancellation[.]\"). With that license returned to the FCC, Entercom now only operates four FM radio stations and one AM radio station in the Sacramento market. Transcript of Oral Argument at 8-9,\n   <em>\n    Stolz v. FCC\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-1248 (D.C. Cir. argued Sept. 11, 2017). That means that even under the\n   <em>\n    2002 Order\n   </em>\n   's new local-market rule, Entercom is eligible to acquire KUDL's license without running afoul of market concentration limitations. Both parties conceded this point at oral argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 10, 19. Accordingly, that portion of Stolz's appeal is dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Stolz separately argues that the FCC's approval of the transfer is invalid under our decision in\n   <em>\n    Kidd Communications v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Stolz reads that decision as broadly barring the involuntary transfers of licenses that are an outgrowth of state-court litigation. While we disagree with Stolz's reading of\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   , we are also unpersuaded by the FCC's invocation of a procedural bar to even addressing intervening circuit precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   -a precedential ruling that Stolz believes proscribes the FCC's decision in his case-came down\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   briefing had been completed on Stolz's application for review to the FCC challenging the Media Bureau's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.115\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). There of course was no possible way for Stolz to have included an argument relying on\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   before that precedent actually intervened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The FCC disputes none of that. Instead, the FCC argues that Stolz's argument about\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   should have been presented to the FCC through some supplemental filing rather than waiting until after the decision issued and then seeking reconsideration. Stolz's failure to do so, the FCC insists, forever forfeited his reliance on intervening circuit precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That is wrong. We have found no FCC rule permitting, let alone requiring, supplemental filings after closure of the pleading cycle. The FCC cites no such rule. Nor does anything in the FCC's procedural regulations put claimants on fair notice that failure to file a nowhere-mentioned-in-the-rules supplemental document will procedurally forfeit a claim. Worse still, what the FCC's regulations do say is that a petition for reconsideration is exactly the place in which to raise \"events which have occurred or circumstances which have changed since the last opportunity to present such matters to the Commissioner.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.106\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(i) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.115\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (\"[N]ew questions of fact or law may be presented to the designated authority in a petition for reconsideration.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The FCC, for its part, cites to a couple of footnotes in prior decisions and a 1979 order to demonstrate that, on occasion, the FCC has entertained such supplemental filings. That misses the point. The issue here is not whether the FCC could have entertained such a filing if Stolz had thought to attempt it. Rather, the issue is whether the FCC gave Stolz fair notice that he had to plead for an exercise of discretion under an\n   <em>\n    unwritten\n   </em>\n   rule on pain of forfeiting a claim that the\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   rules expressly say could be presented later in a petition for reconsideration. If an agency wants a procedural requirement to have the type of claim-foreclosing consequence the FCC attached here, it needs to be explicit about the rule and upfront about consequences of noncompliance. The FCC may not, like Nero, lay out its procedural requirements in a way that makes them \"harder to read and easier to transgress.\" Antonin Scalia,\n   <em>\n    The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%201175\">\n    56 U.

Cir. 1987) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It also bears remembering that the reason Stolz waited ten years to raise his\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   argument is that it inexplicably took the FCC\n   <em>\n    ten years\n   </em>\n   to issue its barely four-page decision on Stolz's application for review. Of course Stolz could not file a petition for\n   <em>\n    re\n   </em>\n   consideration until after the FCC first considered and decided his application for review. In other words, this is hardly the case for the FCC to be pointing a non-jurisdictional timeliness finger at others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While Stolz wins that procedural battle, he loses the war. His reliance on\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   substantially overreads that case. To be sure, in\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   as in this case, a state court ordered the involuntary filing with the FCC of an application for assignment of a broadcast license.\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241142,3446319\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1/\">\n    427 F.3d at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the similarities end there. The problem in\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   was that, once that application was filed, the FCC woodenly granted the assignment application (i) without ensuring that transfer was in the \"public interest,\" as federal law requires,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20310\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), and (ii) notwithstanding that the transfer would enforce the very type of reversionary interest that FCC regulations expressly prohibit.\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241142,3446319\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1/\">\n    427 F.3d at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that the FCC's asserted desire \"to accommodate the [state] court [order]\" for its own sake was unlawful. \"[T]he Commission is not obliged to accommodate a state court's decision that is contrary to Commission policy * * * [and] the public interest determinations [are left] to the Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241142,3446319\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241142,3446319\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1/\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nothing like that happened here. Contrary to Stolz's argument (Br. 23), the dispute in this matter did not involve a transfer that would have enforced a reversionary interest prohibited by FCC regulations, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, the California Superior Court did not order the FCC to grant the transfer application; the court only ordered Stolz to sign the application with the FCC as his agreement with Entercom required.
