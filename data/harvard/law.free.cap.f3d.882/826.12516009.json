In 1999, Padilla-Ramirez unlawfully entered the United States without applying for admission or parole. When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initiated removal proceedings against him in 2006, Padilla-Ramirez sought to avoid removal by applying for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention). These applications were denied, but the immigration judge (IJ) allowed Padilla-Ramirez to depart the country voluntarily. In the event that Padilla-Ramirez failed to depart timely, the order of voluntary departure would become an order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Padilla-Ramirez appealed unsuccessfully the IJ's orders to the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board). He managed to obtain a sixty-day extension of his voluntary departure period, but failed to depart by the deadline. As a result, the voluntary departure order was converted into a removal order that became effective on January 25, 2009. ICE removed Padilla-Ramirez to El Salvador in February 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2015, ICE discovered that Padilla-Ramirez had re-entered the country illegally and was being detained in Idaho in connection with a state criminal prosecution. ICE promptly reinstated Padilla-Ramirez's original removal order pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) and, following the dismissal of his state charges, took custody of Padilla-Ramirez in February 2016. Padilla-Ramirez then asserted that he feared returning to El Salvador and was referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear determination pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The asylum officer found that Padilla-Ramirez had stated a reasonable fear of persecution or torture if he were removed to El Salvador and referred him to an IJ to determine whether he is eligible for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention. These \"withholding-only\" proceedings are ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Padilla-Ramirez filed the instant habeas petition after the IJ denied his request for a bond hearing on grounds that she lacked jurisdiction to consider the request. The district court denied the petition on substantially the same grounds, concluding that Padilla-Ramirez is detained pursuant to a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) that does not allow for bond hearings. Padilla-Ramirez appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Our task in this case is to determine which provision of the Act governs Padilla-Ramirez's detention. Padilla-Ramirez argues that he is detained pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which grants the Attorney General discretion to detain an alien \"pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). That section also permits the Attorney General to release the alien on bond or conditional parole.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1226(a)(2). Pursuant to regulations, an initial custody determination under section 1226(a) is made by the district director, but the detainee may request an additional bond hearing before an IJ.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20236.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). As stated, Padilla-Ramirez requested such a bond hearing, but the IJ denied his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Conversely, the government contends that Padilla-Ramirez is detained pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Section 1231(a) provides for mandatory detention during a ninety-day \"removal period,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1231(a)(2), and discretionary detention \"beyond the removal period\" in certain circumstances,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1231(a)(6). The bond hearing authorized under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20236.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) does not apply to detentions authorized under section 1231(a). Thus, Padilla-Ramirez's entitlement to a bond hearing hinges on whether he is detained pursuant to section 1226(a) or section 1231(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Our decision only addresses Padilla-Ramirez's entitlement to an initial bond hearing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20236.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We do not address Padilla-Ramirez's entitlement to a bond hearing after prolonged detention. We previously have held that \"individuals detained under \u00a7 1231(a)(6) are entitled to the same procedural safeguards against prolonged detention as individuals detained under \u00a7 1226(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Diouf v.

Section 1231(a)(1)(B)(iii) does not apply either because \"an immigration process\" is the only basis for Padilla-Ramirez's detention.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The question before us, then, is whether Padilla-Ramirez's reinstated removal order is administratively final.

Indeed, we previously have concluded that \"this statutory definition of finality does not dictate a clear answer here because there is no way to appeal the reinstatement of a removal order to the [Board].\"\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Alfaro v.

Accordingly, we must look elsewhere to determine the statute's meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The government urges us to defer to a federal regulation which, it contends, answers the question before us. That regulation reads: \"Execution of the reinstated order of removal and detention of the alien shall be administered in accordance with this part.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.8\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). \"[T]his part\" refers to Part 241, which contains regulations implementing section 1231. On its face, this regulation appears to indicate that Padilla-Ramirez is detained pursuant to that section. However, the only detention regulation in Part 241 that could apply to an alien like Padilla-Ramirez simply states that \"[o]nce the removal period defined in section 241(a)(1) of the Act begins, an alien in the United States will be taken into custody pursuant to the warrant of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241.3(a). This regulation therefore does not answer the question of\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   the removal period begins. Because the regulation does not answer the question presented, we will conduct our own review of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Reinstatement of a removal order is governed by section 1231(a)(5), which reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). This provision indicates, in two ways, that a reinstated removal order is administratively final. First, a removal order undoubtedly is administratively final when it first is executed; if it is reinstated from its original date, it stands to reason that it retains the same administrative finality because section 1231(a)(5) proscribes any challenge that might affect the status of the underlying removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the reinstatement provision is located in the same section of the Act, tellingly entitled \"Detention and removal of aliens\n   <em>\n    ordered removed\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1231 (emphasis added), as the detention authority that the government claims in this case. This placement suggests that Congress meant for the detention of aliens subject to reinstated removal orders to be governed by that section, which would require that such orders be administratively final. The fact that the reinstatement provision appears among section 1231(a)'s detention and supervision provisions further bolsters this inference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1231(a)(2)-(3), (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Notwithstanding section 1231(a)(5)'s mandatory language, it offers some leeway with respect to withholding-only proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Andrade-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336342\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/829/#p833\">\n    828 F.3d at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The decision to be made in those proceedings is not whether he is to be removed from the United States, but merely whether he may be removed to El Salvador. This narrow question of\n   <em>\n    to where\n   </em>\n   an alien may be removed is distinct from the broader question of\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   the alien may be removed; indeed, the former inquiry requires that the latter already have been resolved in the affirmative. The fact that the government may still remove Padilla-Ramirez, albeit to an alternate country, even if he is granted withholding confirms that the decision identified in section 1226(a) has already been made-he is \"to be removed\n   <em>\n    from the United States\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Like Zadvydas, the only obstacles to Padilla-Ramirez's removal from the United States are potential individualized determinations that he cannot be removed to specific countries. There is an obvious distinction between the two cases in that those determinations may be made in domestic administrative proceedings in Padilla-Ramirez's case, whereas Zadvydas was made unremovable by virtue of other countries' refusals to accept him. However, the touchstone of section 1226 is the nature of the decision to be made, not the identity of the decision-maker, and the decision to be made in this case is the same as in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   : whether Padilla-Ramirez's removal order may be executed with respect to particular countries. The fact that Zadvydas was detained pursuant to section 1231(a) even while the government cycled through the list of possible removal countries indicates that such country-specific determinations are not \"decision[s] on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

We held that the Board's dismissal of the alien's appeal was the final order for three reasons, two of which are relevant here.

In\n   <em>\n    Kanacevic\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that it had jurisdiction to review a denial of asylum notwithstanding the absence of a \"final order of removal,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), because such a denial \"is the functional equivalent of a removal order\" in asylum-only proceedings,\n   <em>\n    Kanacevic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046094\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/129/\">\n    448 F.3d at 134-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The implication in\n   <em>\n    Guerra\n   </em>\n   is that the denial of withholding in withholding-only proceedings is likewise the \"functional equivalent\" of a final removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Far from supporting the Second Circuit's analogy,\n   <em>\n    Kanacevic\n   </em>\n   underscores a critical distinction between asylum-only proceedings and withholding-only proceedings: in the former, the denial of asylum\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the order of removal. Consequently, there can be no removal order, final or otherwise, until the alien's claim for relief is resolved. Not so in withholding-only proceedings, where a final removal order has been not only entered but\n   <em>\n    executed\n   </em>\n   by the time a withholding-only claim is made. Also, in contrast to withholding-only proceedings, the removal order itself is at issue in asylum-only proceedings, as evidenced by the fact that the order (i.e., denial of asylum) is subject to judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046094\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/129/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Kanacevic\n   </em>\n   , like\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Alfaro\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ayala\n   </em>\n   , addressed finality for judicial-review purposes and was motivated, at least in part, to ensure the availability of such review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046094\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/129/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046094\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/129/\">\n    at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Were we to ... hold[ ] that the disposition of asylum-only proceedings does not function as a final order of removal ..., we would create uncertainty over exactly what procedure a Visa Waiver applicant could pursue in order to obtain review of his or her asylum proceedings in the Courts of Appeals\").\n   <em>\n    Kanacevic\n   </em>\n   therefore is a poor fit in helping to decide this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The second case relied on by the Second Circuit,\n   <em>\n    Chupina v.

Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Chupina\n   </em>\n   's holding-that a denial of asylum was not a final removal order because the Board had remanded the alien's other claims for relief-rested largely on the court's recognition that the original removal order would be in flux until the IJ and Board resolved the remanded claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665130\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/99/\">\n    570 F.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Second Circuit is correct that only an agency action marking \"the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process\" qualifies as final agency action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055268\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs v.

But its conclusion that no such consummation exists while withholding-only proceedings are ongoing again misunderstands the decision at stake in those proceedings. The agency already decided that Padilla-Ramirez \"is to be removed from the United States,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and a different, more limited decision is now pending in his withholding-only proceedings-namely, whether he may be removed to El Salvador. The agency has consummated its decision-making regarding the first issue, but not the second. It therefore is consonant with settled administrative legal principles to hold that Padilla-Ramirez's reinstated removal order (i.e., the agency's decision that he \"is to be removed from the United States,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) is final for detention purposes even though it lacks finality for purposes of judicial review of his withholding-only claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a general rule, \"we decline to create a circuit split unless there is a compelling reason to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Kelton Arms Condo.

This is especially true where the rules at issue \"are best applied uniformly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095827\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/1190/#p1192\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Immigration and Nationality Act, a comprehensive federal scheme that requires a nationally unified administration program, certainly falls into this category. While this consideration ordinarily would counsel in favor of adopting the Second Circuit's resolution of the issue before us, we believe that the legislative intent on this point is in clear opposition to that resolution. By its terms, section 1231(a)(5) inoculates the prior removal orders underlying reinstatement orders against any challenge, and withholding-only proceedings do not override that proscription. Our own decisions in\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Alfaro\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ayala\n   </em>\n   , which addressed finality for judicial-review purposes and turned principally on avoiding a construction that would severely inhibit or eliminate that review, are not controlling in the detention context. Nor are we persuaded by the Second Circuit's analysis in reaching the opposite conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Guerra\n   </em>\n   . So even though it may create discord in our immigration system, we must give effect to Congress's purpose as we understand it. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. If uniformity is\n   required, we are content to leave it to the Supreme Court to harmonize the resulting split of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Padilla-Ramirez did not challenge the factual predicates for reinstatement.
