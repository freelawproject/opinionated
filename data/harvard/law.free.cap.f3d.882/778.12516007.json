Direct Appeal-Robert and Roger\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On October 26, 1995, the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 553. On direct appeal, the brothers raised five issues: (1) jury selection; (2) pretrial motions; (3) evidentiary issues; (4) motion for acquittal; and (5) special verdict form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 555-65. Roger raised five additional trial issues: (1) jury sequestration; (2) jury instructions; (3) request for mistrial; (4) prosecutorial misconduct; and (5) visitation of the crime scene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 565-69. In addition, Roger raised three sentencing issues: (1) objective standards and prosecutorial discretion; (2) independent review; and (3) aggravating factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 569-71. Roger also raised issues related to the following statutory mitigation factors: (1) capacity to appreciate wrongfulness of conduct or conform conduct to requirements of the law, (2) relatively minor participation; (3) age; (4) duress; and (5) no reasonable foreseeability that his conduct would create a grave risk of death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 573-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Arizona Supreme Court also addressed the following nonstatutory mitigation factors that Roger raised during trial: (6) dysfunctional childhood and family relations; (7) medical treatment; (8) remorse; (9) drug and alcohol use; and (10) mental health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 577-78. For the first time on direct appeal Roger urged as mitigation factors: (11) education; (12) residual or lingering doubt; (13) felony murder instruction; and (14) cooperation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 578.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Jury Selection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The original master jury list used was composed of a one-and-a-half-year-old driver's license list in violation of Arizona law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 555. Just days before trial was scheduled to begin, the trial court\n   ordered that a new jury list be created using both the old driver's license list and a list of registered voters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . The jury commissioner advised the trial court that the new list would generate adequate potential jurors by the date of trial, even though the deadline to respond was beyond the date trial was scheduled to begin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Robert and Roger argued that (1) the truncated time to respond to the jury questionnaire resulted in fewer potential jurors from more remote portions of the county; and (2) the one-and-a-half-year-old driver's license list resulted in fewer young prospective jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Robert and Roger contended that these infirmities denied them a jury of their peers because they hailed from a small, rural area in Alabama and were young at the time of trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 555-56. The Arizona Supreme Court concluded that Robert and Roger failed to establish the lack of a fair and impartial jury or prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The brothers failed to show that they were denied the right to have jurors selected from a fair cross-section of the community, or systematic exclusion of any discrete segment of the community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 556. The court noted that \"failure to follow statutory procedures is harmless, absent some separate showing of prejudice or discrimination ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The brothers also contended that the jury commissioner's use of standardless exclusions violated their constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . However, the Arizona Supreme Court determined that the jury commissioner, within her discretion, excused and notified potential jurors in accordance with state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 557. The court concluded that the brothers were not denied their right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community, because the criteria used were neutral and did not \"constitute systematic exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Robert and Roger asserted a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   violation when the prosecution used peremptory challenges to dismiss the only two Hispanic potential jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 557-58.

Roger asserted that he had a genuine and irreconcilable conflict with his trial counsel and the trial court's refusal to appoint new trial counsel was an abuse of discretion that effectively denied Roger's right to counsel. Roger also advanced ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) claims alleging: (1) trial counsel's sleeping during substantial portions of the trial; (2) trial counsel's failure to present the testimony of Jack Potts, M.D. at the mitigation hearing; (3) trial counsel's failure to obtain neurological or neuropsychological evaluations of Roger prior to sentencing; (4) trial\n   counsel's failure to call an exculpatory witness; (5) trial counsel's ignorance of rehabilitation as a mitigating factor; (6) trial counsel's failure to properly pursue a discovery violation by the prosecution; (7) trial counsel's failure to properly discredit the detective who provided footprint testimony; and (8) trial counsel's calling of witnesses who were prejudicial to the defense. Roger's remaining claims challenged the trial court's construction of nonstatutory mitigating evidence and the constitutionality of Arizona's death penalty system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Following a hearing pursuant to Rule 32 of the Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure, the PCR court set an evidentiary hearing for the claims asserting ineffective assistance of counsel for sleeping and for failing to obtain a neurological or neuropsychological examination.

The district court referenced the two types of prejudice resulting from pretrial publicity-presumed prejudice and actual prejudice. Because Roger did not argue actual prejudice, the district court focused on presumed prejudice, albeit noting that the Arizona Supreme Court's decision rejecting actual prejudice was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. The district court acknowledged that presumed prejudice is established when pretrial publicity utterly corrupts the trial atmosphere or incites a public passion that makes a fair trial unlikely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   While the district court recognized that this case garnered significant media attention, it determined that the nature of the press coverage was not unduly pervasive or inflammatory. Rather, the media reports were factual recitations of the crime and the ensuing criminal proceedings. The district court therefore concluded that the Arizona Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in rejecting Roger's claim of presumed prejudice, and that the state court's decision was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Claim 2-\n   <em>\n    Jury Sequestration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The district court noted that because there is no constitutional right to jury sequestration, to obtain habeas relief, Roger was required to show that he was prejudiced by the failure to sequester the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The occurrences referenced by Roger to support his claim of prejudice included the security measures in effect during trial, negative comments made by police officers outside the courtroom, a conversation involving the prosecutor that may have been overheard by two jurors, and the attendance at trial of a juror's spouse. The district court relied on the evidence presented to the state trial court that no jurors were exposed to the officers' comments, that the jurors were admonished to disregard any comments by the prosecutor during the\n   break, and that the juror and his spouse did not discuss the case. Because the state court's determination that Roger failed to establish prejudice withstood AEDPA review, the district court denied habeas relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Claim 3-\n   <em>\n    Severance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The state court's conclusion that Roger failed to establish prejudice from the joint trial, the district court held, was not based on an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law or an unreasonable determination of the facts. There was no indication that the defenses were antagonistic or mutually exclusive. Neither brother testified and no inculpatory statements were introduced. The nature and effect of the overwhelming evidence, which was admissible against both brothers, would not have changed if the trial were severed. The district court thus concluded that this claim was without merit, and denied relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Claim 4-\n   <em>\n    Jury Selection Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The district court rejected this claim because Roger failed to demonstrate that young people or persons living in rural areas are distinctive groups as is required to establish underrepresentation or exclusion of a cognizable group from the jury selection process. The Arizona Supreme Court had rejected this claim on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Duren v. Missouri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330305\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/357/\">\n    439 U.S. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330305\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/357/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330305\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/357/\">\n    58 L.Ed.2d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). Because Roger could not show that either\n   <em>\n    Duren\n   </em>\n   or any other clearly established Supreme Court authority recognized young people or people living in rural areas as distinctive groups for fair-cross section purposes, the district court concluded that the state court had not unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Claim 5-\n   <em>\n    Fair Cross-Section/Equal Protection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The district court determined that, as with Claim 4, the Arizona Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply United States Supreme Court precedent by concluding that Roger failed to establish that a distinctive group was improperly excluded from the jury pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Claim 6-Batson\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The state court's determination that the prosecutor's reasons for striking each of the challenged jurors were race-neutral, the district court concluded, was valid under AEDPA. One juror was excused due to the state's criminal investigation of her relatives and the other juror was excused because the prosecutor knew the juror socially and was concerned that he might be too willing to agree to avoid discord. The district court determined that the Arizona Supreme Court neither unreasonably applied\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   nor based its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Claim 7-\n   <em>\n    Revisiting the Crime Scene\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The district court determined that Roger did not establish prejudice due to the trial court's denial of his request to revisit the crime scene more than a year after the crime was committed and after the crime scene had been cleaned. The district court concluded that Roger failed to show that the evidence sought was material or that the verdict would have been different, particularly in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. The district court denied relief on this claim, affirming the state court's determination under AEDPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Claim 10-\n   <em>\n    Hybrid Representation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The district court concluded that the Arizona Supreme Court's decision denying Roger's hybrid representation claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. Roger did not assert that the state court's ruling violated his constitutional rights in any particular fashion. Additionally, the district court observed that Roger failed to cite any clearly established law supporting his claim of entitlement to hybrid representation. The district court denied relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Claim 11-\n   <em>\n    Gruesome Photographs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The district court found that Roger was not prejudiced by the photographs of the victims and of the crime scene that were admitted into evidence. The court reasoned that even if the pictures were improperly admitted, the error was not prejudicial and did not rise to the level of a due process violation because the evidence against Roger was overwhelming. The district court denied relief, concluding that the state court's determination was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Claim 12-\n   <em>\n    Prosecutorial Misconduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The district court determined that a detective's joking about the FBI while testifying, when viewed in the context of the entire proceedings, \"was innocuous and could have had no effect on the fairness of the trial,\" particularly since the jury was instructed to disregard the offending comments. The district court also determined that the prosecutor's statement during closing argument tying the .25 caliber shell found at the crime scene to Roger was a permissible inference that the prosecutor was allowed to draw based on the evidence. Regarding the prosecutor's reference to the brothers as the \"boys from Alabama\" during closing argument, the district court determined that the \"prosecutor's use of this rhetorical device did not carry the connotations [Roger] ascribe[d] to it and did not deprive him of a fair trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Finally, the district court determined that the comments made by the prosecution \"that the defendants experienced a 'sick excitement' and 'some sick crazy high' \" as they committed the crimes did not result in a due process violation. The trial court neutralized any inappropriateness by instructing the jury not to be influenced by passion or prejudice, and that statements of counsel are not evidence. The district court denied relief because it determined that the Arizona Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law holding that inappropriate remarks must infect the trial with unfairness to warrant reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Claim 13-\n   <em>\n    Reference to In-Custody Status\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Roger objected and moved for a mistrial after reference was made to blood being drawn from Roger by a \"nurse in jail.\" Another reference was made to the fact that Roger's clothing was taken while he was in custody. The trial court sustained the objection to the testimony regarding blood being drawn and struck the answer. Roger's motion for a mistrial was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The district court agreed with the state court that these isolated references to Roger's in-custody status did not warrant a mistrial. The district court concluded that relief was not warranted under\n   <em>\n    Estelle v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179579\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/501/\">\n    425 U.S. 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179579\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/501/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179579\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/501/\">\n    48 L.Ed.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976), and Roger cited no Supreme Court case supporting the proposition that the mere mention of the fact that a defendant is in custody constitutes a due process violation. Accordingly, the district court denied relief on this claim under AEDPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Claim 14-\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Roger challenged the sufficiency of evidence supporting his armed robbery and felony murder convictions. The district court found that the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law,\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/\">\n    443 U.S. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/\">\n    61 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), in concluding that a rational factfinder could determine from the evidence that Roger committed armed robbery and that the deaths of the victims occurred during the course of or in furtherance of the armed robbery. Nor was the state court's conclusion an unreasonable determination of the facts, given the use of several weapons, evidence of a struggle, and the fact that property was taken. The district court, therefore, denied relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Claim 15-\n   <em>\n    Jury Instruction Addressing the State's Failure to Preserve Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Roger alleged that the trial court violated his rights by failing to give a jury instruction regarding the state's failure to preserve evidence. The district court opined that Roger had failed to establish that the officers who conducted the investigation acted in bad faith with respect to gathering, preserving, and analyzing the evidence. The witnesses for the state all gave credible explanations for the methods used to gather and preserve evidence, showing at most negligence on the part of investigators. More importantly, Roger failed to establish that the exculpatory nature of any unpreserved evidence was apparent before it was destroyed, or that the evidence was material.

Only Roger testified that he actually observed his lawyer sleeping, and multiple other witnesses testified that they did not see the lawyer asleep and that he was active and zealously involved in Roger's defense.

The district court determined that even if Roger's counsel was ineffective in failing to present that same witness, the outcome of the trial would have been the same. The proposed exculpatory testimony that the victim was seen with three other men on the night of the murder would not have overcome the insurmountable inculpatory evidence.

An independent review of the record reveals that Roger presented a number of newspaper articles to the state court. The bulk of the pretrial articles were published months prior to trial. And it is important to note that not all of these articles are from Mohave County, or are even about Roger. Some of the articles, particularly the editorials, were about the death penalty in general. It appears that this is because, around the time of Roger's trial, Arizona was preparing to execute a man for the first time since 1963. This situation created interest, leading people to question whether the death penalty should be supported by society in general. In fact, some of the editorials actually questioned whether the death penalty is appropriate. One editorial stated that killers should be put six feet under, but the statement was a general one, not directed toward Roger, neither assuming his guilt, nor calling for his punishment. Only two editorials actually referenced Roger. One referred to \"the Murray brothers\" being represented by Frank Dickey. The editorial continued by criticizing Mr. Dickey's personal views concerning the death penalty. The other was a letter to the editor praising the judicial system for denying the defense motion to suppress evidence obtained after a license plate check by an Arizona DPS officer resulted in the Murrays' apprehension. The letter was anything but inflammatory toward Roger, again not even referring to him by name, but as one of the Murray brothers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   The vast majority of the articles submitted by Roger reported only facts, relaying information regarding what happened at trial on particular days. One article, that ran long before trial, mentioned that the victims were shot \"execution style\" and that an elderly woman had also been attacked by the brothers in Alabama. The problem with relying on this article is that it ran in an Alabama newspaper, thousands of miles from the trial venue. An article describing the brothers as suspects in a crime spree did run in the Kingman, Arizona, newspaper over a year before the trial. The article detailed allegations of a robbery and assault against an elderly woman in Alabama. Finally, as mentioned by Roger, a newspaper ran an article about the venue hearing, including a picture of the brothers being escorted to the jail and a description of armed officers \"perched on rooftops\" overlooking them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Roger also proffered evidence of radio publicity. David Hawkins, the news and sports director for various local radio stations, testified that the radio stations' transmission areas covered the bulk of the residents in Mohave County. Mr. Hawkins brought to court copies of the vast majority of the stories that had been broadcast on the radio. He testified that the community was \"upset with what happened to the victims in this case, and they are curious about the outcome of this particular-not this particular proceeding, but the whole of this case.\" Mr. Hawkins further testified\n   that he had heard some expressed opinions that the defendants were guilty, although he had only spoken to a \"couple dozen\" members of the community-mostly people in legal circles, reporters and social acquaintances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   Of the fifty-seven stories Mr. Hawkins brought to court, some mentioned that the brothers were connected to a robbery/assault in Alabama, that they might be linked to murders in California and New Mexico, and that the murders were committed \"execution style.\" Overall, however, the radio news reports were brief and factual in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Finally, John Freeman, a defense investigator, testified that he had spoken to a number of people about the case who thought the brothers were guilty and should \"get a quick trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   We conclude that the Arizona Supreme Court's determination that prejudice could not be presumed was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent, and while it does not impact our AEDPA inquiry, we note that the ruling was consistent with\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   The publicity surrounding Roger's trial fell far short of the \"utterly corrupted\" trial environment that existed in\n   <em>\n    Rideau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Sheppard\n   </em>\n   , the three cases the Supreme Court described in\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   as establishing the threshold for presumed prejudice due to pretrial publicity.\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n    130 S.Ct. at 2913-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   , we emphasized comments on the evidence from law enforcement officials, derogatory descriptions of the defendants, remarks from potential defense attorneys seeking to avoid appointment, and editorials expressing the appropriateness of the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1526755\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/778/1487/\">\n    778 F.2d at 1539-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   By contrast, news coverage of the crimes committed by the Murray brothers was almost invariably fact-based. There was no inflammatory barrage of information that would be inadmissible at trial. Rather, the news reports focused on relaying mainly evidence presented at trial. These news reports do not come anywhere close to the kind of \"vivid, unforgettable\" and \"blatantly prejudicial\" atmosphere that occurred in\n   <em>\n    Rideau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Sheppard\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n    130 S.Ct. at 2916-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Roger seeks to avoid this conclusion by arguing that the legal standard for prejudice is somehow lower in capital cases, contending that there is a \"heightened obligation to be particularly serious to the need for change of venue for capital cases.\" But Supreme Court precedent provides no support for this proposition. In\n   <em>\n    Dobbert\n   </em>\n   , to illustrate, the Court expressly applied\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   in upholding the petitioner's death sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dobbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178615\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/282/#p303\">\n    432 U.S. at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178615\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/282/#p303\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has not since departed from that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Roger also notes that\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   sets forth a \"totality of the circumstances\" test for whether media coverage has \"utterly corrupted\" the trial, and that the Arizona Supreme Court therefore erred in holding that Roger fell short of the standard because he \"failed to show\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   pretrial publicity was so outrageous.\" That is, Roger believes that he was subjected to too high a bar, in that he should not have been required to cite specific instances of outrageous publicity. But the Arizona Supreme Court cited and considered the evidence that Roger advanced, and simply found that because none of the evidence was individually problematic, it would be impossible to conclude that the totality of circumstances had \"utterly corrupted\" the trial as described in\n   <em>\n    Murphy.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1486505\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/184/9/\">\n    906 P.2d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That potential juror stated: \"Being people were arrested, I automatically thought guilty.\" That same juror indicated that it would be difficult for her to overcome her opinion of guilt based upon the arrest of an individual. That juror was excused by the trial judge, and only two other potential jurors mentioned that they had opinions about the circumstances of the crime. The one potential juror's opinion concerned the horrible nature of the crime, not the guilt or innocence of Roger, while the other potential juror's opinion was regarding how a crime like this could happen, not the guilt or innocence of Roger. Both indicated that they could set aside their opinions and be fair and impartial. The record indicates that no other potential juror had extensive knowledge of the case; indeed, some even stated that they had never heard of the case. We therefore conclude that the Arizona Supreme Court's determination that Roger did not establish either presumed or actual prejudice was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

According to Roger, this purposeful exclusion violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment (the Fair Cross-Section Doctrine) and the Equal Protection Clause of the\n   Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   On direct appeal, Roger argued that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments had been violated because the jury list was composed of an out-of-date driver's license list and did not include voter registration lists. Moreover, Roger asserted that even after the jury list was corrected, because the deadline for returning jury questionnaires was after the date the jury would be picked, potential jurors from rural areas were likely to be underrepresented. Finally, Roger argued that because the state notified jurors to present themselves for service by telephone, its procedures systematically excluded individuals who could not afford telephones. Roger contended that these failures resulted in the exclusion of young people, poor people, and those hailing from rural areas, thereby depriving the brothers of a jury of their peers who were most likely to \"understand\" them, since the brothers were young, poor, and from rural Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   The Arizona Supreme Court thoroughly dealt with the issues raised by Roger on direct appeal, holding that under\n   <em>\n    Duren\n   </em>\n   and relevant precedent of its own, Roger failed to show that young, poor, or rural people were a \"distinctive\" group for fair cross-section purposes.\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1486505\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/184/9/\">\n    906 P.2d at 556-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To the extent Roger advances a claim of error in rejecting this argument, the claim is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   As for the Sixth Amendment claim, Roger has failed to show any systematic exclusion of a distinct group. In fact, Roger has not shown that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   Christians were excluded. Moreover, the jury commissioner testified that members of specific religious denominations are excluded\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if they request exclusion based on their particular religious beliefs. This practice does not constitute systematic exclusion. Likewise, Roger's equal protection claim fails because the jury commissioner did not disclose that any specific religious denomination, or Christians, are singled out for disparate treatment. The evidence only supports the conclusion that individuals are excluded if exclusion is specifically requested due to religious beliefs. By no stretch of the imagination does this meager evidence satisfy the required showings of systematic exclusion and disparate treatment. Thus, even if Roger's claim were not procedurally defaulted, we would conclude that the Arizona Supreme Court's decision denying Roger's fair cross-section/equal protection claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Roger's trial counsel explained to the court that there was an irreconcilable difference of opinion regarding the strategy for the penalty phase proceedings. The trial court ultimately granted Roger's motion to represent himself and allowed an attorney from the public defender's office to remain as advisory counsel. One week later, Roger filed a motion requesting appointed counsel. Counsel from the public defender's office informed the trial court that an ethical conflict remained due to the office's representation of Roger and another client with an adverse interest who was to testify in response to a prospective witness for Robert's case. Counsel also reminded the court about the conflict between counsel and Roger regarding strategy for the penalty phase. Counsel suggested to the court that another attorney represent Roger. The court reviewed the suggestion and reappointed counsel from the public defender's office, with Roger agreeing. The conflict presented to the trial court by Roger concerned strategy for the penalty phase. This issue implicates attorney strategy rather than irreconcilable conflict.

After a two-day hearing including witness testimony, the PCR court concluded that Roger's counsel did not actually sleep during the trial. Robert's trial counsel testified that Roger's trial counsel had a reputation for \"dozing off\" in court. She stated that she personally observed Roger's counsel \"in a posture that look[ed] like he's asleep.\" However, she admitted that she was not sure at times whether he was dozing or just listening with his eyes closed. Robert's counsel did not contemporaneously inform the trial court of her observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   A former juror testified that she vaguely remembered Roger's lawyer nodding off during the trial. During cross-examination, she conceded that Roger's counsel did not close his eyes for long periods of time, and that she would have informed a bailiff if Roger's counsel had been asleep for significant portions of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Roger's appellate counsel testified that Roger specifically told her that his trial counsel appeared to doze during trial. She also mentioned that she did not raise the\n   issue of Roger's trial counsel sleeping, because it was not part of the record on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   Roger's trial counsel testified that he remembered Roger complaining about him sleeping during jail visits, but not during trial. He did not remember sleeping during the trial. The PCR court directly questioned Roger's trial counsel, asking explicitly whether he slept during the trial. In reply, Roger's counsel stated: \"Your Honor, quite frankly, I can't say. I wouldn't be the one to really know that. I don't think I did, but there is a possibility I did. But it would have been basically just a few seconds more than anything else. A cat nap type thing.\" He did not admit to sleeping. The PCR court then recalled on the record that Roger's trial counsel appeared generally to be \"fired up\" during the cases he had tried before the judge. Trial counsel agreed that he indeed was typically \"fired up\" for his cases and that he had \"tried to give [Roger's trial] more because of the importance of it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Roger testified that he observed his trial counsel asleep first at the jail and then almost daily during trial. During the testimony of Detective Lent, the footprint expert, Roger observed his trial counsel asleep for four to five minutes. Roger also observed his trial counsel sleeping during the medical examiner's testimony. Roger remembered his trial counsel sleeping through other witnesses as well. Roger recalled that he informed his other trial counsel and his appellate counsel about his observations. Roger did not inform the trial court about his observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   During cross-examination, the state reviewed the trial transcript with Roger, specifically emphasizing witness testimony where Roger had testified that his counsel was asleep. The state consistently established that Roger's trial counsel was engaged during the witness testimony that Roger previously associated with his counsel's sleeping. Roger admitted during cross-examination that he did not specify in his affidavit precisely when his trial counsel was sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   The prosecutor testified that Roger's trial counsel appeared engaged and active during trial. The prosecutor observed Roger's trial counsel listening with his eyes closed. According to the prosecutor, Roger's trial counsel had a habit of closing his eyes when he was thinking, and he would nod occasionally, but when a response was required he would seamlessly open his eyes and respond appropriately, appearing to be completely engaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   Neither the bailiff nor the investigator remembered Roger's trial counsel sleeping during the trial. The same was true for co-counsel. Co-counsel did not observe Roger kicking his trial counsel or trial counsel falling asleep during trial. Neither did co-counsel recall Roger speaking to him about trial counsel falling asleep during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   After oral argument and after reviewing briefs from both counsel, the PCR court entered a minute order denying relief. The PCR court acknowledged that Robert's trial counsel and a former juror testified to observing Roger's trial counsel sleeping during portions of the trial. However, the PCR court noted that other witnesses and the trial transcript undermined this testimony. The PCR court found that the trial transcript reflected that Roger's trial counsel was \"actively engaged in the trial.\" The PCR court credited the testimony of trial counsel that he did not recall sleeping during the trial. In addition, the PCR court found the testimony of the prosecutor, the investigator, and the bailiff more credible. Each of these three witnesses denied ever seeing Roger's trial counsel asleep during the trial. The PCR court was also persuaded by co-counsel's testimony\n   that Roger never complained to co-counsel about trial counsel sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   We cannot conclude that the PCR court's rejection of Roger's claim was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). Indeed, the record of the trial proceedings confirms the reasonableness of the PCR court's finding that Roger's counsel was not asleep during the trial. Most telling was the state's demonstration from the transcripts that counsel was actively questioning witnesses and objecting to testimony at times when Roger accused counsel of being asleep.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hibbler v. Benedetti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519301\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1140/#p1148\">\n    693 F.3d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1148-50 (9th Cir. 2012) (concluding, after reviewing the evidence presented in state court, that the state court's determination was not unreasonable). Because Roger's\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim hinges on the fact that his counsel slept through substantial portions of trial, which the record does not support, we conclude that the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established Supreme Court precedent. We affirm the district court's denial of relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   The Arizona Supreme Court's rejection of Roger's claim that he was denied a full and fair hearing also was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent.

But the judge is not thereby recusable for bias or prejudice, since his knowledge and the opinion it produced were properly and necessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings, and are indeed sometimes (as in a bench trial) necessary to completion of the judge's task. As Judge Jerome Frank pithily put it: \"Impartiality is not gullibility. Disinterestedness does not mean child-like innocence. If the judge did not form judgments of the actors in those court-house dramas called trials, he could never render decisions.\" Also not subject to deprecatory characterization as \"bias\" or \"prejudice\" are opinions held by judges as a result of what they learned in earlier proceedings.

The distinction is plain. As a fact witness, the judge would be seeking to persuade the finder of fact to a certain view of the evidence. As the presiding jurist, the judge is the factfinder, with absolutely no incentive to shade the facts one way or the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Evid. 605 (providing that the presiding judge may not testify as a witness in the trial over which he presides);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

No similar conundrum exists when the trial judge presides over post-conviction proceedings. In the post-conviction proceedings, the judge functions as a reviewer of the trial proceedings rather than as a chronicler of the facts. As the Supreme Court has explained, the trial judge's unique knowledge of the trial court proceedings renders him \"ideally situated\" to review the trial court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Landrigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556121\" index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/465/#p476\">\n    550 U.S. at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556121\" index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/465/#p476\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Roger's due process rights were honored in full. Serving as an adjudicator rather than as a witness, the PCR court determined that Roger's claim lacked merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   In this case, the only evidence that Roger puts forward is that the judge stated: \"I guess I have to tell you I remember some things about this trial very well ... and I-I never saw [Roger's trial counsel] asleep.\" Roger relies upon this statement to demonstrate that the trial judge \"was a key and biased witness who did not testify but ruled on the motions while his own observations were not subject to cross-examination.\" It is important to consider the trial judge's full comments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-348\">\n   Well, I guess-I guess I have to tell you I remember some things about this trial very well. And one was that [Roger's trial counsel] was very aggressive, very emphatic and-but of course you know-and I-I never saw him asleep. But, you know, I guess I'll let you have an opportunity to show me that he was sleeping during substantial portions of the trial because we have the Affidavits that say he was. But I have to tell you, I'm skeptical about that because I remember how aggressive he was-aggressively he argued when we were off the record, and even when we were on the record, the objections in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-349\">\n   So, I guess I'll set that-that one I think probably should be set for an evidentiary hearing, because you know, it's-it's certainly not something that was on the record and certainly not something that I noticed. So number four we'll set for evidentiary hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   Read in the context of the judge's full statement, Roger's claim is unfounded. The judge stated that his recollection was that Roger's trial counsel was very aggressive and involved and that he had no memory of Roger's trial counsel sleeping. Rather than merely denying the claim based upon his own recollection, however, the judge elected to hold an evidentiary hearing because \"we have the Affidavits that he was [sleeping].\" This situation is no different from a situation where a judge retains unexpressed recollections of trial matters and presides over an ensuing evidentiary hearing. In that vein, the judge's articulated skepticism does not provide a basis for Roger's claim of judicial bias because the judge's \"knowledge and the opinion it produced were properly and necessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings...\"\n   <em>\n    Liteky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p551\">\n    510 U.S. at 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p551\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, because we review Roger's claim under \u00a7 2254(d) rather than\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , Supreme Court precedent bars him from receiving an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinholster\n   </em>\n   , 131 S.Ct. at 1398 (directing that habeas claims under AEDPA be resolved on the record before the state court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   <strong>\n    J.

Roger complains that despite the discovery of this critical witness, his trial counsel failed to interview the witness, depose him, call him to testify, or request a continuance. Roger asserts that his trial counsel had \"no strategic reason for not calling [the witness] directly.\" Failure to call this witness, Roger argues, resulted in the absence of evidence tending to implicate others and suggesting that he was not present at the scene of the crime.

Although her investigator discovered that Anthony was in a Veterans Administration treatment center in California, the investigator was never able to make contact with Anthony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   The PCR court found that Robert's trial counsel had investigated the exculpatory witness to the best of her ability. The PCR judge stated: \"We don't have any proof that the witness would have said what's in\n   the report.

And, even if he had been located just prior to trial, counsel could not have \"gotten him [to court] as a witness.\" This evidence before the state court \"was sufficient to resolve the factual question\" whether Roger's counsel performed deficiently, and thus the PCR court's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue did not \"render its fact-finding process unreasonable,\"\n   <em>\n    Hibbler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519301\" index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1140/#p1148\">\n    693 F.3d at 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Roger did not demonstrate that his trial counsel had performed deficiently, the PCR court's rejection of Roger's claim was not contrary to established Supreme Court precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , 466 U.S. at 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"360\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   Before us, Roger argues that the trial judge erred by not holding a separate evidentiary hearing before resolving his identical claim. However, Roger failed to adduce any evidence raising a question regarding the actual availability of the witness, or regarding a lack of diligence by his counsel in attempting to locate the witness. Roger merely stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-359\">\n   [My] position is that any reasonably effective criminal defense lawyer would have seen that he was a crucial witness at trial, would have located him, would have found him, would have subpoenaed him, would have had him in court and would have had him testify. [Trial counsel] didn't do any of those things, period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   Absolutely no evidence was presented to the PCR court to substantiate Roger's assertions. Only speculation was offered. Specifically, Roger asked for funds so he could:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-361\">\n   find Mr. Anthony nine years after the fact so [he could] present Mr. Anthony to [the PCR court] so that [the PCR court could] live and in color hear Mr. Anthony, hear his testimony, evaluate his credibility, and then make a determination whether if called by an effective counsel Mr. Anthony could have made a difference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   After considering Roger's speculative proffer, the PCR judge had no reason to hold another evidentiary hearing, especially in view of the PCR judge's recognition that \"there's absolutely no proof at all that [Anthony] was available for the trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   Critical to the PCR judge's decision was the fact that \"even if [Roger's counsel] was incompetent, it would not have made a difference as far as the verdict was concerned. So it would not have made a difference. ...\" Thus, it fairly appears that the judge found the evidence of guilt so overwhelming that any testimony Anthony could have given would not have resulted in a different verdict. In other words, Roger could not establish\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice. Ultimately, after evaluating the evidence presented during Robert's evidentiary hearing and Roger's failure to proffer any further relevant evidence, the PCR court summarily denied Roger's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   The district court denied Roger's request for an evidentiary hearing, and agreed with the factual findings made by the state court. The district court correctly denied a federal evidentiary hearing because federal habeas review is limited to the record before the state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinholster\n   </em>\n   , 131 S.Ct. at 1398-1400. Viewing that record, the district court explained that to grant habeas relief, the reviewer would have to find that the jury would have believed the defense's theory that Robert and Roger burglarized the victims' store and home after finding the victims already dead. In support of this theory, Roger relied on Anthony's statement regarding the three men he observed at the store who did not resemble Robert and Roger and who drove a different car; a statement from Angela Anthony that she heard a man threaten one of the victims the day prior to the murders; and proffered testimony from an unidentified witness that Robert and Roger were elsewhere when the three men were spotted at the store. Roger relies most heavily on the statement of John Anthony as the basis for his IAC claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   The state court determined that Roger's counsel was not ineffective in this respect, and the state court's determination was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of,\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   or other Supreme Court precedent.

We also agree with the district court that the overwhelming evidence of guilt forecloses any credible argument that the outcome of the trial would have been affected by the proffered exculpatory evidence. To acquit Robert and Roger, the jury would have had to believe that the brothers found the victims already dead and got the victims blood on their clothes while burglarizing the store and the residence. This scenario, by the way, was totally inconsistent with the facts that the male victim's wallet containing $800 was left undisturbed in his pants pocket, and that $172 was found on a chair. The implausibility of the proffered exculpatory version of events and the strength of the inculpatory evidence both bolster the state court's finding under the doubly deferential AEDPA review applicable to IAC claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   , 131 S.Ct. at 787-88.

SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   We agree with the district court's conclusion that Roger was not entitled to habeas relief on any of the certified claims because the state court's rejection of these claims was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of AEDPA. Even though this sensational, small-town murder understandably generated substantial media coverage, the state court's decision that the coverage was not constitutionally prejudicial was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. Similarly, the state court's rejection of Roger's challenge to the jury venire was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. Acceptance of the prosecutor's race-neutral explanations for the exercise of his peremptory challenges was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Batson.\n   </em>\n   Because the Supreme Court has eschewed claims predicated on the unavailability of immaterial evidence, the state court's denial of Roger's belated request to inspect a sanitized crime scene was also not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   The evidence in the record did not support Roger's request for jury instructions on voluntary intoxication and second degree murder. The state court's denial of relief was consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   Any causal nexus error in the state court's consideration, at sentencing, of mitigation evidence relating to Roger's troubled childhood was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   The Arizona Supreme Court's decisions denying relief on the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , particularly in view of the double deference applicable to AEDPA claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
