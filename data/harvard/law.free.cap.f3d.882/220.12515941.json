S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 128-29 (2010). In \u00a7 941 of the act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   -11, Congress directed the defendant agencies (plus two other banking agencies\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) to prescribe regulations to require \"any securitizer\" of an asset-backed security to retain a portion of the credit risk for any asset that the securitizer \"transfers, sells, or conveys\" to a third party, specifically \"not less than 5 percent of the credit risk for any asset.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   -11(c)(1)(B)(i).

Instead of being a financial institution originating or acquiring assets and then securitizing them, a CLO manager meets with potential investors and agrees to the terms of its performance as well as the risk profiles and tranche structures the CLO will ultimately take. See Wells Fargo &amp; Company, Comment on Credit Risk Retention Proposed Rules 27 (July 28, 2011) (\"Wells Fargo Comment\"). The manager then directs a Special Purpose Vehicle (\"SPV\") (a corporation operating as the manager's agent-although the documents often define the manager as the SPV's agent, Argument Tr. 32-33) to issue notes in exchange for capital from the investors, the various notes reflecting the terms of the agreement and the kind and size of the investments. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\n   <em>\n    Report to the Congress on Risk Retention\n   </em>\n   22-23 (Oct. 2010) (\"Board Report\"). Only then does the SPV-using the investors' money and operating at the recommendation of the manager-purchase the assets to securitize them. Wells Fargo Comment 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The loans underlying CLOs are very large loans made to already highly leveraged companies, often in the retail or manufacturing sectors of the economy. Usually no single bank originates the entirety of a loan. Rather, multiple banks \"syndicate\" under a lead arranger, each holding only a portion of the loan. Syndicated loans are \"actively traded amongst financial institutions in a secondary market place,\" and purchased on these markets by a range of investors, including institutional investors, hedge fund managers, and, of course, CLO vehicles. Wells Fargo Comment 27. The number of syndicated loans in a CLO pool is typically small relative to other asset-backed securitizations. Ordinarily, a pool is made up of 100 to 250 loans, usually all made to moderate or large companies that generate a wealth of risk profile data for review by CLO managers and investors. See Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Comment to Joint Regulators on Credit Risk Retention Proposed Rules 67-68 (June 10, 2011); JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Comment to Joint Regulators on Credit Risk Retention Proposed Rules 58-59 (July 14, 2011). But CLO managers neither originate the loans nor hold them as assets at any point. Rather, like mutual fund or other asset managers, CLO managers only give directions to an SPV and receive compensation and management fees contingent on the performance of the asset pool over time. See American Securitization Forum, Comment to Joint Regulators on Credit Risk Retention Proposed Rules 133-34 (June 10, 2011); U.S. Treasury Department,\n   <em>\n    Report: A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities\n   </em>\n   102 (Oct. 2017) (\"Treasury Report\"); Board Report 22. The agencies do not question these characterizations of the CLO securitization model. See Appellees Br. 4-7; Board Report 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The agencies' interpretation seems to stretch the statute beyond the natural meaning of what Congress wrote; it turns\n   \"\n   <em>\n    retain\n   </em>\n   \" a credit risk into \"\n   <em>\n    obtain\n   </em>\n   \" a credit risk.

But the agencies assert some defenses, which we'll now explore, taking the key words in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Transfer\" ordinarily implies that a person with control over an asset via possession or ownership gives it or conveys it by sale to a transferee. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1727 (10th ed. 2014) (\"to pass or hand over from one to another, esp. to change over the possession or control of\"); 18\n   <em>\n    The Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   395 (2d ed. 1989) (\"To convey or take from one place, person, etc. to another\"; \"\n   <em>\n    Law.\n   </em>\n   To convey or make over (title, right, or property) by deed or legal process\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The agencies point to dictionaries they claim support the idea that a third party can be said to \"transfer\" something if it is somehow the\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   of a transfer between two other parties. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1832 (4th ed. 2000) (\"To convey or cause to pass from one place, person, or thing to another\"). We think the natural reading of \"cause\" in these definitions means nothing more than that the verb \"transfer\" means to\n   <em>\n    engage in the act\n   </em>\n   of making a \"transfer\" (as a noun).\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law\n   </em>\n   495 (2d ed. 2011) (defining the verb as \"to cause a transfer\" and the noun as \"a conveyance of a right, title, or interest in real or personal property from one person or entity to another\" or a \"passing of something from one to another\"). But such a meaning doesn't necessarily encompass a person's playing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   causal role in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   transfer. Moreover, the possible ambiguity and meaning of statutory language depend on \"the specific context in which [the term] is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p341\">\n    519 U.S. 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 341,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p341\">\n    117 S.Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p341\">\n    136 L.Ed.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). Here the specific context is \u00a7 941's imposition of a risk retention rule on entities that \"\n   <em>\n    sell\n   </em>\n   or transfer\" assets to the issuer, indicating that Congress had in mind the ordinary sense of a conveyance between two parties, whether the conveyor was acting for financial remuneration (\"sell\") or was merely shifting economic value between or among an entity and its subsidiaries or affiliates (\"transfer\").

The language does not seem to apply to a person or firm that causes an SPV, whose value belongs to the investors, to make an open-market\n   <em>\n    purchase\n   </em>\n   from wholly independent third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Besides seeming to reverse the apparent flow of the \"transfer,\" the agencies' disregard of context leads them to embrace a reading of \"transfer\" that would include any third party who exerts some causal influence over a transaction. It would thus sweep in brokers, lawyers, and non-CLO investment managers who, though they play a part in organizing securities and \"causing\" the transfer of securitized assets, are clearly not the initiators of securitizations that Congress intended to regulate. That the agencies' interpretation sweeps so far beyond any reasonable estimate\n   of the congressional purpose confirms our view that the interpretation is beyond the statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The agencies argue that \u00a7 941's qualification of \"transfer\" with the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" sufficiently broadens the term to cover CLO managers' activities. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   -11(a)(3)(B). But it would be odd for those adverbs to eradicate the ordinary boundaries around the word \"transfer.\" As the Supreme Court recently said in rejecting a government claim that a provision holding defendants liable for property \"obtained, directly or indirectly\" from certain crimes could make a defendant liable for property he never obtained at all, \"The adverbs 'directly' and 'indirectly' modify-but do not erase-the verb 'obtain.' \"\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/#p1633\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1633,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/#p1633\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Further, the immediate context of \"directly or indirectly\" suggests a meaning far narrower than the agencies' reading. Section 941(a)(3)(B) refers to one who organizes an asset-backed securities transaction \"by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuer.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   -11(a)(3)(B). Congress's use of \"through an affiliate\" as an example of \"directly or indirectly\" (indeed, perhaps the only example contemplated by Congress at all) suggests that the adverbs were meant to assure that, despite the often complicated array of affiliates, depositors and SPVs that financial institutions use to create and sell asset-backed securities, the credit retention rule would reach a transferor no matter how many intermediaries it used. But to be covered by clause B of \u00a7 941(a)(3), the party must actually be a transferor, relinquishing ownership or control of assets to an issuer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The meaning of \"retain\" in this context makes this point clear, as it lacks even the theoretical ambiguity that a person with no possessory interest could effect a \"transfer.\" One occasionally uses \"retain\" colloquially to mean \"acquiring something for the first time,\" as when one first gains legal counsel by \"retaining\" a lawyer. But the agencies conspicuously fail to offer a single real-world example of anyone ever using \"retain\" to encompass a process like the activity that the rule would require of CLO managers: going out into the marketplace and buying an asset they never before held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The agencies argue that \"retain\" doesn't presuppose any voluntary anterior possession. It is of course true that one can keep something that one acquires under duress. Thus, say the agencies, so long as the rule's \"requirement is continuing, and it requires 'retention' of risk on an ongoing basis,\" the rule fits a reasonable reading of Congress's text. Appellee's Br. 31 (citing\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1509 (\"To hold in possession or under control; to keep and not lose, part with, or dismiss.\") ). But it is an astonishing stretch of language to read a mandate to \"retain\" to apply to one who would never\n   <em>\n    hold\n   </em>\n   the item at all apart from the mandate, with\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   congressional text mandating the prior acquisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Indeed, the record indicates the potentially serious consequences of shifting the statute's meaning from \"retain\" to \"obtain.\" Recall that before the rule CLOs would cause SPVs to issue notes to investors and then use investor capital to purchase loans on the open market. Under the rule, CLO managers must now acquire investments that may not be suitable for them, necessitating significant amounts of capital that they may neither have nor have access to. Treasury Report 102. The agencies themselves identified a subset of managers operating between 2009 and 2013 with relatively poor access to capital, and concluded that \"it would be reasonable to estimate that the exit of [those managers\n   ] could impact current levels of capital formation by CLOs by 37 percent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C730\">\n    79 Fed.

The resulting recourse of borrowers and lenders to other devices would presumably somewhat neutralize the net effect on overall supply of capital to the leveraged loan market.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C730\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,730/2-3.

But the agencies make a special argument that requires a somewhat detailed response. If CLO managers are not covered by \u00a7 941, they contend, our interpretation \"would do violence to the statutory scheme\" and \"creat[e] a loophole that would allow securitizers of other types of transactions to structure around their risk retention obligation.\" Appellee's Br. 20.

Regardless of that, however, we think that the agencies overstate the supposed loophole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The argument pressed by the agencies in their final rulemaking asserts that if CLO managers are not covered by \u00a7 941, then the statute is open to \"easy evasion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C655\">\n    79 Fed.

Appellee's Br. 29. At worst, all other securitizations might conform themselves to the CLO structure and thus defeat Congress's purposes entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We understand the agencies' plight, as they must give force to a statute that links the organization and initiation of a securitization to the transference of ownership interests in the assets that are securitized. Occasionally cases may arise, such as this one, in which those \"organizing and initiating\" the securitization do not do so \"by transferring\" the securitized assets to the issuer, while those that\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   transfer the assets are not the entities who organize or initiate the securitization in any meaningful way. However, if that is a \"loophole,\" it is one that the statute itself creates, and not one that the agencies may close with an unreasonable distortion of the text's ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In any event, we do not find the supposed loophole as worrisome as the agencies do. First, the loophole is to a considerable extent a problem of the agencies' own making. To see why requires us to trace several definitions through the statutes and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Congress required the agencies to craft a risk retention rule for \"securitizers,\" defined as: (A) \"an issuer of an asset-backed security,\" or (B) \"a person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed securities transaction by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuer.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   -11(a)(3). Although the agencies commonly refer to the \"issuing entity\" of a security and define \"issuing entity\" as \"the trust or other entity created at the\n   direction of the sponsor that own or holds the pool of assets to be securitized, and in whose name the [securities] are issued,\" Credit Risk Retention: Proposed Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024%2C098\">\n    76 Fed.

In fact, the agencies define the \"issuer\" of clause B as the issuing entity, but in clause A they noted that in multiple other regulations \"the term 'issuer' when used with respect to an asset-backed security (\"ABS\") transaction is defined to mean the entity-the depositor-that deposits the assets that collateralize the ABS with the issuing entity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024%2C099\">\n    76 Fed. Reg. 24,099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   /1. Accordingly, the agencies do not interpret \"issuer\" in clause A to mean \"issuing entity,\" but rather to mean \"depositor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024%2C099\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The agencies in turn define \"depositor\" as either: (1) \"[t]he person that receives or purchases and transfers or sells the securitized assets to the issuing entity\"; (2) \"[t]he sponsor\" if the sponsor transfers assets directly to the issuing entity; or (3) the person that receives or purchases and transfers or sells the securitized assets to the issuing entity through a trust.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20244.2\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20246.2\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 246.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, the clause A \"issuer\" under the rule is not what an ordinary reader would think is an issuer but is rather the \"entity that transfers assets to the issuer.\" Indeed, the second definition of a \"depositor\"-\"the sponsor\"-makes this clear. A \"sponsor\" is \"a person who organizes and initiates a securitization transaction by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuing entity\"-almost exactly the language of clause B.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20246.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In sum, the agencies have interpreted \"issuer\" in clause A of Congress's definition of a \"securitizer\" to be the exact same thing as the substance of clause B-the entity transferring assets to an issuer. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   -11(a)(3). The agencies have thus dropped the actual issuing entity out of the statutory definition altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The LSTA does not challenge the agencies' definition of an \"issuer,\" so we need not wrestle with the question whether the agencies' interpretation mistakenly turns a statutory clause into mere surplusage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cf.\n   <em>\n    Duncan v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    533 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). The agencies contend that the disjunctive \"or\" in Congress's definition of a securitizer gives them discretion to elect which entity will retain the credit risk and that they have \"elect[ed] to impose the risk retention requirements on the sponsors of open market CLOs rather than on the issuing entities.\" Appellee's Br. 35. That may be so, but that choice does not justify the agencies' stretching the definition of a \"sponsor\" to cover those who do not, as required by clause B, have a relationship to the assets such that one can reasonably say that they \"transfer\" the assets and could be required to \"retain\" a portion of the assets' risk. The protest that no securitizer can then be found to retain the risk arises because the agencies have defined a whole class of securitizers-the issuing entities-out of Congress's statute. To be sure, bringing them back in might make no useful difference here; it may be that here the only serious candidate for \"issuer\" is the SPV and that it holds the assets for the life of the securitization for the benefit of the investors, who are the very parties Congress sought to protect. See Argument Tr. 26-29. But addressing the ramifications of this would take us into far deeper\n   waters than the briefs or rulemaking record explore, or than resolution of the case requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A second answer is that the agencies' feared hypothetical loophole is unlikely to materialize, even under their rather circuitous definitions. The agencies' concern is that banks or other financial institutions who actually organize securitizations will employ putatively third-party \"managers\" to sponsor securitizations without themselves transferring assets, thus creating \"a situation in which no party to a securitization can be found to be a 'securitizer' because the party that organizes the transaction and has the most influence over the quality of the securitized assets could avoid legally owning or possessing the assets.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C655\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. 77,655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   /1. The agencies raised two scenarios at argument: one where regulated entities might try to get \"bad assets\" off their balance sheets by appealing to third-party managers to offload them, and one where ABSs might trade on a market and get re-securitized into ever more risky yet opaque offerings. Argument Tr. 35-37. But in the first scenario, where the actual organizer is the institution that holds the assets and \"pre-approve[s]\" the selections of \"a third-party\" manager, then both the rule and the statute logically apply.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C655\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. 77,655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   /1. The bank or financial institution that is actually calling the shots is organizing the securitization \"\n   <em>\n    by transferring\n   </em>\n   \" its assets and can be required to\n   <em>\n    retain\n   </em>\n   credit risks that it is\n   <em>\n    already holding.\n   </em>\n   In fact, the agencies' first hypothetical has provided a textbook example of sponsoring a securitization by indirect transfer through agents and intermediaries, the type of indirect transfer that is absent in this case, where CLO managers act as independent contractors with investors rather than as agents of an originating financial institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the agencies' second scenario, they fear that re-securitized ABSs (the so-called \"CDO squared,\" or collateralized debt obligations made up of other collateralized debt obligations), which became one of the more toxic defaulters of the financial crisis, would escape regulation because they often take a structure similar to that of CLOs: trading on an open market, purchased by third parties on behalf of an SPV that re-securitizes the purchased securities. Argument Tr. 35-36. But this concern ignores that many if not most of the primary securitizations that produce ABSs traded on these markets are now subject to the agencies' risk retention rule and the improved underwriting standards the agencies expect to flow from it. Moreover, any CLO so constituted must, by definition, have acquired the ABSs in open-market purchases at the direction of the investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, to the extent other asset-backed securitizations were to truly take the form of open-market CLOs, it is highly doubtful that their falling outside the reasonable coverage of the statute need be a cause for concern. CLO managers are not direct or indirect agents of the originators, but rather negotiate their contracts with investors, usually with compensation based on performance. Open-market CLOs thus mitigate the problems Congress identified with the originate-to-distribute model: (1) The organizers' compensation dependency already gives them \"skin in the game.\" Cf. S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 128-29. (2) Because they purchase relatively small numbers of unsecuritized loans on the open market through arm's-length bargaining, the activities of CLO managers present a far weaker version of the opacity that Congress identified in other ABS markets. Cf.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C655\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And (3) both the superior incentives and relative transparency reduce the likelihood that such financing will generate anything like the decline in underwriting standards\n   that the more famous ABS market is thought to have brought about. Perhaps for these reasons, CLOs weathered the financial crises relatively well. In contrast to 435 ABS collateralized debt obligations that defaulted, no more than six CLOs defaulted during the crisis, and all six included features atypical for CLOs and were eventually cured. Joint Appendix 527, 875, 1132 (citing Moody's Report, \"Recent Performance of Market Value Collateralized Loan Obligations\" (May 5, 2010); S&amp;P, \"Cash Flow and Hybrid CDO Event of Default Notices Received as of Jan. 25, 2011\"; Jeremy Gluck, \"CLOs versus CDOs\" It's the 'L' That Matters,\" Moody's CLO Interest (July 2010) ). Indeed, Congress in its statutory scheme seems to be trying to achieve through regulation the incentives and transparency that the CLO market achieved through its business model. To the extent other securitizations seek to conform to this model, so much the better for the investors Congress seeks to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In any event, the agencies' policy concerns cannot compel us to redraft the statutory boundaries set by Congress. Our commentary on those concerns only reinforces the reasoning that the ordinary meaning of \u00a7 941 does not extend to CLO managers. See\n   <em>\n    K Mart Corp. v.
