The question before us is whether Margarito Rodriguez Tovar, a child of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) who was deemed by statute to be a minor child until the very day his father naturalized, still qualified as a minor on that day, or whether instead his father's naturalization transformed him on the spot from a minor into an adult. The government and the BIA have parsed individual provisions of the labyrinthine Immigration and Nationality Act to arrive at the latter position, with the effect that a parent's naturalization can cause a child to be deported forthwith and to wait for decades in a foreign land for an immigrant visa-a visa that he would have had in a short period of time if his parent had not become a citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We reject this reading because, considering the relevant statutes as a whole, it is clearly not the interpretation that Congress intended. Rather, we conclude that anyone who under the relevant statutes is considered a minor child of an LPR on the\n   date of the parent's naturalization (and who is the beneficiary of a valid petition for an immigrant visa based on that status) can obtain a visa as the minor child of a citizen following his parent's naturalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rodriguez Tovar was born in Mexico in 1983. He entered the United States in 2000, when he was seventeen years old. The next year his father-who was then an LPR-filed a petition for him to obtain an immigrant visa under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) -the F2A category for minor children of LPRs. The petition received a priority date of April 30, 2001, but was not approved until over four years later, in mid-2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 3, 2006, Rodriguez Tovar's father became a naturalized U.S. citizen. At that time Rodriguez Tovar was 23 in biological age, but after subtracting the four years during which his visa petition had been pending he was only 19 under the age-calculation formula in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1). Had his father not become a citizen, a visa would have been available to him in the F2A category on June 1, 2007-one year after his father's naturalization-when he was 20 under \u00a7 1153(h)(1). Alternatively, if Rodriguez Tovar were considered, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201151\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2), to be a minor at the time of his father's naturalization, a visa would have been immediately available for him as the minor child of a citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2008, Rodriguez Tovar filed an application with USCIS for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence. The application was denied and the government initiated removal proceedings. During the removal proceedings, Rodriguez Tovar renewed his application for adjustment of status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The IJ and the BIA rejected Rodriguez Tovar's application, relying on the BIA's published opinion in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Zamora-Molina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20606\">\n    25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B.I.A. 2011). They held that, because Rodriguez Tovar was over 21 years old in biological age on the date of his father's naturalization, his F2A petition immediately converted to an F1 petition and not to an immediate relative petition, even though he was classified by statute as under 21 years old for purposes of his F2A petition, pursuant to the age calculation formula set forth in \u00a7 1153(h)(1). They also held that there is no opt-out provision allowing F2A beneficiaries to remain in the F2A category after a parent's naturalization. At best, according to the IJ and the BIA, Rodriguez Tovar could choose to transfer from the F1 category to the F2B category. However, there was not a visa immediately available for Rodriguez Tovar in either the F1 or\n   F2B categories. So, according to the IJ and the BIA, either way he would not be eligible for adjustment of status, but would be subject to removal forthwith and a very lengthy period of waiting for a visa in a foreign land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Everyone agrees that if Rodriguez Tovar's father had remained an LPR instead of becoming a citizen, Rodriguez Tovar would have been eligible for a visa in the F2A category on June 1, 2007, at which point his age under the statute would have been 20. Similarly, had he been afforded his statutory age when his father became a citizen, he would have been eligible for a visa immediately. However, the government's position is that because his father decided to become a citizen when he did, Rodriguez Tovar was not eligible for either visa and may now be deported forthwith and must wait in the F1 line abroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The practical implications of the government's position are hard to overstate. We do not know exactly when Rodriguez Tovar will be eligible for an immigrant visa in the F1 category, because the government does not estimate when visas will become available for certain priority dates; rather, each year it determines what priority dates are now eligible for visas. However, as of January 1, 2018-more than ten years after Rodriguez Tovar would have been eligible for a visa had his father not naturalized-he still has not reached the front of the F1 line. In fact, during those ten-and-a-half years the availability date for people coming from Mexico through the F1 line has advanced just over five years (from January 1, 1991 to May 1, 1996).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rodriguez Tovar's priority date is just under five years past the current availability date, so if the current pace continues he will not be eligible for an F1 visa until December 2027, more than twenty years after he would have been eligible for an F2A visa but for his father's naturalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In fact, there is reason to believe that it may take even longer. The government represented at oral argument that \"hundreds of thousands\" of visa petitions were filed right around the same time as Rodriguez Tovar's petition due to a statutory sunset date for certain adjustment of status provisions. As the rate at which the availability date advances depends on the number of petitions filed in each of the intervening years, the wave of applications filed prior to April 30, 2001, will likely cause a significant further backlog, contributing to even longer delays in this already interminable process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In sum, the government's position is that because Rodriguez Tovar's father became a citizen, Rodriguez Tovar must now wait decades longer for a visa than if his father had remained an LPR. In the meantime the government seeks to deport him to Mexico, with any future return subject to unforeseeable modifications to the current immigration laws. As we explain in the remainder of this opinion, the correct interpretation of the statute does not lead to this absurd result, but rather to his entitlement to an immediately available visa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In order to determine if Rodriguez Tovar has an immediately available visa-rather than being deported and required to wait twenty years, or possibly even\n   more, before being eligible for a visa, simply because his father became a citizen-we must determine under which category his petition actually falls. The BIA found, and the government asserts, that Rodriguez Tovar falls under the F1 category, a category in which there is no currently available visa. We disagree, and instead conclude that Rodriguez Tovar's visa application must be treated as one for an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen, for which visas are always immediately available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We arrive at this conclusion by employing \" 'traditional tools of statutory construction' \" which demonstrate beyond any question \"that Congress had a clear intent on the question at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    The Wilderness Soc'y v.

If his \"age\" for purposes of that provision is 21 or over, then he is an adult child and must leave the country and wait in the decades-long F1 line. According to the BIA and the government, \"age\" means biological age, which would make Rodriguez Tovar twenty-three years old on the relevant date.

First, the history of the regulations and statutes governing automatic conversion of visa petitions upon a parent's naturalization demonstrates that at the time the CSPA was passed, both the Department of Justice and Congress understood that petitions for minor children of LPRs would convert to petitions for minor children of citizens while petitions for adult children of LPRs would convert to petitions for adult children of citizens. Second, the CSPA included an opt-out provision for F2B to F1 conversions but no opt-out provision for conversions away from F2A-a decision that makes sense only if F2A petitions always convert to immediate relative petitions upon the parent's naturalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Congress, however, included no such provision in the CSPA. In order to justify their interpretation of the statute, the government and the BIA are forced to characterize the failure to include such a provision as a Congressional oversight.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Zamora-Molina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20606\">\n    25 I. &amp; N.

Given a choice, we will presume that Congress acts competently and understands the implications of the legislation it passes. Its decision not to adopt an opt-out provision therefore supports our interpretation of the statute, on which F2A petitions always convert to immediate relative petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The government takes the position that Rodriguez Tovar could exercise the opt-out provision to transfer to the F2B category rather than the F1 category-he just may not remain in the F2A category.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Zamora-Molina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20606\">\n    25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 613-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This interpretation of the opt-out provision does not reduce the absurdity of the government's position in this case, because it would likely take even longer for Rodriguez Tovar to be eligible for an F2B visa than for an F1 visa. In addition, the government's interpretation is difficult to square with the text of the statute, which says that if a beneficiary opts out of automatic conversion, \"any determination with respect to the son or daughter's eligibility for admission as a family-sponsored immigrant shall be made as if such naturalization had not taken place.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(2). Had Rodriguez Tovar's father not naturalized, Rodriguez Tovar would be eligible for a visa in the F2A category, not the F2B category. An F2B visa is therefore not the but-for result that the statute contemplates. This problem with the government's interpretation further strengthens our conviction that Congress believed that F2A beneficiaries would never need to opt out, because they would always convert to the most advantageous category-immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Our interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201151\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2) makes sense within the context of the whole CSPA. Anyone who is treated as a minor child of a lawful permanent resident for purposes of an F2A petition is treated as a minor child of a citizen when the parent naturalizes, and no one is penalized just because his parent became a citizen. The government's interpretation leads to the absurd result that Rodriguez Tovar's father's naturalization causes the deportation of his son, who is then compelled to wait for decades in a foreign land before he can return-despite the fact that had his father simply remained an LPR, Rodriguez Tovar would have been eligible for a visa within a year.

However, immediate relative status is not a separate claim that can be waived. Rodriguez Tovar's sole claim is that he is eligible for adjustment of status. Resolving that claim requires us to determine into which category his visa application falls, and in so doing \"[w]e are not bound by a party's concession as to the meaning of the law.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
