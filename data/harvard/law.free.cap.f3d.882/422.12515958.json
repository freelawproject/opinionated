The question presented is whether a collection letter sent to collect a time-barred debt that makes a \"settlement offer\" to accept payment \"in settlement of\" the debt could violate the Act's general prohibition against \"any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e. We hold that it could.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Over ten years ago, Appellant Michelle Tatis incurred a debt of $1,289.86 to Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp. Appellee Allied Interstate, LLC-a debt collector-sent Tatis a letter dated May 18, 2015 that read as follows: \"[The creditor] is willing to accept payment in the amount of $128.99 in settlement of this debt. You can take advantage of this settlement offer if we receive payment of this amount or if you make another mutually acceptable payment arrangement within 40 days ....\" App. 37. At the time Allied sent its letter, the six-year New Jersey statute of limitations applicable to debt-collection actions had already run.\n   <em>\n    Tatis v.

The complaint alleged that Tatis interpreted the word \"settlement\" in the letter to mean that she had a \"legal obligation\" to pay the debt, and the least-sophisticated debtor would hold a similar belief. Compl. \u00b6 27, App. 32. She also claimed the letter was a \"false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with\" collecting the debt. Compl. \u00b6 37, App. 34. Specifically, Tatis alleged that Allied \"[f]alsely represent[ed] the legal status of the debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2)(A),\" made \"false threats to take action that cannot legally be taken in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e and 1692e(5),\" and used \"false representations and/or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect [the] debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10).\" Compl. \u00b6 38, App. 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Allied filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim, and the District Court granted the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tatis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205660431\">\n    2016 WL 5660431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.

As the Seventh Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    McMahon\n   </em>\n   , construing the Act to\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   a threat of legal action for any FDCPA violation interposes a mandate that is not found in its text.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120004\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/1010/\">\n    744 F.3d at 1020-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1692e prohibits three discrete categories of conduct: false, misleading, or deceptive representations. So adding a \"threat of litigation\" requirement to all time-barred debt-collection efforts curtails the reach of the Act by excising conduct otherwise covered by the terms \"deceptive\" or \"misleading.\" Common sense, our case law, and traditional tools of statutory interpretation foreclose such a construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For example, \"in certain contexts[,] a completely accurate statement can be deceptive or misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    Campuzano-Burgos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051364\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/294/#p298\">\n    550 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   301 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887696\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/393/#p395\">\n    776 F.3d at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the term \"misleading\" bans \"more than just falsehoods\"). Moreover, a communication subject to the FDCPA is deceptive if \"it can be reasonably read to have two or more different meanings, one of which is inaccurate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 298 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rosenau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3120991\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/218/#p221\">\n    539 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   222 ). Thus, conduct by a debt collector can be unlawfully misleading or deceptive while still falling short of an explicit threat of litigation.

Moreover, the chance that the letter could mislead the least-sophisticated debtor increases with the use of phrases such as \"settlement offer,\" which\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines as \"[a]n offer by one party to settle a dispute amicably (usu[ally] by paying money) to avoid or end a lawsuit or other legal action.\" (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   These textual sources and the reasoning of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits indicate that Tatis has \"state[d] a facially plausible claim for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Caprio v.
