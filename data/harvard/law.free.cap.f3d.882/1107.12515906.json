BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. The '222 Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Entitled \"System and Method for Operating a Drain Valve,\" the '222 application is directed to a valve assembly for draining contaminants, condensation, and other fluids that adversely affect the efficiency and function of a pressurized system. As shown in Figure 1 below, the claimed assembly includes a single \"valve body\" 12, which defines an inlet seat 18 and an outlet seat 20 downstream thereto; two valves 14 and 16; and a sensor 40 for measuring fluid pressure between the valves:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.A. 48-52, 60. The '222 application explains that the sensor generates a \"signal\" 42 reflective of the fluid pressure in the chamber between the valves and transmits the signal to an indicator 44, such as a pressure gauge. J.A. 51. The signal can then be compared to a predetermined limit to generate a control signal, which, in turn, can be used to control or adjust one or more of the two valves to drain fluid as appropriate. J.A. 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The '222 application contains 20 claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the parties agree that the claims at issue on appeal stand or fall with independent claim 1, which recites:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A drain valve comprising:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a. a\n   <em>\n    valve body\n   </em>\n   , wherein said\n   <em>\n    valve body defines an inlet seat\n   </em>\n   and a first outlet seat downstream of said inlet seat;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   b. a first member, wherein said first member has a first position in sealing engagement with said first outlet seat and a second position separated from said first outlet seat;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   c. a second member, wherein said second member has a first location in sealing engagement with said inlet seat; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   d. a\n   <em>\n    sensor\n   </em>\n   downstream of said inlet seat, wherein said sensor generates a\n   <em>\n    signal\n   </em>\n   reflective of a pressure downstream of said inlet seat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   J.A. 56 (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.

The Board's Finding that Rasmussen Anticipates the Claims Is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As described above, the Board affirmed the examiner's rejection of certain claims as anticipated by Rasmussen. A prior art reference anticipates a patent's claim when the four corners of the document \"describe every element of the claimed invention, either expressly or inherently, such that a person of ordinary skill in the art could practice the invention without undue experimentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Spansion, Inc. v.

Cir. 2015) (noting that we review the Board's \"factual findings for substantial evidence and its legal conclusions de novo\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At issue on appeal is claim 1's recitation of an \"inlet seat\" that is \"define[d]\" by a \"valve body.\" The examiner found that Rasmussen inherently discloses such an inlet seat within an unlabeled valve depicted in Rasmussen's Figure 7 above inlet port 17A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206441834\">\n    2016 WL 6441834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (summarizing, and tacitly agreeing with, the examiner's finding that Rasmussen\n   discloses \"an inlet seat (within the valve above condensate inlet port 17A)\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A. 117 (examiner stating in his final rejection that Rasmussen's unlabeled valve \"would inherently include a member (second member) that seals against a seat (inlet seat)\"); J.A. 200 (examiner stating the same in a non-final rejection); J.A. 206 (examiner stating in a non-final obviousness rejection that Rasmussen discloses an \"inlet seat (i.e., the seat inherent to the valve above [inlet port] 17A)\"). Hodges conceded this point during examination, and the Patent Office does not allege that the Board erred in this regard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, as the Board noted, the propriety of the examiner's rejection turns on whether Rasmussen's unlabeled valve containing the inlet seat is \"define[d]\" by Rasmussen's valve body-i.e., whether it \"can properly be considered to be a part of Rasmussen's drain valve body.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206441834\">\n    2016 WL 6441834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. The Board found that it could. In particular, the Board found that Rasmussen's unlabeled valve is \"connected to, and therefore allow[s] or prevent[s] flow into, inlet port 17A,\" and that the seat of the unlabeled valve would therefore \"be 'an internal part' of and contained within the 'outer casing' of drain valve 10.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206441834\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That finding is unsupported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As shown in the annotated version of Rasmussen's Figure 7 included in Hodges' opening brief, the unlabeled valve (shown in red above inlet port 17A) resides above the housing 11 that contains the other valve components (shown in yellow):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Appellant's Br. 22 (citing Rasmussen fig.7 (annotated) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. 5 (annotating Rasmussen's Figure 7 to point to the same valve); J.A. 118 (examiner's rejection pointing to the same valve). As shown, the unlabeled valve-and, therefore,\n   the inlet seat therein\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is not \"an internal part\" of and \"contained within\" the outer casing of the drain valve. To the contrary, Figure 7 clearly shows that the valve is external to and outside Rasmussen's casing. Accordingly, the only permissible factual finding that can be drawn from Rasmussen is that the inlet seat within the unlabeled valve is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"define[d]\" by the \"valve body,\" as required by the claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens Corning v. Fast Felt Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266211\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/896/#p903\">\n    873 F.3d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 903 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (reversing the Board's obviousness determination that was contrary to the \"one permissible factual finding\" that could be drawn from the record).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As sole support for its contrary findings, the Board asserted that \"the positioning of Rasmussen's unlabeled valve is\n   <em>\n    similar\n   </em>\n   to the positioning of [the '222 application's] second member 16, which extends away from valve body 12, ostensibly to allow second member 16 to be controlled.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206441834\">\n    2016 WL 6441834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (emphasis added). The Board neither supported its assertion of similarity, however, nor explained how the positioning of the unlabeled valve in Rasmussen's Figure 7 would enable a skilled artisan to \"practice the invention without undue experimentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Spansion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078975\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/1331/#p1356\">\n    629 F.3d at 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). And, even if Rasmussen's unlabeled valve is ostensibly \"similar to\" the '222 application's second member 16 in some respects, it is different in the only respect that is relevant to the claims at issue-i.e., it is not an internal part of or contained within the valve body. We therefore conclude that substantial evidence does not support the Board's anticipation findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Patent Office shoulders the burden during initial examination of establishing that the examined claims are anticipated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless[ ] ....\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Oetiker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519073\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1443/#p1445\">\n    977 F.2d 1443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1445 (Fed.

The Board construed \"signal\" as encompassing \"an act, event, or the like that causes or incites some action,\" which would encompass virtually any mechanical component within the valve drain that moves in response to the flow of fluid through the drain. The Board attempted to justify its construction by noting that the '222 application specification refers to a pressure gauge that can provide a visual indication of the operability of the drain valve, and concluded from that passage that the recited signal can constitute \"movement of the needle of pressure gauge 44 in response to the sensed pressure.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206441834\">\n    2016 WL 6441834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (citing J.A. 51). Such a reading of the '222 application is unreasonable. The portion of the specification to which the Board cites states that the sensor \"generates a signal,\" which, in turn, can be transmitted to a pressure gauge \"to provide a visual ... indication of the operability of the drain.\" J.A. 51. In other words, the recited \"signal\" causes the pressure gauge to provide a visual indication. The passage does not suggest, however, that the signal itself can constitute \"movement of\" the pressure gauge's needle \"in response to the sensed pressure,\" as the Board concluded.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206441834\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Board's strained interpretation of \"signal\" is therefore unreasonably broad and inconsistent with the '222 application.

The Examiner never stated that the inlet seat was \"within\" the unlabeled valve,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    J.A. 117, 200, 206, and the PTAB only stated as much in inaccurately summarizing the Examiner's findings,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ex Parte Hodges\n    </em>\n    , No. 2014-009710,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206441834\">\n     2016 WL 6441834\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2 (P.T.A.B.

Op. 6 (stating that the PTAB was \"summarizing, and\n    <em>\n     tacitly\n    </em>\n    agreeing with\" the Examiner's finding (emphasis added) ). Moreover, even if the majority is correct that the inlet seat is \"within\" the unlabeled valve, the PTAB never found that the unlabeled valve consists only of the portions of the annotated version of Rasmussen Figure 7 that are depicted in red, as opposed to including protrusions that extend therefrom.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Congress amended \u00a7 102 when it passed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (\"AIA\").
