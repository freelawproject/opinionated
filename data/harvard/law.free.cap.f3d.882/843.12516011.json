To be sure, private citizens often must sacrifice some individual freedom as a condition of their employment by the State, but \"a citizen who works for the government is nonetheless a citizen.\"\n   <em>\n    Garcetti v.

As a society, we must remain solicitous of the constitutional liberties of public employees, as of any citizens, to the greatest degree possible, and should be careful not to allow the State to use its authority as an employer to encroach excessively or unnecessarily upon the areas of private life, such as family relationships, procreation, and sexual conduct, where an individual's dignitary interest in autonomy is at its apex. Nor can or should we seek to eliminate the development of ordinary human emotions from the workplace where we spend a good part of our waking hours, unless such development is incompatible with the proper performance of one's official duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holly D. v.

With respect to the privacy claim, the district court based its decision on qualified immunity. As to the liberty claim, it found no\n   violation of the Constitution. Perez also appeals the district court's summary judgment on her claims against the individual defendants, the City of Roseville, and the Department for sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Perez was discharged after an internal affairs investigation into her romantic relationship with a fellow police officer. She claims that her termination violated her constitutional rights to privacy and intimate association because it was impermissibly based in part on disapproval of her private, off-duty sexual conduct. We have long held that the constitutional guarantees of privacy and free association prohibit the State from taking adverse employment action on the basis of private sexual conduct unless it demonstrates that such conduct negatively affects on-the-job performance or violates a constitutionally permissible, narrowly tailored regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorne v. City of El Segundo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929658,1929759\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/459/\">\n    726 F.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471 (9th Cir. 1983). Because a genuine factual dispute exists as to whether the defendants terminated Perez at least in part on the basis of her extramarital affair, we conclude that she has put forth sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on her Section 1983 claim for violation of her constitutional rights to privacy and intimate association. Moreover, these rights were clearly established by our precedent in\n   <em>\n    Thorne\n   </em>\n   such that any reasonable official would have been on notice that, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to her, Perez's termination was unconstitutional. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's grant of qualified immunity on her privacy claim and remand that claim for further proceedings. We affirm summary judgment on Perez's due process claim because any due process rights she might have had were not clearly established at the time of the challenged action. Therefore, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, we affirm summary judgment on Perez's sex discrimination claim because the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to her, indicates that the defendants' disapproval of her extramarital affair, rather than gender discrimination, was the cause of her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 4, 2012, Janelle Perez was hired by Chief Daniel Hahn to serve as a police officer in the Roseville Police Department. A few months into her probationary term, Perez and a fellow officer, Officer Shad Begley (\"Begley\") began a romantic relationship. Begley had been with the Department for over seven years. Both Perez and Begley were separated from, although still married to, other individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 6, 2012, Begley's wife Leah filed a citizen complaint in which she alleged that Perez and her husband were having an affair and that they were engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct while on duty. This letter prompted the Department to initiate an Internal Affairs (\"IA\") investigation headed by Lieutenant Bergstrom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his report, Bergstrom stated that there was no evidence of on-duty sexual contact between Perez and Begley, but that the two \"made a number of calls and texts when one or both was on duty,\" which \"potentially\" violated Department policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the conclusion of his investigation, Bergstrom provided his written IA report to Captain Stefan Moore. Moore then assigned\n   the review of the report to Lieutenant Cal Walstad, who recommended in a July 10, 2012 memorandum that the Department find Perez and Begley's conduct violated Department policies 340.3.5(c) (\"Unsatisfactory Work Performance\") and 340.3.5(aa) (\"Conduct Unbecoming\"). Moore agreed with Walstad's findings, and believed that Perez should be released from her probation in light of the results of the investigation. Moore later made comments that raise a genuine factual issue as to whether his recommendation that Perez be discharged was based on moral disapproval of her extramarital affair. Similarly, Walstad, who was also heavily involved in the disciplinary process, later admitted that he morally disapproved of Perez's extramarital sexual conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Perez and Begley received official memoranda dated August 15, which sustained the charges of \"Unsatisfactory Work Performance\" and \"Conduct Unbecoming.\" The Department also issued a letter to Begley's estranged wife on August 16, 2012, informing her of the same. Finally, Moore issued written reprimands to Perez and Begley on the basis of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At some point after the completion of the IA report, Lieutenant Maria Richardson informed Chief Hahn that Perez was not getting along with other female officers. Captain Moore also received similar information from Lieutenant Richardson, as well as from Sergeant Missy Morris. According to Perez, however, she made efforts to get along with both Richardson and Morris, and had no contact with any of the four other female officers in the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 29, 2012, shortly after receiving the reprimands from the Department, Perez fell ill, and Begley covered her shift at her request. The next day, Begley approached Sergeant Newton, the supervisor in charge of the dayshift schedule, about covering for Perez again. Newton asked him when Perez would be covering for Begley in return for the August 29 shift trade. Begley responded that he did not know and would contact Perez. Shortly after, Perez called Newton to discuss the shift trade policy. Newton and Perez had multiple follow-up conversations regarding the policy, and at some point Perez expressed her belief that the shift trade policy was being applied unfairly. Newton later discussed the incident with Hahn, Moore, and Lieutenant Glynn, reporting that Perez seemed \"angry\" and \"agitated.\" At their request, Newton memorialized his conversation with Perez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 13, a citizen filed a complaint with Lieutenant Bergstrom about Perez's conduct, alleging that she was rude and insensitive during a domestic violence call. Bergstrom informed Hahn of the complaint, but because the citizen apparently did not wish to pursue the matter further, no IA investigation was initiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Perez appealed her reprimand arising out of the initial IA investigation into her affair. An administrative hearing before Chief Hahn was held on September 4, 2012, at which time Perez provided Hahn with her written rebuttal to the IA findings of \"Unsatisfactory Work Performance\" and \"Conduct Unbecoming.\" At the conclusion of that hearing, Perez was informed without any explanation that she was being released from probation (i.e., \"you're fired.\"); she was issued a written notice, dated September 4, 2012, which was prepared in advance of the hearing. The notice contained no reasons for her discharge. After the hearing, when Perez asked Hahn why she was being terminated, the Chief declined to give a reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   About two weeks after Perez's termination, Lieutenant Glynn issued a new written reprimand to Perez from Captain Moore, dated September 10, 2012, which\n   reversed the findings regarding sections 340.3.5(c) (\"Unsatisfactory Work Performance\") and 340.3.5(aa) (\"Conduct Unbecoming\"), but based the reprimand on new charges of violating section 702 (\"Use of Personal Communication Devices\"). Chief Hahn later averred that Perez's \"personal calls during work time and during performance of various work duties was a concern, but not one warranting termination.\" Perez did not appeal this reprimand because she had already been terminated from her position, and her termination letter said that she had no right to appeal. In his deposition testimony, Chief Hahn stated (apparently for the first time) that he made the decision to terminate Perez's employment prior to the meeting, based on additional information that he had learned about Perez's performance and conduct since the completion of the initial IA investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 10, 2014, Perez sued the City of Roseville, the Department, Moore, Hahn, and Walstad, alleging Section 1983 claims for violation of her rights to privacy and freedom of association and her right to due process, as well as sex discrimination under Title VII and state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court granted summary judgment to each defendant. On Perez's Section 1983 claim for violation of her rights to privacy and intimate association, the district court concluded that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because Perez did not have a clearly established constitutional right to engage in a personal relationship with Begley while on duty. On her due process claim, the district court determined that there was no evidence that stigmatizing information about Perez was published in connection with her termination, and therefore no violation of her rights. As to Perez's sex discrimination claim, the court found that she did not provide sufficient evidence that Hahn's stated reasons for terminating her probationary employment were a pretext for sex discrimination or that her gender was a motivating factor in the decision making process. Perez timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, to survive summary judgment, Perez must establish (1) that a genuine factual dispute exists as to whether her constitutional rights were violated; and (2) that those constitutional rights were clearly established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

We have long recognized that officers and employees of a police department enjoy a \"right of privacy in 'private, off-duty' sexual behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929658,1929759\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/459/\">\n    726 F.2d at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471 ;\n   <em>\n    Fugate v.

This right protects public employees from adverse employment action based \"\n   <em>\n    in part\n   </em>\n   \" on their private sexual activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929658,1929759\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/459/\">\n    726 F.2d at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, under our precedent, the Constitution is violated when a public employee is terminated (a) at least in part on the basis of (b) protected conduct, such as her private, off-duty sexual activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that Perez has provided sufficient evidence of each element to survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Causal Nexus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendants argued before the district court that Perez could not establish that any action was taken against her\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   her sexual relationship with Begley. To the contrary, we conclude that there remains a genuine factual dispute about whether Hahn terminated her \"in part\" because of the affair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, Chief Hahn's testimony is inconsistent as to whether the IA investigation into Perez's affair played a role in his decision to terminate her employment. For example, when asked whether \"the whole Leah Begley complaint, internal affairs investigation, all of that, didn't have anything to do with your decision to terminate Miss Perez,\" Hahn responded, \"No. I would say it was part of it.\" This admission contradicts Hahn's statement in his declaration that \"Perez' [sic] private, off-duty relationship with Begley was not a factor in [his] decision to release her from probation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A reasonable factfinder could conclude on the basis of Hahn's testimony alone that Perez's termination was motivated\n   <em>\n    in part\n   </em>\n   by the revelation of her extramarital affair with Begley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gulden v. Crown Zellerbach Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027215\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/890/195/#p197\">\n    890 F.2d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (9th Cir. 1989) (\"Summary judgment is particularly inappropriate where the inferences which the parties seek to have drawn deal with questions of motive, intent and subjective feelings and reactions.\" (citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, the record indicates that Captain Moore was also motivated\n   <em>\n    in part\n   </em>\n   to terminate Perez on the basis of her extramarital affair, and although he was not the ultimate decisionmaker, he was intimately involved in the decisionmaking process resulting in Perez's termination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poland v. Chertoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047191\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1174/#p1182\">\n    494 F.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1182 (9th Cir. 2007) (\"[A] subordinate's bias is imputed to the employer if the plaintiff can prove that the allegedly independent adverse employment decision was not actually independent because the biased subordinate influenced or was involved in the decision or decisionmaking process.\"). For example, Moore testified that the fact that Perez and Begley were conducting an extramarital affair was \"significant\" to him, because it \"presente[d] a truly ethical dilemma whether or not that is something that could reflect unfavorably on the police department.\" Consequently, not only did Moore issue Perez a memorandum sustaining the \"Conduct Unbecoming\" and \"Unsatisfactory Work Performance\" charges and a written reprimand based on the IA investigation, but he also recommended to Chief Hahn that Perez be terminated on the basis of those disciplinary actions. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that Moore was motivated\n   <em>\n    in part\n   </em>\n   to recommend terminating Perez on the basis of her extramarital affair, and that he was sufficiently involved in Perez's termination that his motivation affected the decisionmaking process. The conclusion that the Department morally disapproved of Perez's private sexual conduct is further supported by the views of Walstad, who was also engaged in the termination process and stated that he personally felt that her conduct was inappropriate in light of her marital status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Third, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to raise a genuine factual dispute about whether the Department's three proffered reasons for terminating Perez were pretextual attempts to conceal its true motive for terminating her: the extramarital affair with Begley. The defendants claim that Perez was terminated for three reasons unrelated to her sexual conduct: (1) she did not get along well with other female officers; (2); the Department received a complaint from a domestic violence victim about Perez's conduct during a service call; and (3) she displayed a \"bad attitude\" in an interaction with a superior about a potential shift trade. Based on the evidence that Walstad and Moore morally disapproved of Perez's sexual conduct, and the speed with which these unrelated employment issues were \"discovered\" immediately after the IA investigation revealed Perez's affair, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that all three reasons were pretexts for an impermissible motive.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stegall v. Citadel Broad. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9055769\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/1061/#p1069\">\n    350 F.3d 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1069 (9th Cir. 2003),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (Jan. 6, 2004) (\"Temporal proximity between protected activity and an adverse employment action can by itself constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence of retaliation in some cases.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Prior to Leah Begley's June 6, 2012 letter informing the Department of the extramarital affair, Perez had been employed for approximately six months and received positive performance evaluations. From June 14 to June 21, Lieutenant Bergstrom conducted an IA investigation into Leah Begley's allegations about Perez's sexual conduct. Based on Lieutenant Bergstrom's investigation, Lieutenant Walstad recommended sustaining charges of\n   \"Conduct Unbecoming\" and \"Unsatisfactory Work Performance\" against Perez and Begley in a memorandum, which specifically referenced the fact that \"[b]oth officers are married and have young children.\" The memorandum criticized Perez's relationship with Begley as \"unprofessional,\" and noted that it \"reflect[ed] unfavorably upon the Roseville Police Department and its members\" because it was \"secret.\" Notably, Walstad later testified to his \"personal feelings\" that the affair was \"inappropriate\" because of Perez's and Begley's marital and familial status. The charges were then sustained in Captain Moore's August 15 memorandum,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Moore issued a written reprimand based on these charges to Perez on August 23. Moore also recommended to Chief Hahn that Perez be terminated on the basis of the charges. On September 4, a hearing was held before Hahn on Perez's appeal from the reprimand. Perez was terminated at the close of this hearing, and Chief Hahn declined to provide a reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Meanwhile, all three of the Department's now-proffered reasons-all unrelated to on- or off-duty sexual conduct-arose\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the conclusion of the IA investigation, over the course of approximately eight weeks. Based in part on this temporal proximity, a reasonable jury could infer that these three reasons were a pretext for Perez's termination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yartzoff v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1643347\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/809/1371/#p1376\">\n    809 F.2d 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1376-77 (9th Cir. 1987) (finding that, after years of positive reviews, plaintiff receiving his first sub-average performance rating only three months after filing an administrative complaint against employer was probative of pretext in retaliation case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Furthermore, there is circumstantial evidence that each of the Department's proffered reasons is independently \"unworthy of credence.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trustees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11234918\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/1115/#p1127\">\n    225 F.3d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (Title VII plaintiff \"can prove pretext ... indirectly, by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is 'unworthy of credence' because it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable\"). First, regarding Perez's alleged inability to get along with her female coworkers, Perez testified that she never worked with any female officers besides Sergeant Morris and Lieutenant Richardson. Also, this complaint was made only after her affair became known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Neither of the other two justifications upon which the Department now claims to have relied is more credible. In contrast to the allegations regarding Perez's sexual conduct, which were investigated thoroughly, it is undisputed that \"no fact-finding investigation\" was conducted into the supposed domestic violence victim's citizen complaint against Perez. Similarly, rather than investigating the circumstances surrounding Perez's alleged \"bad attitude\" with her supervisor, Sergeant Newton, regarding a shift trade, Chief Hahn simply directed Newton to immediately memorialize his conversation with Perez. Newton testified that he found this course of action \"weird,\" and \"that 'something' was going on.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Earl v.

When Chief Hahn notified Perez of her termination at the conclusion of her IA appeal on September 4, he initially declined to provide any reason at all. Then, on September 20, well after her termination, Perez received a new reprimand from Captain Moore, dated September 10, reversing the findings of \"Conduct Unbecoming\" and \"Unsatisfactory Work Performance\" and substituting a new violation under section 702 (\"Use of Personal Communication Devices\"). Moreover, despite his testimony that he decided to fire her on August 30, it was not until this litigation commenced that Chief Hahn put forth the three reasons-failure to get along with women officers, citizen's complaint, and bad attitude with supervisor-on which the Department now relies for terminating her and all of which differ from both the original and the belated reprimands issued by the Department after she was fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, given the investigation of charges based upon allegations related to her affair with another officer, the evidence of the investigators' moral disapproval of her affair, and the Department's constantly shifting justifications for her termination, as well as the independent reasons for doubting the legitimacy of each shifting justification, we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Perez was fired at least in part because of her extramarital affair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although the district court erred in determining that the Department's letter to Leah Begley was not published in connection with Perez's termination, the law of this circuit did not clearly establish that a letter published nineteen days prior to an employee's termination could bear a sufficient nexus to the employment decision to give rise to a right to name-clearing hearing. In fact, in\n   <em>\n    Tibbetts\n   </em>\n   , we explicitly stated that a reasonable public official \"could not have known by recourse to then-extant case law whether a stigmatizing statement made nineteen days after Plaintiffs' termination would violate\n   <em>\n    Campanelli's\n   </em>\n   temporal nexus test.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651594\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/529/#p538\">\n    567 F.3d at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, we conclude that, regardless of how apparent the violation may have been in this case, and notwithstanding that our holding on this question will lead to a different result in future cases, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Perez's due process claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this purely legal conclusion is unavoidable, it is unnecessary to remand to the district court for its consideration in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Moreover, Bergstrom's IA investigation concluded that there was no evidence that the officers were \"excessively texting each other during their shifts.\" At no point did any investigators find evidence of on-duty sexual activity between Perez and Begley, and the use of the phone was dismissed as a basis, let alone\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    basis, for her firing.

June 11, 2013) (\"[U]nlike in\n    <em>\n     Campanelli\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Tibbetts\n    </em>\n    where the stigmatizing statements were made after termination, the City made the stigmatizing statements about plaintiff at the time of his termination.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Because the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, we express no view on defendants alternative arguments that Perez was not entitled to name-clearing hearing because either (1) the letter to Leah Begley did not contain sufficiently stigmatizing charges; or (2) Perez received all of the process which was due at her September 4 administrative hearing before Chief Hahn.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-81\">\n   TASHIMA, Circuit Judge, concurring\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   I write separately because, although I ultimately agree with the decision to reverse the grant of summary judgment to defendants on plaintiff Janelle Perez's Fourteenth Amendment privacy claim, I disagree with much of the majority's reasoning on that claim. We should be mindful that Perez was a probationary police officer, which means that under Roseville city policy, the Police Department (\"Department\") did not have to provide any reasons for terminating her (and initially did not). Still, once litigation began, the Department asserted three reasons for firing Perez. I concur in the reversal solely because those reasons all arose in such short order after the internal affairs review that a reasonable inference may be drawn that they may have been pretextual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority's\n   other bases for reversing the grant of summary judgment on this claim do not, in my opinion, withstand scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Chief Hahn's \"part of\" testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority first relies on Chief Hahn's deposition testimony that Leah Begley's complaint was \"part of\" his decision to terminate Perez-even concluding that Chief Hahn's testimony alone would preclude summary judgment. Maj. Op. at 851-52. The majority calls Chief Hahn's answer \"inconsistent\" with his declaration that Perez's \"private, off-duty relationship with [Shad Begley] was not a factor\" in her firing. As I demonstrate below, however, Chief Hahn's statements are not contradictory. The only part of the affair investigation that factored into the firing was Perez's\n   <em>\n    on-duty\n   </em>\n   phone use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As the majority recognizes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 857 (\"Begley's wife's complaint alleged\n   <em>\n    on-the-job\n   </em>\n   sexual misconduct\"), Leah Begley's complaint letter focused on potential on-duty conduct by Perez and Shad Begley.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter precipitated an internal affairs review, after which Perez was reprimanded, initially for \"[u]nsatisfactory work performance\" and \"conduct ... unbecoming a member of the Department.\" Lieutenant Walstad's initial \"conduct unbecoming\" finding resulted explicitly from the affair. As he wrote, \"Both Officer[s] are married and have young children,\" which \"reflects unfavorably\" on the Department. Captain Moore's subsequent reprimand letter suggested that Perez and Begley's on-duty phone use \"interfere[d] in their work performance\" and \"reflected negatively\" on the Department, but did not mention any off-duty conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Chief Hahn, the final decisionmaker, did not sustain either of internal affairs' findings. He rejected the work performance finding because, he testified, \"I didn't see anything in the internal affairs report that could prove that ... something didn't get done that should have got done.\" Chief Hahn rejected the conduct unbecoming finding for similar reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Well, one, a lot of the allegations in the original complaint were things happening on duty, and none of those were proven that they happened on duty. So now we're just dealing with off-duty conduct, and I didn't see any off-duty conduct that affected morale or standing of the department kind of thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Asked whether the extramarital nature of the affair \"ha[d] anything to do with your decision making,\" Chief Hahn said, \"No. Absolutely not.\" Accordingly, to the extent that Walstad and Moore initially recommended discipline based on Perez's protected\n   <em>\n    off-duty\n   </em>\n   conduct, Chief Hahn explicitly rejected that rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Instead, Chief Hahn determined that Perez's on-duty personal phone use violated the Department's phone policy, and so wrote in a post-firing letter to Perez. He testified that Perez's phone use was the only \"fact[ ] contained in the internal affairs investigation\" that factored into her firing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, when Chief Hahn testified \"yes,\" that the Leah Begley letter and investigation were \"part of\" his decision to fire Perez, he could\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   have been referring to the phone policy violation. He expressly repudiated the other findings in his reprimand of Perez, statements to subordinates, and deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Statements of subordinate officers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Next, the majority concludes that the court may impute Lieutenant Walstad's and Captain Moore's bias against Perez to the Department because, although subordinates, they were involved in Perez's firing. Maj. Op. at 851-52. Walstad and Moore each reviewed the internal affairs investigation report and recommended that the Department discipline Perez. Chief Hahn's independent decision, however, cut off any causal nexus between those officers' apparent bias and Perez's firing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Under our precedent, the court may impute bias to an employer \"if a subordinate, in response to a plaintiff's protected activity, sets in motion a proceeding by an independent decisionmaker that leads to an adverse employment action ... [and] the biased subordinate influenced or was involved in the decision or decisionmaking process.\"\n   <em>\n    Poland v. Chertoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047191\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1174/#p1182\">\n    494 F.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1182 (9th Cir. 2007).\n   <em>\n    Poland\n   </em>\n   was a retaliation case; thus, it is not a perfect match for Perez's claims. Still,\n   <em>\n    Poland\n   </em>\n   's overall point applies: there can be a causal nexus even where an unbiased supervisor makes the ultimate employment decision, if a biased subordinate had a \"pervasive\" influence on the disciplinary process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047191\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1174/#p1182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047191\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1174/#p1182\">\n    at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, \"if an adverse employment action is the consequence of an entirely independent investigation by an employer, the animus of the retaliating employee is not imputed to the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047191\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1174/#p1182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus no nexus exists if the subordinate's influence is not \"pervasive\" or the employer's decision is sufficiently independent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Here, there are indicia that at least Walstad, and maybe Moore, were biased. Walstad, who first reviewed the internal affairs investigation, testified that the affair was inappropriate because both Perez and Begley were married with young children. He recommended sustaining discipline because the officers were married and should model ethical conduct to maintain \"the trust and respect of those who are served.\" Moore, who reviewed Walstad's recommendations, testified that the affair \"present[ed] a truly ethical dilemma whether or not that is something that could reflect unfavorably on our police department.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Despite these indicia of bias, however, the causal nexus between both officers' actions and Perez's eventual termination is virtually nonexistent. Each officer participated in the internal affairs review strictly in the course of his normal duties. Neither requested the investigation. As explained at length above, Chief Hahn explicitly rejected Walstad's and Moore's recommendations to the extent they were based on off-duty sexual conduct, instead determining that Perez violated only the Department's phone use policy. At some later point, Moore was told of Chief Hahn's decision to terminate Perez, and Moore may have agreed (the record is unclear), but the final decision was Hahn's alone. In that respect, this case resembles\n   <em>\n    Lakeside-Scott\n   </em>\n   , in which the allegedly biased subordinate initially reported an employee's conduct, but the employee's termination resulted from a subsequent investigation on which the subordinate had no influence.\n   <em>\n    Lakeside-Scott v. Multnomah Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329859\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/797/#p805\">\n    556 F.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 805-06 (9th Cir. 2009). The court found no causal nexus.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329859\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/797/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , we found no causal nexus between a subordinate's discriminatory remarks to a coworker, complaint\n   to a superior about the coworker, and the coworker's subsequent demotion.\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v. Cty. of L.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9069864\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/349/634/\">\n    349 F.3d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2003),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (Jan. 2, 2004). In the intervening time, as here, the supervisor \"conducted her own thorough investigation\" and determined that a demotion was warranted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9069864\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/349/634/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9069864\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/349/634/\">\n    at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, no reasonable juror could conclude that either Walstad or Moore \"influenced, affected, or were involved in\" Perez's firing when Hahn explicitly rejected their reasoning and recommendations.\n   <em>\n    Poland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047191\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1174/#p1182\">\n    494 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1183 ;\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    France v.

Pretextual reasons\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Lastly, the majority holds that a jury could find the Department's stated reasons for firing Perez were pretextual because they all arose shortly after the affair investigation. I agree that under our controlling case law, the timing of the proffered reasons raises a triable issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Department did not need to provide any reason for firing Perez, who was hired as a probationary police officer. The Department could summarily dismiss Perez for no reason at all or for a frivolous, non-protected reason. Per Roseville city policy, a probationary employee \"may be released from City service without cause at the sole discretion of the City.\" Chief Hahn testified that if a probationary officer has \"done something egregious enough to get disciplined in that period of time where they are supposed to be on their best behavior,\" firing is advisable even without a response from the officer. The majority does not grapple with or even address this issue in its analysis of Perez's privacy claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   At least initially, Chief Hahn did not provide any reason for terminating Perez. However, the Department provided several reasons in the course of this litigation. In his declaration, Chief Hahn said he terminated Perez due to a shift trade dispute, a civilian complaint, and an officer's complaint that Perez was not getting along with other female officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A plaintiff may defeat summary judgment by showing that the defendant's proffered reasons lack credence or are pretextual.\n   <em>\n    Anthoine v. N. Cent. Counties Consortium\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054191\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/605/740/#p753\">\n    605 F.3d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753 (9th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Although the majority states there is evidence that all three of the Department's reasons lack credence, Maj. Op. at 853, I am not convinced that this record supports such a conclusion. The majority contends the informal complaint that Perez was not getting along with other female officers \"was made only after her affair became known.\" Maj. Op. 853-54. Yet, there is not evidence the complainants knew of the affair or the investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that Perez worked with some female officers, including the officer who complained. As for the civilian complaint, the Department did not investigate it because the civilian did not wish to pursue the matter further. Given the nonexistent threshold for firing a probationary officer, Chief Hahn could rely on an unsubstantiated complaint. The same holds true for the\n   shift trade dispute. Moreover, the other officer's sense upon being asked to write a memo about the dispute that \"something was going on\" is not \"evidence that an employer[ ] deviat[ed] from established policy or practice,\"\n   <em>\n    Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836217\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1108/#p1117\">\n    658 F.3d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117 (9th Cir. 2011), but rather of the officer's realization that Perez might be under investigation. None of the three reasons lacks credence, particularly in light of the no-cause standard for firing a probationary officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Under normal circumstances, the timing of the proffered reasons would preclude summary judgment. The complaints all arose in the very short period between the internal affairs review and Perez's appeal hearing, which creates an inference of pretext, as the majority notes.\n   <em>\n    Yartzoff v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1643347\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/809/1371/#p1376\">\n    809 F.2d 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1376 (9th Cir. 1987). But in the context of terminating a probationary employee, the inference is not as compelling, because in that context, no reason at all need be proffered for the termination and often one isn't provided at the time, as in this case. In the usual non-probation case a close-in-time pretextual reason is offered because some reason is required to be given for the personnel action. Here, specific reasons were offered for the termination only because litigation had been instituted. Thus, it is the ordinary course of events that when a probationary employee is terminated, no reason is proffered. As in this case, a reason for the termination will be offered only if the termination is challenged in an administrative or judicial proceeding. Thus, if a justification for terminating a probationary employee is ever called for, it would be in circumstances post-termination and close in time to the termination. These circumstances call for the exercise of caution when applying the close-in-time-equals-pretext\n   <em>\n    Yartzoff\n   </em>\n   rule; but they do not mean that the rule should not be applied at all when probationary employees are involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Here, Chief Hahn knew early on of Perez's affair. He was told about the civilian complaint even though no investigation occurred. There is also a factual dispute over whether Chief Hahn or a different officer instructed Newton to write the shift trade dispute memo. Ultimately, the timing of these three bases permits the inference that Chief Hahn wished to conceal an improper motive with legitimate explanations. Of course, Chief Hahn said he was trying to determine \"what kind of employee [Perez] was\" before the appeal hearing, which might account for the timing of the three reasons. However, resolving this dispute-whether the proffered reasons for Perez's termination were pretextual-is for the jury to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, on this basis alone, I concur in the majority's reversal of summary judgment in favor of defendants on Perez's Fourteenth Amendment privacy claim.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    I join in full the majority's analysis of Perez's other claims. I note, however, that with respect to the due process claim based on the Department's failure to provide Perez with a name-clearing hearing, whether Chief Hahn's letter to Leah Begley was \"stigmatizing\" is not at-issue on this appeal. The majority affirms the grant of summary judgment to defendants on this claim on the basis of qualified immunity, assuming that the letter is a \"publication of stigmatizing charges.\"\n    <em>\n     Mustafa v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684701\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1169/#p1179\">\n     157 F.3d 1169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1179 (9th Cir. 1998).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Maj. Op. at 861 n.15. I doubt that the Chief's August 16, 2012, letter, which, according to the majority, \"indicated that the charges of 'Unsatisfactory Work Performance' and 'Conduct Unbecoming' were sustained\" constituted publication of stigmatizing information.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 29.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The letter stated, in part: \"I also want to report this situation to you and other Roseville officials as I believe the citizens and taxpayers of Roseville have been cheated by the conduct of Officers Begley and Perez\n    <em>\n     during the time they were on duty\n    </em>\n    and sworn to be spending 100% of their time serving the City of Roseville.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    As noted above, Chief Hahn also testified that Perez's phone policy violation factored into his decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    There is no evidence in the record that the internal affairs investigation, or the affair itself, were \"known\" within the Department. Indeed, the senior officer who documented the shift trade dispute was unaware of the internal affairs investigation at the time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
