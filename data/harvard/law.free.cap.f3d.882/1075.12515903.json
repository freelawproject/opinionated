We acknowledge that a determination of the alleged misrepresentations to the PTO will almost certainly require some application of patent law.

This passage does not stand for the proposition that the Federal Circuit retains exclusive jurisdiction of\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   claims. We made these statements in the context of determining whether regional circuit or Federal Circuit law applies to\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   claims, not whether we have jurisdiction over any such claims. We further indicated that our \"conclusion applies equally to all antitrust claims\n   <em>\n    premised on the bringing of a pat\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ent infringement suit.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191656\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/1059/#p1067\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191656\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/1059/#p1067\">\n    at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The Third Circuit recently called into question whether we have exclusive jurisdiction over all\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   claims in light of\n   <em>\n    Gunn.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lipitor Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276741\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/126/#p146\">\n    855 F.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146 (3d Cir. 2017). While recognizing that\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   claims have been \"considered by courts to present a substantial question of patent law,\" the \"substantiality of these theories may be open to debate following\n   <em>\n    Gunn v.

In a case involving a legal malpractice action arising out of an unsuccessful application for a patent, the D.C. Circuit, citing\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   , held that it had appellate jurisdiction because the case \"involve[d] no forward-looking questions about any patent's validity, but instead solely concern[ed] whether unsuccessful patent applicants can recover against their attorneys.\"\n   <em>\n    Seed Co.

Cir. 2016). The\n   Eleventh Circuit held that a contract claim with an underlying patent infringement issue did not implicate exclusive Federal Circuit jurisdiction due to the fact-bound nature of the question, the small likelihood that the issue would impact future cases, and the weak interest of the government in federal adjudication.\n   <em>\n    MDS (Can.)

And the Fifth Circuit held that it had appellate jurisdiction in a case involving a state law claim based on fraud on the PTO because the underlying fraud allegation \"d[id] not cause the underlying hypothetical patent issues to be of substantial importance to the federal system as a whole\" as required by\n   <em>\n    Gunn.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    USPPS, Ltd. v.
