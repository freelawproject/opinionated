(collectively \"Yamaha\"). In her complaint, Hickerson alleged product liability claims under South Carolina law for design and warning defects. The district court excluded Hickerson's proffered expert testimony and entered summary judgment in favor of Yamaha on all claims. Hickerson then filed a motion to reconsider under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), which the district court also denied. On appeal, Hickerson contends the district court erred in requiring expert testimony on her claims and in failing to conduct an appropriate\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis before excluding her expert's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

The following warning (reproduced below) appears on the PWC's front glove box:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. Severe internal injuries can occur if water is forced into body cavities as a result of falling into water or being near jet thrust nozzle. Normal swimwear does not adequately protect against forceful water entry into rectum or vagina. All riders must wear a wet suit bottom or clothing that provides equivalent protection (See Owner's Manual).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.A. 716. The PWC's rear boarding platform also bears a warning label (reproduced below) stating that \"[s]evere internal injuries can occur\" and passengers must \"[w]ear a wetsuit bottom or clothing that provides equivalent protection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.A. 716.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The PWC and accompanying owner's manual also contained warnings that only three people may ride the craft at a time, the operator should be at least sixteen years old, and a person should not ride after consuming alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2012, Hickerson was a passenger riding the PWC on Lake Hartwell, South Carolina. She fell off the back of the PWC into the jet thrust behind it and suffered injuries to her rectum, perineum, vagina, anus, and colon (\"orifice injuries\"). She underwent eight weeks of medical procedures and recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When she was injured, Hickerson was wearing a bikini and no wetsuit. It is undisputed that she was the fourth passenger on the PWC, a ten-year-old was driving, and Hickerson had consumed alcohol prior to riding. Hickerson admitted that she did not read any on-craft or manual warnings before riding the PWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hickerson, a South Carolina resident, filed her complaint in federal court based on diversity of citizenship with Yamaha.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In her complaint, Hickerson pleaded state law claims of strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranties based on the PWC's allegedly inadequate warnings and defective design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During discovery, Hickerson proffered the expert testimony of Dr. Anand Kasbekar, a mechanical engineer familiar with PWCs who has been retained as an expert in dozens of various product liability cases. Dr. Kasbekar represented that he intended to give several opinions: that the PWC's warnings were inadequate, that a set of alternative warnings was better, and that design alterations like a contoured seat and hand straps would have made the PWC safer. The district court found Dr. Kasbekar qualified to testify as an expert on PWC warnings and design based on his relevant experience in engineering, forensic analysis, and warnings testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   However, in response to a motion in limine by Yamaha, the district court excluded Dr. Kasbekar's proffered opinion for a set of alternative warnings as unreliable under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Hickerson v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:13-cv-02311-JMC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204123865\">\n    2016 WL 4123865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.S.C. July 29, 2016). The district court explained that because Dr. Kasbekar's proposals were neither tested nor based on \"specific relevant research or studies,\" they bore no indicia of reliability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204123865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In its written opinion on the motion in limine excluding the alternative warning opinion, the district court mentioned Dr. Kasbekar's separate inadequate warning opinion. However, the court did not expressly exclude the inadequate warning opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Later, in awarding summary judgment to Yamaha, the district court revisited the issue of whether Dr. Kasbekar's proposed inadequate warning opinion was admissible.\n   <em>\n    Hickerson v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:13-cv-02311-JMC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204367141\">\n    2016 WL 4367141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.S.C. Aug. 16, 2016). The court noted that Hickerson's claim of a warning inadequacy \"implicate[s] the study of human factors and other industry standards ... generally beyond the common knowledge of a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Thus, the district court expected expert testimony to support any claim of inadequate warnings. But Dr. Kasbekar's inadequate warning opinion was not supported by studies, research, or other scientific basis of verification necessary to establish reliability for\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   purposes. Indeed, because \"[t]he primary evidence [Hickerson] presented ... to support her inadequate warnings claims was, in fact, in the form of expert testimony from Dr. Anand Kasbekar\" and the proposed warning system opinion was excluded\n   as unreliable, the district court was \"hard-pressed to discern a 'genuine dispute as to any material fact' \" on Hickerson's warnings claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-4. The district court then excluded the proffered inadequate warning opinion and awarded summary judgment to Yamaha on all the warnings claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the defective design claim, the court held that South Carolina continues to follow Comment j to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which, in the district court's view, allows adequate product warnings to \"cure\" alleged design defects. The court next observed that because Hickerson had not produced admissible evidence that the PWC's warnings were inadequate, \"the product's warnings [were] adequate as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Consequently, under Comment j, the adequate warnings cured any alleged design defects so that the PWC could not be deemed defectively designed. Because strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranties claims require \"proof of a defective condition,\" the court granted judgment as a matter of law on all of Hickerson's claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hickerson filed a motion to reconsider under Rule 59(e), claiming the district court's rulings were clearly erroneous because Hickerson had provided sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment and a product with adequate warnings can still be unreasonably dangerous under South Carolina law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hickerson v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:13-cv-02311-JMC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207324684\">\n    2016 WL 7324684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.S.C. Dec. 16, 2016). The district court rejected Hickerson's argument that Dr. Kasbekar's inadequate warning opinion could rest on his own \"specialized skill, training, and experiences\" without any relevant scientific support.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. It also rejected Hickerson's \"mere disagreement with the court's interpretation of South Carolina law\" on the application of Comment j.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. Having reviewed its rulings, the district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hickerson timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hickerson offered Dr. Kasbekar as her expert, and he proffered to opine that the existing warnings were inadequate in location, content, and form. These deficiencies, according to Dr. Kasbekar, inhibited passengers' ability to see the warnings and appreciate the danger of riding a PWC without a wetsuit. He also intended to offer a proposed set of alternative PWC warnings that he claimed would have better informed passengers of the PWC's danger. The district court excluded the alternative warning opinion as unreliable and later similarly excluded his inadequate warning opinion, which was \"ostensibly ... ground[ed]\" on the alternative warning opinion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204367141\">\n    2016 WL 4367141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Hickerson contends the district court abused its discretion by failing to conduct a proper\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis before excluding Dr. Kasbekar's inadequate warning opinion. She argues the court mistakenly held that the proposed inadequate warning opinion was based only on the excluded alternative warning opinion when, in fact, Dr. Kasbekar had formulated his inadequate warning opinion by drawing on his experience, training, testing, and knowledge of PWC industry standards. Yamaha responds that the district court appropriately excluded the inadequate warning opinion because it was unsupported with any scientific indicia of reliability. To that point, Yamaha noted that Dr. Kasbekar's claim for the inadequacy of the glove box and rear craft warnings hinged chiefly on their location; however, his only support for that proposition was his already excluded alternative warning opinion. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded Dr. Kasbekar's inadequate warning opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Dr. Kasbekar had concluded in his expert report that the existing warnings on the PWC were inadequate because passengers could more easily see a warning located directly on the seat instead of warnings appearing on the glove box and at the rear of the craft. He also concluded that the warnings were \"congested\" and confused important information that passengers should read before riding the PWC. J.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   161. Yet, aside from his alternative warning opinion-the exclusion of which Hickerson does not challenge on appeal-Dr. Kasbekar supported his inadequate warning opinion with no research, data, or scientific theories. The district court observed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   outside of the warnings expert testimony, there is little to no evidence in the record on which this court can rely to conclude that there is a genuine factual dispute as to whether the product was 'unreasonably dangerous' based on Defendants' failure to provide an adequate warning concerning the product's use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204367141\">\n    2016 WL 4367141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Dr. Kasbekar had not tested his inadequate warning opinion and admitted he provided no research to support the notion that passengers read a seat warning more often than glove box or rear craft warnings, especially if \"read means ... read and comprehend it.\" J.A. 163-64. Even his opinion that the wetsuit depicted in the on-craft warnings should be black rather than white was based solely on his personal recollection that he had never seen a white wet suit. He could not reliably opine that the PWC warnings with white wetsuit images are inadequate because he failed to provide relevant testing or research and his alternative warning opinion featuring a black wetsuit-which could support the inadequacy of the existing warnings-had been excluded. Dr. Kasbekar's own testimony established that his opinions lacked the markers of reliability Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   require to prevent an expert from misleading a jury with unproven conjecture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, the district court concluded Hickerson presented \"little to no evidence beyond Dr. Kasbekar's excluded testimony\" to support her claim that the PWC's warnings were defective.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207324684\">\n    2016 WL 7324684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. She was unable to refute Yamaha's evidence that the Boating Safety Advisory Council and Coast Guard had approved the PWC's warnings and uniform labels. As illustrated above, the warnings on the PWC plainly warn of the danger of the orifice injuries Hickerson sustained. The district court noted that, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, \"it would be difficult ... to accept that a jury could find that the warnings' direct and specific verbiage and its multiple locations on both the front and rear parts of the PWC rendered them inadequate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204367141\">\n    2016 WL 4367141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The district court properly concluded that the PWC's warnings were adequate as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Hickerson also contends the district court erred in requiring expert testimony at all to support her warnings claims. Because South Carolina only requires expert testimony when issues are beyond a jury's general knowledge and most jurors will have had exposure to various warnings, Hickerson posits the jury here did not need expert testimony to determine whether the PWC's warnings were adequate. Yamaha responds that the district court did not err because the issue of the adequacy of the warnings could only be submitted to the jury once admissible evidence had been presented that they were inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While the district court noted expert testimony was \"in this particular case ... important\" and was \"perhaps the most appropriate form of evidence to support\" the inadequacy of the PWC's warnings, the district court did not end its analysis there.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207324684\">\n    2016 WL 7324684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. After it excluded Dr. Kasbekar's proffered opinions as unreliable, the court also looked for other warnings evidence in the record but was \"hard-pressed to discern a genuine factual dispute on the issue precisely because [his]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   opinion testimony was the primary evidence Plaintiff presented on the issue and because there is little to no evidence in the record on the issue beyond his testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207324684\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted). The district court did not exclude Hickerson's warnings claims merely because they lacked expert testimony; rather, it required her to support those claims with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   admissible evidence. In this regard, Hickerson simply failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Hickerson relied to her detriment on Dr. Kasbekar's expert testimony as the exclusive support for her warnings claims. Because \"the question of the adequacy of the warning\" does not reach the jury unless \"evidence has been presented that the warning was inadequate,\" and Hickerson failed to present such evidence, her warnings claims could not withstand summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

The Parties' core disagreement concerns whether claims of defective design are defeated when product warnings are deemed legally adequate, as occurred in this case. Our judicial function in a diversity case such as this is cabined by a bedrock principle of federalism: \"In adjudicating non-federal questions, a federal court must apply the law of the state.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Little\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413058\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/495/#p498\">\n    52 F.3d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (4th Cir. 1995). Thus, we will apply South Carolina law to resolve this inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   South Carolina's Defective Products Act (\"the Act\") imposes strict liability on manufacturers of defectively designed products. S.C. Code \u00a7 15-73-10,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   This Act codified \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, whose comments the South Carolina General Assembly also adopted as the expression of its legislative intent for the Act. S.C. Code \u00a7 15-73-30 (\"Comments to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement of Torts, Second, are incorporated herein by reference thereto as the legislative intent of this chapter.\");\n   <em>\n    Aldana v.

Apr. 25, 2008). The disputed provision, Comment j to \u00a7 402A, states in pertinent part: \"Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use if it is followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A cmt. j (Am. Law Inst. 1965).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Advancing a number of policy arguments, Hickerson contends Comment j allows her to bring defective design claims even if her defective warnings claims fail. Specifically, she argues that design claims are independent of any warning claim. As a consequence, Hickerson represents that allowing good warnings to trump bad design would \"subordinat[e] design safety to warnings.\" Appellant's Br. 14. Her counsel also speculates that William Prosser, the drafter of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, simply erred in drafting Comment j and did not intend for it to say what it says. In response, Yamaha notes that Comment j's plain text, and the South Carolina court decisions applying it, allow a product manufacturer to rely on a legally adequate warning to avoid liability for an alleged defective design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Hickerson calls Comment j \"ambiguous\" in passing but offers no textual support for her position. Appellant's Br. 6. Even a cursory examination of Comment j refutes her label. On its face, Comment j provides\n   that an adequate\n   <em>\n    warning\n   </em>\n   makes a product \"safe for use if [the warning] is followed.\" \u00a7 402A cmt. j. A product seller who puts such a\n   <em>\n    warning\n   </em>\n   on his product is entitled to \"reasonably assume that [the warning] will be read and heeded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%201883404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    warning\n   </em>\n   also makes the product \"not in defective condition, nor ... unreasonably dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%201883404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The application of Comment j to design defect claims thus relies entirely upon the adequacy of a product warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Consistent with Comment j's text, the South Carolina Court of Appeals has repeatedly applied its plain language to confirm that an adequate warning operates to \"cure\" a product's alleged design defects.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Curcio v.

Thus, the PWC's warnings were adequate as a matter of law.
