He seeks review of an adverse decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board. In this opinion, we address three issues: (1) whether the Board is a proper respondent; (2) whether the Board deprived Petitioner of due process by issuing a two-person decision; and (3) whether the Board's ruling on the merits-that Petitioner failed to make a prima facie case that his complaint to the Department of Defense Inspector General (\"DODIG\") was a contributing factor in the Army's decision to terminate him and exclude him from a work site-is supported by substantial evidence and free of procedural error. We hold: (1) the Army is the only proper respondent; (2) Petitioner received due process; and (3) the Board's decision on the merits is supported by substantial evidence and is procedurally proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in 2008, Petitioner worked as a civilian Supervisory Engineering Technician for the U.S. Army Installation Management Command, Directorate of Public Works, at Fort Hunter Liggett, a military base in California. On October 26, 2012, he filed a complaint with DODIG. As relevant here, Petitioner alleged that he had been the subject of an investigation during which Army employees had made false statements about him. He further alleged in his DODIG complaint that he had encountered nepotism within the Army. The army terminated Petitioner's employment on August 21, 2013, purportedly because the Directorate of Public Works was overstaffed; two days later, he was excluded from the site for 180 days because of the termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Petitioner filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel, alleging as relevant here that his termination and exclusion from his work site were retaliation for his DODIG complaint, a form of whistleblowing. After a hearing, an administrative judge denied Petitioner's request for corrective action. On the merits, the administrative judge found that the DODIG complaint did not contribute either to the Army's decision to terminate Petitioner or to its decision to exclude him from the site. Petitioner appealed that decision to the Board, which affirmed. Petitioner filed a timely petition for review with this court, naming both the Army and the Board as respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Board as a Respondent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We first consider whether Petitioner properly named both the Board and the Army as respondents. Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207703\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Board shall be named respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection,\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the employee ... seeks review of a final order or decision\n   <em>\n    on the merits on the underlying personnel action\n   </em>\n   ..., in which case the agency\n   responsible for taking the personnel action shall be\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphases added.) Petitioner brings procedural and jurisdictional challenges, but he also disputes the Board's determination on the merits of the underlying personnel action. We have not yet considered who is the proper respondent in a \"mixed\" case-that is, one in which the employee challenges both jurisdictional or procedural matters\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the merits of an adverse personnel action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Congress clearly intended for only one party to be \"the\" respondent in any given petition to review a Board decision. Moreover, the text following the word \"unless\" clearly makes the pivot point an employee's challenge to the merits of a personnel decision. Here, because Petitioner is seeking review of the Board's decision on the merits of his termination and exclusion, the Board is not the proper respondent. Only the agency that took the action-here, the Army-is properly \"the\" respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our conclusion on that issue accords with the Federal Circuit's holding that the employing agency is the proper respondent when a petition for review involves both jurisdictional and merits issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Amin v.

If the Board had to serve as the respondent in a case in which the merits of an underlying personnel action were at issue, the Board \"would be placed in a position adversarial to employees whose rights it was established to adjudicate,\" thus undermining the Board's role as a neutral adjudicatory body.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527403\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/1247/#p1252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1252 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spruill v.

We review that legal question de novo.\n   <em>\n    Gilbert v. Nat'l Transp.

But the statute also suggests that the Board can function without all three members.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1203 (\"[W]hen the offices of Chairman and Vice Chairman are vacant, the remaining Board member shall perform the functions vested in the Chairman.\"). Applicable regulations interpreting those statutory provisions also contemplate action by a Board with fewer than three members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201200.2\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1200.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"If the office of the Chairman is vacant ..., then the Vice Chairman performs the Chairman's duties.\"), 1200.3(e) (\"This section applies only when at least two Board members are in office.\"). Petitioner has pointed to no legal authority suggesting that a two-member Board may not act. For those reasons, the Board's decision stands despite the vacancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Merits as to Termination and Exclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, we consider the merits of the decision with respect to the DODIG complaint. We must set aside the Board's decision on the merits if it is \"(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207703\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Cir. 2010) (declining to proceed to the clear-and-convincing-evidence test because the petitioner had not established a prima facie case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that the DODIG complaint was a protected disclosure. And the termination and exclusion were personnel actions. The key question was whether there was a relationship between the complaint and the personnel actions, more specifically, whether the complaint was a \"contributing factor\" to the personnel actions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201221\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that the DODIG complaint did not motivate the Army's decision to terminate and exclude Petitioner. The Board relied on the administrative judge's finding that the two decision-makers did not know about Petitioner's DODIG complaint when they terminated and excluded Petitioner. The Board also relied on the finding that the decision-makers lacked constructive knowledge, in that no one who was aware of the DODIG complaint influenced the decision-makers. Nor was the timing of the termination and exclusion close enough to the time when the DODIG complaint was filed so as to imply a connection. Finally, the Board relied on other factors, including the Army officials' lack of a retaliatory motive and the administrative judge's credibility conclusions. The administrative judge found the Army's witnesses to be \"highly credible, noting that each clearly and concisely answered the questions posed to them,\" whereas Petitioner testified to \"unsupported assumptions and engage[d] in unwarranted speculation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Petitioner argues that the Board ignored certain items of circumstantial evidence that, he claims, show that the decision-makers did know about his DODIG complaint.
