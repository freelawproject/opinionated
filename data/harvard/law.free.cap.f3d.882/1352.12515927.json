He further contended that his sentence could not be enhanced based on these prior convictions because they were not alleged in the indictment.

Accordingly, Deshazior's 2005 conviction for resisting an officer with violence is a conviction for a violent felony under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sexual Battery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Deshazior next argues that his 1989 conviction for sexual battery and his 1993 conviction for attempted sexual battery are not convictions for violent felonies under the ACCA's elements clause. As a provisional matter, he argues that the government failed to establish that he was convicted\n   of sexual battery in 1989 because it did not provide the judgment pertaining to that charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, he concedes that the government did properly establish that he was convicted of attempted sexual battery in 1993, and that the same ACCA analysis applies to both offenses. As a result, we need not resolve this issue, and will proceed to examine the sexual battery conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Florida sexual battery statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20794.011\">\n    Fla.

Under Florida law, this means \"contact.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   does not drive the result here because we only accepted the government's concession for purposes of that case, and because the statute under consideration regarding Deshazior's conviction also requires that the sexual battery be accomplished with the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The remaining sections of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20794.011\">\n    Fla.
