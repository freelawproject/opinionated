Petitioners challenge the denial of their claim to relief under the\n   Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). Petitioners also contest the Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") and Board of Immigration Appeals' (\"BIA\" or the \"Board\") refusal to review their request for administrative closure, a procedural tool used in immigration proceedings that temporarily removes a pending case from the Immigration Court or BIA's calendar. We hold that Petitioners' claim for relief under CAT is denied. We also hold that the IJ and the BIA erred by not reviewing Petitioners' administrative closure request, but we conclude remand is not required in this case. Accordingly, this claim is also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2009, after a traffic stop, Petitioners, as well as their two young daughters, were placed in removal proceedings for overstaying their visas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Immigration and Nationality Act (\"I.N.A.\") \u00a7 237(a)(1)(C)(i). At the family's merits hearing before the IJ in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (\"the Department\") moved to administratively close Petitioners' daughters' cases, and the IJ granted the motion. Petitioners conceded removability but sought relief. They originally requested asylum but withdrew their application because they did not meet the one-year filing deadline. Petitioners proceeded with applications for withholding of removal and protection under CAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because Petitioners believed they fell within the parameters of prosecutorial discretion, they submitted requests to the Department for administrative closure of their cases in June 2011, February 2012, August 2012 and February 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners' counsel asked the IJ to consider Petitioners' request for administrative closure, but the IJ stated the Department denied the requests and that he had \"no authority with respect to the Department's decisions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the merits hearing, Petitioner Gonzalez-Caraveo testified about his fear of returning to Mexico after living in the United States for approximately fifteen years. He stated he was afraid to return because of the general violence in Mexico and because he and his family, especially his young daughters, might be targeted because they would be perceived as having money after living in the United States for many years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner Gonzalez-Caraveo also testified about several family members who had recently been killed in Mexico. His brother, cousin, uncle, and a cousin's husband had all been killed. Although the police had started investigating at least one of the murders, the head investigator in one investigation was also murdered. Petitioner Gonzalez-Caraveo did not know the reasons for any of the murders but speculated that his uncle may have been killed because his uncle's son was a policeman. Petitioner Gonzalez-Caraveo stated he believed he and his family would face violence as well. He also testified he did not believe the Mexican police would be able to assist or protect him because of the failed murder investigations into the murders of his own family members and because police officers often cannot be trusted. Petitioners submitted various reports regarding violence in Mexico, government corruption and other country conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The IJ denied Petitioners' claims. Although the IJ found Petitioner Gonzalez-Caraveo credible, the IJ found his fear unreasonable because Petitioner Gonzalez-Caraveo continued to visit family in the area he claimed he was afraid to return. As to the withholding claim, the IJ found\n   Petitioner Gonzalez-Caraveo could not show that his life or freedom would be threatened in Mexico, on account of the two enumerated bases for persecution he raised-nationality or membership in a particular social group. Addressing the CAT claim, the IJ stated Petitioner Gonzalez-Caraveo's assertion that he might be subject to \"some random violent act in Mexico is not a proper ground for ... [CAT relief].\" Petitioners appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The BIA dismissed Petitioners' claims on appeal. The BIA affirmed the IJ's determination that Petitioners failed to establish an enumerated ground for a basis for persecution, and therefore, they could not show nexus for their persecution claim under withholding of removal. The BIA addressed the CAT claim only by stating, \"[w]e agree with the Immigration Judge that the evidence of record is insufficient to establish the likelihood of torture by, or with the consent or acquiescence of, the Mexican Government.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The BIA also rejected Petitioners' argument that the IJ violated their due process rights by not reviewing and denying their administrative closure request. The BIA concluded that the IJ correctly noted he had no jurisdiction over the administrative closure issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The BIA also rejected Petitioners' due process claim that the IJ showed bias due to certain remarks demonstrating frustration with Petitioners' counsel or abandoned his neutrality by questioning witnesses. Petitioners do not raise this claim on appeal and have waived it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cedano-Viera v.

Petitioners' Administrative Closure Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The IJ erred when he did not review Petitioners' motion for administrative closure because he thought he did not have authority over the Department's opposition to the request.\n   <em>\n    Avetisyan\n   </em>\n   clearly directs that IJs conduct their own independent assessment, considering the\n   <em>\n    Avetisyan\n   </em>\n   factors, to determine whether a request for administrative closure should be granted.\n   <em>\n    Avetisyan\n   </em>\n   , 25 I. &amp; N.

The BIA also erred when it stated that the IJ correctly noted that he had no jurisdiction over administrative closure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IJ and the BIA must independently consider whether administrative closure is warranted based on the\n   <em>\n    Avetisyan\n   </em>\n   factors, despite the Department's objection. Ordinarily, where both the IJ and the BIA erred by not independently reviewing Petitioners' administrative closure request, remand would be the appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Petitioners, however, do not make any argument that their case should be eligible for administrative closure based on the\n   <em>\n    Avetisyan\n   </em>\n   factors. Petitioners do not contend that they have any relevant, pending immigration application, petition or appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   outside of their control, such as a\n   family-based visa petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 692. Although Petitioners assert their case should be remanded because they are \"good candidates\" for prosecutorial discretion, the IJ, BIA and our court's decision is guided by the federal regulations and BIA's guidance in\n   <em>\n    Avetisyan\n   </em>\n   . In addition, for the reasons below, we deny Petitioners' remaining claim for relief-their CAT claim. Accordingly, Petitioners are no longer eligible for any form of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Petitioners also argue that the IJ and BIA violated their due process rights by failing to address their administrative closure claim. Although the IJ and BIA erred, Petitioners have not demonstrated prejudice by showing how the outcome of their proceedings may have been affected by the alleged due process violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ibarra-Flores v.

Although in practice the Department has sometimes used administrative closure as a means of prosecutorial discretion, allowing IJs or the BIA to decide whether administrative closure is warranted in a given case does not give them power over prosecutorial discretion because the IJs and BIAs must follow the\n    <em>\n     Avetisyan\n    </em>\n    factors that are based on administration and efficiency of the Immigration Courts and the BIA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    For example, a criminal appeal that challenges a conviction that is the basis for one's removal may be relevant to one's eligibility for immigration relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
