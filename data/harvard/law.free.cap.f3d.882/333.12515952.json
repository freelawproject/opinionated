SPV Osus Ltd. is the putative assignee of Optimal Strategic U.S. Equity Ltd (collectively, \"SPV\"). Optimal invested money directly with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (\"BLMIS\"). When BLMIS turned out to be a massive Ponzi scheme,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In reBernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec.

The gravamen of SPV's complaint is that UBS and Access aided and abetted BLMIS and Madoff by sponsoring, and providing support for, two European-based feeder funds- Luxalpha SICAV and Groupement Financier Ltd. SPV alleges that the feeder funds in turn channeled billions of dollars to Madoff and BLMIS, allowing them to further their fraud. SPV alleges UBS and Access were involved with the feeder funds despite being aware of numerous signs of fraudulent activity on the part of Madoff and BLMIS. Absent such assistance from UBS and Access, SPV alleges, Madoff and BLMIS could not have continued to operate their Ponzi scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   UBS removed the state court action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. SPV moved to remand. The district court denied the motion, finding federal jurisdiction proper pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides federal courts with \"original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SPV OSUS Ltd. v.

Finally, the district court granted a separate motion by the Access Defendants to dismiss the complaint against them, in relevant part, on the ground that SPV's complaint failed to adequately allege that actions by the Access Defendants proximately caused SPV's loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SPV OSUS Ltd. v.

May 26, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    SPV III\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, SPV primarily argues that the district court erred in (1) not granting SPV's motion to remand, as the instant litigation is not \"related to\" the Madoff/BLMIS bankruptcies and the federal courts lack jurisdiction; (2) finding it lacked personal jurisdiction over UBS; and (3) finding it failed to adequately plead proximate cause. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm the district court's decisions in all respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   SPV is a Bahamian corporation that alleges is it the assignee of Optimal. Optimal invested directly with BLMIS, and its last statement from BLMIS in November 2008 reported roughly $2.9 billion in its accounts. Madoff was involuntarily forced into Chapter 7 in April 2009. In June 2009 the Madoff estate was consolidated with a separate bankruptcy proceeding against BLMIS that was filed under the Securities Investor Protection Act (\"SIPA\"). The order consolidating the bankruptcy proceedings states that the consolidated estate \"shall be administered in accordance with SIPA and the Bankruptcy Code under the jurisdiction of\" the bankruptcy court, but \"the Chapter 7 Trustee shall remain Chapter 7 trustee of the Madoff estate and shall continue to have all powers, rights, claims and interests of a Chapter 7 trustee[,] ... [and] all powers, rights, claims and interests of the Madoff estate are expressly preserved ...\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2014, SPV filed suit in New York state court against UBS and AIA. SPV's suit set forth claims for aiding and abetting fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and knowing participation in a breach of trust. In essence, SPV alleges that the defendants facilitated\n   BLMIS's fraud by moving billions of dollars from European investors to BLMIS by providing support to the Luxalpha and Groupement feeder funds. SPV alleges that by supporting the feeder funds, UBS and Access provided Madoff and BLMIS with a veneer of credibility that gave investors confidence in their decision to invest with Madoff and BLMIS, allowing the fraud to continue. SPV also alleges that UBS ignored certain \"red flags\" indicating Madoff and BLMIS were engaged in fraud, and continued to service the feeder funds so that it might pocket fees. All the while, SPV alleges, UBS protected itself and its clients by not marketing or recommending Madoff funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   UBS AG is a Swiss entity with its principal place of business in Switzerland. The remaining UBS entities were, at all times relevant, Luxembourg entities with their principal places of business in Luxembourg. Luxalpha was organized and located in Luxembourg; Groupement was organized and located in the British Virgin Islands. SPV alleges that it pleaded sufficient contacts to allow the exercise of personal jurisdiction by virtue of the UBS entities' contacts with New York related to their interactions with the Luxalpha and Groupement feeder funds. SPV also sued AIA LLC; Access International Advisors Ltd.; Access Partners (Suisse) S.A.; Access Management Luxembourg S.A.; Access Partners S.A. (Luxembourg); and Patrick Littaye (together, the \"Access Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As described above, the district court denied SPV's motion to remand the matter to state court, then granted separate motions to dismiss the complaint. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Appellate Jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   SPV's notice of appeal designates its appeal as both from the judgment and from orders entered on July 21, 2015, July 24, 2015, May 26, 2016 and May 27, 2016. This list does not include the order and opinion denying the motion to remand. UBS argues that the failure to specify the remand order in the notice of appeal strips this Court of jurisdiction to consider an appeal from that order. We need not linger long over the issue, because even assuming arguendo that SPV waived its right to appeal, the denial of a motion to remand goes to this Court's subject matter jurisdiction, which may be raised at any time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (\"MTBE\") Prod.

A claim need not be certain to provide a federal court with jurisdiction: \"contingent outcomes can satisfy the 'conceivable effects' test, so long as there is the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of an effect on the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The gravamen of SPV's complaint is that defendants are joint tortfeasors with Madoff and BLMIS, which, if proven, would provide defendants with a putative contribution claim, to be asserted in the bankruptcy proceedings. SPV urges us to find that the district court erred in denying its motion to remand to state court because it erroneously found that UBS's potential contribution claims sufficiently \"related to\" the Madoff/BLMIS bankruptcy proceedings to support federal jurisdiction. SPV contends that UBS's potential claims are too remote from the bankruptcy proceedings to have any effect on the estates, making the exercise of federal jurisdiction improper. SPV argues that UBS's potential claim for contribution in the bankruptcy proceedings is illusory, primarily because (1) the bar date to assert claims against the Madoff and BLMIS estates expired, barring UBS from pursuing any claim in the bankruptcy proceeding; and (2) in any event, there is not enough money in either estate to pay out any such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We agree with the district court that the failure to file claims prior to the bar date is not fatal to the potential claims at issue here. Bankruptcy courts are permitted to accept late proofs of claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re PT-1 Commc'ns, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9132524\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/292/482/#p489\">\n    292 B.R. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2003) (allowing filing of late claim where claimant did not know claim existed until after the bar date lapsed). Unlike indemnification claims, contribution claims do not accrue until after liability is established. A party may not know of a potential contribution claim until sued, which may be years after bankruptcy proceedings have commenced. For example, here SPV sued UBS nearly five-and-half years after the SIPA bar date. This lack of notice forms, at a minimum, a\n   credible basis for defendants to petition the bankruptcy court for leave to file a late proof of claim based on excusable neglect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006(b)(1) (bankruptcy court may allow late proof of claim \"where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Conversely, \"[a]n indemnification right arises at the time the indemnification agreement is executed, and it constitutes a claim under the Bankruptcy Code even if the act giving rise to indemnification has not yet occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Oct. 19, 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Excusable neglect does not excuse the failure to file proof of claim for an indemnification liability by the bar date, such that the claim could not have any \"conceivable effect\" on the estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204965150\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sealink Funding Ltd. v.

Oct. 9, 2012) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, it is unclear whether the applicable bar date has passed. While a bar date was set and has passed in the SIPA action involving the BLMIS estate, no bar date was set in the Madoff estate. The consolidation order states only that the combined estate \"shall be administered in accordance with SIPA and the Bankruptcy Code.\" If the SIPA bar date controls, as SPV argues, it cannot be waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lehman Bros., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178878\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/493/437/#p443\">\n    493 B.R. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 443 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2013) (noting that unlike proceedings under bankruptcy chapters 7 and 11, a court lacks discretion to extend the bar date in SIPA cases, with several exceptions inapplicable here).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We need not resolve the issue of which bar date controls. Even if the bar date set in the SIPA estate controls, simply settling the issue of whether a late claim is allowable would likely have an effect on the estate. Any attempt to file a late claim would result in the estate incurring costs. As the district court noted, even unsuccessful claims require evaluation by the trustee, who recovers fees for such work from the estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) (trustee charged with \"examin[ing] proofs of claims and object[ing] to the allowance of any claim that is improper\"); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78fff(e) (\"[a]ll costs and expenses of administration of the estate of the debtor ... shall be borne by the general estate of the debtor.\").

If the money stopped flowing into BLMIS, such that the fraudulent scheme would have collapsed much sooner, staunching OSUS's losses. The link between the Access Defendants' actions (or inactions) and the harm suffered by OSUS is simply too attenuated to constitute proximate cause. As the district court pointed out, \"if any entity that injected massive sums into BLMIS could be said to have aided and abetted Madoff's Ponzi scheme, OSUS, which plaintiff claims invested $1.6 billion in BLMIS, would presumably be subject to liability on the same theory.\"\n   <em>\n    SPV III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203039192\">\n    2016 WL 3039192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cromer Fin.

Neither theory can salvage SPV's claims. The first alternate theory is that the Access Defendants, through misleading marketing materials, aided and abetted the BLMIS fraud by providing BLMIS an \"air of legitimacy.\" Appellant's Br. at 64. SPV points to nothing showing OSUS relied on the marketing materials provided by the Access Defendants, was aware of the Access Defendants or even knew of the feeder funds at issue. As noted above, OSUS invested with BLMIS directly, and its investments began before the feeder funds were created. SPV's second alternate theory is that the Access Defendants are liable because they failed to notify \"the world at large and international investors in particular\" of BLMIS's fraud. Appellant's Br. at 59.
