It found that cylinder failure leads to three principal effects: (1) substantial reduction in engine horsepower of about 20%; (2) increased engine vibration, which can cause stress on aircraft components and in-flight fires; and (3) in twin-engine planes, asymmetric drag. Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,978 -80, 52,983-85. Each possible effect makes airplane takeoff, climbing, and cruising more difficult and less safe.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The FAA concluded that AEC63 cylinder assemblies present a \"hazardous\" risk in the event of failure (the second highest rating). This conclusion was supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Airmotive's evidentiary challenges to the \"hazardous\" determination are unpersuasive. It does not contest that a 20% reduction in engine power may result from cylinder failure, and this finding is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,979 -80. Instead, Airmotive maintains that the FAA has not documented how a 20% reduction in engine power creates a \"hazardous\" condition when other FAA risk guidelines define partial power loss as a \"minor\" event.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'rs' Br. 21-22, 24, 26 (citing FAA, Small Airplane Risk Analysis Handbook, at 10-12 (Sept. 30, 2010); FAA, Engine &amp; Propeller Directorate, Continued Airworthiness Assessment Process Handbook, at 25 (Sept. 23, 2010); FAA, Risk Assessment for Reciprocating Engine Airworthiness Directives, at 3 (May 24, 1999) ). Airmotive also points to record evidence that when AEC63 cylinder assemblies have failed, pilots were able to land the plane safely. This challenge simply overlooks that the FAA has many analytical tools to carry out its statutory mandate, such that an event may be characterized as \"minor\" in one context while contributing to a \"hazardous\" determination in another. Airmotive's reliance on these other FAA guidelines does not advance its position. Indeed, in responding to comments, the FAA acknowledged that while one of its risk assessment policies classifies service problems that do not result in a significant power loss as minor, it had found that a 20% reduction in engine power translates into a 40% reduction in airplane rate of climb and constitutes a hazardous condition, not a \"minor\" condition.

Reg. at 52,979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Airmotive's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of asymmetric thrust to support a \"hazardous\" determination betrays a similar misunderstanding. The airworthiness directive refers to a 2002 NTSB report on a plane crash in which one cylinder of a twin-engine plane failed, resulting in asymmetric thrust as to the other engine, which was left to carry the entire load. NTSB, Factual Report-Aviation, at 1d (Sept. 2, 2002) (ID: NYC02FA178) (citing an FAA Airplane Flying Handbook). Airmotive's point is that \"the NTSB report, at most, supports a conclusion that the failure of an\n   <em>\n    entire engine\n   </em>\n   in a twin-engine airplane-not the failure of one of the six cylinders in the engine-could result in an asymmetric thrust condition.\" Pet'rs' Br. 25. This simply overlooks that in the FAA's judgment, \"[a] cylinder separating from its engine is\n   an engine failure.\" Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n    81 Fed.

Based on an FAA graph of AEC63 cylinder separations, the failure count should be 23. Using those numbers, the average failure rate would be 0.62 in 1,000, significantly lower than the FAA's calculation. Airmotive fights with the FAA's chosen methodology to assess likelihood based on past production and operational data without explaining why doing so is suspect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n    at 52,983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Tellingly, Airmotive misreads the FAA explanation of the data on which it relies. The FAA estimated about 35 percent of the total population of 43,000 AEC63 cylinders would be removed from service based on a prior airworthiness directive, leaving approximately 28,000 cylinders. Resp't's Br. 38. A chart listing 33 confirmed cylinder separations included four that were addressed in a prior airworthiness directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Excerpt, FAA-Assessed List of Airmotive Separations, at tbl.1 (Sept. 20, 2013) (\"2013 Excerpt\"); Resp't's Br. 38 n.12 (referencing Airworthiness Dir.; Engine Components Inc. (ECi) Reciprocating Engine Cylinders,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Fed.%20Reg.%2021%2C049\">\n    69 Fed. Reg. 21,049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Apr. 20, 2004) ). The ultimate resulting calculation is a 1 in 1,000 failure rate. Although a graph shows 23 (not 29) cylinder separations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2013 Excerpt at fig.4, the disparity is explained in the notation accompanying figure 4 that\n   the FAA subsequently determined some excluded separations should have been included. In any event, Airmotive's own technical report, as a practical matter, undercuts its numbers objection, for its report stated the airworthiness directive \"could affect as many as 27,000 cylinders,\" which had \"experienced 29 confirmed head-to-barrel separations.\" Airmotive 2013 Technical Report, at 7, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because the record shows that the FAA's calculation of the safety of AEC63 cylinders was based on a proper application of the Order 8040.4A methodology and is supported by substantial evidence, absent more specific data as would identify fundamental error casting doubt on the FAA's conclusion, Airmotive fails to show that the case should be remanded for the FAA to conduct a new risk assessment. We conclude that Airmotive fails to show fundamental error and that it is necessary only to address the following challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Airmotive responds to the FAA's calculation that AEC63 cylinders fail at a rate 32 times higher than those of the original manufacturer,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 52,978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by maintaining that a comparative approach runs afoul of a purported requirement that airworthiness directives are to be based on an individualized determination. By this we understand Airmotive to mean that absent evidence specific to AEC63 cylinders, the FAA lacked substantial evidence to support its directive. But FAA regulations require that it determine whether the unsafe condition \"is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2039.5\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 39.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Comparative information is relevant if for no other reason than that AEC63 cylinder assemblies are a replacement part. The FAA reasonably considered a comparison between the original and replacement parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   No more availing is Airmotive's view that the FAA's reliance on two fatal airplane accidents was improper because neither crash involved AEC63 cylinders and neither crash was caused by faulty cylinders alone. The FAA's reliance on the crash reports was reasonable because they too provided relevant information showing that failed cylinders created dangerous situations that at least partially caused forced plane landings that resulted in fatalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,983 -84. So too, the FAA reasonably considered Airmotive's ongoing efforts to improve its manufacturing process. The data showed a major decrease in failure rates after Airmotive's 2009 design improvements to AEC63 cylinders, supporting the FAA's finding that older AEC63 cylinders suffered from design problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, Airmotive maintains that the FAA ignored public comments stating that the risks posed by replacing faulty cylinders are greater than those posed by the faulty cylinders themselves. The FAA's \"regulatory framework presumes that maintenance will be performed correctly by experienced personnel authorized by the FAA.\" Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 52,981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This presumption was unrebutted by record evidence. The FAA noted that it \"had not observed any negative effects on safety due to removal of these cylinder assemblies during maintenance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the FAA had previously required cylinder replacement, Airmotive pointed to no evidence of safety or other problems stemming from the requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In sum, the FAA gathered the record evidence over a period of years, with multiple rounds of public comment, on the safety risks posed by AEC63 cylinder assemblies. Its \"unsafe condition\" determination was based on a proper application of the FAA 8040.4A methodology and is supported by substantial evidence in the record on cylinder assembly failures, including a far higher rate of AEC63 failures\n   than the cylinders manufactured by the original manufacturer, notwithstanding Airmotive's emphasis on the absence of certain evidence specific to AEC63 cylinders and the infrequency of some evidence of the harmful consequences of cylinder assembly failures, such as in-flight fires and cylinder failure resulting in fatalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schoenbohm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672925,11468726\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/243/\">\n    204 F.3d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
