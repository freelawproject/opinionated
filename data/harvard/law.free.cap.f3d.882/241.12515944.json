BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We rehearse the facts as found by the district court at the suppression hearing, consistent with record support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691177\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/13/#p15\">\n    609 F.3d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 (1st Cir. 2010). For some years, Paul Wolf, a DEA agent, had been on the trail of a major drug dealer known to him only as \"Champagne.\" Though Champagne proved elusive, Wolf finally got a lead indicating that he was in fact a man named Todd Rasberry. With the help of a cooperating source, Wolf was able to track down one of Rasberry's accomplices while she was making drug deliveries in Portland, Maine. When Wolf confronted the accomplice, she surrendered the heroin she was carrying and told Wolf that he would find Rasberry, along with more drugs, at a motel room she had rented in Scarborough, Maine. The accomplice gave Wolf a key to the room and consented to its search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accompanied by other officers (federal and local), Wolf proceeded to the motel where Rasberry was allegedly ensconced. The officers knew that Rasberry had a criminal history including drug and weapons charges, and he had been arrested only a few months earlier at a party where guns were present. As a result, the officers were armed and wore ballistic vests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the officers arrived at the motel, Wolf tried the room key that he had been given, but discovered that it did not work. Once he knocked, though, Rasberry opened the door and acknowledged that he was a guest in the motel room (which had been rented by the woman with whom Wolf had spoken). The officers told Rasberry that they were there to search the premises and that, although he was not under arrest, he would be detained while they conducted the search. One officer placed Rasberry's hands behind his back and handcuffed him; he then patted down only the portion of Rasberry's lower back that Rasberry might be able to reach despite being handcuffed. Two other officers, with weapons drawn, conducted a sweep of the premises to make certain that nobody else was present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For roughly twenty minutes, the officers searched the motel room with great care. They found plastic sandwich bags, needles, and a digital scale, but no drugs. With the search winding down, Rasberry asked if the handcuffs could be removed. Wolf replied that before he could remove the handcuffs, he had to make sure that Rasberry did not have a weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As Wolf performed a pat-down, he felt (in the groin area of Rasberry's shorts) a hard, round object about the size of a softball. Wolf inquired as to the nature of the object, and Rasberry responded that it was part of his anatomy. At that point, Wolf-confident that the object was not part of Rasberry's anatomy but, rather, was contraband-placed Rasberry under arrest. Reaching into Rasberry's undershorts, Wolf extracted a ball of baggies containing what appeared to be controlled substances. A field test subsequently confirmed that some of the baggies contained heroin and others contained cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In due course, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Maine returned a three-count indictment against Rasberry for various controlled substance offenses. Rasberry moved to suppress the drugs seized from his person, arguing that the search and seizure had violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend. IV. The district court held a hearing at which Wolf and his three fellow officers testified. The district court took the matter under advisement and later denied the motion to suppress. In its order, the court held, in substance, that what\n   had transpired constituted a lawful\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop; that placing Rasberry in handcuffs was reasonably necessary to ensure the officers' safety; and that the duration of the detention was reasonable because the officers were diligently searching the room during that interval. Finally, the court upheld the seizure of the drugs from Rasberry's undershorts on alternative grounds: first, the court adopted the argument, put forward by the government, that the drugs were lawfully seized under the \"plain feel\" doctrine; and second, the court concluded that, in light of the totality of the circumstances, the officers had probable cause to arrest Rasberry, search him incident to his arrest, and seize the drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rasberry proceeded to enter a conditional guilty plea,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2), to a single count of possession of heroin with intent to distribute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). After accepting Rasberry's conditional plea (explicitly preserving Rasberry's right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion), the district court imposed a 138-month term of immurement. The government then dismissed the other two counts of the indictment, and this timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our standard of review is familiar. Ultimate constitutional determinations with respect to issues such as reasonable suspicion and probable cause engender de novo review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ornelas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746351\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/690/#p699\">\n    517 U.S. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746351\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/690/#p699\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746351\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/690/#p699\">\n    134 L.Ed.2d 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) ;\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Espinoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477653\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/490/41/#p46\">\n    490 F.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (1st Cir. 2007). And while the district court's other conclusions of law are also reviewed de novo, its factual findings must be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chhien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497738\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1/#p5\">\n    266 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5 (1st Cir. 2001). Determinations about witness credibility are inherently fact-based and, thus, are peculiarly within the competence of the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baldacchino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366292\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/170/#p175\">\n    762 F.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175 (1st Cir. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a practical matter, Rasberry's asseverational array can be divided into four parts. First, he asserts that his detention in the motel room exceeded the lawful scope of a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop. Second, he asserts that the pat-down during which the softball-sized object was discovered was conducted without reasonable suspicion. Third, he asserts that the seizure of the softball-sized object was not justified under the \"plain feel\" doctrine. Fourth, he asserts that the search of his undershorts was so invasive that it offended both his dignity and his right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment. We examine these assertions one by one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Scope of the Stop\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Fourth Amendment guarantees \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Instead, Rasberry's challenge to the lawfulness of the stop focuses on the events that subsequently transpired. He submits that the behavior of the officers (such as placing him in handcuffs and brandishing weapons) and the duration of the stop (about twenty minutes) pushed the stop past the boundaries of a lawful\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop and combined to transmogrify the stop into a de facto arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In this case, the distinction between a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop and a de facto arrest is of decretory significance.

At the same time, the officers made it clear to Rasberry that he was not under arrest but, rather, was simply being detained while they searched the room.

In this instance, the full pat-down was preceded by an initial frisk some twenty minutes earlier. The district court found, however, that the initial frisk was confined to the area of Rasberry's lower back. This finding is consistent with the officers' testimony at the suppression hearing, and it is not clearly erroneous.

The court-following the government's lead-invoked the \"plain feel\" doctrine, under which a police officer can seize an object if, by touch, its incriminating character is \"immediately apparent.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schiavo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840571\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/6/#p9\">\n    29 F.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12205\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/366/#p375\">\n    508 U.S. at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12205\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/366/#p375\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, the doctrine permits an officer who conducts a lawful pat-down of a suspect's outer clothing to seize an object if its incriminating character is immediately apparent by touch alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Rasberry argues that, due to the plastic packaging surrounding the drugs, the incriminating nature of the object in his shorts could not have been immediately apparent to Wolf. This argument has a patina of plausibility, but we need not address it: the seizure is fully justified on the alternative ground elaborated by the district court. Consequently, we turn to that alternative ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court held that the totality of the circumstances known to Wolf at the time of the pat-down gave him probable cause to arrest Rasberry and, thus, allowed him to seize the softball-sized object incident to Rasberry's arrest.

In the motel room, the officers' search revealed accoutrements of the drug trade (specifically, plastic baggies, needles, and a digital scale), giving rise to a plausible inference that a drug-distribution operation was afoot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fermin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4291263\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/71/\">\n    771 F.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79 n.6 (1st Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The officers had been told by Rasberry's accomplice that there were drugs in the motel room and, after scouring the room in vain, the only place that had not yet been searched was Rasberry's person. While patting Rasberry down, Wolf came across a suspicious object in Rasberry's undershorts-an object that Wolf reasonably suspected contained drugs. This suspicion was heightened by Wolf's knowledge that drug dealers frequently conceal drugs in their undergarments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cofield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139738\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/334/\">\n    391 F.3d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing how suspects often hide drugs in their underwear). When Rasberry was asked directly about the softball-sized object, he responded with an obvious lie. A suspect's blatant prevarication in response to an officer's queries can support an inference of probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699475\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/48/#p57\">\n    500 F.3d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (1st Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To say more would be to paint the lily. Here, a host of factors pointed unerringly to a reasonable inference that Rasberry was hiding drugs in his skivvies. In the circumstances at hand, the district court did not err in finding that Wolf had probable cause to arrest Rasberry and to seize the softball-sized object incident to his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Intrusiveness Claim\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Rasberry makes a final argument: that the search of his undershorts was overly invasive and degrading and, thus, abridged his Fourth Amendment rights. Because this argument is raised for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Madsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058231\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/712/#p717\">\n    809 F.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717 (1st Cir. 2016). Plain error is plainly absent here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The reasonableness of an invasive search depends on whether the totality of the circumstances justifies the degree of the intrusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Roche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840434\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/142/#p146\">\n    659 F.3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146 (1st Cir. 2011) ;\n   <em>\n    Cofield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139738\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/334/\">\n    391 F.3d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To justify a search of a particularly\n   intimate area, an officer must, at a minimum, have reasonable suspicion that the person detained is hiding contraband there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3168287\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/58/#p62\">\n    506 F.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (1st Cir. 2007). Wolf-having just encountered a suspicious object near Rasberry's groin-had excellent reason to think that Rasberry had contraband hidden in his undershorts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although extracting the softball-sized object was, in Wolf's phrase, \"awkward,\" there is no evidence that the extraction was conducted in a needlessly degrading or humiliating fashion.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swain\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959095\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/1/#p6\">\n    117 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (1st Cir. 1997) (finding strip search of female detainee in front of male officers unconstitutional). Wolf and Rasberry were of the same gender and Wolf withdrew the softball-sized object in the privacy of a motel room, allowing Rasberry to remain clothed as he did so. It was Rasberry's decision to hide contraband in such an intimate location, and the seizure was performed in a reasonable manner. No more was exigible to keep Rasberry's Fourth Amendment rights inviolate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We need go no further. Rasberry's appeal yields only bitter fruit and, therefore, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Affirmed\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
