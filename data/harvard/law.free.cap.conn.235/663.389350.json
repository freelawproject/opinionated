Underlying the appeal are two foreclosure actions with respect to the same real property in East Lyme. One, <em>Angus McDonald/Gary Sharpe &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glen Lakes Realty, </em>involved the foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien. The other, <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Meadow </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Lakes Realty </em>Co., involved a mortgage foreclosure. The two actions were consolidated for trial in order to resolve competing claims of priority between the two liens. In the mortgage foreclosure action, a motion to substitute ALI, Inc. (ALI), as the plaintiff was granted because New England Savings Bank, through the United States comptroller of the currency, had transferred and set over to ALI the subject mortgage deed and note for $400,000. ALI also was substituted for New England Savings Bank in the mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure action in which the bank was named as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On September 13, 1994, during a trial on the merits of the foreclosure actions, the trial court ruled that the mechanic\u2019s lien held by Angus McDonald/Gary Sharpe and Associates, Inc. (Associates), was invalid<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ordered it discharged. Thereafter, the court proceeded with the trial in order to determine the total amount due ALI on its mortgage note, set the law days and award various fees. On September 26, Associates filed a notice of reservation of right to appeal the discharge of its mechanic\u2019s lien pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 24, the trial court rendered a judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>strict foreclosure in favor of ALI. As part of that judgment, the court set law days and awarded counsel fees, a title search fee and appraisal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">On November 9, 1994, Associates appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of discharge of its mechanic\u2019s hen. On November 18, 1994, ALI moved to dismiss Associates\u2019 appeal, claiming that the appeal had not been timely filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>35c (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appellate Court, without comment, granted ALI\u2019s motion to dismiss on December 14,1994.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted Associates\u2019 petition for certification limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly dismiss this appeal for untimeliness?\u201d <em>Angus McDonald/Gary Sharpe &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glen Lakes Realty, </em>232 Conn. 915, 655 A.2d 259 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">For purposes of our review of the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal of Associates\u2019 appeal, we assume that the Appellate Court based its dismissal on the only grounds alleged in ALI\u2019s motion to dismiss, i.e., that Associates\u2019 appeal was not timely filed within the seven day time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>period mandated by \u00a7 49-35c (b). ALI claims that even though Associates\u2019 hen was discharged during a trial on the merits and not as a result of a pretrial apphcation or motion, the seven day appeal period of \u00a7 49-35c (b) is applicable. We disagree with ALI and with the AppeUate Court\u2019s dismissal of Associates\u2019 appeal. We conclude that Associates\u2019 appeal is not controhedby \u00a7 49-35c and, therefore, should not have been dismissed for failure to adhere to the seven day time limitation contained in \u00a7 49-35c (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Section 49-35c (b) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[n]o appeal may be taken from <em>the order </em>[discharging a mechanic\u2019s hen] except within seven days thereof.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 49-35c (a) limits the applicability of \u00a7 49-35c (b) to \u201corder[s] entered as provided in subsection (b) of section 49-35b . . . .\u201d The plain language of \u00a7 49-35c (a) and (b), therefore, manifests the legislative intent that the seven day time limit apply only to orders entered pursuant to \u00a7 49-35b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 49-35b, in turn, refers back to \u201chearingfs] held on the apphcation or motion set forth in section 49-35a . . . .\u201d Sequentially, \u00a7 49-35a (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides: \u201cWhenever one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>more mechanics\u2019 liens are placed upon any real estate . . . the owner of the real estate, if no action to foreclose the hen is then pending before any court, may make application, together with a proposed order and summons, to the superior court for the judicial district in which the lien may be foreclosed under the provisions of section 51-345, or to any judge thereof, that a hearing or hearings be held to determine whether the lien or liens should be discharged or reduced. ...\u201d Similarly, if an action to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien is already pending, a party may seek a pretrial adjudication of the validity of the lien under \u00a7 49-35a (c), which provides: \u201cIf an action for foreclosure of the hen is pending before any court, any party to that action may at any time prior to trial, unless an apphcation under subsection (a) of this section has previously been ruled upon, move that the lien be discharged or reduced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Section 49-35a (a) and (c) provide for a pretrial determination of probable cause to establish the validity of a mechanic\u2019s hen on the apphcation of the owner of the liened real estate or on the motion of any party. The court may deny an apphcation for the discharge of a mechanic\u2019s hen if probable cause to sustain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>validity of the lien is established at the pretrial hearing. The court may also order the lien discharged if probable cause is not established or if the hen\u2019s invalidity is established by clear and convincing evidence. See General Statutes \u00a7 49-35b (b). This pretrial procedure allows for a prompt and relatively inexpensive pretrial determination of the validity of a mechanic\u2019s hen prior to the trial of a foreclosure action. See <em>Pero Building Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 Conn. App. 180, 183, 504 A.2d 524 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In this case, no motion or apphcation pursuant to \u00a7 49-35a to discharge the mechanic\u2019s hen was made before trial. The entire statutory scheme on which ALI rehes, however, is directed to and intended to apply only to the pretrial adjudication of the validity of a mechanic\u2019s lien, and is wholly inapplicable to the discharge of a mechanic\u2019s hen as part and parcel of a full trial on the merits of a foreclosure as was the case here. We conclude, therefore, that the seven day time limit in \u00a7 49-35c (b) is inapplicable under the present circumstances. Accordingly, Associates\u2019 appeal should not have been dismissed on the ground that it was filed after the expiration of the mandatory seven day time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">ALI raises in this court for the first time the argument that even if the seven day period of \u00a7 49-35c (b) is inapplicable to Associates\u2019 appeal, the appeal should have been dismissed as untimely because it was not filed within the twenty day time limit provided by Practice Book \u00a7 4009. This twenty day appeal period is applicable \u201cexcept where a different period is provided by statute.\u201d We have previously held that the twenty day time limit of \u00a7 4009, in contrast to many statutory time limits, does not implicate a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 761-62, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993). Enforcement of the twenty day limit is, therefore, within the discretion of the court before which the appeal is pending. We decline to decide an issue properly within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Appellate Court\u2019s discretion with which that court was never presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\"> The court declared that the lien was invalid because it did not adequately describe the property that was subject to the lien; General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 (1) (A); because the lien was placed on one parcel based upon work done on another parcel; see <em>DeWolf </em>v. <em>Bonee, </em>91 Conn. 712, 101 A. 233 (1917); because at least part of the lien was for work performed without the consent of the record owner in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (a); see <em>Centerbrook, Architects &amp; Planners </em>v. <em>Laurel Nursing Services, </em>Inc., 224 Conn. 580, 591, 620 A.2d 127 (1993); and because of the potential conflict of interest of Angus McDonald who served as both a partner and a potential creditor of Associates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4002 provides: \u201cAppeal from Judgment Disposing of Part of Issues</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">\u201c(a) A judgment pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) of this rule that disposes of certain of the issues between the parties or of part or all of the issues between some of them may be treated as a final judgment for the purpose of an appeal by the party or parties against whom the judgment is rendered, notwithstanding that the cause remains undisposed of on other issues or as to other parties.
