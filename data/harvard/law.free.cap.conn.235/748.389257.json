On the evening of February 27, 1992, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>ant, along with three others, Ryan Myers,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Richard Smith and Andre Rogers, was in Roberto Clemente Park in New Haven. The defendant, Myers and Smith wore black clothing with black or purple hoods. Rogers, in contrast, wore a turquoise \u201cMiami Dolphins\u201d jacket and a baseball hat; he was not wearing a hood. That same evening, the victim, Edward Sebastian Moore, and his friend, Charles Stevenson, were in the park selling cocaine. Rogers walked past Moore and Stevenson and exited the park. The defendant, Myers and Smith remained in the park until Moore and Stevenson walked out, at which time the defendant and the two others, all of whom wore masks, robbed and shot them. Moore, who was shot in his right knee and chest, was killed. Stevenson was only grazed in the left leg by a bullet.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant was charged in a four count substitute information with felony murder, robbery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit robbeiy in the first degree and attempted assault in the first degree. Additional facts will be presented as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The first issue on appeal that we consider is whether the defendant was in custody during his interrogation when he implicated himself in Moore\u2019s murder. The trial court found the following facts pertaining to this issue. Two days after the murder, two plainclothes detectives, Joseph Greene and James Ponteau, of the New Haven police department, went to the defendant\u2019s home, where he was on supervised home release, in order to inquire about an unrelated robbery that had occurred in the vicinity of the park on the same night as the murder. After speaking with the detectives for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>about five minutes, the defendant agreed to go with them to the police station in order to be questioned further. They rode to the police station in an unmarked car, with the defendant sitting alone in the back seat. Upon arriving at the station, they went to an interrogation room on the third floor, where the defendant was interrogated in a closed room. Without receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the defendant was first questioned about the unrelated robbery. Those questions and answers were not recorded. Once the questioning turned to the murder case, the defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He waived his rights, continued to answer questions, and implicated himself in the crimes with which he was charged in the murder case. He placed himself in the park on the night of the murder<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and stated that he was wearing black clothing and a hood, as he usually did.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That portion of the interroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>tion was recorded and transcribed and, subsequently, signed by the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress his statement on the grounds that his rights under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to the United States constitution had been violated. He argued, inter alia, that because he was in custody when the interrogation began, and had not first been provided with <em>Miranda </em>warnings, his entire statement should be suppressed, including the portion he gave after receiving <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>warnings, because that portion was the product of a prior unwarned and, therefore, inadmissible statement. The trial court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that he \u201cwas not at any time in custody, he was at all times free to leave. And a reasonable person under the circumstances would not have believed that he was not free to leave. Therefore the giving of the <em>Miranda </em>[w]arnings was not necessary; but they were given, they were understood, and they were waived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court\u2019s finding that he was not in custody at any point during the interrogation, and, therefore, was not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings, is not supported by substantial evidence. The defendant argues alternatively that either he was in custody from the beginning of the interrogation or that the interrogation became custodial once questioning turned to the murder case. Because he was in custody, he asserts that the statement that he gave prior to receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which included information impheating him in the murder,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> should have been suppressed. Furthermore, the defendant claims that if this court agrees that he was in custody and that the statement he provided prior to receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings should have been suppressed, this court should then, as a matter of state, rather than federal, constitutional law, reject the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>supra, 470 U.S. 298,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and conclude that the transcribed state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ment that he furnished after the warnings had been given should also have been suppressed. Because we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not in custody, we do not reach the <em>Elstad </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\u201cTwo threshold conditions must be satisfied in order to invoke the warnings constitutionally required by <em>Miranda: </em>(1) the defendant must have been in custody; and (2) the defendant must have been subjected to police interrogation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>[384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L.

Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1983)], \u2018[although the circumstances of each case must certainly influence a determination of whether a suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of receiving <em>Miranda </em>protection, the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u201d of the degree associated with a formal arrest. <em>[Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.

Ed. 2d 383 (1995). \u201cFurther, the United States Supreme Court has adopted an objective, reasonable person test for determining whether a defendant is in custody. . . . Thus, in determining whether <em>Miranda </em>rights are required, <em>the only relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would believe that he or she was in police custody of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DesLaurier, </em>supra, 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Furthermore, we note that \u201c[n]o definitive list of factors governs a determination of whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have believed that he or she was in custody. Because, however, the <em>Miranda </em>court expressed concern with protecting defendants against interrogations that take place in a \u2018police-dominated atmosphere\u2019 containing \u2018inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely\u2019; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 384 U.S. [467]; circumstances relating to those kinds of concerns are highly relevant on the custody issue. See generally C. Whitebread &amp; C. Slobogin, Criminal Procedure (3d Ed. 1993) \u00a7 16.03, pp. 385-91; 1 W. LaFave &amp; J.

The trial court\u2019s determination of the historical circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interrogation are findings of fact; id.; which will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 652, 469 A.2d 1189 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 292, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982); see Practice Book \u00a7 4061. In order to determine the ultimate issue of custody, however, we will conduct a scrupulous examination of the record; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 267-68, 533 A.2d 545 (1987); in order to ascertain whether, in light of the totality of circumstances, the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>supra, 606; <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 580, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>197 Conn. 180, 185, 496 A.2d 486 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we conclude that there is substantial evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had failed to prove that he was in custody when Greene and Ponteau interrogated him on February 29, 1992. The defendant was transported to the police station by those two plainclothes detectives in an unmarked vehicle after he had voluntarily agreed to accompany them. He was neither handcuffed nor arrested. The detectives did not display or threaten to use force, nor did they show their weapons. At the police station, the defendant was led to an interrogation room, where the door was closed but not locked. He was permitted to leave that room to use the bathroom unaccompanied. The defendant was at no time during this interrogation detained in the police station against his will. In fact, the detectives testified that he could stop responding to their questions and be driven home at any time. Indeed, the defendant testified that he understood that he would be brought home after the interrogation. He never indicated, however, any desire to terminate the interrogation or to go home.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Furthermore, the concerns of <em>Miranda </em>are not implicated in this case. The detectives did not take advantage of the inherently coercive situation that an interrogation inheres. They did not threaten or force the defendant to respond to their questions nor trick him in any way. Therefore, because a review of the facts in the record indicates that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s situation would not have believed that his movement was restricted to a degree that is associated with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>formal arrest, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not in custody when he was interrogated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion in granting, over his objection, the state\u2019s pretrial motion to consolidate the two cases against him in a single trial. The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. Pending trial, the defendant was detained in the New Haven correctional center, from which he, along with his cellmate, Percell Blakeney, escaped on February 1, 1993. Having acquired forged medical passes, the defendant and Blakeney, armed with a \u201cshank,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> left their cell and, after assaulting correction officer Lawrence Bellamy, stole his keys and escaped from the prison. The defendant was recaptured the next morning and confessed to escaping. He was charged in a three count substitute information with escape in the first degree, assault in the second degree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>and possession of a weapon in a correctional institution. Thereafter, the state\u2019s motion to join the murder and escape cases for trial was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The defendant argues on appeal that the trial court incorrectly granted the state\u2019s motion because \u201c[t]he risk that the jury would improperly use the evidence of the escape to establish the murder, or that the defendant\u2019s rights would be otherwise prejudiced, was great . . . [and therefore] the defendant suffered substantial prejudice and . . . [was denied] a fair trial.\u201d We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in consolidating these two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 54-57 and Practice Book \u00a7 829<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> expressly authorize a trial court to order a defendant to be tried jointly on charges arising separately. In deciding whether to sever informations joined for trial, the trial court enjoys broad discretion, which, in the absence of manifest abuse, an appellate court may not disturb. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>209 Conn. 458, 463, 551 A.2d 1231 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 67-68, 530 A.2d 155 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 720-21, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>188 Conn. 406, 410-11, 450 A.2d 356 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>187 Conn. 292, 299, 445 A.2d 901 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jonas, </em>169 Conn. 566, 570, 363 A.2d 1378 (1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 923, 96 S.

Ed. 2d 331 (1976)[Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Book \u00a7 828].<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The defendant bears a heavy burden of showing that the denial of severance resulted in substantial injustice, and that any resulting prejudice was beyond the curative power of the court\u2019s instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 721, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 302; <em>State </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>139 Conn. 234, 240, 93 A.2d 154 (1952). <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 94-95, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989). [Wjhether a joint trial will be substantially prejudicial to the rights of the defendant . . . means something more than that a joint trial will be less than advantageous to the defendant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>216 Conn. 647, 657-58, 583 A.2d 915 (1990); accord State v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 94-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">We recognize that an improper joinder may expose a defendant to potential prejudice for three reasons. \u201cFirst, when several charges have been made against the defendant, the jury may consider that a person charged with doing so many things is a bad [person] who must have done something, and may cumulate evidence against him .... Second, the jury may have used the evidence of one case to convict the defendant in another case even though that evidence would have been inadmissible at a separate trial. . . . [Third] joinder of cases that are factually similar but legally unconnected . . . presentas] the . . . danger that a defendant will be subjected to the omnipresent risk . . . that although so much [of the evidence] as would be admissible upon any one of the charges might not [persuade the jury] of the accused\u2019s guilt, the sum of it will convince them as to all.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>215 Conn. 538, 546-47, 577 A.2d 694 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201cThis court has held that there are several factors that a trial court should consider in determining whether severance is required in order to avoid [these risks]. . . . These factors include: (1) whether the charges involved discrete easily distinguishable factual scenarios; (2) whether the crimes were of a violent nature or concerned brutal or shocking conduct on the defendant\u2019s part; and (3) the duration and complexity of the trial. ... If any or all of these factors are present, a reviewing court must decide whether the trial court\u2019s jury instructions cured any prejudice that might have occurred.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 658; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 95. Applying these principles to this case, we conclude that joinder did not result in substantial injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">First, the charges arising from the two cases involved discrete and easily distinguishable factual scenarios. The first involved an assault, robbery and murder on the streets of New Haven, while the second involved the assault of a correction officer and an escape from a correctional center. These two incidents are factually distinct and occurred nearly one year apart. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 96. Furthermore, presentation of evidence relating to these two events was kept separate at trial, with separate witnesses testifying as to each case and with a clear, logical presentation of evidence of the first incident on January 14 and 18, 1994, followed by evidence of the second incident on January 19, 1994. There was no legitimate concern that the jury would commingle the facts or charges stemming from these two events. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 658-59 (joinder of two cases proper where different witnesses testified as to each incident and both state and defendant treated cases separately by referring to different dates of each offense); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 188 Conn. 411 (joinder proper where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>evidence was not complicated and was presented in orderly manner with evidence from each incident presented in chronological order); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 547-48 (joinder improper where \u201cfacial similarity between the four cases exposed the defendant to the potential prejudice that the jury would decide, cumulatively, that the defendant was responsible for a one-man crime wave of armed robberies of small stores and shops\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 722-23 (joinder improper where factual similarities of four cases was so great that jury would be unable to consider evidence in each case independently).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Significantly, the two cases, although factually unrelated, are legally related. Evidence concerning the escape charge could properly have been admitted in a separate trial for the murder charge because escape indicates consciousness of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 188 Conn. 412 (\u201c[i]t is well established that flight of a person accused of a crime is an element which, when considered with other facts of the case, is relevant to the accused\u2019s guilt\u201d). \u201cWhere evidence of one incident <em>can </em>be admitted at the trial of the other [incident], separate trials would provide the defendant no significant benefit. It is clear that, under such circumstances, the defendant would not ordinarily be substantially prejudiced by joinder of the offenses for a single trial.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Second, although we recognize that the first case involves a crime of an extremely violent nature, we do not believe that the evidence from that case compromised the jury\u2019s ability to consider fairly the charges against the defendant in the escape case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 723. In fact, the defendant confessed to both escaping from prison and assaulting the correction officer. Furthermore, while arguing during closing arguments that the state had failed to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the other charges against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, defense counsel conceded that it would take the jury \u201cabout five minutes to decide the verdict on the escape\u201d charge. Consequently, there was no reason for the jury to confuse or intermingle the evidence with respect to these two charges. Moreover, by returning a verdict of not guilty on the charge of possession of a weapon in a correctional institution, which also stemmed from the escape incident, the jury evidently was able to separate the two cases and did not blindly condemn the defendant on his participation in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Third, the trial was not particularly complex or lengthy. In fact, the entire trial, including all testimony, closing arguments, jury instructions and jury deliberations, lasted only five days and consisted of fifteen witnesses, with the first nine addressing the murder incident and the last six addressing the escape incident.

In order to deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial, however, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor.

Furthermore, in order to warrant review under the plain error doctrine, the allegedly improper conduct must so pervade the defendant\u2019s trial as to have impaired the effectiveness or integrity of the judicial process. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>v. <em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 473, 625 A.2d 791 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 509, 594 A.2d 906 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Our assessment of the allegedly improper statements in light of the entire trial leads us to conclude that further review of the defendant\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim is unwarranted. The statements the defendant now challenges were not blatantly egregious, and, more importantly, were isolated occurrences mostly in response to comments made during the defendant\u2019s closing argument in which defense counsel attempted to attack, without any evidentiary support, the credibility of witnesses whose credibility she had chosen not to question during cross-examination.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Because the record does not adequately support the defendant\u2019s claim that (a) he was clearly deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial so as to warrant review under <em>Golding </em>or (b) the effectiveness or integrity of his trial was harmed, farther review of the defendant\u2019s unpreserved prosecutorial misconduct claim is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Because we conclude that the defendant has failed to persuade us that he is entitled to a new trial under any of his four claims, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, BORDEN and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> The defendant was acquitted of the third charge in the second information, namely possession of a weapon in a correctional institution in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-174a (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides: \u201cFelony murder.

Ponteau testified during the suppression hearing that he had questioned the defendant for twenty-five to thirty minutes prior to advising him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that, during this segment of the interview, he had obtained all of the information that was subsequently included in the transcribed formal statement. The defendant relies primarily on this testimony to argue that the inculpatory statement that he gave prior to being warned should have been suppressed. In contrast, Greene testified that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were provided as soon as the defendant stated that he was in the park on the night of the murder. Because the trial court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>concluded that the defendant was not in custody at any point in the interrogation at the police station, and that, therefore, no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required, it did not have occasion to decide the issue of precisely when the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given. The trial court did state in its opinion, however, that \u201c[o]nce [tire conversation turned to the murder,] it was then stopped and the police advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>[r]ights</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\"> The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall ... be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\"> See footnote 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\"> In <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>supra, 470 U.S. 298, the United States Supreme Court held that, under the United States constitution, the initial failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a suspect who voluntarily provides an incriminating statement, in the absence of actual coercion by law enforcement officers, does not taint any subsequent admissions that are made after the suspect has been fully advised of and has waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The court reasoned that, although the goal of providing <em>Miranda </em>warnings is to eliminate the coercive atmosphere inherent in custodial interrogations and the failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings creates a presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>compulsion, \u201ca simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, [does not] so [taint] the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective .... Though <em>Miranda, </em>requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made. \u201d Id., 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The defendant argues that we should, under our state constitution, reject <em>Elstad </em>and, instead, adopt a totality of the circumstances test whereby we would determine the voluntariness and, therefore, the admissibility of the second statement by examining the entire interrogation, focusing on such factors as the severity of the police illegality in obtaining the first statement, the time lapse between the invalid statement and the valid statement, whether the suspect was confined during that time lapse or had contact with family members or an attorney, and the age and education of the suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\"> The parties agree 1hat the defendant was interrogated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> Our review of the issue of custody comports with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recently enunciated two part test for determining custody. \u201cTwo discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. . . . The first inquiry, all agree, is distinctly factual. . . . The second inquiry, however, calls for application of the controlling legal standard to the historical facts. This ultimate determination, we hold, presents a \u2018mixed question of law and fact\u2019 qualifying for independent review.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>supra, 116 S. Ct. 465. This analysis is similar to the one that we have always applied. We first examine the trial court\u2019s conclusion regarding the historical facts in order to determine whether it is clearly erroneous. We next conduct an independent review in light of the totality of the circumstances by scrupulously examining the record to determine if an application of the law to the facts leads us to conclude that the defendant was in custody. In contrast with the Supreme Court, however, we have never expressly labeled this second determination as a mixed question of law and fact. We note that the court applied this label in interpreting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (d), which affords a presumption of correctness to all issues of fact, in order to escape from the constraints of that presumption with respect to the ultimate issue of custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\"> Although the defendant testified that he was informed that he would be brought home when the interrogation concluded, the defendant argues that the detectives never communicated to him that he could have refused to accompany them to the police station or that he could stop answering questions and be driven home <em>at any time. </em>We have recognized, however, that \u201c[w]hen [an] individual has not been arrested, a finding of custody requires some indication that the officer would not have heeded his or her request to depart.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Northrop, </em>213 Conn. 405, 415 n.7, 568 A.2d 439 (1990).

In other words, the defendant argues that during his illegal interrogation, he let the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d when he admitted he was at the murder scene, and, as a result, all subsequent admissions were presumptively tainted under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.

Ed. 2d 694 (1966), requires that a defendant be informed of certain rights before being subjected to a custodial interrogation. \u201cBy custodial interrogation, [the Supreme Court was referring to] questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Id., 444. A defendant is deemed to be \u201cin custody\u201d if there is \u201ca formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The United States Supreme Court has recently stated: \u201cThe ultimate \u2018in custody\u2019 determination for <em>Miranda </em>purposes ... [is composed of two] discrete inquiries . . . first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>U.S. 116 S. Ct. 457, 465, 133 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1995). The first inquiry is distinctly factual, while the second inquiry \u201ccalls for application of the controlling legal standard to the historical facts.\u201d Id. Therefore, the determination of whether an individual is in custody \u201cpresents a \u2018mixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>question of law and fact\u2019 qualifying for independent review.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">As the Supreme Court of the United States defers to state courts regarding their factual findings; id., 464; we too must defer to the trial court\u2019s finding of facts, unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. Barton, 22 Conn. App. 62, 73, 576 A.2d 561 (1990), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 219 Conn. 529, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). Nevertheless, like the Supreme Court, we must make an independent legal determination of whether the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d based upon the facts found by the trial court. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>supra, 116 S. Ct. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are not in dispute. The police initiated contact with the defendant. In the course of investigating the murder of February 27,1992, two plainclothes detectives went to the defendant\u2019s home and informed him that he was a suspect in a separate and distinct robbeiy, with no mention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>murder or events of February 27, 1992. The detectives asked the defendant to accompany them to the New Haven police headquarters to continue the investigation of the robbery. The defendant, who was on supervised home release, consented. The defendant was not restrained, handcuffed or frisked. Upon arriving at police headquarters, the detectives took the defendant to an interrogation room located on the third floor. There the detectives began questioning the defendant regarding the robbery. Soon thereafter, the detectives\u2019 questions turned to the felony murder that is at issue in this appeal. Although the defendant never asked to terminate the questioning or to leave, he was never informed by the detectives that he could do so. During this questioning, the defendant indicated that he was at the scene of the murder on the night of February 27, 1992. It was only after the defendant let the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d that he was at the murder scene that the police decided to inform him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The questioning continued, and thereafter the police were able to secure a full confession from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, I would find that the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d from at least the time the police began to interrogate him regarding the murder. First, the defendant, by being in a supervised home release program, is \u201ctechnically in legal custody continuously until his sentence has been served,\u201d and therefore should have been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights from the outset of the interrogation. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 500, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (interrogating person on parole). Second, given the circumstances of this case, a reasonable person placed in the situation in which the defendant found himself would not have felt free to terminate the questioning and to leave the station. The fact that the interrogation occurred at a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>station does not, in itself, require that the defendant be given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Id., 495-96. The location of the interrogation, however, is not without significance. In this case, the defendant was taken from his home to an interrogation room on the third floor of police headquarters, a setting that could be fairly characterized as coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">More important than the location of the interrogation is whether the police informed the defendant that he was free to terminate the interrogation and to leave at anytime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 71 n.10, 634 A.2d 879 (1993) (\u201c[o]ften, an important factor distinguishing a consensual encounter from a seizure is whether the police expressly informed the defendant he was free to leave at the outset of the interview\u201d). In this instance, the police never informed the defendant that he had this alternative. Moreover, the police misled the defendant into voluntarily accompanying them to the police station under the obvious subterfuge that they merely wanted to discuss a separate and distinct robbery. I doubt that the average citizen, having been taken to an interrogation room under a false expectation regarding the subject of the interrogation, would have the wherewithal and independent knowledge that he or she could terminate the questioning and leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Furthermore, I disagree with the majority that the fact that the police allowed the defendant to use the bathroom unaccompanied is significant. Nowhere in the record is there even a suggestion that the defendant had possessed evidence on his person that he could have destroyed or that the third floor bathroom offered access to leave the station. Finally, it is obvious to me that the police themselves thought the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d; otherwise, they would not have given him his <em>Miranda </em>warnings after he let the \u201ccat out of the bag.\u201d If he was in custody at the time <em>Miranda </em>warnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>were given, he was equally in custody before when he made the admission that he was at the murder scene because there was no change in the circumstances before or after the admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">My conclusion that the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d is further supported by the facts of <em>Thompson. </em>The facts are similar to those in this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> except that in <em>Thompson </em>the accused was repeatedly told he could leave the police station at any time. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>supra, 116 S. Ct. 461. Notwithstanding these facts, a majority of the United States Supreme Court refused to find that the incorrect standard applied by the state court constituted harmless error. Id., 467. In other words, the majority refused to hold, as a matter of law, that Thompson was not in custody.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also, the factual scenario in <em>Elstad, </em>where the state conceded custody, underscores the conclusion that the defendant in this case was \u201cin custody.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>The state argues that this case is similar to our recent case of <em>State v. Greenfield, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 62, wherein we held that the defendant was not in custody for purposes of determining whether there was a seizure under <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992). I must confess, as the author of the <em>Greenfield </em>opinion, the facts and analysis of <em>Thompson </em>render the determination of whether Greenfield was \u201cin custody\u201d a closer call than we indicated at the time of that decision. The defendant in <em>Greenfield, </em>however, conceded that he was not seized until the police left the interrogation room and closed the door. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, 69-70. This concession became a focal point of our analysis, to which we responded, \u201cwe fail to see how this pause in the interrogation took on the coercive significance the defendant ascribes to it.\u201d Id., 72. Furthermore, the facts of <em>Greenfield </em>are distinguishable in that the defendant there returned to the crime scene and approached the police, unlike the defendant in the present case with whom the police initiated contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Accordingly, I would not only conclude that the defendant\u2019s initial admission that he was at the crime scene must be suppressed, but I would also reach the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements given to the police after he received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings should be suppressed under our state constitution as a result of his letting the \u201ccat out of the bag.\u201d See <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>supra, 470 U.S. 318 (Brennan, J., dissenting); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 740, 508 A.2d 748 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 165-67, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S.

The defendant, in his constitutional analysis, first notes that this court has determined that <em>Miranda </em>procedures have an independent significance under article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 40-41, 463 A.2d 573 (1983).

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992) (defined \u201cseizure\u201d in broader terms than federal law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 672 (federal narrowing of exclusionary rule rejected); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 579 A.2d 58 (1990) (refused to follow \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to exclusionary rule); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S.
