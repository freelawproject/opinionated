The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, indicating that at that time the motion was \u201cpremature.\u201d After the state rested, the defendant renewed his motion to dismiss. The court again denied the motion and the defendant was ultimately convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court had improperly denied his motion. The Appellate Court declined to review this issue, concluding that the defendant had not presented an adequate record for review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>36 Conn.
