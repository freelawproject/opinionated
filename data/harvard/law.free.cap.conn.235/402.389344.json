The defendant, Adrian Kang, appealed to the Appellate Court from his conviction, after a jury trial, of four counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), one count of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and 53a-8, and one count of criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>35 Conn. App. 781, 794, 647 A.2d 25 (1994). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to two of the issues that he had raised in the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">After examining the record on appeal, and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court must be affirmed. The Appellate Court carefully analyzed and rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should have suppressed, on constitutional grounds, identifications made by three of the defendant\u2019s victims at his arraignment for unrelated crimes. The Appellate Court properly concluded that the identifications had not been impermissibly suggestive and that, even if they had been, they were rehable under the totality of the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>stances. Id., 788-89. The Appellate Court, with similar care, analyzed and rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he was unfairly prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to sever the charges pending against him. The Appellate Court properly concluded that, in the factual circumstances revealed by the record in this case, the defendant had failed to establish that joinder had resulted in substantial injustice to him. Id., 793. In light of our agreement with the Appellate Court\u2019s thoughtful resolution of both issues,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained in its comprehensive opinion.

Under the circumstances of this case, was the Appellate Court correct in upholding the admissibility of the identification of the defendant at trial? 2. Did the Appellate Court correctly conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to sever the cases?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>231 Conn. 937, 650 A.2d 174 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\"> With respect to the severance issue, the defendant argued in this court that the abundance of evidence implicating him in one of the robbery counts required severance of that count from the others. To the extent that the defendant now maintains that the trial court should have ordered a separate trial on only one of the charges against, him, that contention is not properly before us, because it was not presented to the trial court.
