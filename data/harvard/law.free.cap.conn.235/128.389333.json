The plaintiff appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>dismissal of its appeal from the defendant\u2019s denial of reauthorization. The trial court determined that the defendant\u2019s decision was not a final decision in a contested case, and, therefore, was not appealable. The plaintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s denial of its request for reauthorization constituted the revocation of a license, as that term is defined in the UAPA. The plaintiff further contends that the revocation of a license is, again by statutory definition in the UAPA, a final decision of an agency in a contested case. Accordingly, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. We agree, and we therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. Prior to July 1,1989, any health care facility that sought to increase its capacity<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was required first to apply to the defendant for a certificate of need. The governing statute authorized the defendant to consider such an application by \u201cascertaining the availability of such service or function at other inpatient rehabilitation facilities, health care facilities or institutions or state health care facilities or institutions within the area to be served, the need for such service or function within such area and any other factors which the commission deems relevant to a determination of whether the facility or institution is justified in introducing such additional functions or services into its program or increasing its staff . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 19a-154. If the defendant determined that the proposed expansion would fulfill a demonstrated public need, it would issue a certificate of need. Thereafter, the facility was required to apply for final licensure from the state department of public health and addiction services (health and addiction services). Final licensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>by health and addiction services would not be issued \u201cexcept upon application for, receipt of, and compliance with all limitations and conditions required by the [defendant] in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes, sections [19a-147 through 19a-155,] inclusive.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D8t (b) (1). No facility could operate the expanded portion of the facility until it had obtained final licensure from health and addiction services.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In 1989, the legislature enacted legislation permitting nursing homes participating in Medicaid (Title XIX) or Medicare (Title XVIII) \u201con a one-time basis, [to] increase [their] licensed bed capacity and implement a capital construction project to accomplish such an increase without being required to request or obtain approval of the increase in services, licensed bed capacity or the capital expenditures program from the commission on hospitals and health care provided that the project (1) shall not require licensure by the department of health services of more than ten additional nursing home beds and (2) the total capital cost of said program shall not exceed thirty thousand dollars per bed, adjusted for inflation annually by said commission.\u201d Public Acts 1989, No. 89-325, \u00a7 3 (P.A. 89-325), effective July 1, 1989, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 19a-155a, now General Statutes \u00a7 17b-351.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In December, 1990, the plaintiff, a licensed skilled nursing facility with a capacity of approximately 130 beds, notified the defendant that it intended to add ten beds to its facility at a cost of no greater than $300,000 pursuant to P.A. 89-325, \u00a7 3. The defendant acknowledged receipt of the plaintiffs request in January, 1991. The defendant\u2019s letter to the plaintiff stated: \u201cThis is to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 6, 1990, in which you indicated that, pursuant to Section 3 of Public Act 89-325, you plan to add ten (10) nursing home beds ... at a total capital cost not to exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>$300,000. You also indicated that your facility currently participates in the Title XVIII and Title XIX programs and has not previously increased the number of beds at the facility pursuant to Section 3 of Public Act 89-325. Please be advised the [defendant] has reviewed your request and found that it is in compliance with the stipulations of Section 3 of Public Act 89-325. Therefore, it will not be necessary for you to obtain farther permission from [the defendant] for you to proceed with your plans to add ten (10) nursing home beds .... Thank you for letting [the defendant] know of your plans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The plaintiffs proposed addition of ten beds was to occur in two phases. Phase I involved the temporary addition of three beds to existing double occupancy rooms. Phase II would involve substantial renovations to the second floor of the facility, the addition of ten beds to the renovated section, and the removal of the three temporary beds. On May 4,1992, health and addiction services approved the site construction plans for phase I of the project. On May 29, 1992, health and addiction services granted final licensure to the plaintiff for phase I of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">On February 24,1993, the plaintiff submitted preliminary architectural plans and drawings for phase II to health and addiction services. That agency acknowledged receipt of the plans two days later, stating that the preliminary plans were acceptable, but not sufficiently specific to permit final review. Health and addiction services requested that more detailed plans be submitted and noted \u201cthe receipt of a letter dated January 3, 1991, issued by [the defendant] advising [the plaintiff] that it was found in compliance with the provisions of PA 89-325, Section 3, allowing the addition of ten (10) beds to the facility without further commission approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>On June 29, 1993, No. 93-406, \u00a7 2, of the 1993 Public Acts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (P.A. 93-406) became effective. This act provided that, due to insufficient need for all of the nursing home beds that had been permitted pursuant to \u00a7 19a-155a, any nursing facility that had not submitted plans to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>health and addiction services on or before June 1,1993, and had not expended at least 25 percent of the project costs, could no longer proceed with its planned additions.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The plaintiff claims that it had submitted its plans and drawings for final approval by health and addiction services on April 23,1992. Thereafter, health and addiction services informed the plaintiff that it had not received the architectural plans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response to this notification, the plaintiff submitted a copy of the architectural plans on June 25, 1993. On July 8, 1993, health and addiction services issued a letter to the plaintiff indicating that certain changes were required before it would grant final approval. The next day, however, health and addiction services informed the plaintiff that because of the passage of P.A. 93-406, \u201cplans for the [plaintiffs] project [were] required to have been approved by this department no later than June 1,1993. We, therefore, are not permitted to continue the design review of your project unless it has been reauthorized to continue by the [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">On July 15,1993, the plaintiff applied to the defendant for reauthorization pursuant to the requirements of P.A. 93-406. The plaintiff stated that \u201cthe total project cost associated with the 10-bed addition will approximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>$227,249. The listing of project costs incurred ... as of June 9, 1993, totaled $56,076 . . . The defendant delegated to the department of social services the responsibility for making a preliminary determination as to whether the plaintiff was eligible for reauthorization. The department of social services reviewed the plaintiffs application and determined that, because the phase II plans had not been approved by health and addiction services prior to June 1, 1993, as required by P.A. 93-406, the plaintiff was not authorized to proceed with completion of the addition of ten beds. The department of social services also concluded that \u201cthere [was] no basis to waive the statutory requirement\u201d that the plans be approved by health and addiction services prior to June 1, 1993, because there was \u201cno evidence that the phase II plans were submitted to [health and addiction services] in April, 1993.\u201d On November 18, 1993, the defendant, without affording the plaintiff an opportunity for a hearing, accepted the recommendation of the department of social services and denied the plaintiffs application for reauthorization of phase II of its project.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On December 3, 1993, the plaintiff submitted to the defendant a request for reconsideration of its denial of the plaintiffs application for reauthorization. The defendant did not reply to the reconsideration request and, accordingly, it was deemed denied on December 28, 1993. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-181a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>thereafter appealed from the decision of the defendant to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 (c) and 19a-158,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claiming that the defendant\u2019s refusal to grant the plaintiffs application for reauthorization of phase II was improper because the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>not afforded the plaintiff notice and a hearing. The defendant moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the plaintiff had not appealed from a final decision of an agency in a contested case as required by the UAPA. The trial court granted the motion, and rendered judgment dismissing the administrative appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The trial court concluded that \u201c[n]either General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155a nor Public Act 93-406 requires the defendant to provide a hearing to determine if the applicant is entitled to proceed with licensure of a ten-bed addition.\u201d The trial court also concluded that, although the plaintiff had the legal right to seek approval to pursue licensure of phase II of its planned expansion, because \u201cthe [defendant] is not required by statute to provide an opportunity for a hearing to determine the plaintiffs legal right to pursue licensure of the ten-bed addition, the present case is not a contested case within the meaning of the UAPA. Therefore [because] the present case is not a contested case, the [defendant\u2019s] decision to deny the plaintiffs application for an exception to Public Act 93-406 was not a final decision from which the plaintiff had a right to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>plaintiffs administrative appeal was from the final decision of an agency in a contested case. The plaintiff contends that because the defendant was required by the UAPA to conduct a hearing before denying the plaintiff\u2019s application for reauthorization, the trial court improperly dismissed its appeal. In support of this claim, the plaintiff argues that the defendant had granted it a license, as defined in \u00a7 4-166 (6)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the UAPA, to proceed with construction of the ten bed addition to the facility. The plaintiff further argues that when the defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s application, the denial constituted a revocation of that license, and that \u00a7 4-182 (c)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> requires notice and an opportunity for a hearing before such a revocation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u201cJudicial review of an administrative decision is a creature of statute.\u201d <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 792, 799, 629 A.2d 367 (1993). Section 4-183 (a) of the UAPA provides in part that \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the superior court as provided in this section. ...\u201d A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (2) as \u201ca proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The issue in this case is whether the defendant was statutorily required to conduct a hearing. To make that determination, we \u201cexamine all the statutory provisions that govern the activities of the particular agency . . . in question.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental </em>Protection, supra, 226 Conn. 802-803.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The trial court correctly concluded that the terms of \u00a7 19a-155a and P.A. 93-406 did not require the defendant to provide an opportunity for a hearing. We conclude, however, that the trial court improperly limited its focus to those two statutes. In addition to being governed by chapter 368c of the General Statutes, \u00a7 19a-145 et seq., the defendant is governed by the UAPA. Accordingly, if the UAPA required the defendant to conduct a hearing before denying the plaintiffs application, then the defendant had a statutory duty to conduct a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The UAPA states that \u201c[n]o revocation, suspension, annulment or withdrawal of any license is lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, the agency gave notice ... to the licensee . . . and the licensee was given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c). Thus, if, as the plaintiff argues, the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs request for reauthorization was the revocation of a license, as defined by the UAPA, then the defendant had a statutory duty to conduct a hearing before denying that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">First we must determine, therefore, whether the plaintiff had a license within the meaning of the UAPA. A license is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (6) of the UAPA as \u201cthe whole or part of any agency permit, certificate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>approval, registration, charter or similar form of permission required by law . . . .\u201d We have construed this language broadly to include any required agency permission even if it is not specifically called a \u201clicense.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Easter House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Children &amp; Youth Services, </em>214 Conn. 560, 573 A.2d 304 (1990). The plaintiffs claim, therefore, turns upon whether the defendant\u2019s initial permission to proceed with the ten bed expansion was required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The statutory framework that created and governs the defendant provides that agency with virtually plenary authority over the creation and expansion of nursing care facilities such as that operated by the plaintiff. \u201cThe [defendant] was created by the legislature to ensure the efficient utilization of health care resources and to control the burgeoning costs of health care. <em>Griffin Hospital v. Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 497, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986). To achieve those ends, the legislature granted the [defendant] broad powers over the budgets of hospitals and over the initiation of new programs and capital expenditures by health care institutions. Id., 497-98; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-150, 19a-151, 19a-153 (a), 19a-154 (a), 19a-156 (a).\u201d <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>208 Conn. 663, 667-68, 546 A.2d 257 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 19a-155a includes requirements beyond that of determination of need. This statute requires a determination of whether the facility requesting expansion: (1) constitutes a \u201cnursing home\u201d; (2) participates in Title XVIII and Title XIX programs; (3) has not previously increased its capacity pursuant to \u00a7 19a-155a; (4) is not planning an expansion of more than ten beds; and (5) costs no more than $30,000 per bed. It would be inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, therefore, to conclude that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>intended to authorize nursing facilities completely to circumvent the defendant in expanding their capacity. We conclude that, despite the legislative provision allowing the plaintiff to bypass obtaining a certificate of need, the plaintiff nonetheless was required by law to obtain approval from the defendant in other respects before proceeding with the planned expansion of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Moreover, our conclusion accords with the administrative scheme within which the plaintiff, the defendant and health and addiction services in fact operated. In advance of proceeding with its planned expansion, the plaintiff sought the approval of the defendant. The defendant thereafter granted that approval in a letter stating that it had <em>\u201creviewed [the plaintiffs] request and found that it is in compliance with the stipulations of Section 3 of Public Act 89-325. </em>Therefore, it [would] not be necessary for [the plaintiff] to obtain <em>further permission </em>from [the defendant] ... to proceed with [its] plans to add ten (10) nursing home beds . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thereafter, in reviewing both phase I and phase II of the plaintiffs plans, health and addiction services acknowledged receipt of a copy of the defendant\u2019s letter to the plaintiff. Indeed, health and addiction services requires such permission in advance of granting final approval of a health care facility\u2019s expansion. \u201cA facility shall not be constructed, expanded or licensed to operate except upon application for, receipt of, and compliance with <em>all limitations and conditions </em>required by the [defendant] in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes, sections [19a-147 to 19a-155,] inclusive.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D8t (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u201cWe presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes and that the legislature intended them to be read together so as to constitute one consistent body of law. <em>Department of Administrative Services </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>226 Conn. 670, 679, 628 A.2d 957 (1993).\u201d <em>Pollio </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 44, 55, 652 A.2d 1026 (1995). Accordingly, we conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 19a-155a to be interpreted in light of the established administrative scheme governing the expansion of nursing care facilities. In the context of the statutory and regulatory system that governs such expansion, we are persuaded that, in enacting \u00a7 19a-155a, the legislature intended to modify the criteria that the defendant would use in reviewing the plaintiffs request, but did not intend to abrogate entirely the defendant\u2019s \u201cbroad powers over the budgets of hospitals and over the initiation of new programs and capital expenditures by health care institutions.\u201d <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Because the plaintiff was required by statute to obtain the defendant\u2019s permission to proceed with its planned ten bed expansion, we conclude that such permission constituted a license. The defendant, therefore, was required by the UAPA to afford the plaintiff notice and an opportunity for a hearing before such license was revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The defendant argues that the requirements of the UAPA regarding licenses and their revocation are inapposite to this case because \u201c[\u00a7 19a-155a] itself, not the [defendant] through a licensing process, gave the plaintiff the authority to increase its bed capacity. . . . Thus the eligibility possessed by the plaintiff to add ten beds was not a license within the meaning of [\u00a7 4-166 (6)].\u201d The defendant correctly points out that the General Assembly is specifically excluded from the definition of \u201cagency\u201d within the UAPA. General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (1). The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the plaintiff had been granted permission to proceed with the ten bed expansion of the facility directly by the legislature, and, therefore, that the \u201clicense\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the plaintiff obtained was not \u201cagency\u201d permission. Thus, the defendant argues, the UAPA is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The plaintiff argues, to the contrary, that \u00a7 19a-155a did not abrogate the defendant\u2019s authority to oversee expansion of health care facilities, but instead, changed the statutory criteria that the defendant was to consider in granting permission to expand the plaintiffs bed capacity. We agree with the plaintiff. As we have held, earlier in this opinion, although \u00a7 19a-155a eliminated the requirement that the plaintiff obtain the defendant\u2019s approval of the \u201cincrease in services, licensed bed capacity or the capital expenditure program,\u201d it did not thereby abrogate entirely the defendant\u2019s oversight authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The defendant also argues that even if its letter acknowledging that the plaintiff had met the statutory requirements to proceed with its ten bed expansion constituted a license, the revocation of that permission was accomplished by the legislature rather than the defendant. The defendant contends that P.A. 93-406<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in effect already had revoked the plaintiffs license when the defendant denied the plaintiffs application for reauthorization because the plaintiff had not obtained final licensure by June 9, 1993. Therefore, the defendant maintains, the \u201crevocation,\u201d if there was one, was not \u201cagency,\u201d but legislative, conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Public Act 93-406, \u00a7 2 (b) provides in part that \u201c[a] facility which has initiated the addition of beds but has not obtained licensure of such beds, may . . . apply to the [defendant] for authorization to proceed with completion of the additional beds and application for licensure, provided (A) plans for the additional beds have been approved by the department of health services pursuant to section 19-13-D-8t (v) (4) of the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>health code no later than June 1, 1993, and (B) twenty-five per cent of estimated project costs have been expended no later than June 9, 1993, provided project costs may not exceed thirty-one thousand two hundred eleven dollars per bed.\u201d Thus, P.A. 93-406 specifically provides that those facilities that had met certain criteria were entitled to \u201cproceed with completion\u201d of the addition. Accordingly, we conclude that P.A. 93-406 did not, ipso facto, revoke the plaintiffs license. Instead, we conclude that this legislation gave to the defendant the authority to determine whether the plaintiffs license should have been revoked based upon its findings as to the specified criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The defendant finally argues that, because it had no discretion to grant or deny the plaintiffs requested expansion if the plaintiff met the statutory criteria, the defendant\u2019s permission to continue in the expansion process could not be deemed a license granted by an \u201cagency.\u201d There is, however, no authority for the proposition that, because an agency is not accorded discretion to determine whether to grant or deny an application, its conduct in doing so is not agency action within the meaning of the licensure provisions of the UAPA.
