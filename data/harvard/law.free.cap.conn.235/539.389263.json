Ct. 1937, 128 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1994), the trial court concluded that the double jeopardy clause was violated when the plaintiff, after having been punished criminally for possession of illicit drugs, subsequently was assessed a tax based upon his possession of those same illicit drugs. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court determined that the tax imposed pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s Marijuana and Controlled Substances Tax Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-650 through 12-660; was punishment for purposes of double jeopardy analysis. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. On November 5, 1992, state police officers searched the plaintiffs place of business in Colebrook, the Route 8 Cycle Shop, as well as a black Ford pickup truck and a trailer located on the premises. As a result of their search, the police discovered approximately one-half pound of cocaine. The plaintiff subsequently was arrested for possession of cocaine with intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 21a-277 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Immediately after seizing the cocaine, the state police submitted a drug tax referral form to the department of revenue services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The referral form noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>police had discovered 1250 grams of cocaine in the plaintiffs possession and indicated that the drug stamps required by \u00a7 12-651 (a) had not been affixed to the drugs. As a result of the information contained in the referral form, the commissioner, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-655 (b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> assessed an initial tax deficiency against the plaintiff. On December 21,1993, the commissioner sent the plaintiff a final determination letter informing him that he owed $255,631 in tax pursuant to \u00a7 12-651, $255,631 as a penalty pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 12-660 (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> plus interest of $41,540.04 pursuant to \u00a7 12-655 (b), for a total amount due of $552,802.04.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On February 15, 1994, the plaintiff, in his criminal case, entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of possession of cocaine with intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 21a-277 (a). The court sentenced the plaintiff to nine years imprisonment, execution suspended after three years, to be followed by four years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Following the imposition of his criminal sentence, the plaintiff filed this tax appeal in the Superior Court, contesting the validity of the tax that had been levied by the commissioner. In his appeal, the plaintiff claimed that the assessment constituted a second punishment for the same offense to which he previously had pleaded nolo contendere and had been sentenced. The plaintiff asserted that, consequently, the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution precluded collection of the tax. The tax session of the Superior Court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on this issue, based upon the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana v. Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 767. Relying on <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the trial court concluded that Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>icut\u2019s tax on controlled substances constituted punishment for double jeopardy purposes and, therefore, could not be imposed upon the plaintiff because he had been punished previously for the same underlying conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment when the material facts are undisputed, we must decide whether the trial court erred in concluding that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book \u00a7 384; <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 202, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995). The trial court based its conclusion on a record that consisted of a stipulation of facts, written briefs and oral arguments of counsel. The record before the trial court, therefore, was identical with the record before this court. Accordingly, our review of the ruling of the trial court is plenary, and we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts appearing in the record. <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. v. Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 53-54, 607 A.2d 424 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides that no person may \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d The double jeopardy clause protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction and multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The third of these protections is at issue in this appeal. We must determine, therefore, whether, under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>assessment of Connecticut\u2019s tax on controlled substances is a subsequent punishment barred by the double jeopardy clause when it is imposed on an individual who previously had been punished criminally for the same conduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that imposition of the tax does not violate double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a Montana tax on the possession of illegal drugs assessed after a criminal penalty had been imposed for the same underlying misconduct violated the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 783. Montana\u2019s Dangerous Drug Tax Act imposed a tax \u201con the possession and storage of dangerous drugs\u201d that was to be collected only after state or federal fines or forfeitures had been satisfied. Id., 770. The amount of the tax was either 10 percent of the market value of the drugs as determined by the department of revenue or a specified amount depending upon the type of drug involved, whichever was greater.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id. The Montana act further required that all law enforcement personnel report any person subject to the tax to the department of revenue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Id. The taxpayer had no obligation to file a return or to pay any tax <em>unless </em>and <em>until </em>he or she had been arrested. Id., 771. Under agency rules,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the taxpayer had to file a return within seventy-two hours of arrest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the defendants pleaded guilty to charges arising from their operation of a marijuana farm.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendants were sentenced in accordance with their plea agreements.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In a separate proceeding, the department of revenue imposed Montana\u2019s dangerous drug tax on the illegal drugs discovered on the Kurth Ranch property.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendants challenged the imposition of the tax, claiming that the dangerous drug tax violated their double jeopardy right to be free from multiple punishments for the same offense. The Bankruptcy Court, the federal District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals all agreed with the defendants and concluded that the tax was an additional punishment for the same offense that violated the double jeopardy clause. The state appealed to the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>appeal, the Supreme Court was presented with the following question: \u201c[W]hether a tax on the possession of illegal drugs assessed after the State has imposed a criminal penalty for the same conduct may violate the constitutional prohibition against successive punishments for the same offense.\u201d Id., 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Initially, the court recognized that \u201cthe unlawfulness of an activity does not prevent its taxation.\u201d Id., 778; see, e.g., <em>Marchetti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 39, 88 S. Ct. 697, 19 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968) (upholding federal tax on gambling activities that were prohibited by state law); <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>366 U.S. 213, 81 S. Ct. 1052, 6 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1961) (upholding federal income tax on embezzled money imposed on person who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to embezzle under state law); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Constantine, </em>296 U.S. 287, 56 S. Ct. 223, 80 L. Ed. 233 (1935) (upholding federal excise tax on liquor sales that violated state law). The court, however, noted that \u201c \u2018there comes a time in the extension of the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses its character [as such] and becomes a mere penalty with the characteristics of regulation and punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 779, quoting A. <em>Magnano Co. </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>292 U.S. 40, 46, 54 S. Ct. 599, 78 L. Ed. 1109 (1934). Accordingly, the court was required to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>mine whether Montana\u2019s dangerous drug tax was so punitive in nature as to subject it to the constraints of the double jeopardy clause. <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 778-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The court began its analysis by noting that although \u201cneither a high rate of taxation nor an obvious deterrent purpose automatically marks this tax a form of punishment,\u201d these factors were at least consistent with a characterization of the tax as punishment. Id., 778. The court did not hold, however, that these attributes of the tax, which are present in Connecticut\u2019s scheme to tax illicit drugs, in and of themselves rendered Montana\u2019s drug tax punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Id., 781. The court focused primarily on two additional \u201cunusual features\u201d of the Montana tax that rendered it \u201ca concoction of anomalies, too far-removed in crucial respects from a standard tax assessment to escape characterization as punishment for the purpose of double jeopardy analysis.\u201d Id., 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">First, the imposition of the Montana tax was conditioned on the arrest of the taxpayer for the commission of a crime. The court noted that this feature of the Montana tax was \u201csignificant of penal and prohibitory intent rather than the gathering of revenue.\u201d Id., 781. The court recognized that in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>340 U.S. 42, 71 S. Ct. 108, 95 L. Ed. 47 (1950),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it had \u201crelied on the absence of such a condition to support its conclusion that a particular federal tax was a civil rather than a criminal sanction.\u201d <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 781. Significantly, the court noted that, by its terms, the Montana tax was to be \u201cexacted <em>only </em>after the taxpayer has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>arrested for the precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation in the first place.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Accordingly, the court observed that persons arrested for possession of marijuana constituted the <em>entire </em>class of taxpayers subject to the tax. Id., 781-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Second, the court took cognizance of the fact that although the Montana tax purported to be a property tax on the possession and storage of illegal drugs, in practice it could never be levied at a time when the taxpayer either owned or possessed the goods. Because the tax was predicated upon arrest, law enforcement officials presumably had already confiscated and destroyed the illegal contraband, thereby divesting the taxpayer of possession of the illicit drugs at the time of the imposition of the tax. Id., 783. The court observed that a statute that imposes a tax on goods at a time when such goods no longer exist possesses a punitive character. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Connecticut\u2019s act that taxes illegally possessed controlled substances, however, does not contain either of the \u201cunusual features\u201d that figured prominently in the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that Montana\u2019s dangerous drug tax constituted punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Connecticut\u2019s tax is neither predicated upon arrest nor is it assessed on property that necessarily has been confiscated or destroyed. Specifically, the act provides that the tax is owed <em>\u201cimmediately </em>upon acquisition or possession in this state by a dealer. \u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-651 (c).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, the tax obligation does not depend on the dealer\u2019s arrest, which in the normal course of events would result in the confiscation and destruction of the controlled sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>stances. <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 783. The dealer can satisfy the tax obligation by paying the tax promptly upon his or her acquisition of the drugs and by affixing the required tax stamps. Accordingly, unlike Montana\u2019s tax scheme, in Connecticut persons who have been arrested for drug possession do not constitute the entire class of taxpayers subject to the tax and the taxpayer is not necessarily divested of the drugs before the tax is imposed. See id., 782-83.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Additionally, our act provides safeguards that further separate the tax from the criminal process, permitting confidential payment of the tax and prohibiting use of the tax information in any criminal proceeding against the taxpayer, except for one involving taxes due under the act itself, unless the information was obtained from some other source. General Statutes \u00a7 12-659. The taxpayer, consequently, may file without risk of self-incrimination. General Statutes \u00a7 12-659.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We acknowledge that in many, if not most, cases Connecticut\u2019s tax will not be imposed until the taxpayer has been arrested and until the illegal drugs have been confiscated or destroyed. The practicalities surrounding the imposition of the tax, however, merely reflect the reality of attempting to tax an illegal activity. <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana v. Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 788 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). The taxpayer\u2019s voluntary choice to ignore his or her tax obligations should not be the determinative factor in evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>whether Connecticut\u2019s tax constitutes punishment in the double jeopardy context. The legislature provided that the information obtained from an individual complying with the statutory requirements cannot be disclosed to law enforcement officials, thereby providing an avenue for the taxpayer to comply with the law without the necessity of providing incriminating information. It would be anomalous indeed if persons conducting an illegal business were excused from the payment of a tax on that business because the failure to pay the tax was not discovered, as a result of their own dereliction, until after they had been arrested and double jeopardy protection attached. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Constantine, </em>supra, 296 U.S. 293.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In support of his contention that the tax serves a purely punitive function, the plaintiff claims that a review of the legislative history of Connecticut\u2019s Marijuana and Controlled Substances Tax Act indicates that there existed a clear legislative intent to use the tax to punish those who traffic in illegal drugs.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Our examination of the legislative history of the act, however, does not indicate that the tax was enacted solely for a punitive purpose. While it is beyond question that the tax was intended to some extent to act as a deterrent to participation in the drug trade, legislators expressed the desire to \u201caddress tax evasion in an underground economy\u201d; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Finance, Revenue and Bonding, Pt. 1, 1991 Sess., p. 170; and \u201c[to open] another door to law enforcement officials on the civil side [because] failure to pay a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>tax [results in] the dealer [being] treated as any other delinquent taxpayer . . . .\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21, 1991 Sess., pp. 7817-18, remarks of Representative John W. Thompson. Legislators also hoped that it \u201cwould produce money for the state while imposing a burden on those who deal drugs.\u201d 34 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1991 Sess., p. 3227, remarks of Senator George Jepsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">While we recognize that the legislative history of Connecticut\u2019s tax reveals some indication of a deterrent purpose underlying the enactment of the legislation, we also recognize that the legislative history indicates a legislative purpose to raise substantial revenue by taxing an unregulated and underground economy that is extremely profitable yet free of tax liability. We note, in addition, that \u201c[i]t is beyond serious question that a tax does not cease to be valid merely because it regulates, discourages, or even definitely deters the activities taxed. <em>Sonzinsky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>300 U.S. 506, [513-14, 57 S. Ct. 554, 81 L. Ed. 772] (1937). The principle applies even though the revenue obtained is obviously negligible ... or the revenue purpose of the tax may be secondary, <em>Hampton &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>276 U.S. 394 [48 S. Ct. 348, 72 L. Ed. 624] (1928).\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>supra, 340 U.S. 44. Further, an obvious deterrent purpose does not alone render a civil or administrative sanction punishment for double jeopardy purposes. <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 779. Accordingly, even though the revenue raising purpose of the tax on illegal drugs may be secondary, Connecticut\u2019s marijuana and controlled substances tax does not rise to the level of punishment, and therefore does not implicate the double jeopardy clause. The constitution permits the legislature to tax this lucrative yet illegal business in order to acquire revenue, while at the same time using the tax as a deterrent to those considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>entry into that illegal business. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>supra, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In sum, we conclude that Connecticut\u2019s Marijuana and Controlled Substances Tax Act does not possess either of the idiosyncratic features on which the United States Supreme Court focused in <em>Kurth Ranch </em>in declaring that a tax assessed pursuant to Montana\u2019s tax on illicit drugs constitutes punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Specifically, the imposition of Connecticut\u2019s tax is not conditioned upon arrest and is intended to be assessed while the taxpayer is in actual possession of the drugs. In addition, the legislative history does not evince a purely punitive intent, but indicates a genuine effort by the legislature to raise income by taxing an untapped source of revenue, a constitutionally permissible practice. We therefore conclude that the imposition of the tax on the plaintiffs illegal drugs after he had been prosecuted for the same underlying misconduct does not violate the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In this opinion PETERS, C.

As such, the \u201ccasual user\u201d is not subject to the tax; rather, only those who possess sufficient amounts to lead one reasonably to believe that they are involved in the drug trade are subject to the tax.

Because, in accordance with the well reasoned opinion of the trial court, I would find that the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution was violated when the plaintiff, following his judgment of conviction for possession of illicit drugs, was assessed a tax pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s Marijuana and Controlled Substances Tax Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-650 through 12-660; I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In deciding that Connecticut\u2019s act crosses the line between revenue raising and punishment, I begin, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>did the majority of this court, with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>511 U.S. 767, 114 S. Ct. 1937, 128 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1994), as a guide. Therein the court stated that although a sanction may possess both punitive and remedial features, a court faced with a challenge based on double jeopardy grounds must determine whether the sanction is fairly characterized as remedial or punitive. In deciding that question, a trial court should review the sanction\u2019s legislative history and examine the nature and structure of the statute. As the court noted, \u201cat some point, an exaction labeled as a tax approaches punishment, and [the court\u2019s] task is to determine whether [the state\u2019s] drug tax crosses that line.\u201d Id., 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">To aid in this task, the court employed an \u201cunusual features\u201d analysis to conclude that an assessment of Montana\u2019s dangerous drug tax amounted to a second punishment prohibited by the double jeopardy clause. Because the tax was conditioned on the arrest of the taxpayer for the commission of a crime, and because the tax, in practice, could be levied only at a time when the taxpayer no longer either owned or possessed the goods, the Supreme Court concluded that the tax was so punitive in nature as to subject it to the constraints of the double jeopardy clause. Id., 781-83. In light of the statute\u2019s obvious punitive purpose, as evidenced by those two unusual features, the court in <em>Kurth Ranch </em>did not examine the legislative history of Montana\u2019s tax act.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In concluding that Connecticut\u2019s tax does not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes, the majority distinguishes Montana\u2019s tax in that our tax does not possess either of the two \u201cidiosyncratic features\u201d on which the <em>Kurth Ranch </em>court focused. In <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>however, the court \u201cdid not hold that a tax must contain each of the [Montana act\u2019s] \u2018punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ment\u2019 aspects, or only the [Montana act\u2019s] \u2018punishment\u2019 aspects, to constitute a punishment within the meaning of the double jeopardy clause.\u201d <em>Clifft </em>v. <em>Indiana Dept. of State Revenue, </em>641 N.E.2d 682, 693 (Ind. 1994). The determination that \u201can exaction labeled as a tax\u201d approaches punishment depends on a variety of considerations and a \u201cconcoction of anomalies\u201d; <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 780, 783; that reflect legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\u201cBecause our fundamental objective in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); we will not undertake an examination of [General Statutes \u00a7 12-651 (a)] with blinders on regarding what the legislature intended [it] to mean. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). Accordingly, our analysis of [General Statutes \u00a7 12-651 (a)] is not limited solely to the words of the statute. Instead, we must also look ... to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 409; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>supra, 92.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Derwin </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 411, 420, 661 A.2d 1025 (1995). In this case, I believe the legislative intent to punish is clear from the specific comments of the legislators sponsoring the bill as well as from a gathering of the indicators relied upon by the Supreme Court in <em>Kurth Ranch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The legislative history of the act expressly articulates a punitive purpose. Indeed, as the trial court noted, these expressions are pervasive. Representative John W. Thompson, the sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives, stated that: \u201cWe have various drug and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>seizure laws which [provide that] if a drug dealer is arrested in commitment of a crime, in possession of drugs and the drugs are found in a house, a boat, a car, for example, the law enforcement officials may seize that house, drug or boat and that becomes property of the state. However, the law does not permit law enforcement officials to reach beyond that to whatever resources those individuals may have, such as cash resources, other businesses and so on. This bill would allow law enforcement officials to reach beyond the immediate seizure and to attack criminals\u2019 assets, bank accounts, homes, property and so on.\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21, 1991 Sess., p. 7809. Although he acknowledged that \u201cthe collection of money is part of the process ... [a] more important part of this legislation is really to put a crimp in the operation of the drug dealer.\u201d Id., p. 7814. Representative Thompson stated in closing that the tax does \u201cexpand the opportunity for law enforcement officials to go after these people, not only through criminal proceedings, but also through civil action.\u201d Id., p. 7818.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Speaking in support of the act, Representative John G. Metsopoulos expressed, in no uncertain terms, the penal nature of the act. He stated: \u201c[Y]ou know, I think the concept is good because what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re double-whacking the offender. You\u2019re getting him with the jail term and you\u2019re getting him with any fines that he may incur through civil or legal offenses. You\u2019re then getting him with the tax that \u2018he would have to pay\u2019 if he was selling this substance.\u201d Id., p. 7813. Representative Curtis D. Andrews, Jr., expressed his view that the tax is \u201cprimarily a law enforcement tool. Secondarily, it\u2019s a revenue raiser, but it is primarily a law enforcement tool.\u201d Id., p. 7817.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The debate in the Senate was comparatively brief. Senator George Jepsen, the sponsor of the bill in the Senate, spoke nothing of its revenue raising purpose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>On the contrary he stated: \u201cThis bill very simply imposes one more burden on drug dealers in our state . . . .\u201d 34 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1991 Sess., p. 3227.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Additionally, while the act does not in principle depend upon an arrest;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 12-651 (a); it is made exclusively applicable to illegal activity by General Statutes \u00a7 12-658, which provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to require persons lawfully in possession of marijuana or a controlled substance pursuant to any provision of the general statutes to pay the tax imposed pursuant to section 12-651.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 12-650 (1) and (2) (defining marijuana and controlled substances, for purposes of the act, as any marijuana and controlled substance \u201cthat is held, possessed, transported, sold or offered to be sold <em>in violation of any provision of the general </em>statutes\u201d [emphasis added]); see also General Statutes \u00a7 12-650 (3) (defining dealer as \u201cany person who, <em>in violation of a,ny provision of the general statutes </em>. . . .\u201d [emphasis added]). Conditioning the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>on unlawful possession is \u201csignificant of penal and prohibitory intent.\u201d <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 781. When the taxed activity is completely forbidden, any legitimate revenue raising purpose that might support the tax could be equally well served by increasing the fine imposed upon conviction of the criminal offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id., 780. Tax on goods that the taxpayer did not lawfully possess \u201chas an unmistakable punitive character. This tax, imposed on criminals and no others, departs so far from normal revenue laws as to become a form of punishment.\u201d Id., 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Finally, although they are not dispositive, two additional features of the act are at least consistent with a punitive character: the high rate of tax, comparable to the tax that the Supreme Court suggested was unrivaled in the world of taxes;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> id., 780 n.17; and the fact that it is the same sovereign that imposes the tax that also criminalizes the activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 782 n.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>It is important to note that the validity of the act is not in question. The question, rather, is whether the tax is a punishment for the purpose of the double jeopardy clause. The fifth amendment does not prevent imposition of the tax; it merely restricts the ability of the state to seek additional sanctions in criminal proceedings against those who possess marijuana or controlled substances from whom taxes have already been collected. Similarly, it restricts the ability of the state to impose a tax on goods the possession of which have served as the basis of criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">In conclusion, I believe that the act provides for a second punishment, and not the kind of remedial sanction that may follow the punishment of a criminal offense. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> The majority emphasizes that because the tax is assessed at the time of possession, and not solely at the time of arrest, it is distinct from the Montana tax. In reality, this is a distinction without a difference. As Chief Justice Rehnquist observed in his dissent in <em>Kurth, Ranch: </em>\u201c [Individuals cannot be expected to voluntarily identify themselves as subject <em>to the </em>tax.\u201d <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 788 n.2. Furthermore, although in theory the tax can be imposed independent of an arrest, Connecticut law enforcement officers, like their counterparts in Montana, have an obligation to complete and submit a drug tax referral form to the department of revenue services identifying the total amount and type of drugs found and indicating that the tax stamps were not present and affixed to the drugs. See Connecticut Informational Publication, IP 92 (7): Questions and Answers for the Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement Agencies on the Connecticut Marijuana and Controlled Substances Tax (Dept. of Revenue Services 1992). Finally, although those subject to the tax can voluntarily declare the drugs and pay the tax, the amount of revenue that has been generated is negligible. As of June 7, 1994, three years after the tax statute was enacted, the initial cost of designing and printing the drug tax stamps had not been recovered through the imposition of the tax. D. Lightman, \u201cState \u2018Grass Tax\u2019 Endangered,\u201d Hartford Courant, June 7, 1994, p. A1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> It is noteworthy that the profits from what the state refers to as \u201cthe illegal drug trade\u201d are also subject to income taxation under General Statutes \u00a7 12-700 et seq., and to sales taxation under General Statutes \u00a7 12-406 et seq. Because these taxes apply equally to legal and illegal activities, they do not violate the double jeopardy clause but rather serve the state\u2019s goals of subjecting drug sales to economic sanctions and of funding worthier enterprises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\"> Section 12-651 (b) (2) provides that one gram of cocaine is to be taxed at $200. The market value of $100 for a gram of cocaine was attested to by an affidavit accompanying the amicus brief of the division of criminal justice. Therefore, the tax is 200 percent of the value. Additionally, the penalty for failure to pay the tax is 100 percent of the tax in addition to the tax imposed pursuant to \u00a7 12-651. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-660 (a). Therefore, if a dealer in possession does not self assess by affixing the proper stamps pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-654, he or she is liable for 400 percent of the market value of the controlled substance. This is the same percentage relationship characterized by the Supreme Court as \u201cunrivaled.\u201d <em>Dept. of Revenue of Montana </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 780 n.17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\"> Consequently, it is unnecessary to consider the question of whether the dual sovereignty doctrine makes the double jeopardy clause inapplicable.
