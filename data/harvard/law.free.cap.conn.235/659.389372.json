The state charged the defendant, Raymond Marquis, with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a consequence of the trial court\u2019s denial of the state\u2019s motion to videotape, the state represented that it could not proceed further with the charges against the defendant. The trial court consequently dismissed the charges against the defendant, discharged him from custody and gave the state permission, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to appeal the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In its appeal to the Appellate Court, the state claimed that the trial court had improperly denied the state\u2019s motion to videotape the victim. The state, in its appeal, asserted that the trial court improperly had based its decision on the state\u2019s refusal to permit the child to be examined by a defense psychiatrist. The Appellate Court held, however, that the trial court\u2019s decision might equally be interpreted to have been based upon a determination that the state had failed to meet its statutory burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that there was a need to videotape the child. <em>State </em>v. Marquis, 36 Conn. App. 803, 804, 653 A.2d 833 (1995). Accordingly, the Appellate Court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the appellate record did not unambiguously disclose the basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling. Id. In the perceived absence of the requisite clear record for appellate review of the issue presented by the state, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 803-804.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We granted the state\u2019s request for certification to appeal from the Appellate Court. Because the Appellate Court never reached the merits of the state\u2019s appeal, we certified only the issue of the sufficiency of the record for appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In support of its claim that the record is adequate for review, the state relies on the trial court\u2019s oral memorandum of decision, in which the court described the procedure that it had followed in its rulings with regard to videotaping. The court first heard the state\u2019s case, and determined that the state had made a prima facie showing in favor of the videotaping. It then ruled that \u201cthe defense at this time is entitled to examination of the child.\u201d Because of objections to such an examination voiced by the child\u2019s mother and her guardian ad litem, the state refused to permit this examination. The court then ruled: \u201cOn the refusal of the State to permit the child to be examined by the defense psychiatrist, then the Court does have to deny the motion for videotaping.\u201d Thereafter, upon the representation of the state that, without the videotaping, it would not be able to proceed, both the state and the defendant moved for dismissal of the case. The court granted the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>motion for dismissal and the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We agree with the state that this record is unambiguous. A reasonable reading of the record discloses that the trial court refused to permit videotaping of the child solely because the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist was not permitted to examine the child. This case must therefore be remanded to the Appellate Court for a consideration of the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g provides in relevant part: \u201cTestimony of victim of child abuse.

[T]he court may order the defendant excluded from the room or screened from the sight and hearing of the child only if the state proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the child would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that a compelling need exists to take the testimony of the child outside the physical presence of the defendant in order to insure the reliability of such testimony. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-70 provides in relevant part: \u201cSexual assault in the first degree: Class B felony: One year not suspendable.
