We conclude that the list of felidae is not exclusive and that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The facts and procedural history relevant to this appeal are set forth as follows. \u201cOn January 27,1992, Jan Puzas, an employee of the United States Department of Agriculture, regulatory enforcement animal care division (USDA), went to 15 Bryson Avenue in Seymour to perform a prelicensing inspection in response to the defendant\u2019s application for an exhibitor\u2019s license for one rabbit. Puzas observed that the defendant kept one jungle cat, one bengal cat and one bobcat surrounded by a stockade fence at the back of her yard. Puzas played with the animals and took pictures of them. She later gave the pictures to Sergeant Rick Lewis and Detective Jim Williams, officers of the Connecticut department of environmental protection (DEP). On March 10, 1992, the defendant received a class three license for the rabbit from the USDA under the Animal Welfare Act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2133 (1993); 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.1 through 2.11 (1993). The defendant has never been found to be exempt from General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a by the DEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cOn February 16, 1992, the DEP, under the authority of a warrant secured after the defendant attempted to sell the three cats, removed the animals from the defendant\u2019s premises and placed them in the care of Elaine Burk, an expert in the field of felidae<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the head of Future Promise, a facility where rescued wild animals are cared for. The DEP also issued a misdemeanor complaint to the defendant charging her with a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a. Burk testified that these animals have a genetic propensity to be potentially dangerous. Burk further testified that bobcats weigh from twenty to forty-five pounds and hunt deer in Massachusetts during the winter;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> jungle cats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>weigh from fifteen to thirty pounds and a bengal cat is a cross between an Asian leopard cat and a domestic cat. Burk also testified as to the behavior of each of these animals while in her care. The bobcat bit both her and her husband and used her hind claws to cause lacerations. The jungle cat uses her claws routinely and caused a two and one-half inch bruise on Burk\u2019s thigh. The bengal fought with the bobcat and, when Burk tried to separate the animals, the bengal attacked Burk, causing a laceration completely around her wrist and perforating her forearm four times.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u201cThe trial court found that the defendant possessed potentially dangerous animals in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a. Specifically, the trial court found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant possessed a bobcat, a jungle cat and a bengal cat, (2) the defendant did not qualify for an exemption from General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a, (3) the list in General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a is nonexclusive and serves only as an example of dangerous felidae, (4) the bobcat, whether hybrid or not, is specifically included on the list, (5) the jungle cat and the bengal cat are included on the list as they are of a type similar to those set forth in the list, (6) General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a is not void for vagueness, and (7) the license for the rabbit given under the Animal Welfare Act to the defendant by the USDA does not preempt General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a. Thus, the trial court found the defendant guilty on all three counts and fined her $25.00 on each count.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>34 Conn. App. 741, 743-45, 643 A.2d 271 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">An appeal to the Appellate Court followed. The defendant presented two issues. First, she claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>she is exempt from the prohibitions of \u00a7 26-40a either because: (1) she was operating a zoo; or (2) she possessed other potentially dangerous animals prior to May 23, 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 745. The Appellate Court rejected this claim. Both the defendant\u2019s proffered definition of zoo<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that found in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contain the element of keeping animals for public display. Because the defendant failed to present evidence at trial that she had kept these animals for public exhibition, the Appellate Court held that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not exempt from the prohibitions of \u00a7 26-40a for operating a zoo was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 745-46. Similarly, the Appellate Court held that because the trial court had not credited the defendant\u2019s testimony that she legally possessed other potentially dangerous animals prior to May 23, 1983, the defendant had failed to prove that she was exempt from prosecution. Id., 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Second, the defendant claimed that the trial court had improperly convicted her \u201cbecause the animals [that she possessed] are not specifically listed in the statute or, in the alternative, the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case.\u201d Id., 747. The Appellate Court first discussed the defendant\u2019s bobcat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The defendant claimed that, although purebred bobcats are clearly prohibited by the statute, her bobcat is not included within the prohibitions of the statute because it is a hybrid bobcat. Id. The Appellate Court noted that the trial court had not decided whether the defendant\u2019s bobcat is a hybrid or a purebred. The Appellate Court stated, however, that because it is obvious that a purebred bobcat is prohibited by the statute, it would assume for the sake of the defendant\u2019s argument that her bobcat is a hybrid. Id., 747 n.6. Having first concluded that it is unclear whether the statute applies to a hybrid bobcat, the court looked to DEP regulations to aid it in determining whether a hybrid bobcat falls within the purview of the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 747-48. The court noted that the DEP, in its \u201cregulations created for the enforcement of General Statutes \u00a7 26-55,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>mined that an animal that results from the crossbreeding of any species listed in General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a shall be considered the wild animal of that species. Thus, the DEP considers the crossbreed of a bobcat and a domestic cat to be a bobcat. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 26-55-2.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We see no reason to depart from that interpretation by the DEP. Thus, we conclude that the possession of a hybrid bobcat is prohibited by the statute.\u201d Id., 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The Appellate Court further concluded that \u00a7 26-40a is not -unconstitutionally vague as applied to this hybrid bobcat. The Appellate Court reasoned that \u201c[b]ecause the statute specifically prohibits bobcats, a person of ordinary intelligence has a reasonable opportunity to know that the possession of a hybrid bobcat is prohibited.\u201d Id., 749. Furthermore, the statute provides a stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>dard for law enforcement. \u201cBecause the statute states that bobcats are, as a matter of law, potentially dangerous, law enforcement officers know that they must determine that the animal is a bobcat before a possessor of an animal can be determined to have violated the statute.\u201d Id., 749-50. Therefore, because the statute includes hybrid bobcats and is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to hybrid bobcats, the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction with respect to the bobcat.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In contrast, the Appellate Court concluded that neither the plain language nor the legislative history of \u00a7 26-40a clearly indicates that the legislature intended that the statute apply to jungle cats and bengal cats. The court reasoned that because the term \u201cinclude\u201d can be used as either a word of enlargement or a word of limitation, the plain language of the statute is unclear. In addition, the court stated that the \u201clegislative history fails ... to provide guidance as to whether the statutory prohibition applies to the listed felidae only, to the listed felidae and all other potentially dangerous felidae species, or to the listed felidae and all other potentially dangerous felidae regardless of species.\u201d Id., 750. The court held, therefore, that because the statute fails to inform a person of ordinary intelligence whether the prohibition applies to an animal\u2019s species or to a particular animal\u2019s behavior, possessors of jungle cats and bengal cats are not warned that their possession of these cats violates the statute. Moreover, the statute does not provide guidance to law enforcement officials. Id., 750-51. Thus, the court held that \u00a7 26-40a is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the jungle cat and the bengal cat and reversed the convictions pertaining to those two cats. Id., 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to decide whether the Appellate Court had improperly determined that \u00a7 26-40a is unconstitutionally vague as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>applied to the jungle cat and the bengal cat.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Additionally, we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to address her claim that the Appellate Court had improperly concluded that \u00a7 26-40a is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the hybrid bobcat.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the list of felidae prohibited by the statute is not exclusive and that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to all three cats, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court with respect to the bobcat and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court with respect to the jungle cat and the bengal cat.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In order to decide whether \u00a7 26-40a is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case, we must first consider whether the list of felidae in \u00a7 26-40a is exclusive. In other words, we must determine whether the legislature intended for the felidae listed in the statute to be the sole felidae the possession of which is prohibited or whether the legislature intended the list to serve merely as an example of the types of felidae that are considered potentially dangerous such that the possession of other species of felidae with characteristics similar to those named in the statute is also prohibited.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To do this, we must construe the word \u201cincluding\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>in the portion of \u00a7 26-40a that provides \u201c[f]or the purposes of this section, the following shall be considered as potentially dangerous animals: [t]he felidae, <em>including the </em>lion, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, ocelot, jaguarundi cat, puma, lynx and bobcat . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The defendant argues that the term \u201cincluding\u201d is a term of limitation and that the list of felidae is an exclusive list of the particular cats that are prohibited by this statute. The state, in contrast, argues that the term \u201cincluding\u201d is a term of expansion and that the list serves as an example of the type of felidae the possession of which is prohibited. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cThe purpose of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F.D. Rich Construction Co., </em>233 Conn. 14, 20, 658 A.2d 83 (1995); <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 390, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>[221 Conn. 217, 225, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992)]. If the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words actually used because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F.D. Rich Construction </em>Co., supra, 20; <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987).\u201d <em>Office of Consumer Counsel </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>234 Conn. 624, 642, 662 A.2d 1251 (1995). This court has determined, however, that the word \u201cincluding\u201d is ambiguous. \u201c[T]here is some ambiguity concerning whether the word \u2018including\u2019 . . . was intended as a word of limitation ... or one of enlargement .... We have recognized in the past that the words \u2018include\u2019 and \u2018including\u2019 can be considered as words of limitation as well as enlargement. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>161 Conn. 145, 150, 285 A.2d 352 (1971).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 147, 480 A.2d 519 (1984); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 422-23, 528 A.2d 811 (1987). More recently, however, in a case in which we were asked to decide whether the term \u201cincluding\u201d in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 17-206b<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was a term of limitation or expansion, we concluded that \u201c[t]he legislature\u2019s use of the word \u2018including\u2019 rather than the commonly utilized expression, \u2018shall include,\u2019 evinces an intention to provide an expansive interpretation of the [statute].\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 569, 569 A.2d 518 (1990). Although <em>Mahoney </em>clarified somewhat the prior ambiguity clouding the word \u201cincluding,\u201d it did not conclusively resolve the ambiguity because it inteipreted \u201cincluding\u201d with reference to a particular statute and its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Where the plain language of a statute is ambiguous, \u201cwe must ascertain the intent of the legislature by examining the language of the statute, its legislative history and the purpose the statute is to serve.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 422. Various principles of statutory construction assist us in examining the language of the statute. \u201c[P]rinciples of statutory construction . . . require us to construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 712, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). We must avoid a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>result that the legislature sought to achieve. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 63-64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). <em>[Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra,] 713. <em>Scrapchansky </em>v. <em>Plainfield, </em>226 Conn. 446, 453, 627 A.2d 1329 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>[227 Conn. 534, 542, 630 A.2d 1059 (1993)]; <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>220 Conn. 643, 650-51, 600 A.2d 1 (1991). . . . <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>229 Conn. 618, 624, 642 A.2d 1186 (1994). It is also a rule of statutory construction that those who promulgate statutes or rules do not intend to promulgate statutes or rules that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 92, 662 A.2d 80 (1995); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Uretek, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 706, 719, 543 A.2d 709 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The state argues that the interpretation of \u00a7 26-40a proposed by the defendant would lead to absurd results. It points out that if the list of felidae were exclusive, the possession of many animals that we all would agree are potentially dangerous would not be prohibited. For example, if we were to read the list as exclusive, the possession of a tiger would not be prohibited because a tiger is not included in the list. We agree that this is an absurd and bizarre result. It would be nonsensical to envision the legislature prohibiting possession of animals such as lions and leopards, but permitting possession of animals such as tigers and panthers that are equally potentially dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Furthermore, it is a basic tenet of statutory construction that \u201cno part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase . . . and no word in a statute is to be treated as superfluous.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>227 Conn. 518, 528, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993); accord <em>Office of Consumer Coun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>sel </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 646; <em>LoPresto </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 424, 448, 662 A.2d 738 (1995); <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 100-101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995); <em>First Bethel Associates </em>v. <em>Bethel, </em>231 Conn. 731, 741, 651 A.2d 1279 (1995); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 66. The inteipretation contemplated by the defendant would render the word \u201cfelidae\u201d superfluous. Had the legislature intended the list to be exclusive, there would have been no need to use this word. By using the term \u201cfelidae,\u201d however, and following it with a list of certain types of felidae that share similar characteristics, the legislature apparently intended to prohibit all felidae that are similar to those listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Additionally, our conclusion is supported by the doctrine of ejusdem generis. According to this doctrine, \u201cunless a contrary intent appears, where general terms are followed by specific terms in a statute, the general terms will be construed to embrace things of the same general kind or character as those specifically enumerated.\u201d <em>Scrapchansky </em>v. <em>Plainfield, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 455. The general term in \u00a7 26-40a is \u201cfelidae,\u201d while the specific terms are \u201clion, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, ocelot, jaguarundi cat, puma, lynx and bobcat.\u201d Therefore, according to this doctrine, prohibited \u201cfelidae\u201d include cats that are of the same general kind or character as lions, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars, ocelots, jaguarundi cats, pumas, lynx and bobcats.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 26-40a supports our conclusion that the list of prohibited felidae is not exclusive. That history clearly indicates that this statute was enacted to address concerns about the danger being posed to the general public as a result of the growing number of Connecticut residents possessing wild animals. 12 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1967 Sess., p. 1512; 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1967 Sess., p. 2553. Because the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>of the statute is to protect the public against the unauthorized and uncontrolled keeping of wild animals, it is illogical to prohibit only those felidae specifically listed in the statute when there are other animals that are equally potentially dangerous. Furthermore, there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the legislature intended to limit the prohibited animals to those that are listed. Rather, there is an indication that lends support to our conclusion that the list of animals is not exclusive. For example, when the bill was first recommended, Senator James Tansley stated that \u201c[i]n recent years, it has come to the attention of the Board of Fish and Game that people in Connecticut have, let\u2019s say, been trying to domesticate dangerous wild animals, and there are presently no controls over them. So this bill would, for such animals as lions, leopards, [cheetahs], jaguars, bears, wolves, <em>and so forth, </em>require a permit from the local community.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 12 S. Proc., supra, p. 1512. Subsequently, during Senate proceedings to discuss an amendment to the statute that would place enforcement authority in the DEP instead of the local town or city, Senator George Gunther stated that \u201c[m]ost of the chief executives in the town know very little about the different species of animals and incidentally, it\u2019s quite succinct in the type of animal such as lions, leopards, [cheetahs], [jaguars], [ocelots], puma, [lynx], bobcat . . . <em>and that sort of thing </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 26 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1983 Sess., p. 1512. This legislative history indicates that the legislators did not intend to limit the scope of this statute to those animals that are listed, but rather intended to prohibit those animals that are similar to the \u201csort of thing\u201d that is listed in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Finally, we are instructed by <em>Pinto </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>United States District Court, District of Connecticut, Docket No. B-87-523 (March 24, 1988), in which the District Court, in deciding whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>a Siberian tiger is prohibited by \u00a7 26-40a, held that \u201cthe plain meaning, if not definition, of the term \u2018including\u2019 is that what follows the term is meant to be representative; the list of animals which follow \u2018including\u2019 in Section 26-40 (a) are simply examples of potentially dangerous felidae. Were this not the case and the animals listed were the only animals to which the statute applied, then there would have been no reason for the legislature to include the phrase \u2018the felidae.\u2019 In other words [the] plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation results not only in an unorthodox understanding of the term \u2018including,\u2019 but also in redundant statutory wording. The better interpretation \u2014 one which comports with the plain meaning of the text \u2014 is that the list of animals is a nonexclusive list meant to serve as an example of \u2018potentially dangerous\u2019 felidae. . . . Indeed, an inteipretation that tigers were <em>not </em>subject to the statutory prohibition would \u2018pervert\u2019 the State\u2019s clear purpose of protecting the welfare of its citizens.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Having concluded that \u00a7 26-40a is not exclusive, we must next decide whether bobcats, bengal cats, and jungle cats are prohibited by the statute. We conclude that their possession is prohibited. Although the trial court never made a definitive finding as to whether the defendant\u2019s bobcat is a purebred or a hybrid, because a purebred is clearly prohibited by the statute, we will analyze the question, as did the Appellate Court, as if the defendant\u2019s bobcat were a hybrid. We agree with the Appellate Court that possession of a hybrid bobcat is prohibited. Section 26-55-2 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> provides that a \u201cquadruped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>which results from the crossbreeding of any animal with one of the species listed ... in Section 26-40a . . . shall be considered to be a wild . . . quadruped of that species . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In other words, this regulation dictates that the cross of a bobcat and a domestic cat is to be considered a wild bobcat. Therefore, because a hybrid bobcat is classified as a wild bobcat, it is included in and prohibited by the plain language of \u00a7 26-40a.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Furthermore, jungle cats and bengal cats<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> are prohibited because they are considered potentially dangerous and they share similar characteristics to those animals listed in the statute. Both the state\u2019s expert witness and the defendant testified at trial that these animals are like those listed in the statute in that they have dangerous propensities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial court stated in its oral memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>randum of decision that \u201c[i]t would appear from the testimony that I heard, and that I credit, that the general behavior of the three cats were quite similar. [Burk] described them all as potentially dangerous. [Burk\u2019s] personal description is not so important to me, as to her conclusion that they are all about the same size, that they are wild as opposed to domestic, and they all have similar characteristics, and the conduct of each one of them is similar in her caring of them. So, based on all of that the Court concludes that the three animals, the Bobcat because it is specifically mentioned, the Bengal and the Jungle cat because they are of a similar type, disposition, and species, that they are also intended to be included within the general definition of potentially dangerous animals.\u201d Therefore, because bengai and jungle cats are potentially dangerous felidae that are similar in nature and character to the named cats, we conclude that they fall within \u00a7 26-40a.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The next issue that we must decide is whether \u00a7 26-40a is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case. \u201c[I]n evaluating [a] defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of [a] statute, we read the statute narrowly in order to save its constitutionality, rather than broadly in order to destroy it. \u2018We will indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 79, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 269, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989) [on appeal after remand, 235 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>206, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995)]; <em>McConnell v.

With all the aforementioned criteria in mind, we must determine whether the defendant had sufficient notice and warning that her possession of the cats was prohibited under \u00a7 26-40a.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The defendant testified at trial that she has specialized knowledge of felidae, including their behavioral characteristics and ancestry. She testified that she has owned various cats, including other jungle cats, for over ten years, that she has contact with breeders, that she buys and sells cats, that she reads books and magazines on exotic cats and belongs to a cat club, that she lectures about exotic cats, and that she trained a veterinarian to handle exotic cats properly. Furthermore, she testified that she even telephoned the DEP to inquire whether she could keep her three cats.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Mindful of this defendant\u2019s heightened knowledge of exotic cats and our conclusion that the list of prohibited cats in \u00a7 26-40a is not exclusive,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we next examine whether \u00a7 26-40a warned the defendant that possession at her home of her three cats was prohibited by the statute. We conclude that she was adequately warned.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We agree with the Appellate Court that \u00a7 26-40a sufficiently warned and notified the defendant that possession of a hybrid bobcat was prohibited. Section 26-55-2 classifies a hybrid bobcat as a wild bobcat and \u00a7 26-40a clearly prohibits bobcats. In addition, the defendant has heightened knowledge of bobcats that stems from her experience with handling them, her contact with breeders and her access to literature on bobcats. The combination of these factors provided adequate warning to this defendant that possession of a hybrid bobcat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>violates this statute. Furthermore, the statute provides a standard for law enforcement because it mandates that an officer determine that an animal is a bobcat before its possessor can. be accused of violating the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 362 (statute provides objective standard so that law enforcement officers know what to consider). Therefore, on the facts of this case the statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to bobcats.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We disagree with the Appellate Court that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to bengal and jungle cats. Both the state\u2019s expert witness; see footnote 20; and the trial court\u2019s findings indicate that bengal and jungle cats are potentially dangerous in that they \u201care similar in type, disposition, and species\u201d to those felidae listed in the nonexclusive statute. In addition, because the defendant has owned various cats in the past, including jungle cats, has worked with breeders to buy and sell cats, and reads numerous publications pertaining to these cats, she must be deemed to be aware of the characteristics of these animals. Therefore, we conclude that this defendant was adequately warned and notified that either her cats are prohibited or that, at a minimum, she should have inquired further to determine if they are prohibited. The defendant did not need to guess at the meaning of the statute. She simply had to compare the cats that she owned to those listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the statute in order to conclude that they are of like character and are, therefore, similarly potentially dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Furthermore, the statute provides adequate guidance to law enforcement officials. Id., 362. The statute creates standards that will avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The statute applies only to potentially dangerous felidae and provides a list of examples of such potentially dangerous felidae to which law enforcement officials can compare other felidae, such as bengal and jungle cats, to determine if a cat that is not named in the statute is similar to one that is named. Therefore, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to bengal and jungle cats.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of a potentially dangerous animal under \u00a7 26-40a with respect to the bobcat is affirmed; the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of a potentially dangerous animal under \u00a7 26-40a with respect to the bengal and jungle cats is reversed, and the case is remanded to that corut with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court pertaining to those two cats.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a provides: \u201cPossession of potentially dangerous animals. <em>For the purposes of this section, the following shall be considered as potentially dangerous animals: The felidae, including the lion, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, ocelot, jaguarundi cat, puma, lynx and bobcat; </em>the canidae, including the wolf and coyote; and the ursidae, including the black bear, grizzly bear and brown bear.

Any hypothetical application that is not vague would save the statute. Because neither party has challenged the constitutionality of this statute on its face, we need only examine whether \u00a7 26-40a is vague as applied to the facts of this case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>200 Conn. 664, 666 n.3, 513 A.2d 646 (1986); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Bieluch v.

Conn. March 24, 1988), that \u00a7 26-40a includes other potentially dangerous animals that are not specifically listed in \u00a7 26-40a, (b) the conspicuous absence of many potentially dangerous animals from the statute, such as tigers, and (c) the defendant\u2019s specialized knowledge of the character of these animals.

Consequently, we do not decide whether an owner of, for example, a tenth generation hybrid would be sufficiently warned that possession of such an animal is potentially illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
