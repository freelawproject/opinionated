Cohen was one of a group of plaintiffs at trial that included students, donors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>alumni, and a former trustee, who brought this action against the defendants, the University of Bridgeport (university), the university\u2019s board of trustees (board) and the Professors World Peace Academy (academy),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenging the validity of a contractual agreement between the university and the academy, and seeking certain declaratory and injunctive relief. The defendants moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that each of the plaintiffs lacked standing to attack the validity of the agreement. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions as to all of the plaintiffs and dismissed the complaint. Only Cohen, the life trustee, appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The university is a nonstock, nonprofit corporation, originally chartered in 1927 by special act of the legislature to operate a college.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The university\u2019s internal governance structure is set out in its bylaws. The \u201crights, powers and privileges\u201d of the university are vested in a board of trustees. The bylaws create three categories of trustees: \u201cterm trustees,\u201d \u201clife trustees\u201d and \u201chonorary trustees.\u201d Term trustees serve four year terms, are counted in determining a quorum of the board, vote on board action, hold office and serve as members and chairpersons of the standing and executive committees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Life and honorary trustees are deemed to \u201chave all the privileges of a Trustee\u201d but may not \u201cvote, or hold any office or standing committee chair, or be a member of the Executive Committee, nor be counted in determining a quorum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Cohen was elected life trustee in 1988. As a life trustee, she attended and participated in deliberations at board meetings and served on the academic affairs committee. During 1990 and 1991, the university experienced serious financial distress. After considering a number of options to improve the university\u2019s financial position, the board entered into a financial agreement with the academy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in May, 1992.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the core of the agreement, relevant to the merits of Cohen\u2019s challenge, was the academy\u2019s promise to loan the university $50.5 million over several years, which loan would become a grant upon fulfillment of the contract conditions. In exchange for that loan, the university granted the academy a security interest in the university\u2019s property and the right, embodied in the university\u2019s bylaws, to nominate 60 percent of the board\u2019s voting members.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Prior to instituting this action, several of the plaintiffs had brought a substantially similar declaratory judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ment action against the university, the board, the academy, and the board of governors for higher education. The trial court, however, had dismissed that action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction owing to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to particularize sufficiently their claim of aggrievement. <em>Steeneck </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford, Docket No. CV 93 0131577 (July 29, 1993). The original plaintiffs, together with five additional plaintiffs, subsequently instituted the present declaratory judgment action against the same defendants, alleging, inter alia, that the agreement and certain amendments to the university\u2019s bylaws implementing the terms of the agreement violated state law, public policy and a charter requirement to operate as a nonsectarian institution. They sought to have the agreement declared invalid and to have the university enjoined from operating and conferring degrees, or, alternatively, to have the court appoint a receiver to remove the present board of trustees and select a new board not affiliated with the academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In this case, the defendants again moved to dismiss these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of lack of standing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In their revised complaint, the plaintiffs claimed to possess \u201clegal and equitable interests which are endangered by reason of [the] agreement and the present governance structure at [the University of Bridgeport] in that . . . Ruth Steinkraus Cohen is a life trustee of [the University of Bridgeport], and as such she has fiduciary duties to the University; she has a property and personal interest in ensuring that the University operates lawfully and in compliance with its charter, and she has a property interest in being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>notified of the deliberations that she was excluded from that led to the acceptance by [the University of Bridgeport] of the . . . agreement.\u201d Following a hearing on issues regarding the student plaintiffs\u2019 standing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> two of the three student plaintiffs withdrew from the action, and the action was withdrawn as to the board of governors for higher education. In a posthearing brief, Cohen asserted, as an additional basis for permitting herself, as life trustee, to maintain the action, that she had statutory standing under General Statutes \u00a7 33-429<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to challenge the agreement as ultra vires.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The trial court concluded that Cohen had failed to demonstrate a sufficient personal and legal interest in enforcing the operation of the university in accordance with its charter to satisfy the requirements of common law standing. As to statutory standing, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>concluded that, even if Cohen could qualify as a \u201cmember\u201d of the university,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the agreement constituted a completed transaction not subject to ultra vires challenge under \u00a7 33-429 and that Cohen lacked statutory standing as well. The trial court concluded that all of the other plaintiffs lacked standing, and thus dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This appeal, by Cohen only, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Cohen argues that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) she lacked statutory standing under \u00a7 33-429 to bring an ultra vires claim; and (2) she was not sufficiently aggrieved by the board\u2019s actions to establish common law standing. Specifically, she argues that, as a life trustee, she is properly considered a \u201cdirector\u201d under \u00a7 33-429, and that the question whether the agreement is a completed transaction is a substantive question not properly resolved as a matter of standing. Alternatively, she argues that if she is not a director under \u00a7 33-429, she nevertheless has common law standing, either as a fiduciary, or as a party with a \u201cspecial interest\u201d in the enforcement of the university\u2019s charter terms, to maintain an action to enjoin the board\u2019s allegedly ultra vires acts. We are unpersuaded by these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\u201cIt is a basic principle of our law . . . that the plaintiffs must have standing in order for a court to have jurisdiction to render a declaratoiy judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>218 Conn. 335, 346, 589 A.2d 356 (1991); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>see Practice Book \u00a7 390 (a) and (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cA party pursuing declaratory relief must . . . demonstrate, as in ordinary actions, a \u2018justiciable right\u2019 in the controversy sought to be resolved, that is, \u2018contract, property or personal rights ... as such will be affected by the [court\u2019s] decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 348, quoting <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Dunnigan, </em>138 Conn. 263, 267, 83 A.2d 491 (1951). \u201cWhen standing is put in issue, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of the issue and not whether the controversy is otherwise justiciable, or whether, on the merits, the plaintiff has a legally protected interest that the defendant\u2019s action has invaded.\u201d <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 492, 400 A.2d 726 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Standing is established by showing that the party claiming it is authorized by statute to bring suit or is classically aggrieved. Cf. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>27 Conn. App. 297, 605 A.2d 885 (1992). \u201cThe fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, \u2018the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in [the challenged action], as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the [challenged action].\u2019 \u201d <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 493, quoting <em>Nader </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Altermatt, </em>166 Conn. 43, 51, 347 A.2d 89 (1974). \u201cThe determination of aggrievement presents a question of fact for the trial court and a plaintiff has the burden of proving that fact.\u201d <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>supra, 493. \u201cThe conclusions reached by the trial court cannot be disturbed on appeal unless the subordinate facts do not support them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 300, 309, 603 A.2d 1131 (1992). Where a plaintiff lacks standing to sue, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>226 Conn. 704, 717, 629 A.2d 333 (1993).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">STATUTORY STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The parties agree that the university, as a nonstock, nonprofit corporation, is governed by the Nonstock Corporation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 33-419 et seq. (act).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cohen argues that the characteristics of the life trustee position at the university are such that she qualifies as a \u201cdirector\u201d under the act, and is thus a party specifically authorized under \u00a7 33-429 to bring an ultra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>vires challenge to the board\u2019s actions with regard to the agreement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants that a life trustee is not a director for purposes of the act, and thus Cohen\u2019s claim to statutory standing fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">In construing statutes, our goal is to discern and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrouding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431-32, 650 A.2d 557 (1994); <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The term \u201cdirector\u201d is not defined in the act;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> however, the term \u201cboard of directors\u201d is defined as \u201cthe group of persons vested with the management of the affairs of a corporation irrespective of the name by which such group is designated.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 33-421 (b); cf. General Statutes \u00a7 33-447 (a) (\u201c[s]ubject to any provisions pertaining thereto contained in the certificate of incorporation, the activities, property and affairs of a corporation shall be managed by its board of directors\u201d). This general, functional definition, and the more specific aspects of the role of a director contemplated by the act; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 33-455 (voting rights and director liability); General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>utes \u00a7 33-473 (b) (2) (same); General Statutes \u00a7 33-447 (d) (standards of performance of management duties); reflect the common understanding that directors of a corporation are persons charged, as members of a body that acts collectively on behalf of the corporation, with both authority, ordinarily including voting power, and responsibility for conducting its affairs, and are subject to corresponding liability, collectively and individually, for the exercise of that authority and the discharge of management responsibilities.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">To determine whether Cohen, as a life trustee, qualifies as a director under the act, we look to the university\u2019s bylaws. In this regard, we note that the act clearly envisions that individual corporations may deviate from the simple, traditional framework it recognizes for corporate management. See General Statutes \u00a7 33-420.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Thus, corporations may and, as in the present case, do create positions that possess some but not all of the attributes traditionally associated with directorship. While we do not identify here a specific formula or combination of management qualities that will suffice to render a person in such a position a director under the act,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we acknowlege the defendants\u2019 concern that the ability attached to director status to bring an ultra vires challenge, and thereby frustrate major corporate initiatives approved by a majority of the managing board, is a significant power, of potentially great consequence for the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Ultimately, the question to be considered in determining the status of one who claims to be a director under the act is whether that person is intended to have a significant managerial role in the corporation\u2019s affairs. The corporate bylaws and certificates of incorporation typically do not specifically address the power to bring an ultra vires challenge. Therefore, it is appropriate, in evaluating whether a position qualifies as a directorship, to focus on the nature of its role within the corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ration, and to require the party outside of the traditional management framework to demonstrate that his or her position carries the ability, in some substantial sense, to direct the corporation\u2019s operation and future.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Our review of the university\u2019s bylaws, together with the limited record provided us by Cohen on this issue, leads us to conclude that the life trustee position is largely an honorary one, to which genuine and substantial management functions do not attach. Article II, \u00a7 1, of the university\u2019s bylaws, which addresses the powers of the board, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAll of the rights, powers and privileges of this Corporation, and of the incorporators thereof, are hereby vested in a Board of Trustees to consist of not fewer than eleven (11), nor more than thirty-nine (39) persons, not including Life or Honorary Trustees.\u201d Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 33-448 (b) (permitting bylaws to fix number of directorships, absolutely or by listing minimum and maximum number). Although this provision does not necessarily render the life trustee a nonmember of the board; cf. bylaws, art. II, \u00a7 8 (\u201c[a] quorum of the Board of Trustees shall consist of thirty percent [30%] of the members of the Board eligible to vote but not less than seven [7] <em>voting </em>members\"[emphasis added]); bylaws, art. V (addressing membership on standing committees in terms of \u201cvoting members\u201d and simply \u201cmembers\u201d); it indicates at least that life trustees are different from term trustees for some purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Article II, \u00a7 3, of the bylaws specifically describes the functions of the life trustee: \u201cA Life Trustee shall have all the privileges of a Trustee, except that such Life Trustee may not vote or hold any office or standing committee chair, or be a member of the Executive Committee, nor be counted in determining a quorum.\u201d This provision confirms that the life trustee\u2019s functions as a member of the board are severely limited. Cohen concedes that she is prohibited completely from voting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>on any action proposed to be taken by the board. Moreover, both parties agree that her role on the board is limited to attending board meetings and participating in the board\u2019s deliberations. Further, she is unambiguously excluded from membership on the executive committee, a body generally recognized as a subgroup of the corporation\u2019s board of directors created in order to exercise, to some extent, the board\u2019s authority to act on behalf of the corporation. See General Statutes \u00a7 33-452. As to standing committees, it is not clear from the bylaws that a life trustee may serve as a member of any committee besides the academic affairs committee, or that a life trustee may vote as a member of any standing committee.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the counsel for Cohen suggested at oral argument that the bylaws <em>could </em>be read to permit both membership and voting rights on all of the standing committees, he presented no evidence to support that reading, such as a practice or example in the university\u2019s history under these bylaws of either event taking place, and we are not persuaded on this record that it is the most sensible reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In sum, we conclude that in creating the life trustee position, the university intended to establish a role restricted to influencing board action by persuasion rather than by the exercise of power, and unencumbered by traditional management responsibilities. Although participation in board and certain committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>deliberations is an important function, potentially of great value both to the university and the individual, we cannot say that it is sufficient to render a position limited to those functions one of a true director. As such, Cohen is not properly considered a \u201cdirector\u201d under the act, and thus does not have statutory standing under \u00a7 33-429 to bring suit to enjoin acts of the university as ultra vires.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">COMMON LAW STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Cohen next claims that even if she lacks statutory standing as a director under the act, she nevertheless has common law standing, either as a fiduciary or as a party with a \u201cspecial interest\u201d in the administration of the university in accordance with its charter, to maintain an ultra vires challenge to the university\u2019s actions. Her claim is premised on the legal trend, with regard to charitable organizations, to extend principles of trust law applicable to charitable trusts to charitable corporations. See 2 Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 348, comment (f) (1959) (\u201c[o]rdinarily the principles and rules applicable to charitable trusts are applicable to charitable corporations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Cohen relies primarily on <em>Holt </em>v. <em>College of Osteopathic Physicians &amp; Surgeons, </em>61 Cal. 2d 750, 394 P.2d 932, 40 Cal. Rptr. 244 (1964), in which the California Supreme Court considered whether minority trustees of the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, a charitable corporation, had the capacity to sue the corporation\u2019s majority trustees to enjoin an allegedly improper use of corporate assets in breach of a charita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ble trust.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In light of the similarity in functions between a charitable trust and a charitable corporation, and between the roles of a trustee of a charitable trust and a director of a charitable corporation; (both are \u201csolely responsible for administering the trust assets . . . and in both cases they are fiduciaries in performing their trust duties\u201d; id., 756); the California court concluded that the principle of trust law that \u201cthe Attorney General does not have exclusive power to enforce a charitable trust and that a trustee or other person having a sufficient special interest may also bring an action for this purpose\u201d was properly applied to charitable corporations. Id., 753.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As a result, the court held that the minority trustees of the defendant charitable corporation, as \u201cfiduciaries who are both few in number and charged with the duty of managing the charity\u2019s affairs\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 755; had the capacity to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Cohen\u2019s reliance on the extension of trust principles to charitable corporations is unavailing. It is evident from <em>Holt </em>that its holding is premised on the determination that directors of a charitable corporation are analogous to actual trustees of a charitable trust. Because of their substantially similar roles, it may well be appropriate to treat charitable corporation directors like actual trustees for purposes of standing to enforce the charity\u2019s purposes. Even if it is assumed that the university is a charitable corporation; but see <em>Common Fund </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>228 Conn. 375, 636 A.2d 795 (1994); Cohen\u2019s \u201ccommon law\u201d standing claim, which appears to have been incorporated in \u00a7 33-429, fails for the same reasons as did her claim to statutory standing: according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>university\u2019s bylaws, she is not \u201ccharged with the duty of managing the charity\u2019s affairs\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Holt </em>v. <em>College of Osteopathic Physicians &amp; Surgeons, </em>supra, 61 Cal. 2d 755; and is thus neither a true trustee, nor a director, of the university. Cohen does not offer, nor do we find, any application of this approach to an individual accorded only the ability to deliberate with the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Cohen also claims common law standing under a \u201cspecial interest\u201d exception to the general rule that beneficiaries of a charitable trust may not bring suit to enforce the trust, but rather are represented exclusively by the attorney general. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>344 So. 2d 1210, 1212 (Ala. 1977) (adopting rule that \u201cbeneficiaries with a sufficient special interest in the enforcement of a charitable trust can institute a suit as to that trust,\u201d and finding that, where grants and loans made to institution were for purpose of upgrading faculty, staff, and student body, those parties have sufficient special interest); <em>Hooker </em>v. <em>Edes Home, </em>579 A.2d 608 (D.C. App. 1990) (recognizing principle that beneficiaries with \u201cspecial interest\u201d in charitable trust may sue to enjoin breach of trust); <em>Y.M.C.A. of Washington </em>v. <em>Covington, </em>484 A.2d 589 (D.C. App. 1984) (same); 2 Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 391 (1959). We agree with the defendants that, even if a right of action in favor of those who benefit from the operation of a charitable corporation survived passage of \u00a7 33-429,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the university is such a corporation, Cohen does not claim to be a beneficiary of the university, much less one with a \u201cspecial interest\u201d distinguishing her from other members of the public, nor does she point to any authority that suggests that the \u201cspecial interest\u201d doctrine has any application to a party in her role at the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>We conclude that Cohen has failed to satisfy her burden of demonstrating standing under either \u00a7 33-429 or the theories of common law aggrievement advanced. If a plaintiff lacks standing to sue, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 717.

The plaintiff Ruth Steinkraus Cohen, a lifetime trustee of the defendant University of Bridgeport (university), has standing to bring this claim challenging the alleged ultra vires agreement between the university and the Professors World Peace Academy (academy). Her standing is based upon both the Nonstock Corporation Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 33-419 et seq.; and the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">It is clear that the determination of whether Cohen has standing must be viewed in the context of the allegations of the complaint. Chief Justice Peters, writing for a unanimous court, pointed out in <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 321 n.6, 439 A.2d 349 (1981), that standing \u201crequires no more than a colorable claim of injury; a plaintiff ordinarily establishes his standing by <em>allegations </em>of injury. Similarly, standing exists to attempt to vindicate \u2018arguably\u2019 protected interests. <em>Ducharme </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>161 Conn. 135, 139, 285 A.2d 318 (1971); see also <em>Assn. of Data Processing Service Organizations </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S. Ct. 827, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1970).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We, therefore, must review this issue within the context of the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">On May 5, 1927, the state of Connecticut granted the university a charter requiring that it be operated as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>nonsectarian educational institution. Cohen alleges that the agreement entered into between the academy and the university constitutes an ultra vires act in part because it renders the university a sectarian institution. The academy was founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon to further the goals of the Unification Church, which are to create a worldwide theocracy and to abolish the separation of church and state. Moreover, it is alleged that the $50,500,000 loan given by the academy to the university under the terms of the agreement was financed by the Unification Church. In return for the loan, the agreement, among other things, empowers the academy to select in perpetuity 60 percent of the seats on the board of trustees of the university. In addition to violating the university\u2019s charter, Cohen\u2019s complaint avers that the validity of the agreement is marred by conflicts of interest. Among the conflicts alleged, Cohen asserts that the trustees of the university \u201chad personal financial interests in enforcing the agreement with the [academy] and the Unification Church in that said agreement reheves the trustees individually for liability stemming from their use of restricted endowment and scholarship funds.\u201d Due to these alleged improprieties and ultra vires acts, Cohen seeks, among other things, a judgment declaring the agreement to be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Although absent from the majority\u2019s opinion, the analysis of whether Cohen has standing should begin with our time honored rule that \u201c[standing is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 Conn. 646, 648-49, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>556 A.2d 1020, on remand, 19 Conn. App. 539, 563 A.2d 314, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 819, 565 A.2d 539 (1989). Standing, therefore, is not to be a review of the merits. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>U.S. , 115 S. Ct. 1611, 1615 n.2, 131 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1995) (\u201c[t]he sole issue in this case, however, is whether one in [the plaintiffs] situation has standing to sue . . . and to that issue the strength of [the plaintiffs] case on the merits is not relevant\u201d). Rather standing is merely a preliminary inquiry. Indeed, it should be remembered that an individual may have standing to bring a meritless claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">As the majority notes, the bylaws of the university create a board of trustees comprised of three distinct positions that constitute the institution\u2019s governance: \u201cterm trustees,\u201d \u201clife trustees\u201d and \u201chonorary trustees.\u201d Life trustees are vested, under the bylaws, with \u201call the privileges of a Trustee,\u201d but may not \u201cvote or hold any office or standing committee chair, or be a member of the Executive Committee, nor be counted in determining a quorum.\u201d In this case, Cohen was made a life trustee in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The parties agreed that the university is subject to the act. Under the act, standing is granted to both \u201cdirectors\u201d and \u201cmembers\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of a nonstock corporation to bring an action to enjoin the corporation from performing ultra vires acts. General Statutes \u00a7 33-429. The university\u2019s bylaws, however, do not employ the term \u201cdirector.\u201d Nevertheless, the majority concedes, and the parties agree, that the \u201cterm trustees\u201d of the university are the functional equivalent of \u201cdirectors\u201d for purposes of the act. It must therefore be determined whether a \u201clife trustee\u201d may also be considered a \u201cdirector\u201d for the puiposes of standing under the act. If stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ing is not to be employed as a technical bar, then the statute permitting standing in order to challenge an ultra vires act should be broadly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Although \u201cdirector\u201d is not defined in the act, \u201cboard of directors\u201d is defined as \u201cthe group of persons vested with the management of the affairs of a corporation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 33-421 (b). Today, this court has decided to define \u201cdirector\u201d as one who has a \u201csignificant managerial role in the corporation\u2019s affairs.\u201d This definition was not advanced by either party, nor is any authority cited in its support. Nevertheless, Cohen, in her capacity as a life trustee, has a \u201csignificant managerial role\u201d within the board of trustees, the body charged with managing the affairs of the university. Despite the fact that life trustees do not have the same responsibilities as term trustees,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including the right to vote, Cohen, nevertheless actively exercised her right to participate in the board of trustees\u2019 deliberations and served on the board\u2019s important academic affairs committee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, her input was critical when the board of trustees first rejected the agreement that was eventually entered into with the academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">It is also clear that, in granting standing to a mere \u201cmember\u201d of a nonstock corporation who has no role in the management of the affairs of the corporation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>see <em>Sterner </em>v. <em>Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club, Inc., </em>188 Conn. 531, 535, 450 A.2d 369 (1982); the legislature could not have intended to deny a nonvoting trustee statutory standing under the act. Statutory construction requires us \u201cto construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purposes or lead to absurd results.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 712, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). In light of the fact that a mere \u201cmember\u201d has standing to enjoin ultra vires acts, it is absurd for this court to require that a life trustee must have \u201csignificant managerial\u201d powers or the right to vote before her standing will be recognized.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Skokie Valley Professional Building </em>v. <em>Skokie Valley Community Hospital, </em>74 Ill. App. 3d 569, 573, 393 N.E.2d 510 (1979) (right to vote is not a litmus test for a \u201cmember\u201d to have standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Notwithstanding the broad scope of \u00a7 33-429 and the fact that our policy for finding standing should be liberally exercised, the majority concludes, without citation to any authority, that because Cohen serves as a nonvoting trustee, she is not a party authorized to bring suit. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In addition to her statutory standing under the act, 1 also conclude that Cohen has standing under the common law by virtue of her position as a trustee. The law is restated as follows: \u201cA suit can be maintained for the enforcement of a charitable trust by the Attorney General or other public officer, <em>or by a co-trustee, </em>or by a person who has a special interest in the enforcement of the charitable trust . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 2 Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 391 (1959). This rule of trustee standing has equal application to the trustee of a charitable corporation. \u201c \u2018The cotrustee is also in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the best position to learn about breaches of trust and to bring the relevant facts to a court\u2019s attention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holt </em>v. <em>College of Osteopathic Physicians &amp; Surgeons, </em>61 Cal. 2d 750, 756, 394 P.2d 932, 40 Cal. Rptr. 244 (1964), quoting K. Karst, \u201cThe Efficiency of the Charitable Dollar: An Unfulfilled State Responsibility,\u201d 73 Harv. L. Rev. 433, 444 (1960) (minority member of board of trustees of university has standing to bring suit to enforce charitable purpose); see <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>17 U.S. 518, 645, 4 S. Ct. 526, 4 L. Ed. 629 (1819). Similarly in this case, Cohen served as a trustee of the university, a charitable corporation, and as such was in an optimal position to detect whether the corporation was acting in an impermissible manner. Therefore, Cohen should be granted the same standing as would be accorded a cotrustee of a charitable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">When Cohen accepted the position of life trustee she was bestowed with certain privileges and in return she bore certain responsibilities, one of which was to ensure that the university, through its board of trustees, acted in an appropriate and beneficial manner. Cohen alleges that the term trustees, who allegedly have serious conflicts of interest, voted to enter into an agreement that directly contradicts the university\u2019s charter, which mandates that the institution remain nonsectarian. Indeed, the agreement allegedly places the university under the control of the academy whose mission is to advance the goals of the Unification Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The majority holds that, as a life trustee, Cohen is powerless to access the machinery of the court in order to prevent the university from engaging in ultra vires conduct. This cannot be the case. In the context of this case, any difference between a \u201clife trustee\u201d and a \u201ccotrustee\u201d is merely semantical. Therefore, I believe that Cohen has both statutory standing as a \u201cdirector\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>and common law standing as a trustee to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> Cohen does not claim that she is a \u201cmember,\u201d for as she indicates, the university has no \u201cmembers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> Article II, \u00a7 3, of the university\u2019s bylaws provides: \u201cThere is hereby created a category of Life Trustee.

The Committee shall also recommend candidates for honorary degrees to the Board of Trustees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\"> Although the court, in footnote 18 of the majority opinion, states that the right to vote is not an essential attribute of a \u201cdirector,\u201d it certainly appears that Cohen\u2019s nonvoting status was dispositive in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
