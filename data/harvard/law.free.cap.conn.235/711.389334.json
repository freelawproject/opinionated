The victim lived in Cheshire with her husband and four children in a house owned by the victim\u2019s mother. On the evening of May 3, 1990, the victim, who had been drinking, and her mother had an argument. The victim then took her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>children and left the house, driving away in her car. Family members notified the police, who stopped the victim and arrested her for disorderly conduct and criminal mischief. The children were taken home and the victim, after being processed at the police station, was permitted to leave. Unable to contact her husband, the victim called a friend, who, shortly before midnight, dropped the victim off at a bar in Southington. Still unable to contact her husband, she ordered a drink at the bar, where she met the defendant and his girlfriend. The victim complained to the defendant about her arrest and explained that she was having difficulty finding a ride home. After the defendant had offered the victim a ride home, the victim, the defendant and his girlfriend left the bar together. Only then did the victim realize that the defendant and his girlfriend were driving separate cars. The defendant told his girlfriend that he would drive the victim home and then meet the girlfriend at their home in approximately ten minutes. The victim got into the defendant\u2019s car. They were stopped almost immediately by the Cheshire police because the defendant\u2019s car had a broken taillight. The police officer, who had known the victim for many years, observed her in the passenger seat and later testified that she appeared to be fine. The police officer gave the defendant a verbal warning and released the parties. Instead of taking the victim home, the defendant drove her to a secluded, wooded area.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">With respect to subsequent events, the parties diverge in their versions of what occurred. The victim testified at trial that when they had arrived at the secluded area, the defendant had gone to the passenger side of the car and had asked her to get out. When the victim refused to leave the car, the defendant grabbed her and dragged her out by her hair. He then dragged her, on her back, across a gravel driveway to a leafy area, where he pinned her down, removed portions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>her clothing, and attempted to force her to engage in fellatio. The victim testified further that she had been able to distract the defendant and run back to the car. The defendant caught up with the victim in the car and forced her to have vaginal intercourse on the front passenger seat, during which he ejaculated. The defendant then took the victim home, where she called the police and reported having been sexually assaulted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The defendant testified that the victim had asked him to take her to a secluded area, where she had consented to sexual intercourse. He testified that the intercourse had taken place in a leafy and rocky area away from the car, and he denied having had intercourse inside the car. He stated that on the ride back to the victim\u2019s house, she had pulled leaves and debris from her hair. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>34 Conn. App. 276, 280, 641 A.2d 426 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment. Id., 276. We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>230 Conn. 591, 646 A.2d 118 (1994) (prejudice caused by trial court\u2019s failure to enforce sequestration order merited new trial). <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>231 Conn. 902, 645 A.2d 1021 (1994). Upon reconsideration, the Appellate Court affirmed its previous judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>36 Conn. App. 912, 649 A.2d 262 (1994). This second certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony of one of the defendant\u2019s medical expert witnesses, due to the violation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>sequestration order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was harmless error. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s improper exclusion of his expert witness\u2019 testimony violated his constitutional right to present a defense and, even if the impropriety was not of constitutional magnitude, the Appellate Court used an inappropriate standard in applying the harmless error doctrine. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The trial began on April 23, 1991. Prior to the taking of any evidence, the court asked both parties whether either of them intended to request a sequestration order. Both the state and the defendant represented that a sequestration order was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The victim testified on the first day of the trial, stating that after the defendant had dragged her across the gravel driveway to the leafy area and had attempted to force her to engage in fellatio, she had escaped and had ran back to the car. She further testified that the defendant then had forced her to have intercourse on the front passenger seat of the car, during which, she believed, he had ejaculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">As additional evidence in its case-in-chief, the state called as a witness Sultan Quarishi, the emergency room physician who had examined the victim. Quarishi testified that the victim\u2019s injuries were consistent with her having been dragged across the ground, but conceded on cross-examination that it was impossible to determine definitively what had caused the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>The state also called as a witness Marybeth Guman, a criminalist at the state police forensic laboratory. Guman testified that hair had been found in the defendant\u2019s car and on clothing belonging to both the victim and the defendant. She testified that the hair was consistent with that of the victim, that it was remarkable in amount, and that she had never encountered a crime scene with so much hair linked to one person.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">When the defendant commenced the presentation of his case, he objected to the fact that one of the detectives who had testified on behalf of the state was seated at counsel table with the assistant state\u2019s attorney, assisting with the trial. The defendant, claiming that the detective\u2019s presence at counsel table was prejudicial, moved that the detective be required to leave. After the court denied the motion, the defendant moved, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 876; see footnote 3; that the detective be sequestered. Subsequently, the state moved for a mutual sequestration order, which the court issued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The defendant called as a witness Michael Conroy, a surgeon, to testify about the cause of the victim\u2019s injuries, particularly scratches and abrasions on her back. After Conroy had given preliminary testimony about his background, the state requested an offer of proof regarding the evidence Conroy would be offering and his credentials to offer that evidence. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>offer of proof, Conroy revealed that he had been provided with, and had reviewed the preceding evening, a transcription of a portion of Quarishi\u2019s testimony. The trial court determined that the defendant had violated the sequestration order by providing Conroy with a copy of Quarishi\u2019s testimony. As a sanction for this violation, the court precluded Conroy from testifying further, and struck the testimony that he had already given.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court allowed the defendant nine days to obtain the services of another witness to testify in lieu of Conroy. The defendant retained another surgeon, Jack Huse, who subsequently testified as an expert witness regarding the victim\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">During the offer of proof regarding Conroy\u2019s proposed testimony, Conroy, a graduate of Yale College and Cornell Medical School, had acknowledged that there are forensic criminalists who are trained in the reconstruction of crimes, but that he had received no such training. He stated that his knowledge regarding the etiology of wounds had come \u201cfrom experience\u201d rather than from specific training. He also stated that the only time he had visited the secluded area where the assault had taken place, in order to observe the conditions there, was on the preceding day, more than one year after the assault. Conroy proposed to testify that the victim\u2019s injuries were consistent with her hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ing engaged in active sex in the leafy area but were inconsistent with her having been dragged head first over the gravel driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Huse, avascular surgeon, was a graduate of Dennison University and Hahneman University Medical School. He, too, lacked training in crime reconstruction. He testified that he had never received any training in the area of forensic science, had never taken any courses in crime scene reconstruction, and had no qualifications or credentials as a criminalist. Like Conroy, Huse had not visited the crime scene until shortly before he was to testify. Huse testified that the victim\u2019s injuries could have resulted from consensual sexual intercourse in the leafy, rocky area at the site of the assault. He also testified that it would be very difficult to drag someone by the hair from behind, and that \u201c[t]he first response of someone who has [her] hair pulled and the attempt to be dragged from behind is that [she] will turn around and right [herself] so [she] will be pulled forward rather than backwards.\u201d Huse further testified that if the victim\u2019s shirt were on and she were being pulled backward, as she claimed, the shirt would have protected her back and that the angle of pulling would have kept her back off the ground, thus avoiding injuries to her back. In addition, Huse testified that had the victim and the defendant had consensual intercourse in the leafy area, and had the victim, on the ride home, attempted to remove the leaves and other debris, a substantial amount of hair follicles would have come out and would have been present in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The defendant argues that precluding Conroy from testifying was incorrect and of constitutional proportion because it prevented the defendant from presenting an effective defense. Maintaining that \u201c[m]edical experts are not fungible\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>supra, 34 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Conn. App. 299 (O\u2019Connell, <em>J., </em>dissenting); and that \u201c[o]ne expert may have more \u2018presence\u2019 and greater credibility, and thus be viewed by the trier of fact as more persuasive,\u201d the defendant urges that this court \u201cshould not assume that the second choice \u2014 a choice \u2018forced\u2019 upon the defense \u2014 was as good as its first choice.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">We note, first, that for purposes of this analysis, we will assume that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Conroy\u2019s testimony was an excessive sanction, and was, therefore, an abuse of discretion. We make this assumption, however, not because we have determined it to be so, but because that was the Appellate Court\u2019s stance in deciding this case, and that was how we certified the relevant question. We therefore review the case in that procedural posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Ordinarily, the remedy for violation of a sequestration order lies in the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 27, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). We acknowledge, however, that, under particular circumstances, the unjustified exclusion of a witness\u2019 testimony can amount to a deprivation of the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense. See, e.g., <em>Braswell </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>463 F.2d 1148, 1155-56 (5th Cir. 1972) (holding that trial court\u2019s discretionary exclusion of sole corroborating witness\u2019 testimony denied defendant fundamental constitutional right). If an impropriety is of constitutional proportions, the state bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 253-54, 630 A.2d 577 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We acknowledge that experts are not fungible. In this case, however, both Conroy and Huse were surgeons, neither of whom specialized in the area of crime reconstruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet, despite their lack of experience in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>field of crime reconstruction, both Conroy and Huse were asked to testify regarding how this incident could have happened, given the victim\u2019s injuries and the conditions present at the site of the assault. Although, as the defendant suggests, Conroy attended what some might regard as more prestigious schools than those Huse had attended, the subject of the testimony that both Conroy and Huse were asked to provide was not within the core of those witnesses\u2019 expertise, and we are not convinced that, for such a purpose, Conroy had credentials that were superior to those of Huse. We are similarly unpersuaded that there was anything in the proposed testimony of Conroy that was substantively different than what was actually presented by Huse. In fact, Huse\u2019s testimony that a person would not be dragged in the manner described by the victim is more supportive of the defendant\u2019s rendition of the facts than Conroy\u2019s proposed testimony. Precluding Conroy from testifying, therefore, did not prevent the defendant from presenting an effective defense and did not violate his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Because we conclude that any impropriety in this case is nonconstitutional, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court\u2019s error caused him harm. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>220 Conn. 652, 661, 600 A.2d 1343 (1991); <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>215 Conn. 148, 153, 575 A.2d 206 (1990). The defendant maintains that the Appellate Court employed an improper standard in concluding that the exclusion of Conroy as an expert witness was harmless. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The standard for determining whether a nonconstitutional error is harmless is that \u201c[t]he defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>ous action of the court affected the result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 544, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 106, 511 A.2d 1246 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 269, 576 A.2d 139 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 175, 571 A.2d 79 (1990). Although we have articulated the same principle in somewhat less definite terms; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 661 (whether erroneous ruling \u201cwas harmful to [the defendant] in that it probably affected the outcome of the trial\u201d); <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 153 (\u201cwhether the erroneous ruling \u2018would likely affect the result\u2019 \u201d); those alternate linguistic formulations did not change the fundamental nature of the appellate inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">It is true, as the defendant points out, that the Appellate Court stated as its harmless error standard that \u201c[t]he defendant has not shown that the result <em>would have been different </em>had the trial court permitted Conroy to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 294. We agree that the Appellate Court could have worded the harmless error standard more precisely by using the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d language. We conclude, however, that the essence of the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion accords with the proper harmless error test.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The Appellate Court sought to determine whether the substitution of Huse for Conroy was likely to have affected the outcome of the trial. Thus, although the exact language of the proper harmless error test may have been lacking, the manner of performing the test was present. The Appellate Court determined that \u201cthe testimony of Huse was equivalent to that intended by Conroy.\u201d Id. As we have indicated, Huse and Conroy offered similar credentials and similar opinions, with Huse providing even more convincing testimony on the defendant\u2019s behalf than Conroy, based on his offer, would have provided. Accordingly, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the Appellate Court employed the proper analysis and properly concluded that the trial court\u2019s preclusion of Conroy from testifying was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that: (1) the trial court correctly permitted the state to present forensic evidence in rebuttal; and (2) even if allowing the introduction of the rebuttal evidence was proper, the trial court properly prevented the defense from presenting surrebuttal evidence. We agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The following facts and procedural background are relevant to these claims of the defendant. Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, his car was impounded and the passenger seat cushion was sent to the state police forensic laboratory for testing. Guman, the criminalist who testified in the state\u2019s case-in-chief, stated that she had received, at the state laboratory, a piece of seat cushion to analyze. Initially she had tested the cushion only for trace materials. She had noticed that there was a stain on the seat cushion, but she did not examine the stain at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The defendant testified as part of the defense case. On May 22, 1991, on cross-examination, the defendant denied ever having had intercourse with the victim in the car. The following day, the state resubmitted the seat cushion to the state police forensic laboratory in order to have the stain tested. The state received the laboratory report after court had recessed on the afternoon of May 28,1991, the day before the defendant was to rest his case. The report indicated the presence of semen on the seat cushion, with spermatozoa matching the defendant\u2019s blood type. The following morning, the state immediately provided defense counsel with a copy of the forensic report. The defendant called his final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>witness, Huse, and then, without requesting additional time to consider the newly received report, rested his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The state then offered, as rebuttal evidence, the laboratory report and the testimony of Granan, who had analyzed the stain on the seat cushion. The defendant objected, claiming that: (1) the state should have presented this evidence in its case-in-chief; and (2) allowing rebuttal evidence regarding a report that the defendant had just received constituted unfair surprise and prejudice. The state explained that the seat cushion was not initially tested for semen because \u201cthe defense of the defendant was consent and I didn\u2019t feel that it was necessary to subject an item of evidence [to tests] that would have only established sexual intercourse when the defense [was] consent. Of course after the defendant took the stand and then claimed that he never had vaginal intercourse o[r] any kind of ejaculation in the front seat of the car, it bec[ame] an important issue and I immediately sent it down to the forensic lab [to be tested for semen].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The court asked the defendant how his case would have changed if the seat cushion had been tested the previous year and he had received the information that the stain had tested positive for semen. The defendant responded that: (1) it would have provided him with the opportunity to hire his own criminalist; and (2) it would have given him the opportunity to present other explanations for the presence of semen in the car. The trial court ruled that the rebuttal evidence was admissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>The defendant then requested the opportunity to offer surrebuttal evidence, on the basis that he had received the forensic report so late in the trial. The trial court refused to rule at that time, stating that it preferred to defer its ruling until after cross-examination of the witness offering the rebuttal evidence, and that it would then consider any offer of proof that the defendant presented regarding surrebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">During the state\u2019s rebuttal, Guman testified that the stained seat cushion had tested positive for semen containing spermatozoa that were consistent with the defendant\u2019s blood type. On cross-examination, Guman also testified that 36 percent of the population had the defendant\u2019s blood type, and that she could not determine how long the stain had been present or whether other sexual activity had occurred in the car. Guman also testified that she did not know whether there had been prior owners of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The defendant then renewed his request for surrebuttal. The only purpose he offered for surrebuttal was to have an independent laboratory analysis performed on the seat cushion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant acknowledged, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ever, that he had not made any arrangements for such an analysis. Notably, the defendant did not then indicate, as he had in his initial request for surrebuttal, that he might be able to present alternative explanations for the presence of the semen on the car seat. Concluding that it would be disruptive to the trial, the court denied the defendant\u2019s request for surrebuttal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion when it had admitted the state\u2019s rebuttal evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\u201c[R]ebuttal evidence is that which refutes the evidence presented by the defense . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Williamson, 206 Conn. 685, 698, 539 A.2d 561 (1988). When a defendant offers evidence in his defense, it is appropriate for the state to offer evidence to refute it, if possible. Id. The admission of rebuttal evidence is within the sound discretion of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 282, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>223 Conn. 703, 715-16, 613 A.2d 1287 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The fact that the state might have opted to have the seat cushion tested for traces of semen earlier in the proceedings and could have offered the test results as part of its case-in-chief does not preclude the state from offering that same evidence instead to rebut the defendant\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Lisella, </em>187 Conn. 335, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>336, 445 A.2d 922 (1982). The defendant had known for at least four weeks, from the time that the victim had testified, that the <em>location </em>of the intercourse, not simply the victim\u2019s consent, was an issue in the case. The state, in contrast, was not aware until the defendant testified, on May 22, 1991, that he had never engaged in intercourse with the victim in the car, that establishing the presence of semen in the car was necessary to lend credibility to the victim\u2019s version of the facts and to discredit the defendant\u2019s version. Until that point, it was not unreasonable for the state, believing consent was the only issue, to determine that testing of the stain was unnecessary. After the state had heard the defendant\u2019s testimony, it took immediate steps to examine the seat cushion for the presence of semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Under the circumstances, it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to admit the forensic report and Guman\u2019s testimony as rebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The defendant next claims that, even if the admission of the rebuttal evidence was proper, the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>improperly concluded that the trial court had acted within its discretion in denying the defendant the opportunity for surrebuttal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">We have previously stated that \u201cthere is no constitutional right to present surrebuttal evidence. . . . The presentation of surrebuttal evidence is a matter resting squarely within the discretion of the trial court. . . . The defendant must demonstrate some compelling circumstance and the proffered evidence must be of such importance that its omission puts in doubt the achievement of a just result.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 253-54, 645 A.2d 999 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Unlike the state, which did not know until the time of the defendant\u2019s testimony that the location of intercourse was an important element in the case, the defendant had known for a minimum of four weeks, at least since the time of the victim\u2019s testimony, that the parties disagreed as to the location of the intercourse. The defendant, however, took no steps to have the stained car seat tested.

The trial court ruled, however, that the sequestration order went into effect the moment after it was issued and applied to all future witnesses in the case. The trial court determined that the gravamen of the defendant\u2019s violation of the sequestration order was that he had released Quarishi\u2019s testimony to Conroy, who admitted he had not read it until the preceding evening, while the sequestration order was in effect. The record does not reflect, however, whether the transcript was delivered to Conroy before or after the sequestration order had been issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\"> We are not presented with, and therefore need not address, a case in which, for example, the defendant had originally secured the services of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>crime reconstruction expert, but was, instead, required to rely on the testimony of someone with no training in crime reconstruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\"> In its ruling permitting the rebuttal evidence, the trial court stated: \u201cBased on the forensic report, I don\u2019t know that it establishes whose semen it is or whether there were any DNA tests done, but that\u2019s subject to cross-examination, but I cannot find any bad faith.

Even under that view, however, the trial court's ruling denying the defendant\u2019s request was not an abuse of discretion, for many of the same reasons given below that lead us to conclude that the trial court properly denied the request for surrebuttal. Because the trial court and the Appellate Court treated the defendant\u2019s request as one for surrebutt al, however, and because that was how we certified the relevant question, we will, for purposes of this case, review the defendant\u2019s request as a request for surrebuttal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\"> Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201c[0]nce you rest your case has been concluded and to suggest that there was a surprise on rebuttal while you had in your possession the supplemental forensic report as pertains to the spermatozoa stain on the front passenger seat of the car before you rested and then to argue that you were surprised on rebuttal simply is without merit and flawed. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">\u201c[A] request for a surrebuttal is an extraordinary measure rarely recognized in our state.

Now our Practice Book allowed the defendant the right to scientifically examine the front passenger seat. In view of the victim\u2019s testimony, such an examination should have been requested six weeks ago. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">\u201cThe examination of the front passenger seat by the state was as a consequence of the defendant\u2019s testimony that the vaginal intercourse occurred in the leafy area and not [in] the car. The state was always aware that the defense would be consent and was never alerted or aware that there would be a discrepancy in the testimony of the victim or the testimony of the defendant as to where the vaginal intercourse occurred. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">\u201cThereafter the state took prompt measures to examine the seat for evidence of sperm. The supplemental forensic report [was] turned over to defense counsel at the earliest possible date. In undertaking that scientific examination, the state assumed the calculated risk. Had the front passenger seat shown no traces of sperm, this evidence could have been treated exculpatorily and the defense surely would have used this state experiment to support the defendant\u2019s version and attack the victim\u2019s version of what transpired that evening. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">\u201cFinally, surrebuttal is required only when there is a manifest act of injustice reaching constitutional proportions. Because the state exercised good faith, because the experiment could have fallen either way, and especially because the defense had substantial advance notice to early resolve this issue, the motion for surrebuttal is denied . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\"> The dissent concludes that the laboratory report, and Guman\u2019s testimony did not constitute \u201ctrue rebuttal\u201d evidence because that evidence \u201ctend[ed] to establish affirmatively the victim\u2019s claim [and was, therefore,] properly part of the state\u2019s case-in-chief,\u201d andbecause \u201cthere had been ample opportunity for the state to introduce the seminal stain evidence during its casein-chief.\u201d It is true that the state <em>could </em>have opted to have the stain tested earlier and <em>could </em>have used the test results in order to corroborate the victim\u2019s claim that sexual intercourse had occurred. Indeed, the trial court noted, that, had the state done so, the court would not have permitted the state to hold back that evidence during its case-in-chief and then present it as rebuttal evidence. The state, however, was not required affirmatively to establish the location of the intercourse, but rather the fact that intercourse had occurred and that it was nonconsensual. That obligation did not, however, contrary to the implication of the dissent, obligate the state to cause every relevant scientific test to be performed, particularly when, as in this case, the defendant had indicated to the state that the defense was consent but had not indicated that the location of the intercourse was contested. The state chose to establish the fact of sexual assault by means other than tests indicating the presence of semen on the seat cushion.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>\u201cRebuttal evidence is proper to meet new matters raised in the preceding presentation, to contradict prior testimony and to impeach . . . witnesses . . . .\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 3.3.1. The trial court acknowledged that there were two possible purposes for having the seat cushion tested: (1) to corroborate the victim\u2019s version of the facts; and (2) to rebut the defendant\u2019s version of the facts. The court admitted the laboratory report and Guman\u2019s testimony, not as evidence corroborating the victim\u2019s testimony, but rather as \u201cevidence . . . necessary to rebut the defense that was presented to the jury.\u201d The rebuttal evidence could not have been relevant for the purpose admitted until after the defendant had testified that no sexual intercourse had occurred in the car. The state was not required to test the seat cushion for the presence of semen in anticipation of what it had no way of knowing, namely, that the defendant would testify that intercourse had occurred somewhere other than in the car. Once the defendant testified, however, the location of the intercourse became relevant; the state then diligently secured the necessary evidence and it had the <em>right </em>to present newly relevant evidence in rebuttal. C. Tait <em>&amp; </em>J. LaPlante, supra, (2d Ed. 1995 Sup.) \u00a7 3.3.1. The evidence was, therefore, \u201ctrue rebuttal\u201d evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> The dissent suggests, without amplification, that the trial court\u2019s disallowance of surrebuttal may have been based on the court\u2019s use of an improper standard for granting surrebuttal. See footnote 2 of the dissent. It is true that the trial court remarked that \u201csurrebuttal is required only when there is a manifest act of injustice reaching Constitutional proportions,\u201d a standard that arguably is not in accord with the standard we set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 253-54, 645 A.2d 999 (1994). We determine, however, that any untoward effect that this improper statement of the standard may have had on the trial court\u2019s decision to deny surrebuttal was cured by the court\u2019s thorough analysis of the factors it considered in making its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The trial court found that four factors entered into its decision to deny surrebuttal: (1) the defense was not surprised by the rebuttal evidence because it had been given a copy of the laboratory results prior to resting its case; (2) the defendant had had ample opportunity and cause to have the seat cushion tested because the defendant had known for at least six weeks that the victim claimed that intercourse had taken place in the car; (3) the defendant had potentially benefitted by the state\u2019s testing of the seat cushion because, had the state\u2019s tests been negative, the defendant would have been entitled to have used the results as exculpatory evidence; and (4) the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Guman established that the semen on the seat cushion could not be traced to any particular person and had been there indefinitely, thus reducing the probative impact of the laboratory report.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">These considerations, together with the fact that the defendant\u2019s proffer of evidence was limited to a proposal to have independent laboratory testing done, strongly suggest that the trial court would also have found that the defendant had not presented circumstances sufficiently compelling as to warrant surrebuttal. Any impropriety in the standard used by the trial court, was, therefore, harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> The dissent builds on its flawed conclusion that the rebuttal evidence presented by the state was not truly of a rebuttal nature; see footnote 10; to conclude further that the trial court should have permitted the defendant\u2019s request for surrebuttal in order to respond to that evidence. This conclusion is equally flawed. First, it rests on the flawed premise noted above. Second, it completely ignores the fact that the defendant\u2019s request to present surrebuttal was, in a real sense, not that at all. See footnote 8. At that point, the defendant had <em>no </em>evidence to present. He had abandoned his earlier suggestion of evidence of other sexual activity in the car that might have explained the presence of semen on the seat cushion. He simply wanted more time to have tests performed that might \u2014 or might not \u2014 yield evidence that he might present. In other words, had the further tests that the defendant claimed to seek yielded results consistent with Guman\u2019s testimony, it is difficult to conceive that he would have sought to present the results in surrebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The dissent also simply disregards our case law that the introduction of surrebuttal evidence is a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion, to be presented when the defendant has demonstrated compelling circumstances and the proffered evidence is of such importance that its omission puts in doubt the achievement of a just result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 254. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to take seriously the dissent\u2019s position that the defendant had a right to what he sought, and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying him that opportunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b755-8\">KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKh\">with whom, BERDON, J., joins, dissenting. For purposes of this dissent, I will assume that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court had acted within its discretion in allowing the state to introduce rebuttal evidence. Because the seminal stain evidence, however, was not a matter of true rebuttal, I respectfully disagree with the majority opinion that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court had acted within its discretion in denying the defendant the opportunity to present surrebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Unlike evidence presented in the case-in-chief, \u201c[t]he function of rebuttal evidence is to explain or rebut evidence offered by an opponent.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tejada, </em>956 F.2d 1256, 1266 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 841, 113 S. Ct. 124, 121 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1992). Rebuttal evidence is usually \u201cconfined to testimony which is directed at refuting the evidence given by the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Addazio, </em>169 Conn. 416, 427, 363 A.2d 153 (1975). According to Professor Wigmore, matters of \u201ctrue rebuttal\u201d are matters that were \u201cproperly not evidential until the rebuttal\u201d stage. 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1976) \u00a7 1873, p. 678. A party has a <em>right </em>to present \u201ctrue rebuttal\u201d evidence, when there has been <em>no </em>prior opportunity to present it. Id.; see C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1992 Sup.) \u00a7 3.3.1 (\u201c[a] party has a right to present rebuttal evidence ... if the evidence was not \u2018evidentiary,\u2019 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>is, relevant or material, until after his adversary\u2019s case\u201d). When a party should reasonably have included in its case-in-chief what it claims to be rebuttal evidence, however, the court may properly deny it that second opportunity. <em>Shaham </em>v. <em>Capparelli, </em>219 Conn. 133, 136-37, 591 A.2d 1269 (1991) <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Because there had been ample opportunity for the state to introduce the seminal stain evidence during its case-in-chief, it did not qualify as true rebuttal evidence. The state knew of the victim\u2019s complaint that the defendant had forced her to engage in vaginal intercourse \u201con the front seat of the car\u201d as of the date of the incident, May 4, 1990. Therefore, any evidence tending to establish affirmatively the victim\u2019s claim was properly part of the state\u2019s case-in-chief. Because the state introduced four photographs of the front seat and forensic evidence \u2014 hair and vegetative material\u2014 seized from the front seat into evidence, it is apparent that the state was aware of the importance of the front seat. As part of its decision to allow the rebuttal evidence, the trial court specifically commented on the fact that the victim had testified \u201cabout six, seven weeks ago and she testified at great length that the hair on her head was extracted during the dragging and during the interaction on the front seat of that car.\u201d Additionally, Marybeth Guman, a criminalist at the state police forensic laboratory, was questioned about the seat cover stains during the state\u2019s case-in-chief. She testified that the seat cover had, as of May 14, 1991, been submitted twice to her laboratory, that she had examined it for trace materials such as hair, and that although there were stains on the cushion, she never examined those stains for the presence of semen. Had the state been more diligent in its testing of the stain, it would have discovered the evidence that it later introduced in rebuttal and would most certainly have offered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>results to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony in its casein-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">We traditionally grant the trial court the discretion to admit, in rebuttal, evidence that might have been properly offered in its case-in-chief. See Practice Book \u00a7 874; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brauneis, </em>84 Conn. 222, 232-33, 79 A. 70 (1911). The unavailability of the evidence prior to May 28,1991, may have sufficed to cause the trial court to exercise its discretion to allow the rebuttal. The late availability of this evidence, however, does not transform its essential nature into new matter. Accordingly, I would conclude that the seminal stain evidence was not truly of a rebuttal nature.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Therefore, although we have stated that the trial court ordinarily enjoys broad discretion in deciding whether to allow surrebuttal evidence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>209 Conn. 622, 634-35, 553 A.2d 589 (1989); that discretion is not unlimited when new matter that was more properly presented as evidence in the case-in-chief has been presented in rebuttal. Practice Book \u00a7 874 (3) provides that if a prosecutor is permitted, in rebuttal, \u201cto present evidence not of a rebuttal nature,\u201d then \u201cthe defendant may respond with further evidence in chief.\u201d We have stated, although not recently, that if the trial court were to allow a party to introduce evidence in rebuttal that was more properly evidence in the case-in-chief, the opposing party \u201cwould have the right to meet it.\u201d <em>State </em>v.

You will recall that [the victim] placed the oral intercourse, described under our law as fellatio, in the leafy area and the vaginal intercourse in the car. The defendant placed the act of oral sex on the passenger side of the car while he was outside the car and [the victim] in the car. And he places the act of vaginal intercourse in the leafy area. [The victim] and the defendant disagree over the issue of consensuality and the locations where these acts of sexual intercourse occurfred].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Moreover, because the victim was the only witness to the crime, the jury\u2019s request to rehear her testimony suggests that the credibility question was a difficult one. The seminal stain evidence was of crucial impact that related to the \u201cwhere\u201d question, which in turn related to the \u201cwho\u2019s telling the truth\u201d question. Introduction of this evidence allowed the state to argue to the jury that \u201cwhen he testified,\u201d the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d about the seminal stain and that he was \u201ctrapped by those stains. He was trapped by the truth. He told the story and the forensic evidence said no.\u201d Furthermore, the fact that the jury convicted the defendant of only the sexual assault count involving forcible vaginal intercourse \u2014 the act that took place in the vehicle \u2014 is additional evidence of the jury\u2019s reliance upon this unrebutted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The defendant wanted only the opportunity, either through testimony or by forensic evidence, to rebut the seminal stain evidence, which was the last evidence heard by the jury and that pertained to the crucial issue in the case. Fairness required that the defendant be given that opportunity. The trial court\u2019s ruling severely placed in doubt the achievement of a just result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 254, 645 A.2d 999 (1994). Accordingly, I would conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing the defendant the opportunity to present surrebuttal evidence and that such failure was harmful.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\"> The majority postulates that because the state used the seat cushion evidence to rebut the defendant\u2019s testimony and not to corroborate the victim\u2019s version of the facts, the evidence constituted \u201ctrue rebuttal.\u201d See footnote 10 of the majority opinion. Although that theory allowed the trial court to find that the evidence was relevant, it does not change the fundamental nature of the evidence. The seat cushion evidence would have been relevant to corroborate the victim\u2019s version of events and was, therefore, properly evidential, that is, relevant or material, prior to the rebuttal stage. 6 J. Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 1873; C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 3.3.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\"> It is noteworthy that the trial court\u2019s disallowance of surrebuttal was based largely on its erroneous view of the nature of surrebuttal evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>34 Conn. App. 276, 288 n.6, 641 A.2d 426 (1994). Contrary to the trial court\u2019s views, surrebuttal is not \u201can extraordinary measure rarely recognized in our state,\u201d and is not limited to situations \u201cwhen there is a manifest act of injustice reaching Constitutional proportions.\u201d Reliance on this improper standard perhaps best explains the trial court\u2019s decision to disallow surrebuttal evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> The majority\u2019s reliance on the fact that the defendant knew of the seminal stain evidence before he rested his case, and therefore that he could have testified himself regarding possible explanations for its presence, is both unfair and unrealistic. In the absence of any testimony about the stain up to that point, any defense evidence would not have been responsive. Certainly, the defendant had the right to wait to see if the state actually introduced the evidence and if, after cross-examination, there was any need to rebut it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\"> Even before the state presented its rebuttal, the court had expressed a disinclination to permit surrebuttal. During the defendant\u2019s case, the prosecutor requested that certain physical measurements be taken of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ant, for possible use in rebuttal. The prosecutor stated that if such evidence were allowed in rebuttal, \u201ccertainly [the defendant is] entitled to [sur]rebuttal with discretion of the court.\u201d The court replied, \u201c[w]ell, the court\u2019s not likely to grant surrebuttals.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
