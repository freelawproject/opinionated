After a trial to the court, the defendant, John Yurch, was acquitted of forgery in the second degree in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-139 (a) (1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but was convicted of two counts of forgery in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-140.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court subsequently found that the defendant was in violation of probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of conviction as to the two counts of forgery in the third degree. <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>37 Conn.
