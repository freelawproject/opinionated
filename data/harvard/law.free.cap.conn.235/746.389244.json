Lukban, </em>deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>John A. Connelly, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Corinne L.

The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Laccone, </em>37 Conn. App. 21, 654 A.2d 805 (1995). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal the propriety and the harmfulness of the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the admissibility of the letter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have concluded that the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. In the circumstances of this case, the Appellate Court reasonably concluded that the trial court had honored the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. Id., 31-32. Appellate review of the trial court\u2019s ruling is therefore limited to a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the letter and, if so, whether the trial court\u2019s ruling was harmless. Because the state presented substantial medical evidence implicating the defendant in the crimes for which he was convicted, we are persuaded that any possible impropriety in the trial court\u2019s ruling was necessarily harmless. Further amplification of the certified issues would, therefore, serve no useful purpose. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>235 Conn. 473, 476, 667 A.2d 796 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Busque, </em>229 Conn. 839, 842, 643 A.2d 1281 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>225 Conn. 524, 527, 624 A.2d 377 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-12\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when ...
