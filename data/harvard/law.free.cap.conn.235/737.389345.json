Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff appealed the reassessment to the</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>trial court, which rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The parties stipulated to the relevant facts. The plaintiff is a Connecticut corporation that was engaged in the business of selling cooperative direct mail advertising services. It was a licensee or sublicensee of Val-Pak Direct Marketing Systems, Inc. (Direct Marketing), a Florida corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In providing cooperative direct mail advertising services for a group of otherwise unrelated business customers, the plaintiff arranged to have printed advertisements, coupons and the like sent in a single envelope to households in a specified geographic area. After a business customer had agreed to use the plaintiffs services, the plaintiff placed orders with Direct Marketing. In accordance with the plaintiffs directions, advertising materials were then printed in Florida and mailed from Florida to the designated households. Direct Marketing billed the plaintiff for the printing and mailing services it performed. The plaintiff billed its customers for its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">On the basis of these stipulated facts, the trial court found that the plaintiff was engaged in providing services to its customers and in purchasing services from Direct Marketing. Because the plaintiff at no time exercised any ownership rights over the advertising materials prepared and mailed by Direct Marketing, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs transactions did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>constitute a taxable \u201cuse\u201d of tangible property in this state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court held that the transactions in which the plaintiff had engaged were not taxable during the audit years and rendered judgment for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Our examination of the record on this appeal, and the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The central issue of the applicability of the use tax to the plaintiffs activities during the audit years at issue was properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision filed by the trial court. <em>Val-Pak of Central Connecticut North, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>44 Conn. Sup. 133, 670 A.2d 343 (1995). Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on that issue. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. See <em>Greater Bridgeport Transit District </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>232 Conn. 57, 64, 653 A.2d 151 (1995); <em>Advanced Business Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 378, 380-81, 650 A.2d 540 (1994); <em>Van Dyck Printing Co. </em>v. <em>DiNicola, </em>231 Conn. 272, 273-74, 648 A.2d 877 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-411 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe use tax.

We do not understand the defendant to be claiming that the plaintiff may be assessed a penalty for its failure to file use tax returns even if the plaintiff had no unpaid use tax liability for the years in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
