The defendant employers are Best Cleaners, Inc., Windsor Dry Cleaners, Broadbrook Cleaners and Nu-Life Cleaners<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (collectively referred to as the employers).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (commissioner) awarded compensation to the claimant and ordered liability for the claim transferred to the fund in accordance with \u00a7 31-349. The workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirmed the decision of the commissioner. The fund appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court, and the appeal was transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>The underlying facts are undisputed. The claimant worked in the dry cleaning business for the employers between 1963 and 1983. Part of the claimant\u2019s job during that time consisted of removing items of wet clothing from a cleaning tank and placing them in a dryer. The cleaning fluid used on the clothes was perchloroethylene, a volatile chemical that is widely used throughout the industry as a cleaning agent. The claimant was exposed to this chemical in its liquid or vapor form throughout his entire career in the dry cleaning business.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In the late 1970s, the claimant began to experience breathing problems. In 1977, he was diagnosed as suffering from asthma. In 1982, when the claimant\u2019s asthma symptoms became persistent, he was referred to Thomas J. Godar, a pulmonary specialist. The claimant furnished Godar with the following history. He was fifty-nine years old, and had smoked cigarettes from age ten until he was forty-eight. He had worked in the dry cleaning business, where he was exposed on a regular basis to perchloroethylene and other cleaning solutions. On the basis of this history, Godar performed pulmonary function tests on the claimant, and these tests revealed that the claimant was suffering from obstructive aiiway disease with an asthmatic component. The claimant left his last employer in May, 1983, and subsequently sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">During the hearing before the commissioner, Godar testified extensively about the claimant\u2019s medical condition. No other expert medical testimony was elicited before the commissioner. Godar explained that the claimant had a 50 percent impairment of his respiratory capacity, and that represented the median percentage of impairment even when the claimant was under a full regimen of medication. Godar estimated that \u201csomething in the range of a 10 to 20 percent loss in function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>. . . was probably related to his smoking . . . .\u2019\u2019He explained that this meant that 10 to 20 percent of the claimant\u2019s 50 percent loss of respiratory capacity, or 5 to 10 percent of the original capacity, was due to smoking. The remainder \u2014 80 to 90 percent of the percentage loss, or 40 to 45 percent of the original capacity \u2014 -was due to the claimant\u2019s prolonged exposure to perchloroethylene while he worked in the dry cleaning industry. Godar stated that the smoking related impairment was \u201ca marginal element of impairment,\u201d and that he did not \u201cthink the smoking had an effect in terms of [the claimant] not being disabled now had he not been a smoker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Godar also testified on the issue of whether the claimant could function in a work environment. According to Godar, the claimant\u2019s exposure to perchloroethylene had sensitized his lungs and respiratory system, so that even common irritants such as cold air and perfume could induce serious breathing problems. Godar suggested that the claimant \u201ccould do probably sedentary work under conditions where there was no smoking, no significant volatile chemicals or fumes involved in the process, and with reasonable environmental control, which would include air conditioning for the summer months, he could do sedentary work.\u201d Godar later stated, however, that \u201c[i]n the real world I\u2019m not of the opinion that he is employable. I think if you look at his lung function under ideal circumstances you would say, well, he could do something, yes, he could. The question is, who would hire him, and how long would he hold that job? And under those circumstances it\u2019s been my experience that [he is] not employable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The commissioner concluded that the claimant was totally disabled and that his labor had become unmarketable. The commissioner implicitly found that, as a result of his continuing exposure to perchloroethylene throughout his employment in the dry cleaning busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>ness, the claimant was suffering from a 50 percent impairment of his respiratory system. The commissioner further found that the claimant had smoked for more than thirty-five years, and that this history of smoking had caused \u201cpre-existing lung disease\u201d that \u201ccaused his airway disease to be materially and substantially worse than it otherwise would have been.\u201d In other words, the commissioner found that the claimant\u2019s first injury to his lungs, caused by the smoking, and his second injury to his lungs, caused by exposure to perchloroethylene, resulted in a permanent disability \u201cwhich is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injuiy alone . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-349. The commissioner subsequently ordered liability for the compensation claim to be transferred from the employers to the fund after the employers had paid 104 weeks of benefits. The fund appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the board, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision with respect to the transfer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>On appeal to this court, the fund renews its claren that the commissioner should not have ordered liability for the claimant\u2019s compensation benefits transferred from the employers to the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-349. Following oral argument in this court, it became apparent to this court that the central issue in this case turned on the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in \u00a7 31-349. We therefore ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the following issues: (1) \u201cIn the context of General Statutes \u00a7 31-349, does \u2018disability\u2019 refer to the claimant\u2019s inability to work and loss of earning capacity, or to his degree of medical impairment?\u201d and (2) \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, was the claimant\u2019s permanent disability \u2018materially and substantially greater than the disability that would have resulted from the second injury alone,\u2019 within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 31-349?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">With respect to the issues we framed, the relevant portion of \u00a7 31-349 provides for a transfer of liability to the fund if an employee with a permanent physical impairment \u201cincurs a second disability by accident or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone . . . .\u201d The fund does not contest the commissioner\u2019s explicit finding that the claimant \u201cdid have pre-existing lung disease as a result of his smoking for 35 years\u201d or his implicit finding that this preexisting lung disease constituted a permanent physical impairment within the meaning of the statute. Nor does the fund challenge the commissioner\u2019s finding that as a result of his employment with the employers, the claimant sustained a second injury to his lungs. These undisputed findings satisfy that portion of \u00a7 31-349 that requires a noncompensable<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> first injury and a compensable sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ond injury for transfer to the fund. The question then becomes whether the claimant\u2019s first and second injuries resulted in a permanent \u201cdisability\u201d under \u00a7 31-349, a question which requires that we define \u201cdisability.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The fund takes the position that, in the context of \u00a7 31-349, \u201cdisability refers to the claimant\u2019s inability to work and loss of earning capacity and not to his degree of medical impairment.\u201d Best Cleaners, Inc., argues that \u201cdisability\u201d refers to the claimant\u2019s degree of medical impairment. Broadbrook Cleaners and Windsor Dry Cleaners argue that the term \u201cdisability\u201d refers both to a claimant\u2019s inability to work and to his medical impairment. The term \u201cdisability\u201d under the latter argument would therefore refer either to an inability or limitation in a claimant\u2019s ability to work, or simply to a worsening physical impairment. We agree with the fund that for purposes of \u00a7 31-349 disability refers to the claimant\u2019s ability to work, and not to the degree of medical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Historically, in the workers\u2019 compensation system, \u201cdisability\u201d has been closely tied to loss of earning capacity. 1C A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1995) \u00a7 57.14 (b), p. 10-74. More recently, we have held that \u201c[compensation under our [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act is based upon incapacity, total or partial, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>hence is based upon loss of earning power.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>F. S. Electric, </em>231 Conn. 529, 541, 651 A.2d 254 (1994). Similarly, in <em>Levanti </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Co., </em>218 Conn. 9, 15, 587 A.2d 1023 (1991), we recognized that the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cis to give to the employee . . . compensation for the loss of wages accruing from the employee\u2019s injury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In that case, we upheld the validity of a limited schedule that established mandatory benefits payable for the loss or loss of use of a body part, but that did not specifically refer to a loss of earning capacity. We reasoned in <em>Levanti </em>that \u201cour legislature must have presumed that the losses therein <em>affected earning capacity, </em>because any other construction would suggest that the section was intended to provide compensation solely for the body part itself, comparable to a tort recovery. This construction would be inconsistent with our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">To equate \u201cdisability\u201d with degree of medical impairment would be to ignore the focus of the workers\u2019 compensation system on earning capacity, and to instead adopt a tort recovery approach for transfer to the fund. Section 31-349 therefore requires more than a showing that a preexisting injury has some measurable effect on, or in some manner augments, a subsequent work related injury. The permanent disability that results from the two injuries refers only to the claimant\u2019s earning capacity or ability to work. In other words, the earning capacity of the claimant must be materially and substantially affected by the preexisting injury for employers to be able to transfer liability to the fund under the provisions of \u00a7 31-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We next address the issue of whether the commissioner\u2019s transfer of liability for the claimant\u2019s benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>to the fund, based on the incorrect standard,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> requires that we remand the case for further consideration by the commissioner. \u201cWhen agency action is overturned . . . because of invalid or insufficient findings ... a court must ordinarily remand the matter under consideration to the agency for further consideration.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Health Services </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>198 Conn. 479, 488, 503 A.2d 1151 (1986); <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 421, 429-30, 429 A.2d 910 (1980); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>172 Conn. 71, 73, 372 A.2d 131 (1976); see General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j). When the agency, however, is reversed and it appears \u201cas a matter of law that there is only one single conclusion that the [agency] could reasonably reach,\u201d this court may direct the agency to take that action on remand. <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 430; General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (k).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We find in the present case, on the basis of the uncontradicted medical evidence before him, that the commissioner could have reached but one conclusion \u2014 that is, the first injury did not materially and substantially contribute to the claimant\u2019s inability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We tangentially visited the issue of whether a second injury was made materially and substantially greater as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>a result of the first injury in <em>Levanti </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Co., </em>supra, 218 Conn. 17 (evidence that preexisting impairment materially increased claimant\u2019s overall disability is sufficient to warrant application of \u00a7 31-349). In <em>Levanti, </em>however, we did not specifically define \u201cmaterially\u201d and \u201csubstantially.\u201d Because there are no statutory definitions of the terms, we look to their commonly approved usage. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 <em>(a); Police Dept. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>225 Conn. 297, 301 n.6, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993) (\u201c \u2018[w]here a statute does not define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that for the first injury to add materially<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and substantially<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the permanent disability, it must have an important and significant role in the disability, such that an absence of the preexisting injury would mean a measurable lessening of the degree of disability \u2014 that is, earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In the present case, Godar was the only expert medical witness, upon whose testimony all parties relied. His testimony provides sufficient evidence that the preexisting lung injury related to the claimant\u2019s smoking history was not a material and substantial factor in the claimant\u2019s permanent disability and resultant unemployability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As we previously noted, Godar referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>the smoking related impairment \u201cas a marginal element of impairment.\u201d He also stated that he did not \u201cthink the smoking had an effect in terms of [the claimant] not being disabled now had he not been a smoker.\u201d The commissioner therefore could reasonably find only that, within the meaning of \u00a7 31-349, the claimant\u2019s permanent disability that resulted from the second injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>was not made materially and substantially greater by the first smoking related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The decision of the board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board with direction to reverse the commissioner\u2019s transfer of liability to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-349 provides in pertinent part: \u201cCompensation for second disability. Payment of insurance coverage for totally incapacitated persons. The fact that an employee has suffered previous disability, or received compensation therefor, shall not preclude him from compensation for a later injury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting therefrom. If an employee who has previously incurred, by accidental injury, disease or congenital causes, total or partial loss of, or loss of use of, one hand, one arm, one foot or one eye, or who has other permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability by accident or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability, including total disability, less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and necessary medical care, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that part of such disability was due to prior accidental injury, disease or congenital causes. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. As a condition precedent to the liability of the second injury fund, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>employer or his insurance carrier must, ninety days prior to the expiration of the one-hundred-four-week period, notify the custodian of the second injury fund of the pending case and shall furnish to said custodian a copy of the agreement or award together with all information purporting to support his claim as to the liability of the second injury fund, and shall make available to the custodian all medical reports as the custodian shall desire. Failure on the part of the employer or the carrier to comply does not relieve the employer or carrier of its obligation to continue furnishing benefits under the provisions of this chapter. In the event the custodian shall reject the claim of the employer and its insurer, the question shall be submitted to the commissioner having jurisdiction, as promptly as possible, and the employer or carrier shall continue furnishing benefits until the outcome is finally decided, and if the employer or carrier prevails all payments made beyond the one-hundred-four-week period shall be reimbursed to the employer or carrier by the second injury fund.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\"> The defendant Nu-Life Cleaners did not file a brief in this appeal.

References to the commissioner are to Spain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b807-5\"> The fund raised nine issues in its appeal from the commissioner to the board, which were consolidated into four issues by the board: (1) liability for the claimant\u2019s compensation benefits should not have been transferred to the fund because there was no evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s finding that there was permanent physical impairment resulting from the claimant\u2019s many years of smoking; (2) liability should not have been transferred because the commissioner found no subordinate facts that supported his conclusion that the claimant\u2019s airway disease had been made materially and substantially worse by the preexisting lung disease; (3) the commissioner had miscalculated the amount of the award due the claimant; and (4) because there were two lungs involved, the commissioner should have ordered the employer to pay 104 weeks of liability for each, or 208 weeks total, before transferring liability to the fund. In consolidating the issues, the board eliminated the fund\u2019s sixth ground, which has become the substantive issue in this appeal. The fund\u2019s sixth ground is that \u201c[t]he Commissioner erred by failing to find that the claimant\u2019s permanent disability was not made materially and substantially worse due to pre-existing lung disease.\u201d The board affirmed the decision of the commissioner on the first, second and fourth issues, but remanded the case to the commissioner for further consideration as to the amount of the award due the claimant. That issue was subsequently resolved by the commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\"> The fund also does not contest that the first ii\\jury was noncompensable. \u201c \u2018It has always been accepted without question that the situation to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>the Second Injury Fund applies consists of a <em>prior </em>noncompensable injury followed by and combining with a <em>subsequent </em>compensable injury.\u2019 (Emphasis in original.) 2 A.

[An objection to this question was overruled by the commissioner.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">\u201cA. <em>I don\u2019t think the smoking had an [ejffect in terms of his not being disabled now had he not been a smoker.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-10\">\u201cQ. So, in other words, in terms of his work function he\u2019s pretty much in the position he\u2019s in now because of his exposure to the chemicals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-12\">\u201cQ. . . . Would it be your opinion that in terms of [the claimant\u2019s] loss of lung function that his smoking history has contributed a relatively insignificant part of his tolal loss of lung function?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">\u201cQ. And that, really, the substantial and significant part of loss of lung function both in living and in \u2014 for job function really is because of his chemical exposure, is that your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-16\">\u201cQ. When you give [the claimant] a 50 \u2014 approximately a 50 percent loss of each lung, you\u2019re giving that under a very controlled condition, aren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-18\">\u201cQ. And that that includes a strict regime of being away from factors, from situations which most people would consider ordinary in order to achieve that kind of level?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-19\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-20\">\u201cQ. And, would it be safe to say that if he was put into a normal, let\u2019s say, humanly normal environment that most of us live in that in fact his loss of lung function would actually measure significantly higher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-21\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
