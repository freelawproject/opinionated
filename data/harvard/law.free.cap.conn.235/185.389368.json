The plaintiff, Home Insurance Company (Home), which was the synagogue\u2019s insurer, obtained a judgment against Schuss and, thereafter, brought this subrogation action against the defendant, Aetna Life and Casualty Company (Aetna), the insurer of Schuss\u2019 parents. After the trial court, <em>Hodgson, J., </em>had denied Home\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>access to certain of Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records, Aetna filed a motion for summary judgment. Home opposed Aetna\u2019s motion on the ground that a genuine issue of material fact existed concerning the applicability of an exclusion in Aetna\u2019s policy for property damage arising from an insured\u2019s intentional misconduct. The trial court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment and rendered judgment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Home appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court improperly had: (1) denied its request for access to Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records; and (2) granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Appellate Court agreed with both of Home\u2019s claims and, accordingly, reversed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>35 Conn. App. 94, 644 A.2d 933 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We granted Schuss\u2019 petition for certification to appeal, limited to the issue of whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that Home was entitled to access to his psychiatric records. We also granted Aetna\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the issue of whether there existed a genuine issue of material fact concerning the applicability of the policy exclusion in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court properly denied Home\u2019s motion for access to Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records and properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The facts and procedural history relevant to this appeal are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cThis is a subrogation action to recover an amount paid by [Home] for damages caused by a fire at the Emanuel Synagogue in West Hartford. The fire was set by Barry Schuss who pleaded guilty to arson in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-113 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Schuss\u2019 parents are insured by [Aetna],</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u201c[Home], as the insurer and assignee of the Emanuel Synagogue, paid its insured $696,539.71 for the damage caused by the fire and commenced an action against Schuss to recover the amount paid. As a special defense, Schuss initially pleaded that he had been \u2018exposed to various experiences in his personal life so as to result in a growing psychological vulnerability [and] ... his loss of a substantial ability to control himself.\u2019 Schuss later withdrew the special defense, and the court rendered judgment, in accordance with a stipulation, against Schuss for $696,539.71 plus interest. [Home] and Schuss stipulated that [Home] would seek to satisfy the judgment only to the extent that Schuss had insurance coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u201c[Home] then commenced a subrogation action against [Aetna], the insurer of Schuss\u2019 parents, to recover the amount of the judgment obtained against Schuss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>[Aetna] did not deny that Schuss qualified as an insured under a general liability policy it issued to Schuss\u2019 parents. [Aetna], however, pleaded as a special defense that it had no obligation to pay the judgment because Schuss\u2019 conduct of August 15, 1983, fell within an exclusion of the policy\u2019s coverage. The exclusion provides that the insurer is not liable for property damage \u2018which is expected or intended by the insured.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u201c[Home] filed an application for an order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-146f for the release of certain confidential psychiatric records of Schuss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> [Home] claimed that [Aetna\u2019s] special defense made Schuss\u2019 mental condition an issue in the case. The trial court denied [Home\u2019s] application on the ground that [Aetna], not Schuss, introduced Schuss\u2019 mental condition as an issue in the case. The court also concluded that under the principles of subrogation [Home] held the contractual rights of Schuss but not his personal rights such as the privilege of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201cAfter the denial of the plaintiffs application, [Aetna] filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that Schuss\u2019 plea of guilty to arson in the third degree conclusively established that he intended to cause damage to the synagogue, which would prevent him from being covered by the insurance policy. After the trial court denied the motion, [Aetna] filed a second motion for summary judgment, contending that statements made by Schuss in a deposition of December 18, 1990, indicated that he intended or expected to damage the synagogue, which allegedly would trigger the application of the policy exclusion. The trial court granted this motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was no evidence before the court \u2018except that which indicates Schuss intended to start the fires and do damage.\u2019 \u201d Id., 95-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Home appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court improperly had: (1) denied Home\u2019s application for an order releasing Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records; and (2) granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Appellate Court reversed on both issues, concluding that \u201c[although the patient, Schuss, introduced his mental condition in [Home\u2019s] action against Schuss, and not in [Home\u2019s] action against [Aetna] . . . the actions are one and the same because the action against Schuss is the underlying action to the subrogation action against [Aetna].\u201d Id., 99. Having determined that Schuss had, in effect, placed his mental condition at issue in Home\u2019s subrogation action against Aetna, the Appellate Court concluded that Home was entitled to access to Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records pursuant to \u00a7 52-146f (5); id., 99-101; and that the issue of whether Schuss had \u201cexpected or intended\u201d to cause damage to the synagogue within the meaning of the insurance policy\u2019s intentional act exclusion clause was a question of fact to be decided by the jury. Id., 101-107. Accordingly, the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>reversed the judgment of the trial court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">On appeal to this court, Schuss claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that Home is entitled to access to his psychiatric records under \u00a7 52-146f (5), and Aetna claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that there existed a genuine issue of material fact regarding the applicability of the exclusion in its policy for property damage intentionally caused by an insured. We agree with both of these claims and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court, and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Home acknowledges that Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records fall within the ambit of General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which establishes the confidentiality of communications and records relating to the psychiatrist-patient relationship. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Home posits three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>arguments, however, in support of its claim that it nonetheless is entitled to access to Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, Home maintains that because Schuss placed his mental condition at issue in Home\u2019s action against Schuss by asserting the special defense of \u201c \u2018psychological vulnerability [and] . . . loss of a substantial ability to control himself,\u2019 \u201d Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records are disclosable to Home pursuant to \u00a7 52-146f (5). Second, Home contends that as the subrogee of Schuss\u2019 rights under Aetna\u2019s insurance policy, pursuant to \u00a7 38a-321; see footnote 4; Home itself is empowered to waive the confidentiality of Schuss\u2019 records. Third, Home claims that the stipulation entered into by Home and Schuss imposed on Schuss an implied obligation not to frustrate Home\u2019s efforts to collect from Aetna on the judgment it had obtained against Schuss. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Under \u00a7 52-146f (5), communications or records that are otherwise subject to the psychiatrist-patient privilege under \u00a7 52-146e \u201cmay be disclosed in a civil proceeding in which the patient introduces his mental condition as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>an element of his claim or defense.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although Home concedes that Schuss has not introduced his mental condition as an element of his defense in <em>this </em>case, Home maintains that nonetheless it is entitled to Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records because Schuss did place his mental condition at issue in <em>Home\u2019s action against Schuss.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In support of its interpretation of \u00a7 52-146f (5), Home argues that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that \u201cunder the principles of subrogation, a party that obtains a judgment against an insured defendant is substituted in place of the defendant for the purposes of an action against the insurer on the insurance policy. . . . This principle of substitution links the action against the insured and the subsequent subrogation action against the insurer to such an extent that they can be regarded as one cause of action.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life </em>&amp; <em>Casualty Co., </em>supra, 35 Conn. App. 99-100. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Home\u2019s argument is contrary to the plain language of \u00a7 52-146f (5), which expressly limits disclosure of psychi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>atric records to those civil proceedings in which the patient has introduced his mental condition as an element of his defense. Had the legislature intended to authorize a subrogee to obtain a subrogor\u2019s confidential psychiatric records in a subrogation action wherein the subrogor is not a party, the legislature easily could have done so. See <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>230 Conn. 17, 22, 644 A.2d 874 (1994); <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 719, 513 A.2d 43 (1986). We will not impute to the legislature an intent that is not apparent from unambiguous statutory language in the absence of a compelling reason to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We find nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 52-146e and 52-146f, or their precursor, General Statutes \u00a7 52-146a, to suggest that the legislature intended the result urged by Home. As we have previously observed, \u201c[t]he people of this state enjoy a broad privilege in the confidentiality of their psychiatric communications and records\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 55, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990); and the principal purpose of that privilege is to \u201cgive the patient an incentive to make full disclosure to a physician in order to obtain effective treatment free from the embarrassment and invasion of privacy which could result from a doctor\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 234-35, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975). Accordingly, the exceptions to the general rule of nondisclosure of communications between psychiatrist and patient were drafted narrowly to ensure that the confidentiality of such communications will be protected unless important countervailing considerations require their disclosure. See, e.g., 9 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1961 Sess., p. 3945, remarks of Representative Nicholas B. Eddy (statutory scheme \u201c \u2018defines the protected relationship carefully and at the same time recognizes the legitimate interest of society in intruding upon the relationship <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>certain limited situations . </em>. . [reading from a letter submitted by Eugene Rostow, then dean of the Yale Law School]; if the <em>patient himself </em>raises the issue of his mental condition, <em>in any claim against him or any claim he may make </em>\u2014 it should be open to <em>his [adversary] </em>to go into the communications between the psychiatrist and himself \u201d [emphasis added]; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciaiy and Governmental Functions, Pt. 2, 1961 Sess., pp. 867-68, remarks of Harold Wright; 9 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1961 Sess., pp. 2888-93, remarks of Senator Florence D. Finney. We see no reason to conclude, therefore, that the legislature intended the result urged by Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We are not persuaded, moreover, that Home\u2019s subrogation claim against Aetna is, in effect, the same action as Home\u2019s claim against Schuss for the puipose of \u00a7 52-146f (5). The principle of substitution in subrogation actions refers not to the relationship between the underlying claim and the subrogation action but, rather, to the substitution of the subrogee for the subrogor. Indeed, the right to subrogation does not depend on the existence of any earlier litigation. See <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>123 Conn. 232, 238, 193 A.2d 769 (1937) (\u201c[subrogation] is a legal fiction through which one who, not as a volunteer or in his own wrong and where there are no outstanding and superior equities, pays the debt of another, is substituted to all the rights and remedies of the other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Furthermore, the claims underlying Home\u2019s action against Schuss and its action against Aetna are completely different: the former was brought as a common law trespass action, and the latter as a statutory subrogation action involving the scope of an insurer\u2019s liability coverage under an insurance policy. Because the claims are separate and distinct, the facts to be proven in satisfaction thereof are also different. Finally, although the two actions were commenced by the same plaintiff, each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>involves a different, defendant who is not a party to the other action. Thus, the fact that the two actions have their origins in the same event does not transform them into one proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Although neither the Appellate Court nor Home cite any authority for the proposition that \u00a7 52-146f (5) applies to a subrogation action in which the subrogor seeking to protect the confidentiality of his or her psychiatric records is not a party, Home relies generally on <em>Goldenberg </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>44 F.R.D. 33 (D. Conn. 1968), to support its claim. In <em>Goldenberg, </em>the plaintiff sued her attorney for legal malpractice for his handling of a case in which the plaintiffs mental condition was an issue. Although the trial court in <em>Goldenberg </em>concluded that the plaintiffs psychiatric records were disclosable under \u00a7 52-146f (5), its conclusion was not based upon any connection between the two cases but, rather, because the plaintiff, in initiating the second action, thereby had placed her mental condition at issue. Here, Schuss is not a party to the second action and, therefore, Home cannot claim that Schuss has placed his mental condition at issue as required by \u00a7 52-146f (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In sum, Home\u2019s claim finds no support in the language of \u00a7 52-146f (5), the pertinent legislative history, the policy underlying the psychiatrist-patient privilege or any precedent. We conclude, therefore, that Home is not entitled to access to Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records under \u00a7 52-146f (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Home next asserts that \u00a7 38a-321, which subrogates a judgment creditor to the rights of his or her debtor against the debtor\u2019s insurer, authorized Home to waive the confidentiality of Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>argument misperceives the reach of our subrogation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Under \u00a7 38a-321, a party who obtains a judgment against an insured defendant \u201cshall be subrogated to all the rights of the defendant and shall have a right of action against the insurer to the same extent that the defendant . . . could have enforced his claim against such insurer had such defendant paid such judgment.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 38a-321 authorized Home to assert any claim or defense that Schuss himself could have raised had Schuss himself brought suit against Aetna. We repeatedly have stated, however, that the \u201cintention of the [statute] is to give to the [judgment creditor] the same rights <em>under the policy </em>as the assured . . . .\u2019\u2019(Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Reinsurance Corp., </em>206 Conn. 668, 672, 539 A.2d 138 (1988), quoting <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>107 Conn. 649, 653, 142 A. 268 (1928); see also <em>Verdon </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 363, 369, 446 A.2d 3 (1982). Because Schuss\u2019 right to maintain the confidentiality of communications with his psychiatrist arises under \u00a7 52-146e and not under his contract of insurance with Aetna, \u00a7 38a-321 does not empower Home to waive Schuss\u2019 privilege. Although Home was entitled, of course, to raise the claim that Schuss did not intend to cause damage to the synagogue when he set it afire, Home\u2019s assertion of such a claim does not also entitle it to access to Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In effect, Home urges us to construe \u00a7 38a-321 as creating an exception to a psychiatric patient\u2019s right to confidentiality under \u00a7 52-146e. See <em>Skrzypiec </em>v. <em>Noonan, </em>228 Conn. 1, 9-10 n.6, 633 A.2d 716 (1993) (reserving question of whether disclosure of otherwise confidential psychiatric records was authorized by Workers\u2019 Compensation Act). We decline to do so because we are unable to find any support for Home\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>claim either in the relevant statutory language or legislative history. In light of the public policy favoring the confidentiality of communications that fall within the ambit of \u00a7 52-146e, we will not engraft an exception onto the privilege established thereunder in the absence of persuasive evidence that such an exception was intended by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Home cites <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 223, in support of the claim that the legislature intended to empower a subrogee to waive its subrogor\u2019s psychiatrist-patient privilege. In <em>White, </em>we concluded that General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 19-492 (c),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> since repealed, established a specific exception to the psychiatrist-patient privilege in the case of a criminal defendant who had been ordered to receive drug treatment as a condition of his probation. In <em>White, </em>we based our determination on the statutory scheme governing the confinement and treatment of drug dependent persons, and in particular \u00a7 19-492 (c), which required the court, inter alia, to determine whether a probationer had satisfied the teims and conditions of a court-ordered treatment program. As we stated in <em>White, </em>\u201c\u00a7\u00a7 52-146d [through] 52-146j establish a general privilege, while \u00a7 19-492 (c) specifies instances, such as we have here, in which such a privilege may not be invoked. . . . [S]pecific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 232-33. Application of this principle of statutory construction to the present case defeats Home\u2019s claim: the specific, narrowly tailored exception to the psychiatrist-patient priv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ilege embodied in \u00a7 52-146f (5) prevails over the general subrogation provisions of \u00a7 38a-321.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Finally, our conclusion is consistent with one of the primary purposes underlying the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 52-146e and 52-146f, namely, to give \u201cthe patient control over who gets his records.\u201d 13 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1969 Sess., p. 4191, remarks of Representative Robert G. Oliver. The statutory construction urged by Home would remove such control from the patient-subrogor by permitting the subrogee to waive the patient\u2019s privilege without regard to the patient\u2019s desire to maintain the confidentiality of his or her psychiatric communications and records. Because we are not persuaded that the legislature intended such a result, we reject Home\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Home\u2019s final argument is that the stipulation it entered into with Schuss carried with it an implied covenant that Schuss would take no action detrimental to Home\u2019s subrogation claim against Aetna. Schuss\u2019 efforts to block the release of his psychiatric records, Home maintains, violated this implied covenant. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Home argues that because Schuss knew that Home would proceed against Aetna under \u00a7 38a-321 after having obtained a judgment against Schuss, Home \u201cjustifiably expected to obtain all the records of Schuss necessary to prosecute its subrogation action.\u201d In the circumstances, however, Home\u2019s expectation that it would be able to obtain Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records gave rise to no legally cognizable right in Home to gain access to those records. We have stated that \u201c[e]very contract carries an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requiring that neither party do anything that will injure the right of the other <em>to receive the benefits of the </em>agreement.\u201d <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>238, 618 A.2d 501 (1992); see also <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Konover, </em>210 Conn. 150, 154-56, 533 A.2d 1138 (1989). Home, therefore, reasonably may argue that Schuss, in entering into the agreement with Home, impliedly promised not to do anything to frustrate Home\u2019s right to receive the benefit to which it was entitled under the stipulation, namely, to obtain a judgment against Schuss on the issue of damages. Home has identified no conduct by Schuss, however, including Schuss\u2019 efforts to bar the release of his psychiatric records, that could be said to run afoul of any such covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">There is further reason to reject Home\u2019s claim. Whatever contractual obligation Home claims Schuss had to assist Home in its litigation against Aetna, that obligation, in the absence of an explicit agreement between the parties, cannot extend to Schuss\u2019 statutoiy right to maintain the confidentiality of his psychiatric records. To conclude otherwise would allow Home to obtain access to Schuss\u2019 confidential psychiatric communications without demonstrating either that the records were available under a recognized exception to the psychiatrist-patient privilege or that Schuss himself expressly had consented to the release of the records. In view of the strong public policy in favor of the confidentiality of psychiatric communications, it cannot be presumed that Schuss\u2019 agreement to a stipulated judgment on the issue of damages also represented his consent to the release of the records in question. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 629-30, 424 A.2d 293 (1979) (waiver of privilege not effective unless knowing and intelligent). Furthermore, Schuss consistently has taken the position that his psychiatric records are confidential and not subject to release.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We will not, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>read into the stipulation a provision requiring Schuss to waive his privilege against the disclosure of his confidential psychiatric records.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Aetna claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court should not have granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established. Summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 384. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . Although the party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact ... a party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. . . . It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court [in support of a motion for summary judgment].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotations marks omitted.) <em>Water &amp; Way Properties </em>v. <em>Colt\u2019s Mfg.

Only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>evidence that would be admissible at trial may be used to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment. See Practice Book \u00a7 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In support of its opposition to Aetna\u2019s summary judgment motion, Home offered as evidence the special defense, later withdrawn, asserted by Schuss in Home\u2019s action against him, as well as Schuss\u2019 deposition testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court properly rejected Home\u2019s claim that Schuss\u2019 special defense is admissible in this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We also conclude that the trial court correctly found that Schuss\u2019 deposition testimony was not sufficient to defeat Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We turn first to Home\u2019s argument that Schuss\u2019 assertion of a special defense empowered Home to use that defense for the purpose of establishing a factual basis for its claim that Schuss did not intend to cause damage to the synagogue and, consequently, that Schuss\u2019 conduct falls outside the provision in Aetna\u2019s policy excluding from coverage any property damage intentionally caused by its insured. Although assertions in pleadings generally are inadmissible as hearsay, \u201c[statements in pleadings that are inconsistent with claims advanced at trial are admissible as judicial admissions.\u201d <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>Pelkey, </em>176 Conn. 245, 248, 405 A.2d 665 (1978). Furthermore, \u201ca superseded pleading remains in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>as a part of its history and is available to the adverse party as an admission.\u201d Id.; see also C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 6.7.1 (\u201cevidentiary distinction between operative pleadings and superseded pleadings should never be overlooked\u201d). Home claims, therefore, that Schuss\u2019 special defense, though later withdrawn, is admissible as the admission of a party opponent. Evidence of the judicial admission of Schuss is not admissible in this action, however, because although Schuss\u2019 judicial admission might be admissible <em>against </em>Home as Schuss\u2019 subrogee, it could not be used <em>by </em>Home against Aetna.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Consequently, the only admissible evidence offered by Home in opposition to Aetna\u2019s summary judgment motion was Schuss\u2019 deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Home advances two arguments in support of its position that Schuss\u2019 deposition testimony raised a sufficient issue of material fact to have defeated Aetna\u2019s summary judgment motion. First, Home claims that the testimony created a doubt as to Schuss\u2019 credibility regarding his intent to cause damage to the synagogue. Second, Home contends that Schuss\u2019 deposition testimony is sufficient to permit an inference that Schuss lacked the soundness of mind to have intentionally caused damage to the synagogue. We are not persuaded by either of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Our careful review of Schuss\u2019 deposition testimony reveals that Schuss testified consistently and unequivocally that he had intended to set fire to the Emanuel Synagogue for the purpose of damaging it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Home does not allege otherwise. Home claims, however, that because Schuss was able to recall certain events more clearly when he was deposed in 1992 than when he was originally deposed in 1988, his credibility is suspect. This claim, however, is not substantiated by the deposition testimony. Schuss\u2019 1992 testimony, though more complete, is entirely consistent with his 1988 testimony. Furthermore, nothing in Schuss\u2019 later deposition testimony reasonably may be construed to cast doubt on the credibility of his statements that he intended to set the fire and to cause damage to the synagogue.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In addition, when Schuss was asked whether he had been able to control his actions when he set the fire, Schuss stated that he was in control and that, had he wanted to, he could have stopped himself. Further, Schuss\u2019 testimony that he had wanted to \u201ccaus[e] trouble\u201d by setting the fire and that he was fearful only about getting caught clearly indicates that he was aware of the wrongfulness of his actions. Home has produced no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We have not had occasion to decide the question of how an insured\u2019s mental condition may affect the application of an insurance policy\u2019s intentional act exclusion clause.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We need not consider this issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>however, because we conclude that Home has failed to adduce any evidence to establish that Schuss did not intend to cause damage to the Emanuel Synagogue when he set it ablaze.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Consequently, a jury reasonably could not have concluded that Schuss\u2019 conduct in setting the fire fell outside the exclusion contained in Aetna\u2019s policy for intentional property damage caused by an insured. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> We granted Schuss\u2019 petition for certification to appeal limited to the following question: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the psychiatric records of Barry Schuss were disclosable under General Statutes \u00a7 52-146f (5)?\u201d <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty </em>Co., 231 Conn. 921, 648 A.2d 163 (1994). We granted Aetna\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following question: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly reverse the trial court\u2019s summary judgment on the ground that [there] was a sufficient question of fact regarding whether Barry Schuss intended to cause damage, within the meaning of the defendant\u2019s policy exclusion?\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The two appeals have been consolidated for presentation to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-113 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of arson in the third degree when he recklessly causes destruction or damage to a building ... of his own or of another by intentionally starting a fire or causing an explosion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> The trial court had granted Home\u2019s unopposed motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability.

The Appellate Court concluded that Home had satisfied this requirement; see <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 35 Conn.

Schuss argues, therefore, that to the extent he had placed his mental condition at issue in the earlier action, he had removed the issue from the case when he withdrew his special defense. Home, on the other hand, claims that once Schuss introduced his mental condition into the case, Home had a right to obtain Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records regardless of the fact that Schuss later withdrew his special defense. In light of our conclusion that \u00a7 52-146f (5) does not apply to this action, we do not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"> Because the Appellate Court agreed with Home\u2019s first argument, it did not consider any of Home\u2019s other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 19-492 (c) provided: \u201cNo physician or staff member of any facility for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug-dependent, persons pursuant to this chapter who submits any report or files any petition authorized by this chapter shall be held to have violated any otherwise confidential relationship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> For example, there are indications in Schuss\u2019 April, 1988 deposition that Schuss withdrew his special defense to avoid the release of the records under \u00a7 52-146f (5).

In fact, at Schuss\u2019 deposition in December, 1990, Schuss\u2019 counsel repeatedly objected to questions regarding Schuss\u2019 thought processes at the time of the fire \u201cbecause [Home has] been trying throughout to get into [Schuss\u2019] psychiatric records and we are not opening any doors in that [regard].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> Schuss was deposed by Home on April 29, 1988, December 18, 1990, February 11, 1992, and May 18, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> Accordingly, Schuss\u2019 psychiatric records also are not available to Home under \u00a7 52-146f (5).
