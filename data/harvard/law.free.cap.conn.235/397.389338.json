After a jury trial, the defendant, Geraldo Torres, was convicted of the crimes of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, attempted murder in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a (a), carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 and 29-37 (b) and conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed to this court, and we transferred his appeal to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 4023. In a per curiam decision, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment against the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>36 Conn. App. 924, 650 A.2d 182 (1994). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the issue of the validity of the preliminary jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>instructions in his case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The defendant does not challenge the accuracy of the trial court\u2019s final instructions concerning the state\u2019s burden of proof. He maintains, however, that the trial court at voir dire had used hypothetical examples that improperly diluted the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the court had referred back to these examples during its reinstruction of the jurors immediately after they had been sworn in. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s final instructions impliedly incorporated its allegedly improper preliminary instructions. According to the defendant, the jury would have understood the trial court to have intended such an incorporation because the court\u2019s final instructions did not expressly disavow any of its preliminary instructions. At trial, the defendant objected neither to the preliminary instructions when they were given nor to the trial court\u2019s alleged failure, in its final instructions, to direct the jury to disregard the preliminary instructions. The defendant maintains that he is nonetheless entitled to appellate review of his claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or as a matter of plain error. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Having examined the record on appeal and studied the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the appeal in this case must be dismissed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ground that certification was improvidently granted. The defendant\u2019s argument cannot be sustained in light of the holdings in an unbroken series of dispositive cases decided by this court and the Appellate Court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 536-37, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 614-16, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>201 Conn. 605, 618-28, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>23 Conn. App. 160, 168-70, 580 A.2d 520, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 831, 583 A.2d 130 (1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 981, 111 S. Ct. 1635, 113 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1991). It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion that these cases contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201cMurder, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person ....</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u201c (c) Murder is punishable as a class A felony in accordance with subdivision (2) of section 53a-35a unless it is a capital felony or murder under section 53a-54d.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 provides in relevant part: \u201cCriminal attempt: Sufficiency of conduct; renunciation as defense, (a) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he: (1) Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or (2) intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 provides in relevant part: \u201cCarrying of pistol or revolver without permit prohibited.
