Tremaine, may be required to pay lump sum alimony to the plaintiff, Nancy G. Tremaine, under the terms of a separation agreement that had been incorporated into the judgment dissolving their marriage and, in addition, whether the defendant has such complete control over the corpus of a certain trust that the value of the entire trust corpus may be included in the calculation of his estate for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>of determining alimony. Two years after the marital dissolution judgment had been rendered, the plaintiff, in accordance with the terms of the separation agreement, filed a motion seeking alimony from the defendant. The trial court awarded the plaintiff both lump sum and periodic alimony based in part on its finding that the value of the entire trust corpus should be considered in determining the defendant\u2019s net worth. The Appellate Court concluded that although the trial court had properly considered the trust corpus as an asset of the defendant, the separation agreement incorporated by reference into the marital dissolution judgment did not permit an award of lump sum alimony. <em>Tremaine </em>v. <em>Tremaine, </em>34 Conn. App. 785, 643 A.2d 1291 (1994). Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case with direction to establish an appropriate award of periodic alimony to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The plaintiff filed a petition for certification<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with this court, claiming that the Appellate Court had incorrectly concluded that an award of lump sum alimony was prohibited under the terms of the marital dissolution judgment. The defendant, who seeks affirmance of the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the trial court\u2019s award of lump sum alimony, also claims that the Appellate Court, like the trial court, improperly concluded that he has such complete control over the trust corpus that, despite the trust form, the value of the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>corpus should be included in the calculation of his estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although we agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court\u2019s award of lump sum alimony was not authorized under the marital dissolution judgment, we also conclude that the trial court improperly attributed to the defendant\u2019s estate the value of the entire trust corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed. The plaintiff and the defendant were married in 1972, and had four children. In July, 1986, the plaintiff obtained a legal separation from the defendant on the ground that irreconcilable differences had caused the irretrievable breakdown of their marriage. The plaintiff thereafter sought a divorce from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">During the pendency of the plaintiffs marital dissolution action, the parties, in December, 1987, executed a written separation agreement. The separation agreement provided, inter alia, that the plaintiff would not request alimony from the defendant for a period of at least twenty-four months from the date of the marital dissolution judgment. The agreement also provided that the plaintiff could thereafter seek alimony in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>period not to exceed seven years from the date of the judgment or until the plaintiffs death or remarriage, whichever occurred first and, furthermore, that any alimony awarded by the court would be retroactive to twenty-four months after the date of the dissolution judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>On February 5, 1988, the trial court, <em>Novack, J., </em>rendered a judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. In rendering its judgment, the trial court approved the parties\u2019 separation agreement and incorporated it by reference into the divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Upon the expiration of the two year period following the dissolution judgment, the plaintiff, who had not remarried, applied for an award of alimony. The trial court, <em>Hon. Margaret C. Driscoll, </em>state trial referee, conducted a hearing on the plaintiffs application and, on February 13, 1992, issued a memorandum of decision. In its decision, the trial court concluded that the parties\u2019 separation agreement did not specifically prohibit either an award of lump sum alimony or periodic alimony, or both. The trial court then proceeded to review the criteria relevant to alimony under \u00a7 46b-82, including the parties\u2019 income and assets. The factors relied upon by the trial court in fashioning its alimony award were summarized by the Appellate Court as follows: \u201cThe [trial] court then noted that the plaintiff had received the family residence, valued between $750,000 and $975,000, and that she had assumed two mortgages on the property totaling $239,000. It is also noted that she had received physical custody of the four children, and that the defendant had been ordered to pay $36,000 annually in child support. The court then found that at the time of the dissolution the defendant had assets of $1,722,266 and an annual income of $136,000. The plaintiff had minimal work experience and had monthly expenses of $10,917. The court further found that the parties had been married for fourteen years, that the cause of the dissolution was the defendant\u2019s conduct, that both parties were accustomed to an \u2018exceedingly affluent lifestyle and led active, social lives,\u2019 that the defendant\u2019s income and assets were substantially more than he reported in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>his financial affidavits, and that the plaintiffs employ-ability was limited by her age, her long absence from the labor market, and the needs of her children, whose best interests counseled against the plaintiffs seeking full-time employment.\u201d <em>Tremaine </em>v. <em>Tremaine, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The trial court included in its calculation of the defendant\u2019s assets the corpus of an express, irrevocable trust that had been established in October, 1988, eight months after the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, for the defendant\u2019s benefit by his grandfather, Burton G. Tremaine, Sr.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trust instrument, known as the Burton G. Tremaine Irrevocable Trust Agreement (trust), provides that, during the defendant\u2019s lifetime, the trustee shall pay to the defendant, in periodic installments not less often than quarterly, all of the net income produced by the trust corpus, plus so much of the principal as the trustee, in its sole discretion, determines to be \u201cnecessary or advisable for [the defendant\u2019s] comfortable care, maintenance and support.\u201d The trust instrument also grants to the defendant a testamentary general power of appointment over the corpus of the trust.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time of its creation, the trust corpus consisted of numerous shares of publicly traded common stock, shares of stock of a private corporation known as the Miller Company, and a small amount of cash. The trial court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>by 1989, the corpus of the trust, excluding the Miller Company stock, had a value in excess of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Under the terms of the trust instrument, the defendant is also empowered to designate a professional investment advisor to \u201cdirect the investment, reinvestment or disposal\u201d of all of the trust property except the Miller Company stock.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant exercised his right to appoint an investment advisor on May 18,1989, selecting a Virginia based investment management firm, Nye, Parnell &amp; Emerson Capital Management, Inc. On the following day, the investment advisor directed the trustee to purchase and furnish, with trust funds, a residence located at 127 Lambert Road in New Canaan at a total cost of $644,000. The investment advisor further indicated to the trustee that the defendant should be permitted to reside in the home rent free.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trustee complied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>with the instructions of the investment advisor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the trial court found that the defendant had also obtained additional funds of approximately $50,000 from the trust for wedding expenses, legal fees and the repayment of a loan. On the basis of these facts, the trial court concluded that the defendant had \u201ctotal control of the disposition of the [trust] principal . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">After considering the factors relevant to a determination of alimony under \u00a7 46b-82, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to both lump sum and periodic alimony. Accordingly, the court awarded the plaintiff lump sum alimony in the amount of $350,000, along with periodic alimony of $1000 per week retroactive to June 1,1990, such periodic payments to continue until June 1, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court had improperly: (1) awarded lump sum alimony to the plaintiff contrary to the terms of the separation agreement that had been incorporated into the marital dissolution judgment; and (2) concluded that the trust instrument confers upon the defendant such complete control over the trust corpus that the value of the entire corpus should be included in the calculation of the defendant\u2019s estate for the purpose of determining alimony. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant and concluded that only periodic alimony, and not lump <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>sum alimony, was authorized under the dissolution judgment. <em>Tremaine </em>v. <em>Tremaine, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 792-93. The Appellate Court also concluded, however, that the trial court had properly considered the value of the entire trust corpus in determining the value of the defendant\u2019s assets. Id., 798-99. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case with direction to establish an appropriate award of periodic alimony to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court, <em>Novack, J., </em>had approved the parties\u2019 separation agreement insofar as the agreement purported to govern the kind of alimony that could be awarded to the plaintiff and, consequently, that the Appellate Court was incorrect in concluding that Judge Driscoll was bound by the terms of the separation agreement. The plaintiff further claims that, even if Judge Driscoll was bound by the terms of the separation agreement, the agreement did not prohibit an award of lump sum alimony. The defendant claims that the trial court and the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trust instrument confers upon the defendant such complete control over the trust corpus that the value of the entire corpus should be included in the calculation of the value of his estate. We agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court was without authority to award the plaintiff lump sum alimony, but we disagree that the trial court, on the record before it, properly included the value of the entire trust corpus in its calculation of the defendant\u2019s estate for the purpose of determining alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that Judge Novack had approved that portion of the separation agreement that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>claims limits any future award of alimony to periodic alimony. The plaintiff contends that the only aspect of the separation agreement approved by Judge Novack relating to alimony was the provision of the agreement that prohibited the plaintiff from seeking alimony within twenty-four months of the date of the marital dissolution judgment. According to the plaintiffs argument, even if the separation agreement could be construed to proscribe any future award of lump sum alimony, Judge Driscoll was free to accept or reject any such provision under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because it had not been approved by Judge Novack. See <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>188 Conn. 98, 103, 448 A.2d 822 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1148, 103 S. Ct. 792, 74 L. Ed. 2d 997 (1983) (trial court not bound by terms of parties\u2019 agreement on alimony if court determines that stipulation is not fair and equitable).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We reject the plaintiffs claim because it has no support in the record. Judge Novack expressly approved the parties\u2019 separation agreement and, contrary to the plaintiffs contention, there is no indication that his approval was limited to any particular term or terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the agreement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, the record contains no suggestion that Judge Driscoll believed that she was free to reject any of the provisions of the separation agreement, or that Judge Driscoll had in fact rejected any of the agreement\u2019s terms. On the contrary, Judge Driscoll expressly acknowledged that her review of the plaintiffs petition for alimony was governed by the terms of the separation agreement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiffs claim that Judge Driscoll was not bound by the terms of the separation agreement approved and incorporated into the marital dissolution judgment by Judge Novack is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the Appellate Court improperly construed the parties\u2019 separation agreement as precluding an award of lump sum alimony. The plaintiff contends that because the alimony provisions contained in article II of the separation agreement do not specifically prohibit an award of lump sum alimony; see footnote 4; the Appellate Court was incorrect when it concluded that the parties contemplated an award of periodic alimony only. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Where, as here, the parties\u2019 written agreement regarding alimony is fair and equitable, the court is authorized to incoxporate that agreement by reference into its dissolution judgment. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66. \u201cA judgment rendered in accordance with such a stipulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the parties is to be regarded and construed as a contract.\u201d <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>214 Conn. 99, 109, 570 A.2d 690 (1990). Thus, our resolution of the plaintiffs claim is guided by the principles that govern the construction of contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u201cA contract is to be construed as a whole and all relevant provisions will be considered together. ... In giving meaning to the terms of a contract, we have said that a contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the contracting parties. . . . The intention of the parties to a contract is to be determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. ... In interpreting contract items, we have repeatedly stated that the intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and that the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 109-10. \u201cSimilarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>232 Conn. 272, 279, 654 A.2d 737 (1995). Absent a statutory warranty or definitive contract language, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a contract, being a determination of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact that is subject to reversal on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous. <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 199, 520 A.2d 208 (1987). Applying these principles to the separation agreement incorporated into the dissolution judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>we agree with the Appellate Court that the parties\u2019 agreement precluded an award of lump sum alimony and that the interpretation of the stipulated judgment by Judge Driscoll was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Judge Driscoll noted that article II of the separation agreement did not expressly prohibit an award of lump sum alimony and, on that basis, concluded that it was free to award both lump sum alimony and periodic alimony to the plaintiff. In so concluding, however, Judge Driscoll failed to give effect to several provisions of the separation agreement that together clearly reflect the parties\u2019 intent to limit any award of alimony to periodic alimony. Specifically, \u00a7 2.2 of article II of the agreement provides that the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay alimony shall not commence until two years after the date of the dissolution judgment, that \u201cthe alimony term shall not exceed a date of seven years from that date,\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation would cease upon the death either of the plaintiff or the defendant, or the remarriage of the plaintiff. Furthermore, \u00a7 2.4 of the agreement states that any alimony award shall be retroactive to the date of the judgment. The Appellate Court correctly concluded that these provisions, which contemplate a series of payments to be made over time rather than a single, unitary payment, are clearly indicative of an award of periodic alimony and not lump sum alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Two other provisions of the separation agreement also support the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s award of lump sum alimony was not authorized under the agreement. First, \u00a7 13.2 of the agreement permits either party to seek a modification of the alimony award based upon a change in circumstances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cLump sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>alimony, unlike periodic alimony, is a final judgment which cannot be modified even should there be a substantial change in circumstances.\u201d <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Scoville, </em>179 Conn. 277, 279-80, 426 A.2d 271 (1979). Thus, as the Appellate Court stated, \u201cbecause lump sum alimony is not modifiable as a matter of law, whereas periodic alimony is modifiable unless the decree explicitly precludes modification, the presence in the separation agreement of language regarding the nonmodifiability of the alimony payments indicates that only periodic alimony was contemplated by the parties.\u201d <em>Tremaine </em>v. <em>Tremaine, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Second, article X of the agreement, entitled \u201cTax Application,\u201d provides further substantiation for the defendant\u2019s claim that the agreement precluded an award of lump sum alimony. Sections 10.4 and 10.5 of article X state in relevant part that <em>\u201call payments </em>pursuant to [article II] hereof are intended to be alimony deductible by the HUSBAND and includible by the WIFE <em>in their entirety. . . . </em>The WIFE agrees to include <em>all of the payments </em>which she receives as set forth in [article II of the agreement], as income in her Federal and, if appropriate, State and/or Municipal tax returns and that she shall be solely responsible for any and all taxes on such income.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As the Appellate Court concluded, because lump sum alimony is generally neither taxable to the payee nor deductible by the payor under the Internal Revenue Code; see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 215; \u00a7\u00a7 10.4 and 10.5 of the separation agreement are not compatible with an intent that the defendant pay lump sum alimony. <em>Tremaine </em>v. <em>Tremaine, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>In light of these provisions, and in the absence of any suggestion in the separation agreement that the parties contemplated the possibility of an award of lump sum alimony, we agree with the Appellate Court that the dissolution judgment precluded the trial court from awarding lump sum alimony to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the judgment rendered by the trial court includes an award of periodic alimony, we agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court must be afforded an opportunity to reconsider that award \u201c[bjecause the financial orders of the trial court granting both lump sum and periodic alimony are interwoven,\u201d and, therefore, \u201c[t]he amount the plaintiff should receive as periodic alimony is necessarily affected by our conclusion that lump sum alimony could not be awarded.\u201d Id., 793. Accordingly, the case must be remanded to the trial court so that it may fashion an appropriate award of periodic alimony to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trust instrument bestows upon him such complete control over the trust corpus that the value of the entire corpus should be included in ascertaining the value of the defendant\u2019s estate for the purpose of determining alimony. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we note that the trust instrument specifies that \u201c[t]he trusts created by this instrument shall be deemed to have their situs in the State of Ohio. The validity of the trusts created hereunder and the validity, construction and interpretation of the provisions contained in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>instrument shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio from time to time in force.\u201d Accordingly, our construction of the trust instrument must be guided by Ohio law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Under the law of Ohio, the beneficiary of a trust may exercise no greater control over the trust property than the settlor has granted to him by means of the trust instrument. <em>Scott v. Bank One Trust Co., </em>N.A., 62 Ohio St. 3d 39, 48, 577 N.E.2d 1077 (1991). Thus, a \u201cfundamental [tenet] for the construction of a . . . trust is to ascertain, within the bounds of the law, the intent of the testator, grantor or settlor.\u201d <em>Domo </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>66 Ohio St. 3d 312, 314, 612 N.E.2d 706 (1993). In determining the intent of the settlor, the words used in the instrument are to be interpreted in their ordinary sense, and all of the provisions of the trust instrument must be construed together, with every word given effect, if possible. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>National City Bank, </em>45 Ohio St. 3d 276, 279, 544 N.E.2d 612 (1989). When the language of the trust instrument is not ambiguous, intent can be ascertained from the express terms of the trust itself. <em>Domo </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra, 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the relevant terms of the trust agreement. Section 2 (a) of the trust instrument directs the trustee to make regular payments to the defendant of all of the income earned by the trust for the duration of the defendant\u2019s life. Section 2 (a) further provides that the trustee shall pay to the defendant so much of the trust principal as shall, in the sole discretion of the trustee, be necessary or advisable for the \u201ccomfortable care, maintenance and support\u201d of the defendant. Finally, \u00a7 3 of the trust instrument authorizes the defendant to select an \u201cinvestment advisor\u201d to direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the \u201cinvestment, reinvestment or disposal\u201d of the trust property. The defendant claims that because these provisions do not bestow upon him the right to direct a distribution of trust corpus to himself, the corpus cannot be considered his property. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that the trust instrument affords the defendant complete control over the trust principal, including the right to effect payments of principal to himself, and, therefore, that the trial court properly included the value of that corpus in its calculation of the value of the defendant\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The plaintiff posits two general arguments in support of her contention that the trust instrument gives the defendant total control over the trust corpus. She first contends that the investment advisor has the power, under the provision of the trust instrument that authorizes the advisor to direct the \u201cdisposal\u201d of the trust property, to direct the trustee to distribute the trust principal to the defendant. The plaintiff argues that because the trust agreement authorizes the defendant to select an investment advisor of his choice, the defendant can appoint an advisor who will, in accordance with the defendant\u2019s wishes, direct the trustee to distribute the trust corpus to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We do not agree with the plaintiff that the trust instrument empowers the investment advisor to direct the distribution of trust property to the defendant. Under \u00a7 3 of the instrument, the investment advisor is authorized to supervise and direct the <em>investment </em>decisions of the trust. Because the \u201cdisposal\u201d of trust principal by means of a distribution to the defendant cannot reasonably be construed to constitute an investment decision, we are persuaded that such a distribution is not permitted under the terms of the trust instrument. Furthermore, \u00a7 2 (a) of the trust instrument expressly authorizes the trustee to make payments to the defendant from the trust corpus that, <em>\u201cin the sole discretion </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>of the [tjrustee,\u201d </em>are necessary or advisable for the defendant\u2019s care, maintenance and support. (Emphasis added.) The construction of the term \u201cdisposal\u201d urged by the plaintiff is inconsistent with the settlor\u2019s mandate that the distribution of trust principal is a matter solely within the discretion of the <em>trustee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We conclude, rather, that the investment advisor\u2019s right to direct the \u201cdisposal\u201d of the trust corpus is limited to the power to <em>sell </em>the trust property, for purposes of diversifying the trust assets, preserving the value of the trust property, or for some other legitimate reason. This interpretation of the trust instrument is consistent with the intent of the settlor as expressed throughout the trust instrument, and is the construction ordinarily ascribed to the term \u201cdisposal\u201d as it pertains to a trustee\u2019s duty to manage trust corpus. See, e.g., <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>National City Bank, </em>supra, 45 Ohio St. 3d 281; 1 Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 230 (1959). Thus, because the investment advisor\u2019s right to direct the \u201cdisposal\u201d of trust property embraces only the authority to direct the sale of trust assets, the plaintiffs contention that the defendant can effect a distribution of the trust property to himself through the investment advisor is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The plaintiff also claims that even if the investment advisor cannot lawfully direct the distribution of trust property to the defendant, the trust instrument otherwise empowers the defendant to exercise such complete control over the trust corpus that it must be considered his asset. The plaintiff maintains that the defendant\u2019s control over the trust principal is evidenced by the investment advisor\u2019s direction to the trustee to purchase the New Canaan home, by the advisor\u2019s decision to allow the defendant to reside there rent free, and by the trustee\u2019s distribution of $50,000 in trust funds to the defendant. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>We first note that the defendant does not have authority under the trust instrument to invade the trust corpus, either for his own benefit or for that of another, and he similarly is not entitled to payments of trust principal in excess of what the trustee may deem to be appropriate for the defendant\u2019s care and support. See II A. Scott, Trusts (4th Ed. W. Fratcher 1987) \u00a7\u00a7 128.3 and 128.4; 1 Restatement, supra, \u00a7 128, comment (e); see also <em>Bureau of Support in Dept. of Mental Hygiene &amp; Correction </em>v. <em>Kreitzer, </em>16 Ohio St. 2d 147, 150, 243 N.E.2d 83 (1968); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>24 Ohio Op. 2d 148, 150, 191 N.E.2d 862 (1962). Furthermore, as we have previously indicated, the investment advisor appointed by the defendant cannot direct the trustee to make payments of trust principal to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">It is true, of course, that the defendant has the right under the trust instrument to appoint an investment advisor who, in turn, has broad authority to direct the investment of the trust\u2019s assets. It is also true that the advisor appointed by the defendant instructed the trustee to purchase and furnish a home to serve as the defendant\u2019s rent free abode. Legal title to that home, however, resides in the trustee and not in the defendant. See <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Tenney, </em>165 Ohio St. 513, 518, 138 N.E.2d 15 (1956) (in valid trust, legal title of trust property is owned by trustee, while beneficiary has mere beneficial interest in use of that property). Thus, although the defendant has the use of the New Canaan house, he does not own it. Accordingly, the value of the house to the defendant is not what the house is worth, but rather how much the defendant\u2019s rent free use of the house saves him in living expenses. Because the defendant\u2019s interest in the New Canaan residence is not tantamount to ownership of the property, we are unable to agree with the Appellate Court that \u201c[t]he act of the investment advisor in directing the trustee to purchase a particular house for the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>shows that the principal of the trust is really the defendant\u2019s own.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Tremaine </em>v. <em>Tremaine, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Furthermore, we are not persuaded, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, that the investment advisor\u2019s decision to purchase an asset that has subsequently depreciated in value<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant controls the entire trust corpus. That the purchase of the New Canaan property may not have been a wise investment decision does not alter the fact that the defendant has no ownership interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the trustee\u2019s payment of $50,000 to the defendant for various expenses also indicates that the trust corpus is the property of the defendant. As we have previously stated, however, the defendant cannot control the distribution of the trust corpus; under the terms of the trust instrument, the trustee alone is responsible for deciding whether the defendant may receive payments of trust principal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The fact that the trastee has in the past exercised its discretion to make payments for the \u201ccare, maintenance and support\u201d of the defendant, and that it may again do so in the future, does not support the plaintiffs contention that the defendant can control the distribution of the trust corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Our rejection of the plaintiffs claim that the trust instrument empowers the defendant to exercise complete control over the trust corpus does not, however, preclude the trial court, on remand, from considering the trust\u2019s actual value to the defendant. Indeed, because the defendant is entitled to receive, for the duration of his lifetime, all of the income produced by the trust corpus, the trial court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s income should include the trust income reasonably to be expected from the prudent investment of the trust corpus. Moreover, any payment or other benefit actually bestowed on the defendant by the trustee, including the value to the defendant of the rent free residence, will be relevant to the trial court\u2019s calculation of the value of the defendant\u2019s estate and, therefore, will bear upon the court\u2019s determination of an appropriate periodic alimony award. We conclude only that the trial court, in establishing its award of periodic alimony on remand, may not consider the value of the entire trust corpus as an asset of the defendant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed insofar as it reversed the judgment of the trial court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>remanded the case with direction to establish an appropriate award of periodic alimony to the plaintiff. The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed insofar as it affirmed the decision of the trial court that the trust constituted an asset of the defendant for the purpose of determining alimony and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for a new hearing regarding alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\"> We granted certification limited to the following issues: \u201c1. Did the Appellate Court misconstrue the initial presentation of the separation agreement as an \u2018approved agreement\u2019 with respect to the award of alimony where the initial agreement reserved the determination of alimony for a date in the future?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u201c2. Did the Appellate Court correctly conclude that in a separation agreement that reserves the issue of \u2018alimony\u2019 for determination at a later date, that the term \u2018alimony\u2019 was limited to periodic alimony and did not include lump sum alimony?\u201d <em>Tremaine </em>v. <em>Tremaine, </em>231 Conn. 901, 901-902, 645 A.2d 1020 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> The defendant raised this claim under Practice Book \u00a7 4140, which provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Upon the granting of certification, the appellee may present for review alternative grounds upon which the judgment may be affirmed provided those grounds were raised and briefed in the appellate court. <em>Any party to the appeal may also present for review adverse rulings or decisions which should be considered on the appeal in the event of a new trial, provided that such party has raised such claims in the appellate court. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\"> The separation agreement erroneously stated that the plaintiff could seek alimony pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 rather than under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82.

Because we conclude that the parties\u2019 intent to preclude an award of lump sum alimony is unambiguously manifested in the four comers of the separation agreement, no testimony was needed to establish the intent of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\"> Although our construction of the trust agreement is governed by the law of the state of Ohio, the ultimate question of whether the value of the entire trust corpus was properly attributable to the defendant\u2019s estate must be determined under the law of this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\"> We note that the investment advisor may have lacked the authority under the trust instrument to direct the trustee to allow the defendant\u2019s rent free use of the New Canaan residence because that decision may not have been a bona fide investment decision. It is not clear, however, that the investment advisor actually directed the trustee to permit the defendant to reside in the home rent free; see footnote 8; and we may therefore presume that the trustee exercised its own discretion in authorizing the defendant to forego the payment of rent. Furthermore, the defendant, as the income beneficiary of the trust, would have been entitled to any rental income generated by the residential property. Thus, by paying rent to the trust the defendant would merely be routing the rental payments to himself through the trust. The net economic effect, therefore, of the \u201cno rent\u201d provision is the same as if the trustee had charged the defendant a fair market rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b89-9\"> According to the defendant\u2019s financial statement, the New Canaan property has depreciated in value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\"> The plaintiff does not claim that the investment advisor directed the trustee to make the payments to the defendant totaling $50,000, or that the trustee otherwise failed to exercise properly its discretion in concluding that those payments were \u201cnecessary or advisable for [the defendant\u2019s] comfortable care, maintenance and support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b90-8\"> Because the trust instrument does not prohibit the defendant either from assigning his right to receive the trust income during his lifetime or from promising to exercise his testamentary power of appointment in favor of a particular person or entity, the defendant\u2019s interest in the trust may have value to an investor willing to purchase from the defendant an assignment of the trust income and the defendant\u2019s promise to exercise his testamentary power of appointment in favor of the investor. If the plaintiff can establish that a market exists for the defendant\u2019s interest in the trust, the trial court would not be precluded from assigning a value to that interest for the purpose of determining the defendant\u2019s net worth. We intimate no view, however, on whether the trust does, in fact, have a market value and, if so, what that value may be.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
