We must determine what information relating to medical peer reviews and hospital morbidity studies these statutes shelter from disclosure and what burdens of proof must be assumed by those who seek to avail themselves of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The cumbersome record discloses the following undisputed facts. In July, 1998, the plaintiffs, Eunice Babcock and Keith Babcock, and Gloria Bonaffini and Philip Bonaffini, filed these separate actions seeking damages alleging that the defendants, Bridgeport Hospital (hospital) and its parent company, Southern Connecticut Health Systems, had been negligent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>reckless and had acted in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the complaints in both actions alleged, inter alia, that there had been an epidemic of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in the hospital, that the defendants had failed to prevent its spread and that they had conspired to cover up the epidemic. In their complaint, the Babcocks alleged that during her hospitalization, Eunice Babcock was infected by both MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), causing her to undergo multiple surgeries and suffer serious permanent injuries. In their complaint, the Bonaffinis alleged that Gloria Bonaffini suffered severe illness, injuries and disabilities due to the MRSA infection, including multiple surgical procedures, amputation of her left foot, a tracheostomy and a colostomy, ultimately leading to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">On August 5, 1998, the plaintiffs filed a notice of deposition and production request directed to the hospital\u2019s \u201cInfection Control Officer.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>a notice of deposition and production request directed to Michael Liebowitz, Bridgeport Hospital\u2019s risk manager, and to Karen Hoffer, clinical services manager of Bridgeport Hospital. The defendants moved for a protective order, asserting that the requested material was protected from disclosure by \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17b and 19a-25.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, the plaintiffs filed their first set of interrogatories and accompanying requests for production to which the defendants objected, asserting essentially the same privileges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>In December, 1998, the case was transferred to the Complex Litigation Docket. Thereafter, in January, 1999, the plaintiffs served supplemental interrogatories and production requests, seeking additional data and records relating to infection control at the hospital. The plaintiffs also filed an opposition to the defendants\u2019 requests for a protective order, challenging the defendants\u2019 assertions of statutory privilege to both the plaintiffs\u2019 first set of interrogatories and requests for production, and to the production request that accompanied their notice of deposition. In support of their opposition, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants had failed to make the evidentiary showing needed to establish the existence of either statutory privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Thereafter, the defendants objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental discovery request, asserting, inter alia, that the information requested also was protected by \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17b and 19a-25.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following a scheduling confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>ence on February 24, 1999, the defendants submitted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>pursuant to \u00e1 court order, a memorandum of law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>reply to the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to their motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>protective order. As part of their reply, the defendants included the affidavit of David Baker, a physician and a member of the hospital\u2019s infection control committee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the defendants argued in their reply that when they first filed their motion for a protective order, an evidentiary hearing would have been premature, and that should the court determine that such a hearing is required, the defendants would be able to support the claim of privilege by testimony or additional affidavit. The record does not reflect that the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>requested an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, on March 15, 1999, the plaintiffs sought an adjudication of the discovery issues. On March 17, 1999, the defendants objected to that request insofar as it pertained to the plaintiffs\u2019 two sets of interrogatories and requests for production.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">On March 19,1999, the trial court issued the following order in response to the most recent pleadings: \u201cAt the case management conference conducted on [February 24, 1999] the parties were advised to take all steps necessary for adjudication of pending discovery disputes. The [hospital] did not file its brief in support of its objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories but now claims that the objections should not be adjudicated because it has failed to file its brief. Any brief shall be filed on or before March 30, 1999. The [hopsital] shall by that date file a \u2018privilege log\u2019 listing any document claimed to be privileged or exempt from disclosure by virtue of any statute. As to each item claimed to be privileged, the defendant shall list what the claimed source of the privilege or exemption [is]. If the [hospital] fails to comply, the court will rule on the issues on the state of the submissions and will not revisit the issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion for articulation as to the court\u2019s order. Protesting that at the February 24, 1999 conference the court had ordered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>defendants to reply to the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to the motion for a protective order and that no orders had been entered relative to the objections to the interrogatories and requests for production, the defendants sought an additional thirty day time period within which to respond. The trial court extended the time period for the defendants to make their submissions until April 15, 1999, and reiterated that the defendants were to \u201ccomply with this court\u2019s <em>order </em>to file a privilege log listing each document claimed to be privileged and the legal basis for the privilege.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court added that, \u201c[wjhere the title of a document for which a privilege is claimed does not reveal its nature, that document shall be supplied to the court but not to the plaintiff(s) at this stage.\u201d Finally, the court emphasized that the defendants were to submit briefs on any objections to discovery by April 15, 1999, \u201cor the objections will be decided on the basis of the briefs on file as of that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">On April 15, 1999, the defendants filed a brief in support of their objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for production of August, 1998, and January, 1999; see footnotes 5 and 6 of this opinion; adopting by reference the arguments they had made earlier. (See defendants\u2019 brief supporting motions for protective order concerning production of documents in connection with noticed depositions and their reply to plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to their motion for protective order.) Additionally, <em>as ordered, </em>the defendants submitted a privilege log to the court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They did not submit any documents for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>camera review. One week thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">On May 28,1999, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision denying the defendants\u2019 motion for protective order and overruling their objections based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>peer review and morbidity and mortality studies privileges. Specifically, as to the defendants\u2019 peer review privilege claim under \u00a7 19a-17b, the trial court found that the documents listed in the privilege log were statistics, graphs, flow charts, memos and chronologies, and that, although they allegedly had been prepared by the hospital\u2019s infection control committee, \u201cthe bare titles\u201d of the documents listed did not \u201csuggest that their focus is the performance of any health care professional, nor have the defendants supplied any affidavits to the effect that peer review was the task to which the documents are addressed.\u201d The trial court also rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the items listed in the log were protected under the morbidity and mortality studies privilege of \u00a7 19a-25. According to the court, even though the descriptions of the ninety-one items indicated that they were procured \u201cin the sense of collection or generation, by the defendants\u2019 infection control committee . . . [t]he titles and descriptions of the documents do not, however, indicate that they were collected or generated in connection with studies of morbidity or mortality ... or that they were procured for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality. . . . The defendants have not filed any affidavit in which any competent witness has stated whether any of the ninety-one documents for which an exemption is claimed was procured \u2018in connection with a study of morbidity or mortality,\u2019 nor whether the purpose of the study, if there was one, was the reduction of morbidity or mortality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) With respect to Baker\u2019s affidavit, the trial court noted that although Baker had identified himself as a member of the infection control committee, he listed several reasons for which the committee assembles data, including \u201cestablishing and enforcing guidelines designed to keep within reasonable bounds the cost of health care .... [Although he] avers broadly that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>documents sought by the plaintiffs are an integral part of the infection control committee and were utilized by the infection control committee dining its regularly scheduled meetings . . . [t]his affiant provides no information from which this court can determine whether the information sought was collected for a study concerning reduction of morbidity or mortality, the specific limit of the exemption. . . . Baker\u2019s statements are vague and general, and appear to assume that any information that comes before the infection control committee, of any kind, is exempt. Since this affiant states that his committee reviews data for some purposes that have nothing to do with reducing morbidity or mortality, such as controlling health care costs, there is no basis for this court to presume that the information at issue was acquired and reviewed for purposes defined by \u00a7 19a-25. . . . Averments which do not address those precise issues do not discharge the defendants\u2019 burden of proving the exemption applies to the particular documents sought. Indeed, the inference this court draws from the vagueness of the affidavit is that the selected affiant has purposely offered general statements not addressed to the salient issue because he cannot testify that the documents sought were in fact procured (by his committee) in connection with studies of morbidity and mortality conducted by (his committee) ... for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality from any cause or condition.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court concluded that although the defendants knew of their burden to prove the facts relevant to their claim of privilege, early on in the proceedings they opposed the idea of a hearing and \u201coffered only the assumptions and conclusions of their counsel and the vague generalities of . . . Baker\u2019s affidavit in lieu of competent evidence on the actual issues concerning the nature of the documents in view of the limits of the statutory privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>In connection with the plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental interrogatories and requests for production, the trial court, relying on the explicit statutory language that \u201c[t]his section shall not be deemed to affect disclosure of regular hospital and medical records made in the course of the regular notation of the care and treatment of any patient, but only records or notations by such staff committees pursuant to their work\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-25; see footnote 1 of this opinion for the full text of \u00a7 19a-25; concluded that the medical records of other patients who contracted MRSA during the relevant time period were not protected.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court also overruled the defendants\u2019 objection to the supplemental request for production pertaining to bacterial isolates, based upon its determination that the defendants had failed to establish any connection between the isolates and the peer review statutes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Accordingly, the trial court ordered the defendants to disclose the items in the log to the plaintiffs. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the defendants appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>from the trial court\u2019s ruling denying their motion for a protective order and overruling their objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests. We now address this interlocutory ruling and conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision was proper.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">On appeal, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly denied their motion for a protective order and overruled their objections to discovery based on their claim of privilege under \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17b and 19a-25. They argue that the scope of the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests, in conjunction with Baker\u2019s affidavit, demonstrate conclusively that the documents in question were created by a medical review committee charged with evaluating the performance of health care professionals so as to reduce the incidence of morbidity and mortality. Taking as true the averments in Baker\u2019s affidavit that the documents in question were procured by a medical review committee that is charged with conducting peer review and reducing the incidence of morbidity and mortality; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>232 Conn. 242, 262, 654 A.2d 748 (1995); we nonetheless conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the defendants have failed to establish that the documents are immune from discovery under either \u00a7 19a-17b or \u00a7 19a-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Our analysis of this issue is guided by well established legal principles. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). \u201c[0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 86-87, 662 A.2d 80 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 32, 699 A.2d 101 (1997). In undertaking this analysis, we are mindful that, as with any claim of privilege, a statutory privilege \u201chas the effect of withholding relevant information from the factfinder . . . .\u201d <em>Shew </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, 245 </em>Conn. 149, 157, 714 A.2d 664 (1998); <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>State, </em>230 Conn. 698, 713, 647 A.2d 324 (1994). Accordingly, although a statutory privilege must be applied so as to effectuate its purpose, it is to be applied cautiously and with circumspection because it impedes the truth-seeking function of the adjudicative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">With respect to the appropriate standard of review, Practice Book \u00a7 13-14 (a) provides in relevant part that a trial court \u201cmay, on motion [to compel production], make such order as the ends of justice require.\u201d Consequently, although we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are clearly errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>ous, \u201c[t]he granting or denial of a discovery request rests in the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Standard Tallow Corp. </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 57, 459 A.2d 503 (1983). Provided the trial court properly interpreted the pertinent statutes, a question over which this court has plenary review; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 317; that decision will be reversed only if such an order constitutes an abuse of that discretion. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>249 Conn. 36, 51, 730 A.2d 51 (1999). We conclude that the trial court properly interpreted the statutes in question and did not abuse its discretion in applying them to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">We begin with \u00a7 19a-17b. \u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 93, 102, 680 A.2d 1321 (1996). Section 19a-17b (d) provides: \u201cThe proceedings of a medical review committee conducting a peer review shall not be subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action for or against a health care provider arising out of the matters which are subject to evaluation and review by such committee, and no person who was in attendance at a meeting of such committee shall be permitted or required to testify in any such civil action as to the content of such proceedings; provided the provisions of this subsection shall not preclude (1) in any civil action, the use of any writing which was recorded independently of such proceedings; (2) in any civil action, the testimony of any person concerning the facts which formed the basis for the institution of such proceedings of which he had personal knowledge acquired independently of such proceedings; (3) in any health care provider proceedings concerning the termination or restriction of staff privileges, other than peer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>review, the use of data discussed or developed during peer review proceedings; or (4) in any civil action, disclosure of the fact that staff privileges were terminated or restricted, including the specific restriction imposed, if any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Section 19a-17b (a) defines \u201cpeer review\u201d and \u201cmedical review committee\u201d as follows: \u201c(2) \u2018Peer review\u2019 means the procedure for evaluation by health care professionals of the quality and efficiency of services ordered or performed by other health care professionals, including practice analysis, inpatient hospital and extended care facility utilization review, medical audit, ambulatory care review and claims review. ... (4) \u2018Medical review committee\u2019 shall include any committee of a state or local professional society or a committee of any health care institution established pursuant to written bylaws, and any utilization review committee established pursuant to Public Law 89-97, and a professional standards review organization or a state-wide professional standards review council, established pursuant to Public Law 92-603, engaging in peer review, to gather and review information relating to the care and treatment of patients for the puiposes of (A) evaluating and improving the quality of health care rendered; (B) reducing morbidity or mortality; or (C) establishing and enforcing guidelines designed to keep within reasonable bounds the cost of health care. It shall also mean any hospital board or committee reviewing the professional qualifications or activities of its medical staff or applicants for admission thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the statute, by its language, limits the privilege to the \u201cproceedings of a medical review committee conducting a peer review\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17b (d); which is a specifically defined activity. They further argue that although the statute protects the content of peer review proceedings, it does not necessarily shield all documents used in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>proceedings, nor does it shield all documents utilized by a committee charged, in part, with conducting peer review. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Simply because a hospital committee is a medical review committee does not suggest that all of its activities are considered peer review proceedings. The scope of \u00a7 19a-17b is specifically defined, not by the nature of the committee, but by whether the committee was engaged in \u201cpeer review.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17b (d). That qualifier has been defined separately and, we presume, intentionally. <em>See Hall v. Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 303, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997). Furthermore, the privilege applies only to those documents that reflect the \u201cproceedings\u201d of a peer review, or that were created primarily for the puipose of being utilized during the course of peer review. In addition, the privilege does not apply to those documents that were independently \u201crecorded\u201d or \u201cacquired.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17b (d) (1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We conclude that by using the word \u201cproceedings,\u201d the legislature intended to restrict the privilege to the substantive discourse that takes place at the actual meetings during which \u201cmatters which are subject to evaluation and review by such committee,\u201d are discussed and deliberated. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17b (d); see Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Health and Safety, Pt. 1, 1976 Sess., pp. 284-85; 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 24, 1980 Sess., p. 7098 (1980 amendment). Although the statute does not define \u201cproceedings,\u201d that term, as construed in accordance with its common usage; see <em>State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>244 Conn. 487, 497, 709 A.2d 1129 (1998); refers to \u201can official record of things said or done.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1995). In the context of \u00a7 19a-17b, therefore, we read proceedings as encompassing the sequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>events or the course of action undertaken by a committee engaged in peer review, such as the dialogues, debates and discussions that transpire at a peer review meeting, as well as opinions and conclusions reached by committee members.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The legislative history surrounding the statute further indicates that the privilege applies to the peer review committee\u2019s self-generated analysis, but not to the underlying facts that provide the basis for that analysis when such facts have been collected by an independent source. In 1976, the first proposed version of the peer review statute, House Bill No. 5826, \u00a7 4, provided that \u201c[t]he proceedings and records of a medical review committee shall not be subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action against a health care provider . . . .\u201d Thereafter, the conference committee eliminated the phrase \u201cproceedings and records\u201d and substituted instead the word \u201copinions,\u201d explaining: \u201cThe difference between [House Amendment Schedule \u2018B\u2019] and file No. 399 has to do with section 4. Section 4 gave many of us, particularly in the House, a great deal of technical problems because it would appear ... to create a method <em>whereby certain evidence could be washed through a Peer Review group and thereby be immunized, from utilization in any other proceedings. </em>What House \u2018B\u2019 does is insert a new section 4 which restricts this [privilege] to the <em>opinions </em>of the medical review committee . ... <em>It makes it, crystal clear that evidence itself has not been surrounded with the immunity.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1976 Sess., pp. 4093-94, remarks of Representative James T. Healey; see R. Brunnell, \u201cConnecticut\u2019s Peer Review Immunity Statute: A Legislative History of P.S. 76-413,\u201d 43 Conn. Med. 571 (September 1979). The bill, which ultimately was codified as General Statutes \u00a7 38-19a (d), now \u00a7 19a-17b (d), provided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>pertinent part: \u201cThe opinions of a medical review committee shall not be subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action for or against a health care provider . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Thereafter, in 1980, the legislature amended the statute to provide protection for \u201cproceedings of a medical review committee conducting a peer review,\u201d simultaneously adding language permitting discovery of \u201cindependently recorded writings\u201d and testimony of those individuals having \u201cindependently acquired\u201d personal knowledge. Public Acts 1980, No. 80-446; see Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1980 Sess., pp. 553-54, remarks of Robert J. Brunnell. This language was intended to \u201callow for some confidentiality in peer review proceedings with regard to any hospitals and medical facilities, but, at the same time, it does allow that should there be a civil action with regard to any possible malpractice, that while protecting that peer review confidentiality . . . any knowledge gained really independent of that peer review proceeding would be allowable in a civil action.\u201d 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 24, 1980 Sess., pp. 7096-97, remarks of Representative Richard Lawlor. Returning briefly to the language of the statute itself, we note in the exemptions to the protection, the legislature\u2019s use of \u201cany writing . . . recorded independently of such proceedings [and] . . . the testimony of any person concerning the facts which formed the basis for the institution of such proceedings . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17b (d) (1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In light of the statute\u2019s language and legislative history, we conclude that the privilege afforded by \u00a7 19a-17b applies to the substantive exchanges that transpire during the course of a peer review meeting, and that confidentiality is provided for such exchanges, but not for any knowledge gained by a committee member independent of that meeting. Thus, for example, the minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>of a meeting reflecting such exchanges would be privileged under the statute. We note that often such exchanges may be based upon documents that were submitted to the members of the committee engaging in peer review, but which were generated for more than one purpose. We conclude that the peer review privilege applies to those documents provided they were created principally for the purpose of peer review.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">This interpretation is consistent with the aim of the peer review privilege, which is to encourage committee members to \u201ctake positions that they might not otherwise take if they thought they were going to be subpoenaed in the middle of a malpractice case.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1980 Sess., p. 561; see also <em>Mahmoodian </em>v. <em>United Hospital Center, Inc., </em>185 W. Va. 59, 65, 404 S.E.2d 750, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 863, 112 S. Ct. 185, 116 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1991) (peer review privilege \u201cevinces public policy encouraging health care professionals to monitor the competency and professional conduct of their peers in order to safeguard and improve the quality of patient care\u201d). \u201c[0]nly where . . . peer review committees . . . are assured of confidentiality [will they] feel free to enter into uninhibited discussions of their peers.\u201d <em>Claypool </em>v. <em>Mladineo, </em>724 So. 2d 373, 388 (Miss. 1998); see also <em>Cruger </em>v. <em>Love, </em>599 So. 2d 111, 114-15 (Fla. 1992) (peer review privilege is \u201cintended to prohibit the chilling effect of the potential public disclosure of statements made to or information prepared for and used by the committee in carrying out its peer-review function\u201d); <em>Trinity Medical Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Holum, </em>544 N.W.2d 148, 155 (N.D. 1996) (\u201cphysicians . . . would not feel free to openly discuss the performance of other doctors practicing in the hospital, without assurance that their discussions in committee would be confidential and privileged\u201d); <em>Moretti </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>592 A.2d 855, 857 (R.I. 1991) (\u201c[i]n enacting [Rhode Island\u2019s] peer-review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>statute, the Legislature recognized the need for open discussions and candid self-analysis in peer-review meetings to ensure that medical care of high quality will be available to the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Moreover, this interpretation of \u00a7 19a-17b does not interfere substantially with a medical malpractice plaintiffs access to information, given that evidence of a practitioner\u2019s negligence is immune from discovery only to the extent that it is disclosed solely during the course of peer review. Should a conflict between access to such evidence and peer review confidentiality arise, it was the legislature\u2019s judgment in enacting the peer review privilege that the strong public policy favoring open peer review would outweigh any incidental burden on discovery. See <em>Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, 174 Cal. App. 3d 711, 720, 220 Cal. Rptr. 236 (1985) (peer review statute \u201c \u2018embraces the goal of medical staff candor at the cost of impairing plaintiffs\u2019 access to evidence\u2019 \u201d); <em>State ex rel. Shroades </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>187 W. Va. 723, 727, 421 S.E.2d 264 (1992) (\u201c[t]he peer review privilege represents a legislative choice between medical staff candor and the plaintiffs access to evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Having established the contours of the privilege under \u00a7 19a-17b, we now determine whether the trial court properly interpreted the statute in applying it to the facts of this case. In the proceedings below, the trial court made no express finding as to whether the hospital\u2019s infection control committee met the statutory definition of a \u201cmedical review committee,\u201d nor whether the documents in question constituted part of the \u201cproceedings\u201d of such a committee. The court did recognize, however, that \u201c[t]he scope of the peer review exemption is defined not by the nature of the committee but by whether it is engaged in \u2018peer review,\u2019 since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>exemption from discovery quoted [in the statute] on its face relates only to \u2018the proceedings of a medical review committee conducting a peer review\u2019 not to all activities conducted by a medical review committee.\u201d In light of this requirement, the court denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order on the ground that \u201c[t]he titles of the documents listed [in the privilege log] do not suggest that their focus is the performance of any health care professional, nor have the defendants supplied any affidavits to the effect that peer review was the task to which the documents are addressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">We find, based on the trial court\u2019s focus on the nature of the documents in question, that it undertook to evaluate all requisite statutory factors. See <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>245 Conn. 508, 539, 752 A.2d 978 (1999) (trial court\u2019s opinion demonstrates proper interpretation of statute despite lack of express reference to statutory factors). The defendants had supported their assertion that the documents in question constituted part of the \u201cproceedings\u201d of a \u201cmedical review committee\u201d under \u00a7 19a-17b (d) with the uncontradicted affidavit of Baker that attested to the peer review function of the infection control committee, and to the fact that the documents in question were in some manner produced, generated or utilized by that committee. We assume that the trial court accepted the truth of those assertions. <em>See Barrett v. Danbury Hospital, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 262 (trial court permitted to accept truth of defendant hospital\u2019s uncontroverted evidence). That the trial court nevertheless denied the defendants\u2019 motion reflects its proper understanding that even if the documents did constitute part of the \u201cproceedings\u201d of a \u201cmedical review committee,\u201d the privilege would apply only if the documents related to \u201cpeer review.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Having concluded that the trial court adopted a proper interpretation of \u00a7 19a-17b, the ultimate issue in our review is whether, in applying the statute, the trial court reasonably could have concluded as it did. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Conn. 158, 175, 708 A.2d 949 (1998). \u201cOur review is guided by the well established principle that [t]he resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court . . . [and] [t]he trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 762, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s discovery ruling mindful that testimony adequate to establish an exemption from disclosure \u201cmust not be couched in conclusory language or generalized allegations, however, but should be sufficiently detailed, without compromising the asserted right to confidentiality . . . <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 341, 435 A.2d 353 (1980); see also <em>State ex rel. Shroades </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 187 W. Va. 727 (protective order issued upon \u201cthe assertion of a blanket privilege against discovery . . . constitutes abuse of discretion\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Friedman </em>v. <em>Provaznik, </em>668 S.W.2d 76, 80 (Mo. 1984). Confidentiality properly attaches to peer review documents only when the moving party has provided \u201csufficient, information to enable the court to determine that each element of the privilege is satisfied. ... A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>failure of proof as to any element of the privilege causes the claim of privilege to fail.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State ex rel. Dixon </em>v. <em>Darnold, </em>939 S.W.2d 66, 70 (Mo. App. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In the trial court proceedings, the defendants argued, in effect, that \u00a7 19a-17b bars discovery of all records, proceedings and documents utilized by a medical review committee having the responsibility of conducting peer review as one of their functions. The defendants argued further that the hospital\u2019s infection control committee is a \u201cmedical review committee\u201d as defined under the statute, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories and production requests seek documents generated by that committee. As we have stated, however, \u00a7 19a-17b applies only to the proceedings of a medical review committee that is actually \u201cengaged in peer review.\u201d Therefore, the defendants\u2019 assertion that the documents are privileged by virtue of having been created by the hospital\u2019s infection control committee implies that the sole function of that committee is to conduct peer review.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The infection control committee, however, performs other functions as well. For example, it discharges the hospital\u2019s institutional obligations pursuant to \u00a7 19-13-D3 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and the Hospital Accreditation Standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Accreditation Standards).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In that capacity, the infection control committee undertakes a number of tasks, some of which are unrelated to peer review. The defendants themselves contend that the committee is created pursuant to hospital bylaws to carry out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>mandates of \u00a7 19-13-D3. That regulation requires that all short term hospitals in the state of Connecticut assemble an \u201cinfection control committee\u201d for the purpose of administering an \u201cinfection prevention, surveillance and control program.\u201d See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D3 (Z) (1). In discharging this function, the committee must: (1) adopt working definitions of hospital associated infections; (2) develop standards for surveillance of infections and conditions predisposed to infection; and (3) develop a mechanism for monitoring, evaluating, reporting and controlling infections and environmental conditions with infection potential. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D3 (Z) (4). With respect to review and reporting, the committee shall, at a minimum: (1) review information obtained from the program\u2019s day-to-day surveillance activities; (2) review and revise existing standards; and (3) report to the medical executive committee. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D3 (Z) (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Similarly, the Accreditation Standards require hospitals to establish a program for \u201csurveillance, prevention, and control of infection,\u201d through the implementation of a \u201ccoordinated process\u201d that reduces the risk of infections in patients and health care workers. See Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Hospital Accreditation Standards (1998) \u00a7 IC, pp. 211, 212. That process is \u201ccomprehensive, encompassing both patient care and employee health services.\u201d Id., p. 214. Although the focus on patient care is likely to include peer review, \u201cinfection control . . . is integrated with the hospital\u2019s overall process for assessing and improving organization performance.\u201d Id. Significantly, infection control \u201ccovers a broad range of processes and activities . . . that are coordinated and carried out by the hospital. This function also links with external organization support systems to reduce the risk of infection from the environment, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>food and water sources.\u201d Id., p. 211. In this regard, the Accreditation Standards require that hospital management systems provide \u201csupport activities such as data analysis, interpretation, and presentation of findings\u201d; id., p. 214; and that an infection control committee report \u201cinformation about infections both internally and to public health agencies.\u201d Id., p. 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Both \u00a7 19-13-D3 of the regulations and the Accreditation Standards establish the hospital\u2019s obligation, as an institution, to assess, prevent and control infection within its premises through a system of integrated resource management. That institutional responsibility is independent of the hospital\u2019s duty to monitor the quality of services performed by its medical staff through an effective program of peer review. See <em>Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, supra, 174 Cal. App. 3d 725-26. Where a single committee is charged with carrying out both responsibilities, the proceedings of that committee are immune from disclosure under \u00a7 19a-17b only to the extent that its members are engaged in \u201cpeer review.\u201d See id., 726 (no privilege under California statute for proceedings \u201cindependent of the investigative and evaluative activities\u201d of the infection control committee when it is engaged in peer review); <em>Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>270 Ga. 376, 509 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1998) (committee qualifying as review organization under Georgia\u2019s peer review statute not protected when performing function other than peer review); <em>Claypool </em>v. <em>Mladineo, </em>supra, 724 So. 2d 387 (privilege pertains to proceedings of committee formed with \u201csole\u201d purpose of conducting peer review, but not to committee peripherally engaged in peer review). To hold otherwise would contravene the express language of the statute, and allow hospital administrators to insulate from discovery information relating to the adequacy of medical care provided at their facility simply by delegating their institutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>responsibilities in that regard to a committee that is simultaneously charged with conducting peer review.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Therefore, although the hospital\u2019s infection control committee, in assessing the quality of medical staff performance, engages in peer review, it also discharges the hospital\u2019s institutional responsibility regarding infection prevention, tracking, surveillance and control. In light of these multiple tasks, application of the privilege to the proceedings of the infection control committee depends on the nature of the documents in question and whether they relate to peer review. In turn, the nature of a particular document can be discerned only pursuant to an evaluation of the purpose for which the document was created and the use to which it was put. See <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>426 Mass. 514, 529, 689 N.E.2d 1304 (1998) (privilege requires testimony of \u201cway in which given record was produced or how it was used\u201d); <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Morehead Memorial Hospital, </em>318 N.C. 76, 86, 347 S.E.2d 824 (1986) (denying privilege where defendant failed to provide information regarding the \u201creason for [document\u2019s] creation\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Shroades </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 187 W. Va. 729 (party asserting privilege should identify source and reason for document\u2019s creation). In the absence of evidence to that effect, the trial court reasonably could not have concluded that the defendants had established that the documents in question relate to peer review.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">We note that throughout the lower court proceedings, the trial court afforded the defendants numerous opportunities and ample means by which to establish the privilege, including the submission of documents for in camera review. At the case management conference of February 24, 1999, and then again on March 19, 1999, the parties were ordered to take all steps necessary for resolution of then pending discovery disputes. The order of March 19, 1999, specifically advised the defendants to submit a privilege log \u201clisting any document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>claimed to be privileged,\u201d and \u201clist[ing] what the claimed source of the privilege or exemption [is].\u201d Thereafter, in response to the defendants\u2019 protests, the trial court extended the time for making submissions an additional thirty days. The court reiterated that the defendants were to comply with its previous order to file a privilege log, and specifically advised the defendants that where the nature of a document was not apparent by its title, \u201cthat document shall be supplied to the court but not to the plaintiff(s) at this stage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The defendants made no assertion that the scope of the trial court\u2019s inquiry was inadequate or prejudicial, nor did they accept the trial court\u2019s invitation to submit the allegedly privileged documents for inspection. The defendants relied instead on the following evidence in support of their motion for a protective order and their objection to discovery requests: (1) their submissions filed previously in response to the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests; (2) Baker\u2019s affidavit; and (3) the privilege log.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The defendants filed three memoranda pertinent to the trial court\u2019s discovery ruling, namely, the September 4, 1998 memorandum in support of their motion for a protective order, the March 12, 1999 memorandum in reply to the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to that motion, and the April 15, 1999 memorandum in support of their objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories and document requests.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Neither of the first two memoranda identified any specific documents as to which the defendants asserted a privilege, nor did either indicate that the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery request sought material related to peer review. As to the defendants\u2019 final memorandum, none of the assertions therein established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>the nature of the documents in question indicated their relation to peer review.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Turning to these memoranda in specific, in the September 4,1998 memorandum in support of their motion for protective order, the defendants asserted conclusorily that the requested documents \u201coriginated from the [i]nfection [c]ontrol [c]ommittee at [the hospital] and were composed for the purpose of infection control and quality control. The document requests are objected to insofar that they seek . . . privileged material protected by [\u00a7\u00a7] 19a-17b and 19a-25.\u201d Similarly, the defendants\u2019 March 12, 1999 memorandum replying to the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to their motion for protective order established only that the plaintiffs sought documents that \u201cpertain to policies and procedures enacted by the infection control committee and documents specifically created to research and investigate any rise in the level of MRSA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The defendants\u2019 April 15, 1999 memorandum in support of their objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories and request for identified items; see footnote 5 of this opinion; were more pointed. For example, in addition to asserting broadly that the documents in question were protected \u201cbecause they emanate from the [i]nfection [c]ontrol [c]ommittee,\u201d the defendants specifically objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 sixth request for production which sought any documents that \u201creflect, pertain to or relate to the manner in which decisions were made at [the hospital] regarding any MRSA infection which developed at the hospital in 1996-1997.\u201d According to the defendants\u2019 memorandum, such documents were protected by the peer review privilege because they reflected the infection control committee\u2019s decision-making process, which included \u201cthe preparation of charts, graphs and summaries by the [i]nfection [control [c]ommittee and for the [committee] in order to aid in decision making and any corrective measures.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The memorandum also raised the defendants\u2019 objection to the plaintiffs\u2019 ninth request for production, which sought \u201cdocuments prepared by the [i]nfection [c]ontrol [o]fficer at [the hospital].\u201d According to the defendants, such documents \u201cmay not be disclosed . . . without a violation of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The defendants\u2019 memoranda, although establishing that the documents in question emanated, in some manner, from the hospital\u2019s infection control committee, do not establish that the documents in question were generated principally for the purpose of \u201cpeer review.\u201d Specifically, the defendants made no claim that the documents reflect the infection control committee\u2019s deliberations with respect to an analysis of medical staff practices, a facility utilization review, a medical audit, a review of ambulatory care or a claims review. Nor did the defendants claim that the infection control committee engaged in such deliberations for the purpose of evaluating the performance of a health care professional. Absent a detailed assertion to that effect, the defendants\u2019 memoranda could not supply the trial court with a sufficient factual predicate from which it could discern the nature of the allegedly privileged items.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Turning to Baker\u2019s affidavit, the assertions therein, if taken as true, establish three relevant points: (1) that the infection control committee is a \u201cmedical review committee\u201d as that term is defined in the statute; (2) that one of the functions of the infection control committee is \u201cpeer review\u201d; and (3) that the documents at issue were in some manner procured by the infection control committee during a regularly scheduled meeting. Baker\u2019s affidavit does not attest to the nature of the information contained in the documents, nor to the fact that, as the trial court stated, \u201cpeer review was the task to which the documents are addressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Further, no entry contained in the defendants\u2019 privilege log reflects the documents\u2019 relation to \u201cpeer review.\u201d See footnote 10 of this opinion. The privilege log lists ninety-one documents for which the defendant sought a protective order \u00a7 19a-17b. In its entirety, each entry identifies a particular document by title and date of creation, and references the statutory privilege being claimed. Although the title of each document indicates that it was in some manner prepared, created, requested or received by the infection control committee, \u201cthe log provides no information to indicate for what purpose each document was prepared or how it was used.\u201d More specifically, as the trial court noted, the titles of the documents \u201cdo not suggest that their focus is the performance of any health care professional . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">On the basis of the evidence before it, the trial court properly denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order. As explained previously, a document is not immune from discovery simply by virtue of having been generated by a medical review committee charged, in part, with conducting peer review. The defendants produced no evidence to demonstrate that the documents were produced primarily for the purpose of peer review, and therefore warranted protection under \u00a7 19a-17b.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">We next review the defendants\u2019 claim that the documents are privileged under \u00a7 19a-25. That section provides in pertinent part: \u201cAll information, records of interviews, written reports, statements, notes, memoranda or other data . . . procured by . . . staff committees of facilities accredited by the Department of Public Health in connection with studies of morbidity and mortality conducted by . . . such staff committees, or carried on by ... such staff committees jointly with other persons, agencies or organizations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>... for the purpose of reducing the morbidity or mortality from any cause or condition, shall be confidential and shall be used solely for the purposes of medical or scientific research .... Such information, records, reports, statements, notes, memoranda or other data shall not be admissible as evidence in any action of any kind in any court . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-25. The scope of confidentiality and inadmissibility mandated by this statute does not extend to all records, as the concluding sentence makes clear: \u201cThis section shall not be deemed to affect disclosure of regular hospital and medical records made in the course of the regular notation of the care and treatment of any patient, but only records or notations by such staff committees pursuant to their work.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The defendants argue, in effect, that the statute protects from discovery information collected or generated by a medical review committee that procures information related to patient morbidity or mortality. They argue further that taken together, Baker\u2019s affidavit and the privilege log sufficed to establish that the documents sought were protected by \u00a7 19a-25, and that if more detailed information were required with respect to the activities of the infection control committee or the creation of the documents themselves, the court should have afforded the defendants an opportunity to present additional evidence to that effect. We disagree with both of the defendants\u2019 contentions. Based on our review of the record, we hold that the trial court properly determined that the evidence presented by the defendants did not establish that the statutory privilege applied to the documents in question, and further, that the trial court had afforded the defendants adequate opportunity to establish the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">We again use the principles of statutory construction in resolving this claim. As stated previously, we first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>review the language of the statute itself. See <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 102. By its terms, \u00a7 19a-25 does not address all documents procured by a hospital \u201cstaff committee,\u201d but only such documents procured \u201cin connection with studies of morbidity and mortality . . . .\u201d Moreover, confidentiality attaches to these documents only when the study itself is undertaken for the distinct \u201cpurpose of reducing morbidity or mortality . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-25. Thus, the language of the statute contemplates the protection of material related to a specific topic when it is collected for a distinct purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Moreover, even among the narrow class of otherwise privileged documents, the language of the statute provides that confidentiality does not attach to \u201chospital and medical records\u201d made in the course of patient \u201ccare and treatment . . . .\u201d Thus, the notations of a treating physician or nurse are not protected, even if those notations are utilized in a study of morbidity or mortality undertaken for the purpose of improving the quality of care. See <em>Buss </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>203 Ill. App. 3d 992, 996-97, 561 N.E.2d 356 (1990) (holding that patient\u2019s medical records fall into statutory exception for privileged documents despite that records may be used for research and studies).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 19a-25 underscores that the medical studies privilege protects research conducted for the purpose of reducing instances of morbidity and mortality, but not information collected in the course of routine patient care or for other purposes unrelated to reductions in morbidity and mortality. As first enacted in 1961, the medical studies privilege applied solely to the work of perinatal and maternal mortality study committees. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 1, 1961 Sess., p. 271. During the legislative committee hearings on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>original bill, one proponent reassured committee members that confidentiality would attach to \u201conly a scientific research study, and the cause of death of an unidentified patient treated by an unidentified doctor in an unidentified hospital.\u201d Id., p. 273, remarks of Roswell E. Johnson, chairman of the state medical society\u2019s committee on perinatal morbidity and mortality. Other commentators characterized the proposed immunity in terms of the committee\u2019s \u201cinvestigations\u201d into instances of mortality; id., p. 270, remarks of Joseph P. Cooney; as well as \u201cstudies\u201d and \u201cresearch\u201d into the causes of death of mothers and infants undertaken for the distinct puipose of \u201cpointing out from past experiences ways to improve medical care.\u201d Id., pp. 272-73, remarks of Roswell Johnson. Moreover, Johnson emphasized the relatively narrow focus of the pending legislation by remarking that \u201c[other] states . . . have adopted laws specifically for the purpose of protecting not only studies such as we\u2019re considering but also the participants in these studies both physicians and patients.\u201d Id., p. 274. By way of comparison, he stated that the bill under consideration would not protect \u201cthe records of the case, as they are in the hospital.\u201d Id., p. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Thereafter, in 1971, the legislature amended \u00a7 19a-25; see Public Acts 1971, No. 811; to make its provisions applicable to data procured by all \u201cstaff committees\u201d engaged in studies of morbidity and mortality. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 535. At the same time, the legislature nevertheless declined to extend the privilege beyond those committees \u201cset up to carry on review and study of cases [of morbidity and mortality] in [medical facilities].\u201d Id., remarks of Isadore Friedberg. In this respect, the privilege was designed \u201cto protect certain kinds of records, and yet to make available what always has traditionally been available to subpoena or other proper authority.\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1971 Sess., p. 4112, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>remarks of Representative Carl R. Ajello, Jr. Ajello continued, stating that \u201cit is our legislative intent to specifically continue to maintain the availability of proper records to subpoenas, in the case of court proceedings .... The notes of surgical performances and the operating room procedures ... all of which has formerly been available . . . will continue to be available, but there will be records done in the course of auditing these performances, and they may now be kept with some degree of safety.\u201d Id., p. 4113.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Section 19a-25 is premised on the belief that, without the statutory privilege, physicians would be reluctant to engage in \u201ca full and frank discussion\u201d of their colleagues that is integral to \u201cthe administration of good medical care.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 536, remarks of John Q. Tilson; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Health and Safety, Pt. 1, 1971 Sess., p. 103, remarks of Tilson (\u201cthe records of [research] committees should be kept confidential ... [so as not] to make doctors more reluctant than they are to discuss frankly these problems that arise in the treatment of hospital cases\u201d). As the Supreme Court of Illinois stated in addressing similar language from the Illinois Medical Studies Act:<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cThe purpose of the [Medical Studies] Act is to encourage candid and voluntary studies and programs used to improve hospital conditions and patient care or to reduce the rates of death and disease.\u201d <em>Niven </em>v. <em>Siqueira, </em>109 Ill. 2d 357, 366, 487 N.E.2d 937 (1995); see <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Wu, </em>102 Ill. 2d 468, 480, 468 N.E.2d 1162 (1984) (purpose of legislation \u201cis to ensure the effectiveness of professional self-evaluation, by members of the medical profession, in the interest of improving the quality of health care\u201d). Section 19a-25 is, however, in no way intended to provide immunity for all material, without regard to its purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>or effect, produced or utilized by a hospital staff committee. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Illinois Masonic Medical Center, </em>297 Ill. App. 3d 240, 696 N.E.2d 707, 711 (application of medical studies privilege does not preclude \u201cfull and complete access to [patient\u2019s] own records,\u201d nor entitle plaintiffs\u2019 to \u201cdepose all persons involved in their treatment and engage experts to give opinions as to the quality of care received\u201d), appeal denied, 179 Ill. 2d 580, 705 N.E.2d. 436 (1998). In light of the statute\u2019s language and legislative history, we conclude that the privilege afforded by \u00a7 19a-25 is limited to the designated materials of a hospital staff committee that are generated primarily for the purpose of the study of morbidity and mortality, undertaken specifically for the purpose of reducing the incidence of patient deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Having delineated the scope of \u00a7 19a-25, we now determine whether the trial court properly applied the statute to the defendants\u2019 claim. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court interpreted the language of the statute as requiring a three part showing to invoke the privilege. Pursuant to that understanding, the trial court evaluated the defendants\u2019 evidence to determine whether, in accordance with the statute, the documents were \u201cprocured by a staff committee ... in connection with studies of morbidity and mortality . . . for the purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In this regard, the trial court was satisfied that the description of the items \u201cindicate that they were procured, either in the sense of collection or generation, by the defendants\u2019 infection control committee.\u201d The trial court nevertheless denied the defendants\u2019 motion on the ground that the description did not \u201cindicate that [the documents] were collected or generated in connection with studies of morbidity or mortality ... or that they were procured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The trial court\u2019s analysis demonstrates its proper understanding that the privilege afforded by \u00a7 19a-25 is not unlimited in scope, but, rather, applies only to documents of a particular nature procured for a specified purpose. We must determine, therefore, whether the trial court reasonably concluded that the defendants had not satisfactorily established that the documents at issue were generated principally for a morbidity or mortality study undertaken for the purpose of reducing incidents of patient death. The trial court\u2019s conclusions in this regard are factual findings that will not be upset unless they are \u201cclearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">In asserting an immunity from discovery under \u00a7 19a-25, the defendants relied on the same memoranda, privilege log and affidavit discussed in section II C of this opinion. We evaluate this evidence, mindful that, like the peer review privilege, the medical studies privilege cannot be invoked without competent testimony to establish the requisite nature of the documents sought to be withheld. See, e.g., <em>Ekstrom </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>197 Ill. App. 3d 120, 126-27, 553 N.E.2d 424 (1990) (trial court properly ordered disclosure where hospital supplied no evidence setting forth documents\u2019 relation to medical study activities).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Turning to the defendants\u2019 memoranda of September 4,1998, and March 12,1999, neither identify any specific documents as to which the privilege applies, nor do they indicate that the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests sought material related to a study of morbidity or mortality. Rather, the defendants\u2019 September 4, 1998 memorandum asserted solely that the documents requested by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>the plaintiffs were nondiscoverable because they \u201coriginated from the infection control committee at [the hospital] and were composed for the purpose of infection control and quality control.\u201d The defendants\u2019 memorandum of March 12, 1999, although providing a more detailed objection to the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery request, asserted only that the plaintiffs were requesting documents that reflected data \u201cused by the committee for very specific purposes; the improvement of the quality of care of patients and the reduction of morbidity and mortality,\u201d and that \u201cinfection control studies which specifically include studies performed in response to any rise in MRSA are studies conducted for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In addition to failing to identify any particular\" document that reflected such a study, the defendants offered no factual support for their assertion that the reduction of morbidity or mortality was in fact the purpose of any study undertaken in response to a rise in the MRSA infection. It is insufficient for the party invoking the privilege to do so solely by way of factual assertions made by an attorney in a memorandum of law to the court. The assertion must be made by way of evidence, that is, by an affidavit of a person qualified to make the assertion or, in the event that an evidentiary hearing is held, by way of witness testimony. In addition, as noted previously, the hospital\u2019s infection control committee performs a number of infection control related tasks. A study involving infection control, therefore, is not necessarily primarily undertaken for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality. To say simply that a document is immune from discovery because it serves both a protected and unprotected function would undermine the purpose of the statute, which is generally to encourage the reduction of morbidity and mortality. This objective can be accomplished only by confining the statutory privilege to material generated principally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>for that purpose. In this case, Baker\u2019s affidavit is simply too general and too sweeping to establish the necessary showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">As to the defendants\u2019 April 15, 1999 memorandum, the assertions therein provide no factual basis whatsoever for concluding that the documents requested by the plaintiffs pertain to a \u201cstudy of morbidity or mortality.\u201d The sole reference in that memorandum to the medical studies statute is the blanket assertion that the plaintiffs \u201cseek information which is privileged and protected by [\u00a7\u00a7 19a-17b and 19a-25] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Regarding the defendants\u2019 remaining evidence, then-privilege log enumerated ninety-one documents to which the defendants asserted confidentiality under \u00a7 19a-25. See footnote 9 of this opinion. As previously described, however, the log itself characterized each document in terms of its title, date of creation and procuring source, that is, the infection control committee. The log is devoid of any indication that the documents relate to a \u201cstudy of morbidity or mortality\u201d undertaken for the specific purpose of reducing instances of patient deaths. In fact, given the vagueness of the entries included therein, it cannot be discerned from the privilege log that the hospital has recorded even a single incident of patient death.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">With respect to Baker\u2019s affidavit, the averments therein establish generally that the documents in question \u201care an integral part\u201d of the infection control committee. The affidavit, however, includes no assertion regarding the nature or purpose for which the relevant documents were procured. Therefore, to accept the affidavit as sufficient to invoke the privilege would imply that the sole function of the committee is to conduct studies related to morbidity or mortality. Baker himself, however, attests to the many reasons for which the committee collects data, including \u201cto gather and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>review information relating to the care and treatment of patients for the purpose of evaluating and improving the quality of health care,\u201d and \u201cestablishing and enforcing guidelines designed to keep within reasonable bounds the cost of health care.\u201d Nothing in Baker\u2019s affidavit indicates, as the trial court concluded, that the infection control committee was not collecting such data \u201cfor purposes of comparison with other institutions, to track seasonal variations, or for other puiposes other than reducing morbidity or mortality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On the basis of our review of the defendants\u2019 memoranda, their privilege log and Baker\u2019s affidavit, we conclude that the trial court was within its discretion in determining that the defendants had failed to demonstrate the elements necessary to invoke the medical studies privilege. Consistent with our analysis above, a document is not immune from discovery by virtue of having been procured by a committee that engages in research related to morbidity or mortality. Rather, the documents themselves must have been generated primarily for such a study, and that study must have been undertaken for the particular purpose of reducing instances of morbidity or mortality.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Finally, for the reasons articulated in section I C of this opinion, we are unpersuaded that the trial court failed to provide the defendants with an adequate opportunity in which to establish under \u00a7 19a-25 the confidentiality of the documents in question. Nothing in the record indicates that the defendants objected to the scope of the trial court\u2019s inquiry. In particular, contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertion at oral argument, there is nothing to indicate that the defendants requested a hearing on the discovery issue. In this regard, we find it difficult to accept an indictment against the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s inquiry given that the defendants declined to accept the trial court\u2019s invitation to submit the allegedly privileged documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>for in camera inspection. Rather than submitting the documents for in camera review or offering competent testimony as to how the medical studies privilege applied, the defendants relied on generalized assertions that the documents in question were procured by an infection control committee that, in some capacity, seeks to reduce instances of morbidity and mortality. As the trial court noted, the defendants had from September, 1998, through April 15, 1999, to provide the court with a factual basis for their claims of privilege. The defendants should not now be permitted to compensate for the inadequacies of their own evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the disclosure of privileged documents without specifically articulating the burden of proof the defendants were expected to meet and without allowing them a reasonable opportunity to meet that burden by either requesting additional affidavits or holding an evidentiary hearing. In this respect, the defendants urge that the trial court should have adopted the procedure set forth by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 426 Mass. 529-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The central issue in <em>Carr </em>was whether the confidentiality provisions of the Massachusetts peer review statute<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> precluded in camera review of certain documents to determine whether the privilege applied. According to the court, in camera inspection was not warranted under the circumstances because the defendant hospital, the party claiming the privilege, had produced sufficient evidence in the form of testimony and affidavits to show that the incident reports in question were protected under the statute. In reaching its decision, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>court in <em>Carr </em>set forth a two step approach for determining privilege claims pursuant to the relevant peer review statute. First, the trial court must examine the face of a discovery request in order to determine whether the records sought are within the scope of the statutory privilege. Id., 529. If such is the case, discovery is denied and further review is unwarranted. Second, if the discovery request is ambiguous, the burden shifts to the party asserting the privilege to offer \u201cevidence of the way in which a given record was produced or how it was used.\u201d Id. Upon presentation of such evidence, the court should deny the request without resort to an in camera inspection, \u201cparticularly if the party seeking the allegedly privileged materials offers no reason to doubt a hospital\u2019s sworn statements.\u201d Id. Pursuant to this protocol, the Massachusetts court upheld the hospital\u2019s privilege claim, not because the plaintiffs requests sought privileged documents on their face, but, rather, because \u201c[the hospital] had produced sufficient evidence to show that the . . . incident reports in question [met] the [peer review] requirements . . . .\u201d Id., 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The defendants in the present case argue that had the trial court applied the <em>Carr </em>procedure, it would have granted their motion on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests, on their face, seek protected material. In the alternative, the defendants claim that the evidence they produced in support of their motion adequately justified application of the claimed privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Heretofore, we have not articulated the burden of proof scheme applicable to claims of privilege asserted under \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17b and 19a-25. Nonetheless, with respect to privilege claims generally, we have held that where the confidential status of otherwise discoverable information is apparent, a claim of privilege may be disposed of without further inquiry. See <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>State, </em>230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Conn. 698, 714, 647 A.2d 324 (1994) (denying attorney-client privilege where state\u2019s offer of proof, \u201con its face,\u201d demonstrated that elicited testimony would not reveal client confidences). Where the nature of a document is not patently discernible from the face of the discovery request, however, the burden of estabhshing immunity from discovery rests with the party asserting the privilege. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 341. That burden is discharged by the presentation of evidence in the form of testimony or affidavits concerning the document\u2019s content and use. See id., 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">A number of jurisdictions have applied a similar burden of proof scheme to privilege claims asserted under a peer review or medical studies statute. These jurisdictions hold generally that once a party has made a prima facie request for relevant documents, the burden is on the party opposed to discovery to establish the existence of any applicable privilege. See, e.g., <em>Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 174 Cal. App. 3d 727 (\u201cthe party claiming immunity from discovery carries the burden of showing that the evidence it seeks to suppress is within the terms of the statute it relies upon\u201d); <em>Roache </em>v. <em>Springfield Clinic, </em>157 Ill. 2d 29, 44-45, 623 N.E.2d 246 (1993) (placing burden of estabhshing applicability of peer review privilege on party seeking to invoke privilege); <em>Claypool </em>v. <em>Mladineo, </em>supra, 724 So. 2d 387 (\u201c[t]he party or parties wishing to apply the privilege must prove that the particular committee in question comes within the purview of [the peer review statute]\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Dixon </em>v. <em>Darnold, </em>supra, 939 S.W.2d 70 (\u201c[w]here a [peer review] privilege is asserted and then challenged, the burden rests upon the party claiming the privilege to establish that the material is, in fact, not discoverable\u201d); <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Herzke, </em>924 S.W.2d 652, 658 (Tenn. 1996) (party seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>protective order bears burden of justifying confidentiality of each and every document sought to be protected); <em>In re Methodist Hospital, </em>982 S.W.2d 112, 114 (Tex. App. 1998) (\u201c[t]he party claiming [peer review] privilege bears the burden of producing evidence to support its contention that the documents in question qualify for the privilege\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Shroades </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 187 W. Va. 728 (\u201cparty asserting the [peer review] privilege has the burden of demonstrating that the privilege applies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">In light of our own privilege jurisprudence and the well reasoned authority from other jurisdictions, we are persuaded that where the status of a document cannot be discerned from the face of a discovery request, under \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17b and 19a-25, the party opposed to discovery has the burden of both asserting and establishing the applicable privilege. We read <em>Carr </em>as invoking a burden shifting scheme similar in approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The record indicates that the trial court, consistent with our own jurisprudence as well as with the Massachusetts court\u2019s decision in <em>Carr, </em>properly imposed upon the defendants the burden of establishing the documents\u2019 privileged status. Nothing in the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests seek information so clearly within the exclusive domain of peer review or a medical study of morbidity or mortality that the defendants\u2019 motion properly could have been granted without further judicial inquiry. See contra <em>Mt. Diablo Hospital </em>v. <em>Stella, </em>183 Cal. App. 3d 30, 35, 227 Cal. Rptr. 790 (1986) (party\u2019s request for production of \u201cminutes\u201d properly denied without further review per statute that makes confidential \u201cproceedings\u201d of qualifying committee); <em>Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 174 Cal. App. 3d 727 (discovery request for \u201cself-generated analysis of the adequacy of work performed by hospital staff members\u201d denied without further examination). The documents requested by the plaintiffs range in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>nature from those that pertain to the rates of nosocomial infection, to those that constitute incident reports prepared in light of such an infection, to those that reflect hospital procedures or recommendations taken with respect to high risk patients. As we stated in part I C of this opinion, such information is relevant to a myriad of hospital functions and might very well be procured by various members of the hospital\u2019s medical or administrative staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In the lower court proceedings, the trial court did not expressly state that the broad content of the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests essentially shifted the burden to the defendants to assert and then establish any applicable privilege. That the court nevertheless declined to interfere with the discovery process until the defendants had had the opportunity to respond reflects its proper understanding to that effect. The defendants\u2019 response, however, came in the form of a motion for a protective order and objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories in which the defendants asserted conclusorily that the documents were privileged pursuant to the peer review and medical studies statutes. Neither the defendants\u2019 motion nor their objections to interrogatories conveyed the nature or purpose of the documents in question. Nor did Baker\u2019s affidavit establish the critical elements necessary to invoke either the peer review or medical studies privilege. See parts I C and II C of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Although the defendants had failed in their initial attempt to establish any applicable privilege, the trial court provided them with an opportunity to submit additional information. The trial court twice ordered the defendants to submit a detailed privilege log listing the claimed source of privilege. In addition, it provided the defendants with the option of submitting questionable documents for in camera review. The trial court thereafter issued its ruling based on the evidence that the defendants had submitted.

Our review of the record does not support that assertion.

Additionally, James P.
