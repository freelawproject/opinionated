The FDIC claims that the scope of de novo review afforded by \u00a7 12-237 provided the court with subject matter jurisdiction over the counts of the complaints in question. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the failure of the banks to have filed amended returns and claims for refunds pursuant to \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1) did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the FDIC\u2019s claims. We therefore reverse the judgments of dismissal of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The legal background, facts and procedural history are undisputed. Since 1979, corporate taxpayers such as the banks, in general, have been required to include as gross income, for purposes of the state\u2019s corporation business tax; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-213 through 12-242i; interest income received from federal, state and local bonds, as well as from other securities and obligations. Moreover, under the corporation business tax, although a deduction is permitted for interest expenses incurred in holding bonds the income from which is taxable under the federal income tax, no such deduction is permitted for such expenses incurred in holding bonds the income from which is exempt from tax under the federal income tax. In 1996, this court, in <em>D.A. Pincus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>235 Conn. 865, 880, 670 A.2d 1278 (1996), concluded that such diverse treatment did not violate the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Furthermore, in contrast to the general taxability under the state corporation business tax of the income from federal, state and local bonds, from 1979 until 1995, the state, pursuant to various specific statutes, exempted from gross income under the state corporation business tax the interest income earned from certain Connecticut state and local bonds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>It is also undisputed that, until 1991, CBT was a federally chartered national bank qualified to do business in this state and subject to the state corporation business tax. CBT owned federal and municipal bonds during the tax years of 1983 through 1987. In its tax returns for the tax years 1983 through 1985, the first audit period, CBT included in gross income the interest earned from the federal and municipal bonds that it held, and deducted its interest expenses incurred in buying and holding such bonds. After auditing CBT\u2019s 1983, 1984 and 1985 tax returns, the commissioner, in August, 1988, sent CBT audit workpapers showing a proposed tax recalculation of $2,112,532, plus interest. Following an informal conference with the commissioner, CBT received from the commissioner revised first audit workpapers adjusting the proposed tax recalculation to $2,175,329, plus interest. The audit results were based on the commissioner\u2019s disallowance of the deduction taken by CBT for interest expenses related to the federally tax exempt municipal bonds. CBT made a partial payment of $3,000,000 on the tax recalculation for the first audit period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> CBT also made a claim for a refund of that payment, and preserved its rights to protest further and to appeal any and all audit adjustments. Thereafter, in September, 1991, the commissioner sent the FDIC, which by then had become the receiver of CBT, a determination letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Meanwhile, the commissioner also audited CBT\u2019s 1986 and 1987 tax returns, the second audit period, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>issued a proposed tax recalculation indicating that CBT owed additional taxes for the second audit period, also based on disallowance of the interest expense deduction taken by CBT in connection with holding the federally tax exempt municipal bonds. In November, 1988, CBT made a partial payment of $1,800,000 on the second audit period tax recalculation. This payment also was made under protest with a claim for a refund of the payment, together with a preservation of CBT\u2019s right to protest and to appeal any tax adjustment. In June, 1990, the commissioner issued a billing notice for the second audit period to CBT for the assessment of $1,594,231, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 12-236, CBT requested a hearing and a correction of the two deficiency tax assessments. Thereafter, in September, 1991, the commissioner sent the FDIC, as receiver for CBT, a determination letter notifying it that the request for a correction was denied, and that the commissioner had determined that CBT owed an additional $386,817 for the second auditperiod. In October, 1991, pursuant to \u00a7 12-237, the FDIC filed its appeal in the present case to the trial court from the two deficiency assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Until 1993, New England was a state chartered, federally insured bank that was subject to the state corporation business tax. New England owned federal and municipal obligations during 1986. In its 1986 corporation business tax return, New England included in income the interest earned from the federal and municipal bonds that it held, and deducted its interest expenses incurred in buying and holding such bonds. In May, 1988, after auditing New England\u2019s tax returns for the tax year 1986, the commissioner issued to New England a notice of assessment of an additional tax for 1986, in the amount of $17,654, plus interest, on the ground that New England improperly had deducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>interest expenses incurred in holding the federally tax exempt municipal bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 12-236, New England applied for a hearing and a correction of the tax assessed. New England also made a protest payment of $21,773.28. Thereafter, the commissioner notified New England that its request for a correction was denied. In April, 1990, pursuant to \u00a7 12-237, New England filed its appeal in the present case to the trial court from the deficiency assessment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The commissioner\u2019s deficiency assessments against both CBT and New England were based on the disallowance of certain deductions taken by the banks for expenses related to municipal bond income. That type of income is exempt from federal taxation, but is taxable under our state corporate business tax. At the administrative level, the banks had claimed that the state\u2019s different tax treatment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of federally tax exempt bonds, such as municipal bonds, versus federally taxable bonds, such as corporate bonds, discriminated against holders of the former as against holders of the latter in violation of the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. We refer herein to this claim as the FDIC\u2019s equal protection theory. Thus, the tax dispute arising out of the question of the validity of the banks\u2019 equal protection theory was whether the banks had overstated their deductions against an aspect of their gross income, namely, municipal bond income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>thereby understating their net income for purposes of the corporation business tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The FDIC's appeals in both cases were stayed pending the outcome of <em>D.A. Pincus &amp; Co. </em>v. Meehan, supra, 235 Conn. 865. On January 30, 1996, this court released its decision in <em>D.A. Pincus &amp; Co., </em>rejecting the equal protection theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Thereafter, the FDIC, with the permission of the trial court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>amended its complaints in both the CBT and New England cases to add a new theory challenging the deficiency assessments. Under this new theory, the FDIC claimed that the fact that the state taxes interest income on federal bonds while exempting from taxation interest income from certain state and municipal bonds; see footnote 7 of this opinion and accompanying text; violated the borrowing clause<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the supremacy clause<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the United States constitution, and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity as codified by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124. We refer herein to this claim as the FDIC\u2019s intergovernmental tax immunity theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Under the intergovernmental tax immunity theory, the FDIC claims that, with respect to the federal bond interest income, the banks paid an invalid tax. Thus, under this theory, the question would be whether the banks had overstated their gross income by the total amount of the interest income on their federal bonds. In other words, in the amended complaints, the FDIC claimed that the <em>understatement, </em>if any, of their municipal bond income, resulting from the unjustified deductions for the interest expenses related thereto, was offset by the alleged <em>overstatement </em>of their federal bond income. The amounts of the alleged overpayments of the tax by the banks are far greater than the deficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>assessments against both banks.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In its amended complaints, however, the FDIC did not seek a full refund of those alleged overpayments. Instead, the FDIC sought only a refund of the amount of the deficiency assessments that the banks had paid under protest. After a joint trial, the trial court, <em>McWeeny, J., </em>dismissed the counts related to the intergovernmental tax immunity theory. The court reasoned that the failure of the banks to have filed an amended return and claim for a refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1); see footnote 6 of this opinion; based on the intergovernmental theory, deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction over those counts. This joint appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The parties do not dispute that \u201ca tax appeal pursuant to \u00a7 12-237 affords a taxpayer a trial de novo.\u201d <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 421, 521 A.2d 569 (1987). The dispute between the parties relates to the scope and meaning of de novo review of the FDIC\u2019s challenge under \u00a7 12-237 to the commissioner\u2019s deficiency assessments. The FDIC claims that, by virtue of the de novo standard of review applied under \u00a7 12-237, the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the counts that were based on the intergovernmental theory. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">There is no question, and the FDIC does not contend otherwise, that if it were seeking, based on the intergovernmental theory, a refund of the amounts of corporation business taxes that the banks allegedly had overpaid for the years in question, their failure to follow the procedures set forth in \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1) would deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction over such a claim. Section 12-225 (b) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny company which fails to include in its return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>items of deduction or includes items of nontaxable income or makes any other error in such return may, within three years from the due date of the return, file with the commissioner an amended return, together with a claim for refund of taxes overpaid as shown by such amended return. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this section constitutes a waiver of any demand against the state on account of overpayment. ...\u201d Section 12-225 \u201cestablishes an administrative request for a refund as the prescribed avenue of relief that the [FDIC was] required to follow in order to take advantage of the state\u2019s limited waiver of its sovereign immunity. We have frequently held that where a statute has established a procedure to redress a particular wrong a person must follow the specified remedy and may not institute a proceeding that might have been permissible in the absence of such a statutory procedure. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>200 Conn. 697, 708, 513 A.2d 77 (1986). When an adequate administrative remedy exists at law, a litigant must exhaust it before the Superior Court will obtain jurisdiction over an independent action on the matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Assn. of America </em>v. <em>State, </em>209 Conn. 679, 686-87, 553 A.2d 1104 (1989). Thus, intertwined principles of sovereign immunity and exhaustion of administrative remedies would require that any claim for a refund of taxes allegedly overpaid, based on the intergovernmental theory, be preceded by a timely amended return and claim for such a refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-225. Id., 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In the present case, however, the FDIC does not claim such a refund. Instead, it seeks to regain the amounts paid under protest in response to the commissioner\u2019s deficiency assessments. The more narrow question posed by this case, therefore, is whether the FDIC may utilize the same legal theory that would have underlain such a claim for a refund, not for the purpose of seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>a refund of the taxes that the banks paid, but in order to offset additional taxes in the form of deficiency assessments imposed by the commissioner. We conclude that the FDIC may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">First, our precedents on the scope of de novo review of tax determinations counsel that the court has jurisdiction over the FDIC\u2019s claims based on the intergovernmental theory. In <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 421, we held that the de novo scope of review of a tax appeal from an administrative tax proceeding included a legal claim that \u201cdid not entirely track the discretionary nature of the petitions that [the plaintiff] had filed at the administrative level . . . .\u201d Moreover, we referred to this inconsistency between the claim made at trial pursuant to \u00a7 12-237 and the claim made at the administrative level as a \u201cprocedural impropriety\u201d; id., 421-22; rather than a defect of subject matter jurisdictional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In <em>Konover </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>242 Conn. 727, 734-35, 699 A.2d 158 (1997), we addressed the scope and meaning of de novo review in a municipal property tax appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The property owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>had appealed from the assessment of the municipal board of tax review to the trial court claiming that he had been overassessed. Id., 729-30. At trial, the town introduced evidence indicating that a portion of the properly owner\u2019s land inadvertently had been omitted in the original assessment and, therefore, the board of tax review was not aware of the actual area of the land. Id., 731-33. This evidence would have suggested an original underassessment by the town that would have offset the overassessment claimed by the property owner. The trial court, however, in determining the fair market value of the property, declined to consider this evidence because it had not been presented to the board of tax review. Id., 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>We reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, however, concluding that \u201c[t]he scope of atrial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in such an appeal must encompass the power to consider any facts that are relevant to determining whether a taxpayer actually has been over-assessed.\u201d Id., 741. We first discussed the well established principles of subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cJurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. ... A court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has the authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal controversy. ... It is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 740-41. We also explained that \u201c[i]n a de novo proceeding, the trier of fact makes an independent determination of the matters on which the appeal was taken without regard for the action or decision of the lower tribunal.\u201d Id., 741. This conclusion was not altered by the fact that the particular evidence of underassessment had not been presented to the board of tax review. Id., 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Thus, the reasoning of <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>and <em>Konover </em>rested on two related factors, namely, that in de novo tax appeals under \u00a7 12-117a and \u00a7 12-237: (1) the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction includes the power to consider all factors relevant to the determination of the tax liability in question; and (2) that consideration is independent of the action or decision at the administrative tribunal. We conclude that this reasoning governs the present case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">In this case, the judicial determination of the FDIC\u2019s tax liability involved the question of whether it owed additional amounts of the corporation business tax for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>the years in question, over and above what already had been paid regarding that tax. The trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 12-237 included the power to consider all factors relevant to the determination of that additional tax liability. Although the legal basis of the FDIC\u2019s claims for refunds of the deficiency assessments differed from the bases of the assessments and from what it claimed at the administrative level, the ultimate question presented to the trial court was, nevertheless, whether the FDIC owed an additional amount of its corporation business tax. In addition, the court was required to arrive at that judicial determination independently of the action or decision of the administrative tribunal from which the tax appeal was taken. De novo review in this context means, therefore, that the trial court was not confined to the particular legal theory underlying the resistance to the deficiency assessments that was asserted administratively.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Second, the trial court was \u201c[v]ested with full power, under \u00a7 12-237, to \u2018grant such relief as may be equitable\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 422. Section 12-225 (b) (1) provides that if a company \u201cincludes items of nontaxable income or makes any other error in [its] return [it is required], within three years from the due date of the return, [to] file with the commissioner an amended return, together with a claim for refund of taxes overpaid as shown by such amended return . . . [and that the] [\u00b6] allure to [do so] constitutes a waiver of any demand against the state on account of overpayment. ...\u201d Thus, \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1) provides the requisite administrative procedure for \u201ca claim for refund of taxes overpaid . ...\u201d In the present case, however, the FDIC does not seek such refunds. It seeks only the additional corporate business taxes involved in the deficiency assessments. Therefore, although the banks, by not timely following the provisions of \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1), forfeited their right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>seek refunds, based on the intergovernmental theory, of the allegedly unjustified taxes that they voluntarily had paid, it is consistent with principles of equity to permit them to avail themselves of that theory, if valid, to regain the <em>additional </em>taxes imposed by the deficiency assessments that they had paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Finally, we see no difference between the language of the tax appeal statute involved in <em>Konover </em>and \u00a7 12-237. Section 12-117a empowers the trial court to hear and determine appeals taken by taxpayers \u201caggrieved by the action of the board of tax review . . . [and] to grant such relief as to justice and equity appertains . . . .\u201d In similar- fashion, \u00a7 12-237 empowers the trial court to hear and determine appeals taken by taxpayers \u201caggrieved because of any order, decision, determination or disallowance of the Commissioner . . . [and to] grant such relief as may be equitable . . . .\u201d Although the language of the two statutes is not identical, we perceive no textual reason why the scope and meaning of the de novo tax appeal under \u00a7 12-117a explicated in <em>Konover </em>should not apply equally to a de novo tax appeal under \u00a7 12-237.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The commissioner argues that the intergovernmental tax immunity theory properly could have been raised only by filing an amended tax return pursuant to \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1). According to the commissioner, the trial court had no subject matter jurisdiction because the absence of amended returns represents a failure to exhaust those administrative remedies upon which the waiver of sovereign immunity is predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">For this proposition, the commissioner relies on our decision in <em>Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Assn. of America </em>v. State, supra, 209 Conn. 680, in which the plaintiffs sought to recover taxes paid for fuel identification decals by an independent plenary action without first pursuing statutorily provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>administrative remedies. We concluded in that case that recourse to the available administrative remedies was a prerequisite to the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity and, therefore, to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction, and we affirmed the dismissal by the trial court. Id., 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The commissioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Assn. of America, </em>is misplaced for two reasons. First, in the present case, the FDIC\u2019s failure to file amended returns did not represent a failure to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1) because, as we have explained, the FDIC did not seek tax refunds. Contrary to the commissioner\u2019s suggestion, the difference between seeking a refund of taxes voluntarily paid and seeking to regain amounts paid under protest pursuant to a deficiency assessment over and above that payment, is not a \u201clinguistic sleight of hand.\u201d Although they both may rest on the same legal theory, the relief sought under each would be different. The administrative procedure provided for by \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1) applies only to the former, and not the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Second, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Assn. of America, </em>the banks in the present case <em>did </em>pursue the available administrative remedies for challenging a deficiency assessment, and the appeals were filed in the trial court pursuant to statute.

Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 144-45, 527 A.2d 679 (1987); presupposes an underlying administrative determination of fact.\u201d Therefore, the commissioner asserts, consideration of the intergovernmental theory \u201cwould not have been a de novo review; it would have constituted an initial determination of a tax assessment, the authority for which has been vested by the legislature in the commissioner, not the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">It is true that, in <em>Altray Co. v. Groppo, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 440, in which we reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment rejecting the taxpayer\u2019s claim for a refund, we noted in framing the remand that the record did not reflect the required administrative factual determination of the amount of the refund claimed, and that, therefore, a \u201cremand to the commissioner is the appropriate course in the absence of such an administrative determination.\u201d The tax appeal under \u00a7 12-237 in <em>Altray Co., </em>however, was from the commissioner\u2019s disallowance of the taxpayer\u2019s amended return and claim for refund, pursuant to \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1), and in such an administrative proceeding the statute specifically provides that in his disallowance the commissioner shall set forth his \u201cfindings of fact and the basis of disallowance . . . .\u201d We already have discussed why, in our view, this proceeding is not governed by \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The judgments dismissing the counts in each complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>reversed and the cases are remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-237 provides: \u201cAny taxpayer aggrieved because of any order, decision, determination or disallowance of the Commissioner of Revenue Services under the provisions of this part may, within one month after service upon the taxpayer of notice of such order, decision, determination or disallowance, take an appeal therefrom to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford, which shall be accompanied by a citation to the Commissioner of Revenue Services to appear before said court. Such citation shall be signed by the same authority, and such appeal shall be returnable at the same time and served and returned in the same manner, as is required in case of a summons in a civil action. The authority issuing the citation shall take from the appellant a bond or recognizance to the state of Connecticut, with surety to prosecute Hie appeal to effect and to comply with the orders and decrees of the court in the premises.

As receiver, the FDIC succeeded to all assets and liabilities of that bank by operation of law, including the claim for the return of protested tax payments that has become the subject of the present case.

When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to negligence or intentional disregard of the provisions of this part or regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to ten per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment, or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. When it appeal\u2019s that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions of this part or regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to twenty-five per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment. No taxpayer shall be subject to more than one penalty under this section in relation to the same tax period. Any decision rendered by any federal court holding that a taxpayer has filed a fraudulent return with the Director of Internal Revenue shall subject the taxpayer to the penalty imposed by this section without the necessity of further proof thereof, except when it can be shown that the return to the state so differed from the return to the federal government as to afford a reasonable presumption that the attempt to defraud did not extend to the return to the state. Within thirty days of the mailing of such notice, the taxpayer shall pay to the commissioner, in cash or by check, draft or money order drawn to the order of the Commissioner of Revenue Services, any additional amount of tax shown to be due by the corrected return or shall be paid by the State Treasurer, upon order of the Comptroller, any amount shown to be due it by such corrected return. The failure of the taxpayer to receive any timely mailed notice required by this section shall not relieve him of the obligation to pay the tax assessed under the terms of this part or any interest or penalties thereon. When, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the examination of the return or the assessment of the tax, both the commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to such examination or assessment after such time, the return may be examined and the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.

The commissioner shall promptly consider each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>such application and may grant or deny the hearing requested. If the hearing is denied, the applicant shall be notified thereof forthwith. If it is granted, the commissioner shall notify the applicant of the time and place fixed for such hearing. After such hearing the commissioner may make such order in the premises as appears to him just and lawful and shall furnish a copy of such order to the applicant. The commissioner may, by notice in writing, at any time within three years after the date when any return of any taxpayer has been due, order a hearing on his own initiative and require the taxpayer or any other individual whom he believes to be in possession of relevant information concerning the taxpayer to appear before him or his authorized agent with any specified books of account, papers or other documents, for examination under oath.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-225 (b) (1) provides: \u201cAny company which fails to include in its return items of deductions or includes items of nontaxable income or makes any other error in such return may, within three years from the due date of the return, file with the commissioner an amended return, together with a claim for refund of taxes overpaid as shown by such amended return. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this section constitutes a waiver of any demand against the state on account of overpayment. The commissioner shall, within one hundred eighty days of the receipt of such claim, determine whether such claim is valid and, if so, the commissioner shall notify the State Comptroller of the amount of such refund and the State Comptroller shall draw an order on the State Treasurer in the amount thereof for payment to such company. If the commissioner determines that such claim is not valid, either in whole or in part, he shall mail notice of the proposed disallowance in whole or in part of the claim to the company which notice shall set forth briefly the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact and the basis of disallowance in each case decided in whole or in part adversely to the claimant. Sixty days after the date on which it is mailed, a notice of proposed disallowance shall constitute a final disallowance except only for such amount as to which the company has filed, as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, a written protest with the commissioner.
