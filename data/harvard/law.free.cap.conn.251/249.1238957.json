The Appellate Court originally reversed the judgment of conviction for what it perceived to be an evidentiary error by the trial court; <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>42 Conn. App. 78, 80, 679 A.2d 950 (1996); and, on a certified appeal from that judgment, we reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court and remanded the case to that court for consideration of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>241 Conn. 784, 792, 699 A.2d 91 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Following our remand, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment only as to the conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>burglary in the second degree, and affirmed the judgment in all other respects. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>48 Conn. App. 260, 274, 709 A.2d 590 (1998). We then granted the defendant\u2019s certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, limited to the following two issues: \u201c1. Should this court review the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s instructions that \u2018the law is made to protect society and innocent persons, and not to protect guilty ones?\u2019 \u201d and \u201c2. If the answer to the first question is yes, did the instructions violate the defendant\u2019s federal or state constitutional rights to have the jury adequately instructed regarding the presumption of innocence and the concept of reasonable doubt?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>245 Conn. 907, 718 A.2d 15 (1998). This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">This case is controlled by our recently issued decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 167-77, 728 A.2d 466 (1999). In that case, we considered and rejected claims essentially identical to those presented by the certified questions in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b269-7\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARv\">dissenting. I would reverse the conviction of the defendant, Charles Coleman, on the ground that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction \u2014 \u201cthe law is made to protect society and innocent persons, and not to protect guilty ones\u201d \u2014 was unconstitutional. As I explain in my dissent in <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>251 Conn. 220, 244-49, 740 A.2d 832 (1999), this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 728 A.2d 466 (1999), was wrongly decided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, this court should be guided by the reasoning set forth in the Second Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>130 F.3d 532, 539 (2d Cir. 1997), and should hold that the challenged language of the jury instruction in this case \u201ccreated a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the reasonable doubt standard and the presumption of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> I was not assigned to sit on the panel for <em>Schiappa, </em>which was decided by a full court of seven justices (a senior justice was selected to complete the panel of seven).
