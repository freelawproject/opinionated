We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination concerning the existence of the requisite reasonable and articulable suspicion. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The defendant, Jeffrey L. Donahue, pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court had denied in part and granted in part the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of his statements to the police and the results of the field sobriety tests the police had conducted prior to his arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its denial of the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court, <em>Schuman, J., </em>held that the defendant had been stopped by the arresting officer pursuant to a reasonable suspicion justifying the stop and that, therefore, the resulting statements and field tests were admissible. Following the defendant\u2019s conditional plea of nolo contendere pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction and sentenced the defendant to a term of six months imprisonment, execution suspended, and six months conditional discharge. The trial court also suspended the defendant\u2019s license, imposed a fine and ordered community service and counseling. The execution of the sentence was stayed to allow the defendant the opportunity to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>denied his motion to suppress. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>53 Conn. App. 497, 502, 729 A.2d 255 (1999). This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. He claims that the police did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify his detention. The state claims that the police did have a reasonable and articulable suspicion, and that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The Appellate Court determined that the following facts were undisputed. \u201cOn December 10, 1997, Sergeant Todd Lynch of the Connecticut state police was on routine patrol on Club Road in Windham. As a shift supervisor, Lynch normally would not be on street patrol. This area, however, had experienced a dramatic increase in criminal activity in the previous four to six weeks, which he was attempting to counteract with his help on patrol. Specifically, Lynch was patrolling a cemetery next to a public housing project located on Club Road where drug dealing and prostitution often took place. Individuals would often park their vehicles at the commercial establishments along Club Road and then walk through the cemetery into the housing project to engage in these illegal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201cAs Lynch was leaving the cemetery at approximately 1:50 a.m., he noticed a vehicle operated by the defendant turn abruptly from Club Road into the vacant parking lot of the French Club, a private social club that had closed for the evening. The defendant had a passenger with him in the car. As the defendant parked his vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>and kept the engine running . . . Lynch drove his vehicle across the street toward the defendant\u2019s vehicle. By the time Lynch actually entered the French Club parking lot, the defendant had positioned his vehicle so that it was facing the exit of the parking lot. Lynch then made a U-tum in the parking lot so that he could approach the defendant\u2019s vehicle from behind and activated his red, yellow and blue flashers, but not his light bar. Before exiting his vehicle, Lynch radioed the defendant\u2019s license plate number to the Colchester barracks to find out whether the defendant\u2019s vehicle was stolen and if there were any outstanding warrants for its registered owner. Lynch learned that the vehicle was neither reported stolen, nor were there any outstanding warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\u201cUpon receiving this information, Lynch exited his vehicle and approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle to ask the defendant for his license and registration. The defendant rolled down his window when he saw Lynch at his driver\u2019s side window. At that point, Lynch detected alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath and, after the defendant failed a field sobriety test, Lynch arrested him for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a.\u201d Id., 498-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">At trial, the defendant moved to suppress evidence obtained after his initial detention on the ground that such detention had been unlawful. The defendant claimed that Lynch lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop his vehicle and that the ensuing detention, therefore, violated his rights pursuant to the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that \u201cthere\u2019s a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot when given the vicinity, the time of night the defendant pulls into the dirt parking lot of a club that is closed. And there\u2019s no other businesses in the area that could have been opened at that time. So I find that there was [a] reasonable suspicion to justify the stop at that time.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in part.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision, concluding that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s actions . . . were particularly consistent with the type of suspicious activity that often preceded . . . crime in this area. Under these circumstances, Lynch had an objective basis to suspect that the defendant may have been involved in the crimes .... The facts of this case support the determination that a reasonable and articulable suspicion existed to justify the stop of the defendant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d Id., 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Before this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify stopping his vehicle. The state argues in response that Lynch\u2019s investigatory stop of the defendant was justified based upon the fact that the defendant was driving his lawfully registered vehicle in a commercial area that recently had seen an increase in criminal activities, especially drug dealing, prostitution, larceny and vandalism, and that \u201cindividuals would often park their vehicles at establishments along Club Road and walk across the cemetery into the adjacent public housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>project to engage in drug dealing and prostitution.\u201d We agree with the defendant that the facts of this case do not reveal a reasonable and articulable basis for a police stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard by which we review the Appellate Court\u2019s ruling. \u201c[W]e undertake a two-part analysis. First, we ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s underlying factual findings were clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>197 Conn. 620, 625, 500 A.2d 1299 (1985); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980) .... Second, in light of the facts found by the trial court, we determine whether the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that the police officer [had] a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity on which to base his initial investigative approach to the defendant\u2019s car. The trial court\u2019s conclusions must stand unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, [625]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 267, 460 A.2d 970 (1983).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotations marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>220 Conn. 38, 44, 595 A.2d 1349 (1991). We conclude that the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that Lynch had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity is legally and logically inconsistent with the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Although the issue of whether Lynch\u2019s detention of the defendant constituted a \u201cseizure\u201d is not a certified issue before this court, the state asserts, as an alternative ground for affirming the decision of the Appellate Court, that Lynch\u2019s stop of the defendant was not a seizure. Indeed, the state cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>237 Conn. 81, 87, 675 A.2d 866 (1996), for this court\u2019s definition of \u201cseizure.\u201d \u201c[A] person [is defined] as seized under our state constitution when by means of physical force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained. ... In determining whether a seizure has occurred, so as to invoke the protections of our state constitution ... a court is to consider whether in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The trial court ruled that Lynch\u2019s detention of the defendant did constitute a seizure and the Appellate Court did not disturb that finding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The state\u2019s argument is difficult to sustain in light of its counsel\u2019s concession, at oral argument before this court, that under the circumstances in the present case, he \u2014 or any other reasonable person \u2014 would not have felt free to leave after Lynch pulled up behind the defendant\u2019s ca\u00ed and activated the vehicle\u2019s overhead flashing lights. Accordingly, we do not disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was seized for the purpose of an investigative detention at the point at which Lynch pulled up behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle and activated the police car\u2019s red, yellow and blue flashing lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Having concluded that the defendant was seized by the action of Lynch, we must now decide whether the defendant\u2019s detention was legally justified. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">\u201cArticle first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of our state constitution permit a police officer \u2018in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner\u2019 to detain an individual for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>investigative purposes even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest. <em>State </em>v. Mitchell, [204 Conn. 187, 195, 527 A.2d 1168, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 927, 108 S. Ct. 293, 98 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1987)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 654, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992). \u201cIn determining whether the detention was justified in a given case, a court must consider if [b]ased upon the whole picture the detaining officers [had] a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity. ... A court reviewing the legality of a stop must therefore examine the specific information available to the police officer at the time of the initial intrusion and any rational inferences to be derived therefrom. . . . These standards, which mirror those set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>[392 U.S. 1, 20-22, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968)], with regard to fourth amendment analysis, govern the legality of investigatory detentions under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of our state constitution.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 654.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201cIn the present case, we must decide whether article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution afford greater protection to the citizens of this state than does the federal constitution in the determination of what constitutes a seizure. We conclude that they do.\u201d Id., 649-50. \u201cPolice have the right to stop for investigation short of arrest where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot. . . . [I]n justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, 165 </em>Conn. 577, 584-85, 345 A.2d 532 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 960, 94 S. Ct. 1977, 40 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Upon our careful review of the record in the present case, we conclude that Lynch\u2019s detention of the defendant was based on nothing more than the location of the defendant\u2019s vehicle at an early hour of the morning. Obviously, these factors are not criminal in and of themselves, and they do not form the proper bases for rational inferences that warrant Lynch\u2019s intrusion. Furthermore, they do not rise to the standard of a reasonable suspicion that we have found in other cases. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 46-47 (\u201c[vjiewing the totality of the circumstances in this case, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>that the informant had supplied [the police officer] with information that had sufficient indicia of reliability and corresponded adequately to his observations in the parking lot to provide him with [a] reasonable and articulable suspicion sufficient to justify approaching the defendant\u2019s car for further investigation\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 216 Com. 175 (after hearing police broadcast describing vehicle driven by intoxicated individual, officer was justified in stopping car that matched description driving without its headlights illuminated in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-96a [d]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Com. 142, 149, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981) (\u201c[t]he plainly furtive conduct of the occupants of that vehicle observed by the officer as he approached certainly justified the limited intrusion upon the defendant\u2019s personal liberty\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 165 Com. 585-86 (police stop of defendants was justified when their vehicle was observed pulling into parking lot of motel at 11:30 p.m., discharging four occupants and moving next to exit, and four occupants were then observed coming from rear of motel, walking \u201churriedly and cautiously\u201d back to car).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The state\u2019s argument that Lynch was justified in stopping the defendant due to an increase in crime in the area is unpersuasive. We considered and rejected a similar argument in <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 233 Com. 655. In <em>Oquendo, </em>we held that the officer\u2019s detention of the defendant was not justified when the officer\u2019s suspicions were based on the following factors: the clothing worn by the defendant; the increased crime rate in the area in which the defendant was walking; the fact that the officer knew the defendant\u2019s companion was a recent arrestee for larceny and burglary; and the officer\u2019s \u201c \u2018hunch\u2019 \u201d that the defendant was about to commit a crime. Id., 641. We fomd that those factors were considered insufficient to make the officer\u2019s stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>of the defendant \u201cconstitutionally reasonable.\u201d Id., 657. Commenting specifically on the officer\u2019s suspicion of the defendant based upon the fact that others recently had committed burglaries in the area, we noted: \u201cAlthough burglaries had been reported in the general area . . . [the officer] had not received any report that a burglary had been committed in that area on [that] evening . . . nor did he possess information linking the defendant... to a particular burglary in the area.\u201d Id., 655. \u201cA history of past criminal activity in a locality does not justify suspension of the constitutional rights of everyone, or anyone, who may subsequently be in that locality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 655 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Here, the state argues that the following five factors produced a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was engaged or about to engage in criminal activity: (1) he was driving in a deserted area late at night; (2) he made an abrupt turn into the parking lot; (3) he pulled into an empty, unlit parking lot of an establishment that had closed for the evening; (4) his vehicle was in an area that had experienced a rise in criminal activity; and (5) his behavior was \u201cconsistent with the type of behavior that often preceded the criminal activity Lynch was out on patrol investigating.\u201d We disagree and conclude that, as in <em>Oquendo, </em>the officer did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion. We are unpersuaded that the totality of circumstances in this case reach the level of a reasonable suspicion found in our precedents. Here, the defendant had not committed any traffic violation. He had not been driving erratically. Neither he nor his passenger had exhibited any furtive conduct. Indeed, neither the defendant nor his passenger had exited the vehicle. Furthermore, the vehicle had not been the subject of any police investigation; indeed, Lynch even checked with the Colchester barracks and determined that the vehicle was not stolen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>and that neither the vehicle nor its registered owner were wanted by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Thus, we conclude that the police officer had no reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant had committed or was about to commit a crime. According to the principles of our state constitution as articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 654, we conclude that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">While there is no evidence or suggestion in the record that Lynch or any other individual involved in law enforcement was engaged in the practice, the present case does raise the insidious specter of \u201cprofiling\u201d:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the criminalizing of locations, neighborhoods or even individuals due to generalized perceptions of supposedly identifying and suspicious characteristics. This court cannot permit such a suspension of constitutional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court, and remand the case to that court with direction to vacate the plea of nolo contendere and to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">In this opinion BERDON, KATZ and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both.

The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion as it pertained to the results of the chemical test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen a defendant . . . enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to taire an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search or seizure . . . the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law.

We do conclude, however, that the detention of the defendant was in violation of the standard set forth in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 20-22. Furthermore, the federal cases relied upon by the dissent are distinguishable from the present case in that they all conclude that reasonable suspicion existed in light of distinct, articulable facts specific to the defendant in question.

The level of specificity and the indicia of reliability inherent to these cases distinguishes them from the general, nonspecific aura of suspicion existent in the present case. Accordingly, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s reliance on these federal cases and conclude that the facts of the present case do not rise to the standard of reasonable and articulable suspicion presented in the federal precedents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\"> As defined in the racial context, \u201cprofiling\u201d has come to refer to the practice of \u201csingling] out black and Hispanic drivers based on ostensible traffic violations and subjecting] them to criminal searches.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>159 N.J. 277, 368, 731 A.2d 1121 (1999) (Handler, J., dissenting); see also D.

The concern that is identified in the context of racial profiling is, however, applicable here, as it was in <em>Oquendo, </em>in that the constitutional rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the defendant are violated as a result of a police stop predicated on no reasonable and articulable suspicion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>MCDONALD, C.

In <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20-27, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), the United States Supreme Court recognized that police officers, upon reasonable and articulable suspicion, may take \u201cnecessarily swift action predicated upon the on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beat . . . [that] as a practical matter could not be, subjected to the warrant procedure.\u201d Id., 20. <em>Terry </em>concerned a police officer who approached three men on the street and asked their names. The actions of the men had aroused his interest. After the men mumbled their response, the officer physically seized one of them and conducted a \u201cpat down.\u201d After he felt a gun in the man\u2019s coat, he ordered them into an adjacent store where he searched the man and seized a revolver. Id., 6-7. It was under these circumstances that the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a police officer conducting \u201ca stop and frisk\u201d when there is reasonable and articulable suspicion. Id., 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In this case, the defendant and his passenger were parked with the car\u2019s engine running at 1:50 a.m. in a dimly lit and otherwise deserted parking lot adjacent to a public highway. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>53 Conn. App. 497, 498, 729 A.2d 255 (1999). The officer parked his vehicle behind the defendant\u2019s car, which faced the exit of the parking lot. Before approaching the defendant\u2019s car, the officer put on his flashing lights; id.; in the trial court\u2019s words, \u201clargely for his own protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The majority\u2019s decision expands the <em>Terry </em>doctrine to find that a police officer merely approaching and speaking with a defendant seated in a parked vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>is an \u201cinvestigative stop\u201d; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 20-27; or, as this court described, \u201ca brief investigatory detention.\u201d State v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990). This holding runs counter to our prior decisions that recognize that a police officer\u2019s mere approach is not an investigative stop. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>214 Conn. 146, 153-54, 570 A.2d 700 (1990), this court quoted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u201c[pjolice officers do not violate an individual\u2019s constitutional rights by approaching him, by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions, by putting questions to him if he is willing to listen, or by offering into evidence in a criminal prosecution his voluntary answers to such questions. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S. Ct. 1319, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 47, 52-53, 505 A.2d 1225 (1986).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Here, the police cruiser\u2019s flashing lights were, in the darkness, the only means to mark the vehicle as a police car and identify the police officer approaching the defendant\u2019s vehicle. Police officers wearing a uniform and displaying a badge often approach either on foot, bicycle or in a marked police cruiser to question persons. Detectives in plain clothes, showing a badge or credentials, must interview people to conduct police investigations. Although one may feel obligated to cooperate with an officer in these circumstances, the law should not require, as the majority does today, that the officer have a reasonable and an articulable suspicion of criminal activity before approaching a person. The majority\u2019s decision prohibits a police officer from approaching and talking to anyone unless the officer has such suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The safety and security of law-abiding citizens strongly mitigates against the result of this case. The use of beat patrols on foot or bicycle, which encourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>such encounters, has been recognized as effective in preventing and reducing crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Moreover, the government\u2019s core function is to protect the public. The United States Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>observed in <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163, 2 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1803), that \u201c[o]ne of the first duties of government is to afford . . . protection.\u201d Among the basic duties of any government is to protect the lives and property of its citizens through effective law enforcement. The framers of the United States constitution, in the wake of Shays\u2019 Rebellion, perceived \u201can opportunity to strengthen the national government to deal with internal disorders . . . .\u201d J. Bybee, \u201cInsuring Domestic Tranquility: <em>Lopez, </em>Federalization of Crime and the Forgotten Role of the Domestic Violence Clause,\u201d 66 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1, 22, and generally 19-24 (1997). The framers\u2019 broader purpose was reflected in the preamble to the constitution, which provides: \u201cWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union . . . <em>insure domestic Tranquility . . . </em>do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\u201d (Emphasis added). In article four, \u00a7 4, of the United States constitution, the framers provided that \u201c[t]he United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government . . . .\u201d The majority\u2019s decision unreasonably frustrates Connecticut law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect its citizens from domestic violence and its obligation to ensure domestic tranquility as insured by the federal constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">For these reasons, I would affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s decision upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> A number of studies show that community policing strategies result in overall crime reduction and quality of life improvements.

Moreover, Lynch testified that he was patrolling Club Road specifically because his subordinate police officers needed help to respond to this increase in crime.

A determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on the whole of the circumstances \u201cviewed through the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer on the scene guided by his experience and training.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Delos-Rios, </em>642 F.2d 42, 45 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 941, 101 S.

Such a result will discourage legitimate police investigation and detract from the safety of Connecticut\u2019s citizens and their property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\"> The majority\u2019s concern about racial profiling is misplaced. This is not a case of racial profiling. The defendant is not a member of a racial minority.
