(Lomar), appeal from a judgment enjoining them for a period of three years from disclosing, using or selling information found by the trial court to be a trade secret, which Federico learned throughout his association with the named plaintiff, Elm City Cheese Company, Inc. (Elm City),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and its owners, Richard and Suzanne Weinstein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The principal issue before us is whether the facts found establish a trade secret as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>term is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 35-51 (d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The trial court found the following facts, which are largely undisputed. The Weinsteins own Elm City, which has been manufacturing cheese since 1896, but has been making primarily grated cheese since the late 1950s. Elm City does not sell its products to the public; rather, it sells its Italian style grated cheese to three major customers that use Elm City\u2019s cheese as a \u201cfiller\u201d to blend into their cheeses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Federico has known Richard Weinstein (Weinstein) since Federico was seven years old, and over the years, he developed a close social relationship with the Weinsteins. According to the trial court\u2019s findings, Federico \u201cbecame [the Weinsteins\u2019] most trusted adviser and confidant. Federico effectively became a member of the family, virtually the \u2018number one son.\u2019 \u201d When Federico, a certified public accountant, was not given a partnership in the firm for which he was working, Weinstein encouraged him to start his own firm and Elm City became one of his first clients. From 1982 to 1994, Federico served as both Elm City\u2019s accountant and the Weinsteins\u2019 personal accountant. When, in 1988, Weinstein learned that he had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Federico became increasingly more involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the operation of the business. He was also named executor of Weinstein\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The trial court found, further, that Federico\u2019s duties went beyond typical accounting work. For example, in the early 1980s, he was involved in efforts to solve an odor control problem in the plant. An engineer who was not an employee of Elm City eventually solved this problem by installing certain dehumidification equipment. This solution provided the additional and unexpected benefit of decreasing the time required to remove moisture from Elm City\u2019s cheese, thereby allowing Elm City to produce its product more quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The trial court found that, eventually, Federico was given keys to the building and access to the alarm system. When the Weinsteins were away, Federico was placed in charge of operations and was given the authority to make decisions. In February, 1992, Federico was made a vice president of the company and was given signatory power over the company checkbook. Although he was involved in projects for Elm City that were outside of the accounting area, even after he became vice president, he nevertheless spent four days each week at his accounting firm. In October, 1993, he became a full-time employee of Elm City and was placed in charge of the day-to-day operations of the plant. He continued to serve as Elm City\u2019s accountant, however, and also serviced other clients of his accounting firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The trial court also found that Federico learned the different aspects of Elm City\u2019s operation at various times during his association with Weinstein. For example, he first learned the identity of Elm City\u2019s biggest customer when he was a young boy. Later, in the late 1970s, before he became a certified public accountant, he did some payroll work for the company. He and Weinstein would talk about the business. During this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>time, Federico learned that Elm City used \u201creturn milk\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as its principal raw material for cheese production. According to the trial court, \u201cFederico had learned long before he became [a full-time] employee ... all aspects of Elm City\u2019s business including its method of cheese production, its customers and suppliers, its methods for drying cheese, and the prices it paid for supplies and charged for finished product.\u201d The court found: \u201cBecause of his role as Elm City\u2019s \u2018right hand man,\u2019 which grew out of his role as [accountant], Federico learned every financial aspect of Elm City\u2019s business. He knew, for example, what [Elm City] paid [its suppliers] for return[ed] milk and what [Elm City] charged its three customers . . . for Italian style grated cheese. He also became involved in every aspect of Elm City\u2019s business, including, but not limited to: its unique processes and techniques in making grated cheese; its pricing and cost structures; and its suppliers and customer relationships. He did financial projections, he kept journals on the milk suppliers and tracked the amount of milk [Elm City] ordered (and the price it paid) in Elm City\u2019s milk logs and accounts payable journal. Before Federico assumed these responsibilities, only the Weinsteins themselves were privy to these financial aspects of the business, as the financial record-keeping was primarily [Suzanne Weinstein\u2019s] job, with some assistance from Weinstein.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court noted that \u201c[although Federico may have learned some aspects of Elm City\u2019s methods of production, etc., while an employee, all the important intricate components of Elm City\u2019s business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>became fully known to Federico when he served as [an accountant] for Elm City and the Weinsteins.\u201d Federico prepared monthly statements for Elm City from 1982 to 1994. According to the trial court, these statements, which Federico prepared both before and after he had become an employee of Elm City in October, 1993, contained the type of information that a client would expect an accountant to keep confidential, particularly from potential competitors of Elm City.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The trial court found that, by 1994, the relationship between Federico and Weinstein had started to deteriorate. Weinstein became increasingly unhappy with Federico\u2019s indulgence of his family, several members of which Elm City employed at Federico\u2019s request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Federico, by contrast, claimed that his ultimate decision to leave Elm City was because Weinstein had reneged on an agreement to sell Elm City to Federico. Weinstein denied that they ever had a contract for the sale of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The trial court found further that, in mid-December, 1994, Weinstein told Federico that he would divide Elm City\u2019s profits evenly with Federico, as Weinstein\u2019s father had done with him. Shortly thereafter, in late December, Federico assured Weinstein that he intended to stay in the business. Nevertheless, on January 3, 1995, shortly after profits had been distributed, Federico gave Weinstein two letters of resignation, one as his employee and the other as his accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The trial court found that Federico then returned to his accounting practice for a brief period. In October, 1995, he attended a four day course in cheesemaking. In November of that same year, he attended a conference in Chicago that was attended by two of Elm City\u2019s three largest customers. Soon thereafter, Federico applied to a bank for a loan to start Lomar, the other defendant in this appeal. The business plan submitted to the bank by Federico, developed in November, 1995, duplicated Elm City\u2019s business, including the process for making the cheese, which Weinstein had developed over several years. According to the trial court, Lomax intended to manufacture the same product that Elm City manufactures, by the same process, and sell it to Elm City\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In November, 1996, Lomar began operations at the site of a former dairy located in Providence, Rhode Island. At trial, Federico admitted that Lomar followed the basic production method used by Elm City. It bought its supplies from some of the same suppliers used by Elm City, and it sold its finished products to the same customers that Elm City did. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">On December 20, 1996, Elm City brought an action seeking temporary and permanent injunctions, as well as damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At trial, Elm City alleged five causes of action: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) misappropriation of trade secrets;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (3) violation of the Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (4) misrepresentation; and (5) conversion. The trial court found for Elm City on the first, second and third counts, and for the defendants on the two remaining counts. The court concluded, however, that Elm City\u2019s claims were governed by General Statutes \u00a7 35-57 (a), which provides in relevant part that, \u201c[u]nless otherwise agreed by the parties, the provisions of [the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (trade secrets act); General Statutes \u00a7 35-50 et seq.] supersede any conflicting tort, restitutionary, or other law of this state pertaining to civil liability for misappropriation of a trade secret.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, the court enjoined the defendants, under the second count \u2014 the trade secret <em>count </em>\u2014 for a period <em>of three </em>years, \u201cfrom disclosing, using or selling any of [Elm City\u2019s] confidential customer information, trade secrets, procedures, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>technical data or know-how relating to the products, processes, methods, research and development plans, equipment or business operations of [Elm City].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In addition to the injunctive relief, the trial court awarded Elm City compensatory damages in the amount of $461,239, and, based upon its finding that the defendants had wilfully and maliciously misappropriated Elm City\u2019s trade secrets, the court awarded Elm City $300,000 in punitive damages, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 35-53 (b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Subsequently, the trial court, in a second memorandum of decision, awarded Elm City $100,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 35-54.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred the appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">On appeal, the defendants make several claims. First, they claim that the trial court improperly concluded that Elm City\u2019s process for making cheese was a trade secret entitled to protection under the trade secrets act. Second, they argue that the trial court improperly found the defendants\u2019 conduct wilful and malicious and, accordingly, improperly awarded punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Finally, they argue that the injunction fashioned by the trial court should be vacated on the grounds that it is not narrowly tailored to protect Elm City\u2019s trade secrets, and it does not adequately inform the defendants as to the restrictions on their conduct. We are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 arguments and, therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Before we address the parties\u2019 arguments, we set forth the standard of review applicable to this appeal. The question of whether information sought to be protected by the trade secrets act rises to the level of a trade secret is \u201cone of fact for the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Allen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Loika, </em>145 Conn. 509, 516, 144 A.2d 306 (1958).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c[W]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. . . . <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). ... In other words, to the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether those findings were clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>248 Conn. 183, 188-89, 728 A.2d 493 (1999); see also <em>Robert W. Weiss &amp; Associates, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>v. <em>Wiederlight, </em>208 Conn. 525, 539, 546 A.2d 216 (1988) (applying clearly erroneous standard in upholding trial court\u2019s conclusion that customer list and related insurance information were not trade secrets).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We begin our analysis by restating some basic principles of the law governing trade secrets. Generally speaking, in the absence of a restrictive covenant, a former employee may compete with his or her former employer upon termination of employment. <em>Town &amp; Country House &amp; Home Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>150 Conn. 314, 317, 189 A.2d 390 (1963). Even after the employment has ceased, however, \u201cthe employee remains subject to a duty not to use trade secrets, or other confidential information, which he has acquired in the course of his employment, for his own benefit or that of a competitor to the detriment of his former employer.\u201d <em>Allen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Loika, </em>supra, 145 Conn. 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">According to \u00a7 35-51 (d), a trade secret is \u201cinformation, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, process, drawing, cost data or customer list that: (1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (2) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Turning to the appeal before us, \u201c[a] primary issue to be determined ... is whether there is a trade secret existing which is to be protected.\u201d <em>Plastic &amp; Metal Fabricators, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>163 Conn. 257, 267, 303 A.2d 725 (1972). Essentially, according to \u00a7 35-51 (d), in addition to the two enumerated requirements, to constitute a trade secret, information must be of the kind included in the nonexhaustive list contained in the statute. The first step in our analysis, therefore, is a determination of whether the information at issue satisfies this threshold requirement. To do so, we must first identify the information that the trial court found to be a trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The defendants claim that the trial court improperly found that Elm City\u2019s process for making cheese is a protectable trade secret. We note, however, that although the defendant focuses on the reasons the <em>process </em>may or may not be a trade secret, we believe that the trial court\u2019s findings warrant a broader reading. Our reading of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision leads us to conclude that, in addition to Elm City\u2019s cheesemaking process, the trade secret, as found by the trial court, encompasses Elm City\u2019s customer list and certain financial information \u2014 -including its product pricing structure, and list of suppliers and the prices paid for its supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">It is true that the trial court stated that \u201cthis court . . . finds that the overall way that Elm City makes its type of \u2018Italian Style Grated Cheese,\u2019 i.e., the quick drying and the use of return milk, gives it an economic advantage [and] is a trade secret.\u201d Additionally, the trial court stated that \u201cElm City had a unique way to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>its cheese product and the combination of factors that produce its cheese is a trade secret.\u201d A careful examination of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision compels us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the scope of Elm City\u2019s trade secret go well beyond the cheesemaking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Recognizing that \u00a7 35-51 (d) (2) requires that the party seeking trade secret protection must have taken efforts to maintain the secrecy of the information sought to be protected that are reasonable under the circumstances, the trial court found that Elm City took such efforts \u201cto maintain the secrecy of its production.\u201d Rather than merely list the steps that Elm City took to protect the secrecy of its cheesemaking process, however, the trial court also stated that \u201cthere is no evidence that the formula, methods of production, sales to selected customers or other business related information was open to the public, or generally known by other employees [other than Federico].\u201d Additionally, two paragraphs later in its memorandum of decision, noting that Elm City had argued that what should be considered \u201creasonable efforts\u201d for a family operation differs from what should be so considered for a large, sophisticated corporation, the trial court discussed the fact that \u201call information was kept confidential and shared only by family members and one other, Federico, who was more than a family member in the eyes of the Weinsteins and [was] their personal accountant.\u201d The trial court immediately followed this statement with a discussion of the financial information that Federico, as an accountant, was bound, by both statute and the ethical code of his profession, not to disclose. The court noted that \u201call the information as regards customers, pricing, suppliers, costs and everything intended to be held confidential was learned by Federico . . . .\u201d Finally, we note that the trial court enjoined the defendants from \u201cdisclosing, using or selling any of Elm City Cheeses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>confidential customer information, trade secrets, procedures, technical data or know-how relating to the products, processes, methods, research and development plans, equipment or business operations of [Elm City].\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Although the defendants sought an articulation of the trial court\u2019s findings with respect to \u201cthe scope of the court\u2019s trade secret ruling,\u201d they failed to seek a review of the denial of their motion for articulation. \u201cIn the absence of [a more complete] record, we presume that the trial court, in rendering its judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, undertook the proper analysis of the law and the facts. <em>DiBella </em>v. <em>Widlitz, </em>[207 Conn. 194, 203, 541 A.2d 91 (1988)]; <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 206, 487 A.2d 191 (1985).\u201d <em>S &amp; S Tobacco &amp; Candy Co. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 313, 321-22, 617 A.2d 1388 (1992). Moreover, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision as a whole demonstrates an understanding of \u00a7 35-51 (d). We can conceive of no reason, therefore, for the trial court to have discussed financial information \u2014 including pricing data, supply information and customer lists \u2014 with respect to reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>sought to be protected as a trade secret, absent the court\u2019s belief that such information is part of the trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The foregoing leads us to conclude that the trial court found Elm City\u2019s business operations \u2014 from the specific sources and costs of its supplies, through the production of its cheese, to the distribution of its product to three specific customers and the prices charged them \u2014 to be a protectable trade secret.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We are <em>not </em>saying, however, that each and every component is necessarily a trade secret in and of itself \u2014 although the trial court specifically found that the cheesemaking process is a trade secret. In other words, we are not finding, for example, the customer list, the list of suppliers or the pricing data to be trade secrets. Such factual findings are not ours to make; rather, they fall within the province of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>245 Conn. 508, 527, 752 A.2d 978 (1998); <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CPC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 762, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996); <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Youth Challenge of Greater Hartford, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 657, 666, 594 A.2d 958 (1991). In this case, we are merely interpreting the trial court\u2019s findings to include such components within the scope of Elm City\u2019s trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Having identified the information that constitutes the trade secret at issue, we must now determine whether that information is of the kind that, assuming the requirements \u00a7 35-51 (d) (1) and (2) are met, can be considered a trade secret under the trade secrets act. Section 35-51 (d) provides in part that \u201c \u2018trade secret\u2019 means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, <em>method, </em>technique, process, drawing, cost data or customer list . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, if we read broadly the term \u201cmethod,\u201d so as to include Elm City\u2019s method of doing business, we find the trial court\u2019s finding supported by the statute. We need not rest, however, solely on this broad reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">As noted above, the nonexhaustive list contained in \u00a7 35-51 (d), in addition to \u201cmethod,\u201d includes \u201ctechnique, process . . . cost data [and] customer list . . . .\u2019\u2019Therefore, the statute clearly provides that virtually every one of the individual components of Elm City\u2019s trade secret, under the appropriate circumstances, could be considered a trade secret in and of itself. Moreover, this proposition finds support in this court\u2019s case law. For example, Elm City\u2019s list of suppliers and the costs it paid for its supplies could be found to be trade secrets. See <em>Triangle Sheet Metal Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>154 Conn. 116, 126, 222 A.2d 220 (1966) (\u201cfinancial details of [the plaintiffs] costs, pricing and bidding\u201d axe trade secrets); see also 1 R. Milgrim, Trade Secrets (1999) \u00a7 1.09 [8] [b], pp. 1-461 through 1-468. As for the manufacturing process itself, the trial court expressly found that it was entitled to trade secret protection. In so doing, the court relied on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Allen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Loika, </em>supra, 145 Conn. 515, in which we concluded that, despite the fact that the specific materials used in the plaintiffs manufacture of screws were common, commercially available components, the \u201cplaintiffs ability to combine these elements into a successful . . . process, like the creation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>of a recipe from common cooking ingredients, is a trade secret entitled to protection.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In <em>Allen Mfg. Co., </em>we noted that \u201c[t]he fact that every ingredient is known to the industry is not controlling for the secret may consist of the method of combining them which produces a product superior to that of competitors.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Finally, we note that customer lists can also be found to be trade secrets. See, e.g., <em>Town &amp; Country House &amp; Homes Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 319 (\u201c[a] list of customers, if their trade and patronage have been secured by years of business effort and advertising and the expenditure of time and money, constitutes an important part of a business and is in the nature of a trade secret\u201d). The foregoing supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the business plan as a whole merits trade secret protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Although our conclusion as to the breadth of the trial court\u2019s identification of Elm City\u2019s trade secret can be supported by a broad reading of the term \u201cmethod\u201d in \u00a7 35-51 (d), and, according to both \u00a7 35-51 (d) and ornease law, each essential component of Elm City\u2019s trade secret could itself be considered a trade secret under the appropriate circumstances, we have found very little other authority, either from our state or from foreign jurisdictions, for the proposition that such individual components, <em>together, </em>can constitute a trade secret.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Significantly, however, we have found even less authority contrary to this proposition.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, in light of the unique combination of the components at issue, that the aforementioned individual components, viewed in conjunction with each other, can be considered a trade secret under the specific circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Central to the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding that Elm City\u2019s business plan constitutes a trade secret, is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>court\u2019s finding that Elm City\u2019s business is unique.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> If the business were not unique \u2014 that is, if both the individual components of Elm City\u2019s business plan, and the way in which those components are combined, were generally known \u2014 Elm City arguably would not be entitled to trade secret protection because its information would not meet the statutory requirements of \u00a7 35-51 (d). Federico himself testified, however, that Elm City occupied a specialized niche in the cheesemaking industry. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the trial court found, Elm City\u2019s operation \u201cwas a tailor-made business for three customers who took all their product.\u201d Elm City does not sell directly to the public. Rather, its cheese is used as a filler in other cheesemakers\u2019 products. In light of the fact that each component of Elm City\u2019s business method, under the appropriate circumstances, could be considered a trade secret, and, more importantly, in consideration of the unique relationship between Elm City and its suppliers and customers, we conclude that it was appropriate for the trial court to consider Elm City\u2019s business method, as a whole \u2014 that is, its purchase of returned milk from a very limited number of suppliers, its production from that milk of exclusively hard grated cheese through a unique process, and its sale of its product exclusively to three cheesemakers to blend into their cheeses \u2014 to be entitled to trade secret protection, provided that the requirements of subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 35-51 (d) are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Relying on those subdivisions, the defendants correctly state that \u201ceven if the information at issue falls into the category of possible trade secrets,\u201d the party claiming trade secret protection must prove that the information: (1) is of independent economic value; and (2) was the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. According to the defendants, Elm City\u2019s trade secret fails to meet these requirements. Because the defendants address subdivision (2) of \u00a7 35-51 (d) first, and devote significantly more attention to it, we consider that subdivision first as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Section 35-51 (d) (2) requires that information sought to be protected be \u201cthe subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d The defendants argue that there is no evidence that the plaintiff \u201chad taken any of the measures commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>required to preserve the secret status of a business operation.\u201d We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that Elm City\u2019s efforts to maintain the secrecy of its trade secret were reasonable under the circumstances was not clearly erroneous. See <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 221-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Citing a leading commentator on trade secret law, the defendants note that reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy \u201coften include some of the following techniques: requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements or otherwise advising them of the confidential nature of the process; posting of warning or cautionary signs, or placing legends on documents; taking precautions regarding visitors, by requiring them to sign confidentiality agreements, having them sign in, and shielding the process from their view; segregating information, so that no one person or written source discloses the entire manufacturing process; and using unnamed or coded ingredients.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See 1 R. Milgrim, supra, \u00a7 1.04, pp. 1-178 through 1-189. Additionally, the defendants cite four cases from other jurisdictions, including one from the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, in which courts found that reasonable efforts had been taken to maintain the secrecy of the trade secrets at issue because the parties seeking trade secret protection had employed some of the aforementioned measures.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>It is important to note, however, that the measures cited in the Milgrim treatise are merely examples of the types of actions that may be considered, under the appropriate circumstances, to be reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy. They do not provide a standard that we must observe. Likewise, the cases cited by the defendants merely demonstrate how, in specific circumstances, a party has protected the secrecy of its trade secrets. The courts in those cases did not attempt to delineate precisely what minimum amount of effort they deemed sufficient to invoke the protection of the relevant trade secret statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The question of whether, in a specific case, a party has made reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of a purported trade secret is by nature a highly fact-specific inquiry. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Stenger, </em>695 F. Sup. 688, 691 (D. Conn. 1988). What may be adequate under the peculiar facts of one case might be considered inadequate under the facts of another. According to \u00a7 35-51 (d) (2), the efforts need only be \u201creasonable <em>under the circumstances </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The defendants assert that Elm City had no confidentiality agreements with their employees; its written employee manual makes no mention of confidentiality or nondisclosure policies or guidelines; most employees of the company have become familiar with all aspects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>of the cheesemaking process;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the cheese production equipment was in plain view of anyone inside the plant;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the thermostat displaying the temperature in the drying rooms was also in plain view; and Elm City made no effort to conceal from its employees the identity of its milk suppliers or cheese customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Having concluded that the trade secret at issue is Elm City\u2019s entire business plan, from the purchase of supplies to the sale of its cheese, we need not determine whether the cheesemaking process itself was subject to adequate efforts to maintain secrecy so as to satisfy \u00a7 35-51 (d) (2). We conclude that so long as Elm City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>kept confidential enough information to make it virtually impossible for its employees to use the rest of the information constituting its trade secret, a trier of fact reasonably could find that, under the circumstances, its methods of maintaining secrecy complied with the demands of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The trial court found that all sensitive financial information \u201cwas kept confidential and shared only by family members and one other, Federico, who was more than a family member in the eyes of the Weinsteins and [was] their personal accountant.\u201d Weinstein testified that the books and records pertaining to Elm City\u2019s business were kept in a locked safe in a locked office with a monitored burglar alarm system, until the company was burglarized and the safe destroyed. Thereafter, the records were kept in an alarmed office in a separate building from Elm City\u2019s physical plant, in locked cabinets, to which only the Weinsteins, Federico, and Federico\u2019s father, whom Federico had hired, had access.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Accordingly, the trial court found that all employees other than Federico \u201cdid not have sufficient exposure to all the integral parts of Elm City\u2019s business to go out and compete. . . . [T]here is no evidence that the formula, methods of production, sales to selected customers or other business related information was open to the public, or generally known by other employees.\u201d According to the trial court, therefore, no one but Federico had access to enough information, in conjunction with the cheesemaking process, to be able to compete with Elm City.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">As noted previously, Elm City created a unique niche for itself in the cheesemaking industry. It tailored its operation to please primarily three customers and, therefore, its success depended on its relationship with those customers. Without access to certain information, such as the costs of supplies and the prices charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>to customers, one would be unable to profit from the knowledge of the cheesemaking process. As discussed above, that information was unavailable to employees other than Federico. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court was justified in finding that, by keeping secret from those employees its confidential business related information, Elm City made efforts that were reasonable under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy of its trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Having noted that most of Elm City\u2019s employees did not have knowledge of the confidential financial aspects of Elm City\u2019s business necessary to compete with Elm City, we also note that Federico, by contrast, did have such knowledge. As the trial court stated, Federico had learned \u201call the information as regards customers, pricing, suppliers, costs and everything intended to be held confidential . . . .\u201d In his role as Weinstein\u2019s confidant and, more importantly, in his capacity as the Weinsteins\u2019 and Elm City\u2019s accountant, Federico had access to the company\u2019s business records. According to Federico\u2019s own testimony, he prepared balance sheets, income statements, statements of cash flow, monthly reports and year-end statements. He also testified that he had access to information regarding the prices Elm City charged for its goods sold, the cost of its materials, the prices it paid for the returned milk it purchased, and from whom Elm City purchased its supplies, as well as Elm City\u2019s overhead costs, administrative costs, advertising costs, promotional costs and operational costs for a thirteen or fourteen year period. In fact, Federico testified that, by the time he resigned from Elm City, he knew every financial aspect of Elm City\u2019s business. Weinstein testified that not only did Federico have access to \u201cevery financial piece of information that was at [Elm City],\u201d but he also \u201chad possession of voluminous records at his own office that belonged to Elm City . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In light of the fact that Federico knew every aspect of Elm City\u2019s business and would, therefore, possess the knowledge necessary to compete with Elm City if he so chose, one question remains. The question is whether, to be entitled to rely upon the protection of the trade secrets act, Elm City was required to take affirmative steps to protect the secrecy of its information with respect to Federico.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The defendants argue that Elm City\u2019s failure to require Federico to sign a confidentiality, nondisclosure or noncompetition agreement is fatal to Elm City\u2019s claims. Elm City maintains that any such agreement was unnecessary in light of the nature of Federico\u2019s relationship to both the Weinsteins and Elm City. The trial court concluded that Elm City had taken efforts to maintain the secrecy of the information constituting its trade secret that were reasonable under the circumstances. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In testifying that he had never asked Federico to sign a confidentiality agreement, Weinstein stated: \u201c[Federico] was very sensitive to any time we talked about things of this [nature]. We had a very close relationship. It was a trusting kind of relationship. If you questioned it, he would be very upset over it. . . . I did not think it was necessary [to have Federico sign an agreement]. . . . I had trust in [him]. He was my certified public accountant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">As the trial court stated: \u201cIt is a gross oversimplification of the facts merely to state that [Federico] was the accountant for [the Weinsteins and Elm City] .... He was also a close friend and confidant to [Weinstein], a business advisor, a part-time overseer of business operations, [and] the \u2018heir apparent\u2019 and intended future leader of the company . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">According to the trial court, and the testimony of Conrad Kappel, who is an expert in ethical standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>for accountants and who conducts peer reviews of accounting firms, Federico violated both General Statutes \u00a7 20-281J, which provides in relevant part that an accountant \u201cshall not voluntarily disclose information communicated to him by the client relating to and in connection with services rendered to the client by the [accountant] in the practice of public accountancy\u201d and the professional standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, particularly \u00a7 301, which provides in part that certified public accountants \u201cshall not use to their own advantage or disclose any member\u2019s client confidential information. ...\u201d Therefore, based in part upon expert testimony, the trial court found that Federico had violated both state statute and his profession\u2019s ethical code.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We conclude that, in light of the close personal relationship enjoyed over the years by the Weinsteins and Federico, it was reasonable for Elm City to assume that it had nothing to fear from Federico in the way of misappropriation of its cheesemaking process or its business information and, therefore, Elm City\u2019s decision not to take affirmative steps to ensure the secrecy of its information with respect to Federico constituted \u201creasonable efforts under the circumstances.\u201d Moreover, we conclude that, in light of the confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>nature of a certified public accountant\u2019s relationship with his or her client, Elm City was not required to obtain from Federico a written statement on the order of an agreement pertaining to confidentiality, nondisclosure or noncompetition. Rather, such an agreement was implicit in the relationship between the parties, and Elm City was entitled to rely on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, and in light of the deferential standard of review we apply to the many factual findings of the trial court, we conclude that Elm City has satisfied the secrecy requirement contained in subdivision (2) of \u00a7 35-51 (d). We acknowledge that Elm City\u2019s efforts to maintain the secrecy of its trade secrets were not as extensive as prudence might have dictated. We reiterate, however, that \u201c[Reasonable precautionary measures for maintaining the secrecy of the [information] were all that were required.\u201d <em>Allen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Loika, </em>supra, 145 Conn. 516. We emphasize that nothing in this opinion should be read to diminish the importance of taking precautionary measures \u2014 for example, requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements, segregating duties, restricting visitor access, or other appropriate measures \u2014 in order to satisfy the statutorily mandated secrecy requirement of \u00a7 35-51 (d) (2), nor should our conclusion be construed as encouraging proprietors to be lax in their protection of the secrecy of information they want to be considered protectable trade secrets. Rather, our conclusion is merely a reflection of the unique factual circumstances that gave rise to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Having considered the secrecy requirement of \u00a7 35-51 (d), we next consider the second requirement of the statute, contained in subdivision (1) \u2014 namely, that the information sought to be protected \u201c[d]erives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The defendants assert that, because the profitability of Elm City\u2019s cheesemaking process depends upon the company\u2019s access to, and use of, returned milk, it does not satisfy \u00a7 35-51 (d) (1). According to the defendants, \u201c[Elm City\u2019s] claims about the supposed uniqueness of its production process are a smokescreen to obscure the true motive of this litigation \u2014 to keep Lomar out of the retumfed] milk market, and eliminate price competition that increased [Elm City\u2019s] costs.\u201d The defendants seem to base their entire argument with respect to \u00a7 35-51 (d) (1) on the general availability of returned milk and the fact that Elm City had no exclusive contract with its suppliers for the purchase of the milk. The defendants\u2019 argument, however, focuses on the production process as constituting Elm City\u2019s trade secret. As we have concluded previously herein, the trade secret is broader than that, encompassing confidential business information, including pricing and cost data. We must determine, therefore, whether Elm City\u2019s trade secret, as found by the trial court, satisfies \u00a7 35-51 (d) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The trial court determined that \u201cthe use of return[ed] milk together with the method of production being unique does have economic advantage particularly as it is sold as a filler for just three customers now being taken away by Lomar.\u201d The court concluded \u201cthat the combination of the use of the milk and the method of production was unique, and the combination has substantial economic advantage, meant to be kept confidential, which Federico saw over the years of compiling the profits of Elm City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">As Elm City notes in its brief: \u201cPrior to establishing Lomar, Federico\u2019s only experience in the cheese business was with Elm City. . . . [He] had no independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>source of knowledge as to the particulars of \u2018accommodating the special needs\u2019 of [Elm City\u2019s] three-customer market: the characteristics of the product; the way the product is manufactured; the costs involved in producing it; the prices charged; and the identities of the customers willing to purchase the product. Each particular piece of this information has value in connection with the related information; all are necessary to satisfy the specialized needs of the three customers; all contribute to the economic value of Elm City\u2019s particular business niche. The economic value of the whole cannot be separated from its constituent parts.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Federico testified that he endeavored to make the same product that Elm City was making to accommodate the special needs of the same private label packers to whom Elm City sells all of its product. He conceded that Elm City occupied a specialized niche business at the time he left the company. In fact, Federico testified that, as part of his efforts to secure a bank loan to establish Lomar, he submitted to Lafayette American Bank a business plan in which he stated that \u201c \u2018[t]his specialized [niche] business can accommodate the special needs of the private label packers.\u2019 \u201d In that same business plan, Federico suggested thatLomar\u2019s marketing plan had an advantage in that large manufacturers of cheese are unable to fill the special needs of the private label packers.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Federico\u2019s own testimony demonstrates, therefore, that: Elm City occupied a special niche in the cheese-making industry; Federico intended to duplicate Elm City\u2019s product, using Elm City\u2019s supply sources and its customers; and Lomar\u2019s business plan, which essentially mirrored that of Elm City, gave Lomar an economic advantage over large cheesemakers. Indeed, the mere fact that Elm City\u2019s plan served as the basis of Lomar\u2019s plan for the purposes of securing loans to start Lomar supports the proposition that Elm City\u2019s plan has substantial economic value.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Moreover, prior to Lomar\u2019s entrance into the market, Elm City alone occupied its special place in the local cheesemaking industry. According to Federico, Lomar sells 90 to 95 percent of its product to the same three customers to which Elm City sells virtually all of its product.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is reasonable to conclude that, if Elm City\u2019s customers purchase from Lomar the same product that Elm City sells to those customers, the customers would likely buy less product from Elm City. The foregoing demonstrates plainly that Elm City\u2019s trade secret derived independent economic value from not being generally known to those who could profit from the knowledge of it, that is, in particular, the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Therefore, on the basis of the evidence presented and the testimony elicited at trial, particularly that of Federico, we can conceive of no principled reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that Elm City\u2019s business plan satisfies \u00a7 35-51 (d) (1). Having concluded that Elm City\u2019s trade secret meets all the requirements of \u00a7 35-51 (d), we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to that court\u2019s finding of a trade secret violation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We now consider whether the trial court properly awarded Elm City punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s awards were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Before addressing the parties\u2019 arguments, we note that \u201c[t]he trial court has broad discretion in determining whether damages are appropriate. <em>Buckman </em>v. <em>People Express, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 166, 175, 530 A.2d 596 (1987). Its decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. Id <em>.\u2019\u2019Robert S. Weiss &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wiederlight, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Section 35-53 (b) provides in relevant part that, \u201cif the court finds wilful and malicious misappropriation, the court may award punitive damages . . . and may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The trial court expressly found \u201cthat the defendants wilfully and maliciously caused the misappropriation of Elm City trade secrets and pursuant to \u00a7 35-53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>(b) awardfed] the sum of $300,000\u201d in punitive damages. In a subsequent memorandum of decision, the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $100,000.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The defendants assert that \u201c[t]he paucity of evidence that [Elm City] treated its manufacturing process as secret and proprietary over the years precludes a finding of wilful and malicious infringement.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We note first that, again, contrary to what we have concluded previously, the defendants narrowly define the trade secret at issue to Elm City\u2019s cheesemaking process. Considering Elm City\u2019s business plan as a whole, however, it is evident that Elm City took precautions to protect the secrecy of the crucial business related information from all employees except Federico, and that it reasonably believed it did not need to take affirmative steps to protect itself against Federico because he was under an obligation, as Elm City\u2019s certified public accountant, to keep such information confidential. The defendants\u2019 argument, therefore, lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The defendants also argue that \u201c[t]he trial record cannot support a finding that [Federico] wilfully or maliciously [mis] appropriated information from Elm City that he had reason to believe was a trade secret.\u201d The defendants claim that \u201cthe evidence suggests the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u2018trade secret\u2019 were never uttered at Elm City until Lomar opened as a competing business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The defendants\u2019 argument, relying as it does on its belief that Elm City\u2019s trade secret is limited to its manufacturing process, is, essentially, as follows. Because Federico did not know that the process was a trade secret, he could not have acted wilfully or maliciously in duplicating the process. This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We previously have noted that Federico used confidential business information that he was duty bound, by both statute and the ethics of his profession, to keep confidential. He cannot do so and then hide behind professed ignorance that the information he used improperly is part of Elm City\u2019s trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">According to \u00a7 35-51 (b), one of the definitions of \u201cmisappropriation\u201d is: \u201c(2) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who . . . (B) at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was . . . (ii) acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use . . . .\u201d We conclude that Federico should have known that he was using information that was a trade secret and that he was duty bound to keep confidential. We further conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of a wilful and malicious misappropriation was amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The trial court found that Federico was \u201con a course for Elm City\u2019s demise rather than to enter into fair competition.\u201d The court noted that the defendants\u2019 choice of location for Lomar, in Providence, Rhode Island, a location closer to the milk suppliers than Elm City\u2019s location, would have the effect of \u201cchoking off Elm City\u2019s supply of retumfed] milk.\u201d Also, the court found that Federico \u201cwould be tapping the resources of Elm City\u2019s suppliers of retum[ed] milk and choking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>off further the distribution of Elm City\u2019s life lines by getting the three major customers of Elm City\u2019s product . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Moreover, although there was disagreement as to its cause, there was ample testimony regarding the animosity between Federico and Weinstein at the time Federico tendered his resignation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> A review of the facts found by the trial court, as well as a review of the testimony of both Weinstein and Federico, compels us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of wilful and malicious animus on Federico\u2019s part is amply supported by the record.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s awards of punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees, and we therefore affirm the awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We turn now to the final issue raised on appeal. The defendants claim that the injunction fashioned by the trial court should be vacated on the grounds that it is not narrowly tailored to protect Elm City\u2019s trade secret, and it does not adequately inform the defendants as to the restrictions on their conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">As an initial matter, we note that a trial court is vested with broad authority to fashion equitable relief. See, e.g., <em>Pamela B. </em>v. <em>Ment, </em>244 Conn. 296, 315, 709 A.2d 1089 (1998). In the present case, on December 5, 1997, the trial court rendered a judgment that, inter alia, enjoined the defendants \u201cfor a period of three years from disclosing, using or selling any of Elm City Cheeses, confidential customer information, trade secrets, procedures, technical data or know-how relating to the products, processes, methods, research and development plans, equipment or business operations of [Elm City].\u201d The trial court also stated: \u201cThe defendants . . . are also enjoined for a period of three years from developing or utilizing any information as to the [procedure for making] the Italian Style Grated Cheese produced by Elm City. Federico is enjoined from using any records he used or prepared for Elm City while he was acting as Elm City\u2019s accountant. The defendants are enjoined for a period of three years, including any persons or entities under their control, direction or in concert from developing or utilizing any information regarding the drying and odor control processes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>equipment used in Elm City\u2019s manufacturing process. The defendants are enjoined from contracting or divulging the identity of Elm City\u2019s customers, and the defendants are enjoined directly or indirectly from selling any cheese product made like Elm City for a period of three years. The foregoing injunction does not foreclose the defendants from manufacturing or selling other types of cheese to others or the named three customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The defendants assert that this injunction is overly broad and unsupported by the evidence. They note that \u201c[Elm City] alleged that its entire method of doing business constitutes a trade secret, and the trial court\u2019s order does not parse the various elements of [Elm City\u2019s] business to determine which are entitled to trade secret protection.\u201d As we have stated numerous times in this opinion, however, Elm City\u2019s method of doing business \u2014 that; is, the business <em>plan </em>\u2014 is its trade secret. Therefore, there was no need for the trial court to determine which aspects of the plan are protected under the trade secrets act, because each component, as part of the trade secret, is entitled to protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The defendants claim that the injunction is impermissibly broad and, therefore, it \u201cdo[es] not give [them] fair notice of what they can and cannot do.\u201d Elm City maintains to the contrary, stating that \u201c[t]he trial court fashioned an injunction only broad enough to [e]nsure protection of Elm City\u2019s trade secrets.\u201d A reading of the injunction reveals that what the defendants are prohibited from doing is merely what is encompassed within the trade secret. We therefore disagree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">As Elm City notes, \u201c[t]here should be no difficulty in understanding the injunction or following it. Elm City\u2019s trade secrets have value only in relation to its very limited market. The defendants are precluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>doing business in that market. For a period of three years, the defendants cannot make a parmesan-style cheese specially manufactured for sale to private label packers who purchase the product for blending in a grated cheese product. The more particular aspects of the trade secret protection \u2014 -the manufacturing processes and procedures, pricing, market and customer information \u2014 only have relevance in this very narrow market niche.\u201d We agree with Elm City\u2019s reading of the trial court\u2019s injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The injunction makes clear that the defendants are prohibited from using Elm City\u2019s cheesemaking procedure, including the quick drying method Federico learned from Elm City, to manufacture cheese. They also may not use Elm City\u2019s confidential business information. As the injunction makes equally clear, the defendants are <em>not </em>prohibited, however, from making other kinds of cheeses, using other cheesemaking processes. They may even sell such products to Elm City\u2019s customers, provided the product is not a competitive substitute for Elm City\u2019s product.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As Elm City correctly notes, \u201c[i]f the defendants choose to make a truly different cheese product, the trade secrets Federico learned at Elm City will have no value to him because everything from the production process to the market for the product will be sufficiently different as to avoid any possible misinteipretation of the order.\u201d Put simply, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the injunction states plainly what actions the defendants are prohibited from taking and, even, certain actions they are <em>not </em>prohibited from taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In light of the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the injunction is impermissibly broad. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s injunction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In summary, we conclude that: (1) Elm City\u2019s trade secret meets the requirements of \u00a7 35-51 (d); (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees; and (3) the injunction fashioned by the trial court is not impermissibly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">In this opinion BORDEN and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\"> The defendants also appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment awarding Elm City compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"> At the outset of the trial, Richard Weinstein was also a plaintiff in the case.

Additionally, in order to divert some income from Federico\u2019s father so as to allow him to collect social security benefits, Elm City carried Federico\u2019s mother on its payroll, even though she worked for Federico\u2019s uncle rather than for Elm City.

In support for this assertion, the defendants note that Elm City, in claiming that the clearly erroneous standard governs, relied upon, inter alia, <em>Allen Mfg. Co. v. Loika, </em>supra, 145 Conn. 516, which was decided before the enactment of current Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, formerly \u00a7 4061, which permits this court to reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if we determine that the factual findings are clearly erroneous or if \u201cthe decision is otherwise erroneous in law.\u201d The defendants fail to note, however, that this court also applied the clearly erroneous standard in <em>Robert W. Weiss &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wiederlight, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 539, which was decided in 1988, a decade after the enactment of \u00a7 4061 in 1978. We reaffirm that this standard is the appropriate one to apply in a trade secrets appeal such as the present one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\"> We recognize that it could be argued that the trial court\u2019s inclusion of the phrase \u201ctrade secrets\u201d in this list could be construed as an indication that the trade secret at issue must be something other than the confidential or business information listed because, otherwise, the injunction would be redundant. This argument is unpersuasive, however, in light of the fact that the trial court also included in the same list, \u201cprocedures, technical data or know-how relating to the products, <em>processes, [and] methods\u201d </em>employed by Elm City. (Emphasis added.) There is no dispute that such information was considered by the trial court to be part of the trade secret. We conclude, therefore, that, just as the inclusion of \u201cprocesses\u201d and \u201cmethods\u201d is not redundant of \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d neither is the inclusion of the confidential or business-related information. The trial court\u2019s inclusion of the phrase \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d therefore, does not exclude from the definition of that phrase any of the other information listed in the injunction. Rather, it is likely that the inclusion of the term is a result of the trial court\u2019s desire to create as complete a list as was possible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\"> The defendants even seem to acknowledge that the trade secret encompasses more than merely the cheesemaking process itself. In their original brief, in support of their assertion that Elm City did not take sufficient measures to maintain secrecy, the defendants note that Elm City \u201cmade no effort to conceal the identity of milk suppliers or cheese customers from its employees . . . .\u201d Additionally, in their reply brief, the defendants claim that \u201cthe essential elements of [Elm City\u2019s] business \u2014 how to make the cheese, where to buy the milk, where to sell the cheese \u2014 were known to hundreds of employees. . . . [Elm City] gave no indication to any employee that its customers, suppliers, or [cheesemaking] procedure were secret.\u201d By including the supplier and customer information in its list of information that it. argues Elm City should have kept secret, the defendants imply that such information is part of the trade secret at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\"> We have found two eases in which courts have considered several components of a business to be a irade secret. For example, in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>453 F.2d 1006, 1008 (9th Cir. 1972), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s finding that \u201ca detailed plan for the creation, promotion, financing, and sale of contracts for \u2018prepaid\u2019 or \u2018pre-need\u2019 funeral services\u201d was entitled to trade secret protection. \u201cThe plan . . . encompassed all of the forms, information, and techniques, for formulating, promoting, financing, and selling contracts for \u2018prepaid\u2019 funeral services in the continuous operation of a mortician\u2019s business.\u201d Id., 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Another example can be found in <em>California Intelligence Bureau </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>83 Cal. App. 2d 197, 199, 188 P.2d 303 (1948), which involved a business that consisted of procuring, digesting and analyzing information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>concerning solicitations of funds for, generally, charitable and philanthropic purposes, and distributing, by bulletin, information to subscribers for the purpose of protecting those subscribers from \u201cfalse, fraudulent and unworthy\u201d solicitations. In determining that the method of operating the business was a trade secret, the court stated: \u201cDuring the many years [the] plaintiff has been in business it has acquired and retains a vast amount of information relative to those who solicit funds. It knows the worthy and the unworthy. It has developed superior methods of investigation of newcomers in the field. It has evolved methods of analyzing and digesting the results of its investigations. It tersely supplies its conclusions to its subscribers. . . . <em>AH of this, including [the] plaintiffs list of subscribers, is a trade secret, </em>confidential information, property of [the] plaintiff. [The] [plaintiffs list of customers is a preferred list, a list of persons, firms and corporations willing to pay for confidential, difficult to obtain, information about persons soliciting funds.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">It is noteworthy that the courts deciding these cases did not parse out the business plans at issue, even though they listed the components of them, in order to determine whether each component was a trade secret. Rather, in each case, the overall plan itself was found to be a trade secret. We view the plans at issue in these cases as sufficiently analogous to Elm City\u2019s overall business plan so as to provide a measure of support for our conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> The extent of the authority we found contrary to our proposition can be found in 1 R. Milgrim, supra, \u00a7 1.09 [8] [d], p. 1-470, in which the author states that systems and methods \u201cmay be entitled to protection but might be so all-embracing with reference to any given enterprise that it would amount to protection of the business rather than the \u2018secrets.\u2019 \u201d The author provides no authority, however, to support this sentence. The author then notes that \u201c[c]ases denying this class of matter protection, however, do not carefully analyze why relief has not been granted.\u201d Id., pp. 1-470 through 1-471. We have examined every case cited in relation to this sentence and have uncovered none in which a court expressly held that several components of a business, each of which, under the appropriate circumstances, could be deemed a trade secret, could not, taken together, constitute a trade secret. Milgrim does cite one case, however, in which the court found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the contrary, which bolsters our conclusion. See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>453 F.2d 1006, 1008 (9th Cir. 1972), discussed in footnote 19 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b95-5\"> In finding that Elm City\u2019s method of cheese production is unique, the trial court relied in part on the expert testimony of Robert Bradley, a professor of food sciences at the University of Wisconsin, who testified that, in his opinion, the method is \u201cvery unique.\u201d The trial court also had available to it voluminous testimony from others about the uniqueness of the process. Although there was testimony about several stages of the process that Elm City claims make it unique, such as the cutting of curd into small pieces and the use of certain drying containers, the court focused primarily on two key components of Elm City\u2019s process that were the subjects of lengthier discussion at trial than were others.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The first component cited by the trial court is Elm City\u2019s use of returned milk, which, according to Weinstein\u2019s testimony, is unique in the cheesemaking industry with respect to the manufacture of grated cheese. It was undisputed that the use of returned milk makes the production of the cheese much less costly. Indeed, Weinstein testified that if Elm City\u2019s exact process were followed but milk bought at normal supply prices was substituted for returned milk, Elm City\u2019s cheesemaking process would not be profitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The second main factor contributing to the uniqueness of Elm City\u2019s process cited by the trial court is the way in which the company rapidly dries the cheese through a technique developed specifically for Elm City. True parmesan cheese takes a minimum of ten months to cure. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 133.165 (a) (1999). Elm City's product, which is not a true parmesan cheese but is, rather, sold to other cheesemakers to use as \u201cfiller\u201d in their cheeses, is dried in a matter of weeks. The process Elm City employed immediately prior to 1985 gave rise to an odor problem within the plant. Federico was involved in efforts to solve the problem, which was eventually solved by an engineer who test ified at trial, Alex Semeomirsky \u2014 whose name is spelled \u201cSandomirsky\u201d in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision. The solution entailed the installation and use of dehumidification components, an air handler, a chiller and a water tower. This solution not only alleviated the odor control problem, but had the unexpected but beneficial effect of accelerating the removal of moisture from Elm City\u2019s product, thereby allowing Elm City to produce its cheese more quickly to its economic advantage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\"> We note that the defendants exclude from their list a method cited in the treatise that Elm City <em>did, </em>employ \u2014 that is, \u201c[k]eeping secret documents under lock.\" See 1 R. Milgrim, supra, \u00a7 1.04, p. 1-188. For a discussion of Elm City\u2019s efforts in this regard, see the remainder of part IIB of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\"> The defendants cite <em>Uncle B's Bakery, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke, </em>920 F.

For example, he testified that none of Elm City\u2019s nonsupervisory employees had access to the cheesemaking process in its entirety. According to Weinstein, only supervisory personnel have been allowed to add certain ingredients to the milk used for making the company\u2019s cheese, and, since the late or mid-1980s, those ingredients have been kept in a refrigerated truck under lock and key. Weinstein also testified that Elm City\u2019s employees were familiar with \u201c[d]ifferent stages of malting cheese and not from beginning to end.\u201d The trial court properly could have credited this testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 227, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996) (\u201c[t]he determination of a witness' credibility is the special function of the trial court\u201d). Additionally, we note that such segregation of information \u2014 that is, the withholding of certain information necessary to the procedure as a whole \u2014 is listed in Milgrim\u2019s treatise, cited by the defendant, as a method of maintaining secrecy that has been recognized by courts. See 1 R. Milgrim, supra, \u00a7 1.04, p. 1-186 (including \u201c[mjaintaining internal secrecy by dividing the process into steps\u201d in list of techniques adopted to protect secrecy on which courts have focused).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\"> In addition to the defendants\u2019 argument that employees had access to Elm City\u2019s process, the defendants also note that delivery truck drivers would sometimes enter the plant and were not barred from the production floor, and visitors were not barred from the plant. Weinstein testified, however, that, although there was \u201cnothing in writing, [he has] told [Elm City\u2019s] supervisors to keep unauthorized people out of the plant verbally.\u201d If credited, this testimony indicates an effort to maintain secrecy with respect to truck drivers and persons not employed by Elm City. Moreover, we agree with the trial court that such persons, including truck drivers, who are not in the cheesemalting business, would not be in a position to \u201cgain enough knowledge to compete [with Elm City] . . . .\u201d We focus our attention, therefore, on Elm City\u2019s employees, who were in a better position to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> At trial, the defendants argued that Federico was employed in \u201cindustry\u201d and not in the practice of public accounting. The trial court noted that, according to Kappel\u2019s testimony, because Federico was performing the services of a certified public accountant, even when employed by Elm City, he was subject to the ethical standards of those in that profession. As the trial court noted, from 1982 to 1993, Federico was engaged in a public accounting practice. From October, 1993, to December, 1994, he worked in a dual capacity, as one of Elm City\u2019s employees, and also serving the company, as well as other clients, as an accountant. He remained the president and a 98 percent shareholder of Federico and Company, a firm engaged in the practice of public accounting. Accordingly, the trial court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that Federico was not engaged in the practice of public accounting. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defendants\u2019 argument was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\"> Federico\u2019s testimony on this point is telling, particularly in light of the fact that the \u201cindependent economic value\u201d requirement contained in \u00a7 1 (4) (i) of the federal Uniform Trade Secrets Act; see 1 R. Milgrim, supra, \u00a7 1.01 [2], p. 1-29; which is identical to the analogous language in \u00a7 35-51 (d) (1), has been interpreted as a codification of the common-law requirement that a trade secret must give its owner a competitive advantage. See Restatement (Third), Unfair Competition, Appropriation of Trade Values \u00a7 39, p. 445, reporters\u2019 note (1995), citing <em>Electro-Craft Corp. </em>v. <em>Controlled Motion, Inc., </em>332 N.W.2d 890, 900 (Minn. 1983); see also <em>ISC-Bunker Ramo Corp. </em>v. <em>Altech, Inc., </em>765 F. Sup. 1310, 1333 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (even slight competitive edge satisfies \u201ceconomic value\u201d requirement); accord <em>Telerate Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Caro, </em>689 F. Sup. 221, 232 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (same). Because Lomar\u2019s plan, which Federico testified gave the company a competitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>advantage, mirrors Elm City\u2019s plan, it is manifest that Elm City\u2019s plan likewise had a competitive advantage, particularly before Lomar duplicated it for its own use. Under the reasoning of the cases cited in this footnote, therefore, Elm City's plan meets the independent economic value requirement of \u00a7 35-51 (d) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> Moreover, Weinstein testified that, because of Lomar\u2019s purchase of returned milk from the same suppliers used by Elm City, Elm City\u2019s supply of the milk has decreased dramatically. Weinstein testified further that he received a telephone call from one of Elm City\u2019s main suppliers who stated that Elm City\u2019s supply of returned milk would be reduced significantly because the bulk of the milk would be going to a new business in Providence, Rhode Island, which is where Lomar is located. According to Weinstein, without adequate access to this crucial ingredient, Elm City would be unable to produce enough of its product to meet its customers\u2019 needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\"> As noted previously, we need not address the two alternate grounds for affirmance advanced by Elm City based upon CUTPA violations and breach of fiduciary duly, respectively. likewise, we need not consider the defendants\u2019 argument that these alternate grounds provide an insufficient basis upon which to affirm the judgment of the trial court, in light of the trial court\u2019s finding that the trade secrets act provides the exclusive remedy for the conduct at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b108-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 35-53 provides in its entirety: \u201cDamages.

Although the trial court did not make detailed findings with respect to his resignation, Federico\u2019s own testimony, which supports the trial court\u2019s finding of wilful and malicious intent, included the following information. After decades of friendship with the Weinsteins, and approximately twelve years of professional association with Elm City and the Weinsteins, Federico resigned without warning, giving the Weinsteins no advance notice, and without making any provision for a replacement to assume his accounting duties. In fact, only days before, Federico had expressly assured Weinstein that he would remain with Elm City, despite their then recent disagreements. Within two business days of receiving a check reflecting gross pay of $227,133.29, Federico resigned as vice president of Elm City, as Elm City\u2019s accountant and as the Weinsteins\u2019 personal accountant. Federico handed his letters of resignation to Weinstein on the day that the Weinsteins were leaving on a vacation. The foregoing demonstrates the ill will Federico felt toward Weinstein and bolsters the trial court\u2019s finding that Federico acted wilfully and maliciously.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\"> Citing <em>Triangle Sheet Metal Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>supra, 154 Conn. 116, the defendants opine that this court has reversed an award of punitive damages on facts more compelling than those of the present case. In that case, the trial court had awarded punitive damages when one of the defendants had breached a written confident iality/trade secret agreement. This court affirmed the finding of a trade secret violation; id., 126; but reversed with respect to the punitive damages award. Id., 128. We note, however, that whether the facts in that case are more compelling than those in the present one is not as clear as the defendants assert. The record in the present case paints a compelling picture of an abuse of trust that the trial court reasonably could have found to be the result of improper motives, indicating wilful and malicious animus.</p>\n<p id=\"A4l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Moreover, given the highly fact-specific nature of this inquiry, in light of the deference we are obligated to give to the trial court\u2019s finding, we believe that this court\u2019s reversal of an award of punitive damages, under the specific facts of <em>Triangle Sheet Metal Works, Inc., </em>is not controlling in the trial court\u2019s or this court\u2019s determination of whether, <em>under the specific facts of this case, </em>the trial court\u2019s award of punitive damages was a clear abuse of discretion. In other words, the fact that this court reversed on the damages issue in <em>Triangle Sheet Metal Works, Inc., does not </em>necessarily dictate that we must do so in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b114-6\"> The defendants argue that, even if an injunction is proper, this court should vacate the trial court\u2019s injunction and remand the matter to that court with instructions to clarify the injunction \u201cto make clear that [the] defendants are not restricted from using customer information, or other information about [Elm City\u2019s] cheesemaking process that [Elm City] never claimed as unique or proprietary.\u201d Such a clarification is unnecessary. The injunction is clear. It properly prohibits the defendants from using customer identity only with respect to the sale of parmesan-style cheese for use as filler in those customers\u2019 products. As noted in the text of this opinion, the defendants are not prohibited from selling other kinds of cheeses to those same customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b115-10\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the majority that the cheese drying process and unique business of the named plaintiff, Elm City Cheese Company, Inc. (Elm City), constitutes covered \u201cinformation, including a . . . method . . .

Co. </em>v. <em>Loika, </em>145 Conn. 509, 515, 144 A.2d 306 (1958), and the majority in this case recognizes, Elm City\u2019s use of return milk, its supplier and customer lists, and the unique process used to quickly dry the cheese product, catering to a niche market, gave it the \u201cability to combine these elements into a successful. . . process, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the creation of a recipe from common cooking ingredients, [and] is a trade secret entitled to protection.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) This, however, is only the first statutory requirement necessary to qualify as a trade secret. The trade secrets act also requires that the information upon which a claim is made must be \u201cthe subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-51 (d) (2). There is not a scintilla of evidence to support that essential requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Elm City failed to take very basic, common measures to ensure the secrecy of its business methods and practices. The plaintiff Richard Weinstein,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> co-owner and president of Elm City, testified that he neither required the named defendant, Mark Federico- \u2014 or any other employee \u2014 to sign a confidentiality agreement or covenant not to compete, nor did Elm City\u2019s employee manual make any reference to the confidential nature of the business. Elm City also failed to take any precautions to shield the production process from visitors to the plant. Finally, Elm City did not use unnamed or coded ingredients. Similar failures to preserve secrecy have resulted in courts declining to extend trade secret protection. See, e.g., <em>Pressure Science, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>413 F. Sup. 618, 626-28 (D. Conn. 1976); <em>Wilson Certified Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fairbury Food Products, Inc., </em>370 F. Sup. 1081, 1085-86 (D. Neb. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">What is frightening about the majority opinion is that this case will make it virtually impossible for an employee to leave his employment and establish a competing business in situations where the employer never considered that its process was a trade secret even though the employee is not bound by a contractual obligation not to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Although, in my view, the trade secrets claim must fail, Elm City is not left without legal redress for Federico\u2019s deplorable conduct. Federico had a \u201cspecial relationship of confidence or trust\u201d with Weinstein and Elm City. <em>Holiday Food Co. </em>v. <em>Munroe, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 546, 553, 426 A.2d 814 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Indeed, it is apparent to me that the main thrust of Elm City\u2019s case was its first count for breach of a fiduciary obligation and its third count for violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. As the trial court found, \u201c[although Federico may have learned some aspects of Elm City\u2019s methods of production . . . while an employee, all the important, intricate components of Elm City\u2019s business became fully known to Federico when he served as a [certified public accountant] for Elm City and [its owners].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Whether in his capacity as a certified public accountant or in the broader confidant capacity that Federico served in as vice president and heir apparent at Elm City, as the trial court found, a fiduciary relationship obviously existed and Federico breached the duty of loyalty to the plaintiffs. \u201cRather than attempt to define a fiduciary relationship in precise detail and in such a manner to exclude new situations, we have instead chosen to leave the bars down for situations in which there is a justifiable trust confided on one side and a resulting . . . influence on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dunham </em>v.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion upholding the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff, Elm City Cheese Company, Inc. (Elm City), was entitled to trade secret protection. The majority relies on the following factors to entitle Elm City to trade secret protection for its cheesemaking operation \u201cas a whole\u201d: (1) its purchase of returned milk from a number of dairies; (2) its production from that milk of hard grated cheese filler through a unique process; and (3) its sale of that filler to only three cheesemakers to blend into their cheeses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">To qualify as a trade secret under General Statutes \u00a7 35-51 (d), the information in question must be \u201csecret\u201d and \u201cthe subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d \u201c[E]mployee access to trade secrets is not inconsistent with . . . secrecy. But employees having such access should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>carefully cautioned as to the trade secret status of matters on which they work.\u201d 1 R. Milgrim, Trade Secrets (1999) \u00a7 1.04, pp. 1-190 through 1-191. \u201cAlthough it is not essential that the proprietor have exclusive possession of the information, a substantial element of secrecy must exist, to the extent that there would be difficulty in acquiring the information except by the use of improper means.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Robert S. Weiss &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wiederlight, </em>208 Conn. 525, 538, 546 A.2d 216 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Improper acquisition of trade secrets includes \u201ctheft, fraud, unauthorized interception of communications, inducement of or knowing participation in a breach of confidence, and other means either wrongful in themselves or wrongful under the circumstances of the case. Independent discovery and analysis of publicly available products or information are not improper means of acquisition.\u201d Restatement (Third), Unfair Competition, Appropriation of Trade Values \u00a7 43 (1995). \u201cThe factors used to determine whether given information is a trade secret include the extent to which the information is known outside the business and by employees and others involved in the business, the measures taken by the employer to guard the secrecy of the information, the information\u2019s value to the employer and to competitors, the resources the employer expends in developing the information, and the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others <em>.\"Robert, S. Weiss &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wiederlight, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 538. \u201cMatters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry cannot be appropriated by one as his secret.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country House &amp; Homes Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>150 Conn. 314, 318, 189 A.2d 390 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Under these principles, the purchase of returned milk from a number of dairies does not constitute a trade secret. It is well known that cheese is made from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>pressed curds of milk. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, p'. 382. A curd is produced when part of the milk is treated with rennet and sometimes fermented. P. Montagn\u00e9, The New Larousse Gastronomique (1977) p. 208. \u201cFrom the earliest times cheese has been made in stock-rearing countries to use up surplus milk.\u201d Id., p. 207. Elm City is hardly entitled to trade secret protection for such a practice. It would also be surprising if very young children could not identify milk wholesalers and dairies as suppliers of milk. That stale milk, no longer having retail value, would be cheaper to purchase than fresh milk is also common knowledge. Moreover, there was no evidence before the trial court that Elm City did anything to safeguard the business practice of purchasing returned milk with which to make cheese. Elm City, in fact, had no restrictive agreement with any employee about anything.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the purchase of returned milk from a number of dairies does not qualify as a trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">With regard to the method of production of exclusively hard grated cheese filler, there was evidence that the techniques used to produce the cheese without creating a noxious odor and the use of air conditioning to speed the fermentation process may not be known commonly. Elm City, however, did nothing to keep its contractor\u2019s inventions a secret, if indeed it could have done so in the absence of an agreement with the inventor. Furthermore, the inventor described the system at length at a public hearing before the department of environmental protection, and Elm City described this system in a pleading it filed with that department. Elm City did not request that the document be filed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>seal. This production method, therefore, cannot be considered a trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Finally, Elm City\u2019s sale of its product exclusively to three cheesemakers is not a trade secret. \u201cThere is no trade secret ... if [information] can readily be ascertained through ordinary business channels or reference resources.\u201d <em>Robert S. Weiss Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wiederlight, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 538. \u201c[W]here the identity of the customers is readily ascertainable through ordinary business channels or through classified business or trade directories, the courts refuse to accord to the list the protection of a trade secret.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country House &amp; Homes Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 320. The identity of those who sell cheese containing the filler produced by Elm City could be ascertained easily through a visit to the grocer or the Italian deli. Here again, Elm City did nothing to protect the \u201csecrecy\u201d of the identity of its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Because none of the three factors relied upon by the majority constitutes a trade secret alone or in combination, the information taken \u201cas a whole\u201d or in an \u201coverall way\u201d does not merit trade secret protection. As the majority admits, it is \u201cnot saying, however, that each and eveiy component is necessarily a trade secret in and of itself . . . .\u201d The character of some nonsecret information does not change simply because it may be presented together with other nonsecret information. It is impossible to add three zeros and reach a sum greater than zero. See J. King, The Art of Mathematics (1992) p. 63. There could be no evidence that buying returned milk to make cheese, combined with selling cheese fillers to cheese manufacturers would be a trade secret. The \u201ctrade secret\u201d protected by the majority is a true example of what Robert Milgrim, in his leading text, describes as \u201cprotection of the business rather than [of] \u2018secrets\u2019 \u201d where the \u201csecret\u201d information is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201call-embracing with reference to any given enterprise . . . .\u201d 1 R. Milgrim, supra, \u00a7 1.09 (8) (d), p. 1-470.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">After concluding that Elm City is entitled to trade secret protection, the trial court enjoined the defendants Mark Federico and Lomar Foods, Inc., for aperiod of <em>three years </em>from, among other things, (1) developing or utilizing any information as to the manufacturing process and drying and odor control processes and equipment for the cheese produced by Elm City, (2) contracting with or divulging the identity of Elm City\u2019s customers and (3) directly or indirectly selling any cheese product made like Elm City\u2019s.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a trade secret case, the injunction should not be for a limited period of time unless the court finds that, in that time, the trade secrets would cease to exist. The remedy prescribed by Connecticut\u2019s Uniform Trade Secrets Act provides: \u201cActual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined upon application to any court of competent jurisdiction. An injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-52 (a). The three year limit on the injunction suggests that there are no trade secrets to be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In sum, there can be no trade secrets in Elm City\u2019s production methods or lists of suppliers and customers. Any other conclusion, as Justice Berdon points out, would turn employment with any industry into a universal contract not to compete and would completely restrict the rights of a former employee to use knowledge legitimately gained during employment. American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>law, up to date, recognizes no such wide-sweeping view of trade secrets for those activities. Trade secret law should not only encourage innovation but also maintain \u201c \u2018the public interest in having free and open competition in the manufacture and sale of unpatented goods.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pepsico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>54 F.3d 1262, 1268 (7th Cir. 1995), quoting 2 M. Jager, Trade Secrets Law (Rev. Ed. 1994) \u00a7 IL.03. \u201cUpon termination of the agency [relationship] . . . and in the absence of a restrictive agreement, the agent can properly compete with his principal in matters for which he had been employed. Thus, before the end of his employment, he can properly purchase a rival business and upon termination of employment immediately compete.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Town &amp; Country House &amp; Homes Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 317. \u201cAn employee has a right to grow with his experience, and he can carry away for general use his skill and everything that he has learned at his place of employment, except trade secrets.\u201d A.B.A., Trade Secrets: A State-by-State Survey (A. Pedowitz &amp; R. Sikkel eds., 1997) p. 147; see 2 Restatement (Second), Agency \u00a7 396, comments (b) and (h) (1958). Because Elm City\u2019s production methods and customer lists were not trade secrets, Federico was entitled to use them in his new business to compete with his former employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">I fully agree with the opinions of the majority and Justice Berdon, however, as to the trial court\u2019s well reasoned and sound conclusion that Federico violated his fiduciary duty as an accountant with respect to Elm City. The trial court did not award damages for the accountant-client confidentiality breach because the court found Elm City\u2019s exclusive remedy to be under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The trial court thereby did not distinguish between the information Federico learned as Elm City\u2019s accountant and that which he learned in his role as the operations manager. In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>circumstances, fairness requires a new trial on the issues of liability and damages for the breach of accountant-client confidentiality. See <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>209 Conn. 450, 455, 551 A.2d 1227 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\"> I would conclude that whether the named defendant, Mark Federico, learned any of this information in his capacity as Elm City\u2019s accountant is relevant only in considering a claim of breach of fiduciary duty and is of no consequence in determining if a trade secret exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\"> Elm City attempted to justify the lack of an agreement with other employees by arguing that the majority of its employees over the years have spoken English as a second language.

I find this excuse unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> The only injunction that the trial court issued without the time limit was a prohibition on using any records Federico used or prepared for Elm City while he was acting as its accountant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
