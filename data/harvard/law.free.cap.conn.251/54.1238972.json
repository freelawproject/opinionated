Cox, </em>50 Conn. App. 175, 176-77, 718 A.2d 60 (1998). The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments and affirmed his conviction. Id. We granted certification, limited to the following issues: (1) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>a sufficient evidentiary basis for the trial court\u2019s instruction on flight or consciousness of guilt?\u201d and (2) \u201cIf the answer to the first question is no, was the error harmful?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>247 Conn. 928, 719 A.2d 1170 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Having examined the record on appeal, studied the briefs and heard the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed. The issue on which we granted certification was properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive opinion of the Appellate Court. See, e.g., <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Burger King Corp., </em>244 Conn. 204, 206, 707 A.2d 30 (1998); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Buonato, </em>241 Conn. 319, 321-22, 696 A.2d 320 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of assault in the second degree when ... (2) with intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument other than by means of the discharge of a firearm . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
