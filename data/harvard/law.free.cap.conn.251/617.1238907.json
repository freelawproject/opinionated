After rejecting an earlier plea agreement between the defendant and the state, the court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea of nolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>contendere on June 28, 1991, and rendered judgment thereon. The defendant subsequently filed a motion to vacate the 1991 judgment and to withdraw his plea on November 4, 1997. The issue to be resolved in this appeal is whether Public Acts 1997, No. 97-256, \u00a7 6 (P.A. 97-256), which amended General Statutes \u00a7 54-1j<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by, inter alia, limiting the time within which a defendant may move to vacate a judgment and withdraw a plea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>should be applied retroactively to crimes committed prior to October 1,1997, the effective date of the amendment. We conclude that, in enacting P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, the legislature clearly intended to apply such time limit retroactively. Therefore, because the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and withdraw his plea was filed six years after the judgment was rendered, his motion is barred by the three year statute of limitations established by P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The record discloses the following relevant facts. On November 18, 1990, the defendant was the driver of a car that was involved in a motor vehicle accident. That accident caused the death of one of his passengers. The defendant was charged with, inter aha, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 53a-56b. A test of the defendant\u2019s blood performed at a hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>after the accident revealed that the defendant had a blood alcohol level of 0.161 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">On May 3, 1991, the defendant attempted to plead guilty to the charge of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle. During the plea canvass, the trial court informed the defendant of the potential effect of a guilty plea on his immigration status by stating: \u201cYou know if you are not a citizen of the United States, when you plead guilty to a charge such as this, a felony charge, you leave yourself open to the possibility of deportation from the United States.\u201d The defendant responded yes. The trial court, however, subsequently rejected that plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">On June 28, 1991, both the state and the defendant reappeared before the trial court with a revised plea agreement. At the June 28 plea canvass, the court failed to advise the defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 54-lj (a), of the consequences that his plea could have on his immigration status. The court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere to the charge of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle, rendered a judgment of conviction and sentenced him to eight years incarceration, suspended after five years, followed by three years probation with special conditions. The state nolled all other remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">On November 4, 1997, the defendant filed a motion to vacate the 1991 judgment and withdraw his plea of nolo contendere on the ground that, during its plea canvass on June 28, 1991, the trial court had failed to inform him of the possible consequences that his plea could have on his immigration status, as required by \u00a7 54-lj (a). On July 20, 1998, the trial court concluded that P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, amended \u00a7 54-lj by limiting the time within which a defendant can move to withdraw his or her plea pursuant to \u00a7 54-lj to three years from the date of the court\u2019s acceptance of the plea. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>court further found that the statute of limitations was procedural in nature and, therefore, applied retroactively. Because more than three years had passed between June 28, 1991, when the court had accepted the defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere, and November 4, 1997, when the defendant had filed his motion to vacate the judgment and withdraw his plea, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. Subsequently, the defendant appealed the denial of his motion to the Appellate Court, and this court transferred the appeal to itself pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">METHOD OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">As the parties recognize, whether P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, applies retroactively is a question of law to which this court gives plenary review. E.g., <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 318, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997) (employing plenary standard of review to determine whether statute of limitations applies retroactively). Generally, \u201c[i]n construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 195, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In this case, rather than employing the normal means of statutory interpretation, the defendant argues in his brief that P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, should not be given retroactive application \u201cabsent language demonstrating a clear legislative intent\u201d for such application. By the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>\u201cabsent language,\u201d we assume that the defendant means absent <em>statutory </em>language. Thus, the defendant appears to argue that P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, may have retroactive application only if the words of the public act itself indicate that the legislature intended such retroactive application, without resorting to its legislative history.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state, in contrast, argues that we should examine the public act\u2019s legislative history in determining whether the legislature intended P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, to apply retroactively. For reasons we discuss hereinafter, we conclude that it is proper to look beyond the words of the public act and to examine its legislative history in determining whether the legislature intended P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, to apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We begin our analysis by noting that, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 353, 456 A.2d 305 (1983), this court looked solely to the language of the statute it was construing, and not to the statute\u2019s legislative history, in determining whether a statute of limitations applied retroactively. In <em>Paradise, </em>the state argued that an amendment that extended the time within which certain felonies could be prosecuted applied retroactively to the defendants. The court in <em>Paradise </em>held that, because the statute\u2019s language did not \u201cclearly necessitate] \u201d a retrospective application of the amendment, none would be given. Id. The court reasoned: \u201cLegislative intent is to be found in the language of the statute. . . . There is nothing in [the statute at issue] which indicates a clear legislative intent that the statute have a retrospective effect. Certainly there is no language whatsoever which makes a retrospective construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>necessary. <em>State </em>v. Jones, [132 Conn. 682, 685, 47 A.2d 185 (1946)]. . . . <em>[CJriminal statutes are not to be accorded retrospective effect absent language clearly necessitating such a construction </em>. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State v. </em>Paradise, supra, 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Thus, the court\u2019s reliance upon the holding in <em>Jones </em>that, \u201cin a criminal case a retrospective construction of a statute should not be adopted unless its language clearly makes such a construction necessary\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 352, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 132 Conn. 685; makes clear that the court in <em>Paradise </em>was holding that a criminal statute\u2019s language, not merely its legislative history, must necessitate a retrospective construction in order for one to be given. The court noted in <em>Paradise </em>that the rationale behind its holding was \u201cgrounded in the principle that criminal statutes must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We agree with the defendant that <em>Paradise </em>created a bright line rule on \u201cmatters involving the statutory construction of criminal statutes\u201d; id., 353 n.5; namely, that the language of the statute itself must clearly necessitate a retrospective construction for one to be given. However, the breadth of the holding in <em>Paradise, </em>and, therefore, its application to this case, is limited in two important ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">First, the court expressly noted in <em>Paradise </em>that its holding that \u201ccriminal statutes are not to be accorded retrospective effect absent language clearly necessitating such a construction\u201d; id., 353; was limited. The court wrote: \u201cThe civil-criminal distinction enunciated in <em>Jones </em>and affirmed herein, is not necessarily applicable to other areas of the criminal process. Our holding [in Paradise] extends solely to matters involving the statutory construction of criminal statutes.\u201d Id., 353 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Second, this court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 678 A.2d 462 (1996), made clear that there are instances in which neither <em>Paradise </em>nor <em>Jones </em>prevents this court from considering the legislative history of a criminal statute in determining whether such a statute should be applied retroactively. In <em>In re Daniel II., </em>we determined whether a statutory amendment eliminating the right to an immediate appeal from an order transferring a juvenile matter to the regular criminal docket applied retroactively. Id., 366-67. While we specifically held that the statutory amendment at issue was a criminal statute that affected substantive rights; see generally id., 373-76; we, nonetheless, looked to its legislative history to determine whether the amendment should be applied retroactively. Id., 376. Thus, we did not limit our analysis to a determination of whether the language of the amendment clearly necessitated a retrospective application, but, rather, used the normal tools of statutory construction to determine the legislature\u2019s intent on the issue of retroactive application of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Thus, we agree with the defendant that <em>Paradise </em>stands for the proposition that, for certain types of criminal statutes, such as a statute of limitations for the prosecution of a crime, the language of the statute must \u201cclearly necessitate] \u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 353; a retrospective application in order for one to be given.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the state, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>footnote 5 of <em>Paradise </em>and the holding in <em>In re Daniel H. </em>make clear that statutes affecting \u201cother areas of the criminal process\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 353 n.5; may be given retrospective effect if the legislative history evinces a clear and unequivocal intent for such a retrospective application. Id.; <em>see In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 376 (holding that substantive criminal statute could not be applied retrospectively because there was \u201cnothing ... in the language or the legislative history\u201d that was \u201ca clear and unequivocal expression of legislative intent\u201d to rebut presumption of prospective application only).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Our task, then, is to determine whether P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, covers one of those \u201cother areas of the criminal process\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 353 n.5; to which the holding of <em>Paradise </em>does not extend. We hold that, for reasons discussed hereinafter, this case is governed by the method of statutory interpretation employed by this court in <em>In re Daniel H. </em>See generally <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Public Act 97-256, \u00a7 6, affects an area of the criminal process far removed from the actual criminal conduct for which the defendant originally was charged. For example, P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, does not change the elements of the crime with which the defendant was charged, alter the elements of his defense to that crime or make more burdensome the punishment for that crime, after its commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unlike that in <em>Paradise </em>or <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Crowell, </em>228 Conn. 393, 636 A.2d 804 (1994); see footnote 6 of this opinion; the legislation at issue in this case does not affect the period of time within which the defendant was susceptible to prosecution for his conduct. Therefore, the proper test for determining whether P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, should be applied retroactively is whether the language of P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, or its legislative history, indicates that the legislature clearly and unequivocally intended for the statute to apply retroactively. See <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">APPLICATION OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Although we have determined that we are not limited solely to the language of P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, in determining whether it should be applied retroactively, we, nevertheless, begin our search for the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the words of the statute itself. E.g., <em>Peabody N.E., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>250 Conn. 105, 122, 735 A.2d 782 (1999). Section 6 of P.A. 97-256 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere from any defendant in any criminal proceeding unless the court advises him of the following: \u2018If you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\u201c(c) If the court fails to advise a defendant as required in subsection (a) of this section and the defendant not later than three years after the acceptance of the plea shows that his plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences, the court, on the defendant\u2019s motion, shall vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and enter a plea of not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">As the state concedes, P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, on its face, is ambiguous with respect to whether it is to be applied retroactively. The legislative history surrounding the enactment of P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, however, clearly and unequivocally demonstrates a legislative intent to apply this statute of limitations retroactively.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The strongest evidence of such intent came during a debate over the bill that later became P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, on the floor of the House of Representatives, in which one legislator expressed his concerns over possible retroactive application to one of the bill\u2019s sponsors. Representative Robert Farr stated: \u201cI guess to Representative [Michael P.] Lawlor, my understanding of what\u2019s going on out there now is that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is now going through records and finding people <em>who have been convicted years ago </em>and starting to deport them. I guess my concern with this language would be that somebody who might have pleaded guilty to a drug type of situation, in many cases not knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the consequences, it might have been a simple possession of marijuana. It might have been some other charge for which they did not understand the consequences, <em>it might have been ten years ago. </em>If the [Immigration and Naturalization Service] now picks that up, and they didn\u2019t understand the consequences, I am not sure why we want to say that [if] they weren\u2019t informed, that they only have three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">\u201cThrough you, Mr. Speaker to Representative Lawlor, I am not sure why justice would suggest that we ought to be doing this.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 40 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13, 1997 Sess., pp. 4700-4701.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Thus, Representative Farr clearly contemplated that the proposed amendment to \u00a7 54-lj would apply retroactively, and expressed his concern over such application. In response, Representative Lawlor did not dispute that the proposed amendment would apply retroactively. Rather, he noted that there was a practical reason for such retroactive application: \u201c[Apparently a practical problem that has cropped up is that in some courts it\u2019s been difficult to obtain the records of exactly <em>what happened years and years ago, </em>whether or not defendants were in fact advised and <em>this would eliminate that problem.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 4701.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Clearly, Representative Lawlor also envisioned that the proposed amendment would have retroactive effect. Otherwise, the statute would not \u201celiminate [the] problem\u201d of potentially improper plea canvasses in cases that happened \u201cyears and years ago.\u201d Id. Thus, one of the express purposes of P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, necessitates retrospective application. Because \u201c[i]t is well settled that statutory construction involves a reasoned search for the legislature\u2019s intent . . . including the purpose and policies behind [the statute\u2019s] enactment\u201d; <em>Hartford Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Allen-Bradley Co., </em>250 Conn. 334, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>346, 736 A.2d 824 (1999); our conclusion that P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, should be given retroactive effect is further supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Representative Lawlor also pointed out that the \u201clanguage [of the proposed amendment to \u00a7 54-lj] would not prohibit a court from re-opening a case and allowing a person to essentially re-negotiate [his or her] plea agreement. This simply modifies language which requires a court to do so. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u201cSo ... in the event that there were a compelling case, nothing that we are doing here today would prohibit a court from reconsidering it. We are just eliminating^ \u2014 we are limiting the mandatory re-opening to a window of three years.\u201d 40 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 4701.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Representative Farr responded: \u201cI\u2019ll take Representative Lawlor\u2019s representation that the court would still have the power to re-open these cases and withdraw any objection.\u201d Id., pp. 4701-4702.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Thus, on the floor of the House of Representatives, two representatives clearly and unequivocally stated that they understood that the proposed amendment to \u00a7 54-lj would apply retroactively. Furthermore, the value of these statements in determining the intent of the legislature is heightened by the fact that this understanding that the law would apply retroactively came both from a representative who expressed concerns over the bill and one of the bill\u2019s sponsors. See <em>Haroco, Inc. </em>v. <em>American National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago, </em>747 F.2d 384, 390 (7th Cir. 1984), aff'd, 473 U.S. 606, 105 S. Ct. 3291, 87 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1985) (fact that both supporters and opponents of bill interpreted proposed legislation similarly is indication of legislative intent); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Ed. Singer 1992) \u00a7 48.13, p. 356 (\u201cfederal courts hold that statements by any members during legislative debates may be considered in the interpretation of a statute where they show a common agreement in the legislature about the meaning of an ambiguous provision\u201d); cf. <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 395-97, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998) (statements by bill\u2019s sponsor made legislative intent clear).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In addition to this exchange, Representative Lawlor, in urging the bill\u2019s passage, noted that the bill \u201cwould close a wide loop hole available to convicted offenders in order to obtain a new trial\u201d by responding to the growing problem of defendants seeking to withdraw their pleas many years after they had been entered. 40 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 4699-4700. Representative Lawlor also noted that the bill \u201celiminates a problem that was cropping up on the appellate level in certain cases\u201d; id., p. 4698; and that the bill was \u201csuggested in the aftermath of several cases where there was an unfortunate result in a pending criminal case.\u201d Id., p. 4699.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">These statements strengthen the conclusion that the legislature intended P.A. 97-256, \u00a7 6, to apply retroactively so as to close what legislators perceived as a \u201cwide loop hole\u201d; id., p. 4700; and eliminate \u201cunfortunate result[s].\u201d Id., p. 4699. Any interpretation that applies the statute only prospectively would allow this wide loophole to continue in spite of the legislators\u2019 understanding that the bill would apply to defendants who were \u201cconvicted years ago . . . [even] ten years ago\u201d; id., p. 4700, remarks of Representative Farr; on the basis of plea canvasses that happened \u201cyears and years ago.\u201d Id., p. 4701, remarks of Representative Lawlor. We decline to interpret the statute so as to lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>to this bizarre and unintended result. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 437, 668 A.2d 348 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In this opinion MCDONALD, C.

The majority, contrary to our established principles of law, applies retroactively a legislative enactment, Public Acts 1997, No. 97-256, \u00a7 6 (1997 amendment), which limits the time in which a judgment may be vacated and a defendant be allowed to withdraw a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 352, 456 A.2d 305 (1983), this court put the legislature on notice that we had reaffirmed the bright fine rule enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>132 Conn. 682, 685, 47 A.2d 185 (1946), that \u201cin a criminal case a retrospective construction of a statute should not be adopted unless its language clearly makes such a construction necessary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In addition to the constitutional implications of such ex post facto laws,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the prospective statutory construction rule is grounded in this court\u2019s long-standing principles \u201cthat criminal statutes must be strictly construed . . . [and] must be liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 352. Indeed, the majority ignores the fact that not long after <em>Jones </em>was decided by this court, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which provides: \u201cNo provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be <em>construed </em>to have a retrospective effect.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Furthermore, the majority opinion is bewildering. It hangs its hat on footnote 5 of <em>Paradise, </em>which provides: \u201cThe civil-criminal distinction enunciated in <em>Jones </em>and affirmed herein, is not necessarily applicable to other areas of the criminal process. Our holding [of prospective application] extends solely to matters involving the statutory construction of criminal statutes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 353 n.5. That is precisely what we have here \u2014 a question of statutory construction of whether the legislature intended that the 1997 amendment have retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In <em>Jones </em>and <em>Paradise, </em>the court did not reference the legislative history of the amendments in question, but, rather, concluded that the statutory language must clearly indicate that it is to be retroactively applied. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 352; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 132 Conn. 685. The majority in the present case relies on our decision in <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 678 A.2d 462 (1996). But <em>In re Daniel H. </em>made clear the following: \u201cIn criminal cases, to determine whether a change in the law applies to a defendant, we generally have applied the law in existence on the date of the offense, regardless of its procedural or substantive nature. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 283, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) (relying on date of offense in retroactivity analysis of change in law ultimately found to be procedural); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>[supra, 132 Conn. 684-85] (application of statute requiring court in certain pending cases to order examination of defendant for venereal disease, enacted after date of offense but prior to arrest, would impermissibly give it retroactive effect); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Millhouse, </em>3 Conn. App. 497, 501, 490 A.2d 517 (1985) (in construing penal statute to determine whether application is retroactive, date of crime controls). In fact, we recently have rejected an argument analogous to the argument made by the state in the present case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>228 Conn. 393, 636 A.2d 804 (1994). In <em>Crowell, </em>the state had contended that to apply a revised statute of limitations, which the legislature had extended from five years to seven years, to a defendant who allegedly had committed a child sexual abuse offense less than five years prior to the revision, would not constitute a retroactive application. Id., 398. Specifically, the state had argued that, although the change had been made after the date of the offense, it had occurred prior to the expiration of the original five year period and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s right to a statute of limitations defense had never vested. Id. We rejected this approach and, relying on the date on which the offense was committed, concluded that to apply the seven year statute of limitations to the defendant would constitute a retroactive application of the law. Id., 401. Similarly, in the present case, to determine whether applying the 1994 amendment to the respondents would constitute retroactive application of the amendment, we look to the law in effect on the date of their alleged offenses. We conclude that to apply the 1994 amendment to the respondents would constitute a retroactive application. Accordingly, we conclude that the 1994 amendment does not apply to juveniles charged with crimes that occurred prior to its effective date.\u201d <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 377-78. Additionally, this court previously has held that \u201c[w]e presume that the legislature is aware of the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>construction placed upon its enactments. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, [352] put the legislature on notice that if it intends that a criminal statute of limitations should apply retrospectively, it must make that intent clear.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>supra, 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">I must concede that the opinions in <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 364, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 393, included references to \u201clegislative history.\u201d In neither case, however, did the analysis of the court turn on an interpretation of the legislative history, but, rather, depended on the express language of the statutory enactment. Nevertheless, even if the vague legislative history is to be considered in this case, it could not pass the clear intention requirement of <em>Jones, Paradise, Crowell </em>and <em>In re Daniel H.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Not one legislator expressed the view that the limitation period at issue in this case was intended to have retroactive effect. The majority\u2019s disingenuous construction lifts phrases such as \u201cconvicted years ago\u201d or \u201cten years ago\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the legislative history and places them in a contrived context to support its conclusion. Not one exchange among the legislators, however, when contextually examined, offers even a glimmer of support for the proposition that the legislature clearly intended that the 1997 amendment was to apply retrospectively. The legislative history indicates only that the general purpose of the amendment was clear \u2014 to close an apparent loophole in the statute. That history does not indicate the legislature clearly intended the amendment was to apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Therefore, I can conclude only that the majority\u2019s opinion is result oriented.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\"> Justice Norcott cogently set forth in <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 376 n.10, 678 A.2d 462 (1996): \u201cOur conclusion that [the 1994 amendment, which eliminated the right to an immediate appeal from a court order transferring a juvenile matter to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court (1994 amendment)] applies prospectively only is also supported by the canon of statutory construction that instructs us to read statutes to avoid, rather than to create, constitutional questions. <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 534, 613 A.2d 748 (1992). In the present case, a retroactive application of the 1994 amendment would raise significant concerns about the amendment\u2019s constitutionality insofar as it arguably makes the punishment for a crime more burdensome after its commission and, therefore, might be found to be an ex post facto law under <em>Collins </em>v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 110 S. Ct. 2715, 111 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1990).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\"><em> Paradise, Crowell </em>and <em>In re Daniel H., </em>have their roots firmly planted in <em>Jones, </em>wherein this court stated: \u201cThe application of [the amended statute] in this case would give it a retrospective effect The court\u2019s refusal to apply the act was correct. There is nothing in this legislation which indicates any intent on the part of the legislature to give it such operation, and an act is never given retrospective effect unless its terms absolutely require it. <em>Bridgeport v. Greenwich, </em>116 Conn. 537, 543, 165 [A.] 797 [1933]. <em>In Bryant </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>118 Conn. 233, 238, 171 [A.] 664 [1934], we said that a law will not be given retrospective effect unless the legislature has manifested that intent \u2018by very plain and explicit words.\u2019 In <em>Massa </em>v. <em>Nastri, </em>125 Conn. 144, 146, 3 [A.2d] 839 [1939], we said that laws are to be interpreted as operating prospectively and considered as furnishing a rule for future cases only, \u2018unless they contain language unequivocally and certainly embracing past transactions.\u2019 It is true that the cases cited above are civil cases. There are apparently few criminal cases where the rule has been applied, probably because they usually turn on the claim that a statute, if applied retrospectively, would be invalid as an ex post facto law. In Crawford, Statutory Construction, p. 573, it is said that in a criminal case a retrospective construction of a statute should not be adopted \u2018unless its language clearly makes such a construction necessary.\u2019See. also [59 C.J. 1173, Statutes \u00a7 698(1932)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 132 Conn. 684-85.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
