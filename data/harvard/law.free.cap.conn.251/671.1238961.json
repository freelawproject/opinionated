J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArG\">The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of one count of capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (8) and of two counts of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) the trial court improperly permitted the state to \u201cdeath qualify\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> potential jurors prior to the guilt phase of her trial, thereby denying her right, under the Connecticut constitution, to trial by an impartial jury; (2) the trial court improperly excused a venireperson; and (3) the trial court\u2019s instruction on proximate causation was flawed. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The juiy reasonably could have found the following facts. In 1990, the defendant, Janet Griffin, was employed as a housekeeper at the Pico Resort Hotel in Vermont. Gina Coccia, the executive housekeeper at the hotel, was the defendant\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">The two women became friendly, shared an apartment and subsequently became lovers. In June, 1992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Coccia ended her intimate relationship with the defendant. When Coccia terminated the relationship, the defendant became very upset and told Coccia that she wanted it to continue. Around that same time, Coccia and her father purchased a two-family house in Vermont, and the defendant and Coccia moved into that house. There, the two women continued to share a bedroom, but they did not resume an intimate relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Shortly thereafter, while visiting her aunt, Margaret Pugliese, in Bloomfield, Connecticut, Coccia met one of the victims, Patricia Lynn Steller. Steller resided at 14 Red Orange Road, Middletown. Coccia and Steller became friends, and Coccia subsequently returned to Connecticut several times to see Steller. Steller and Pugliese also visited Coccia in Vermont two or three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In January, 1993, Coccia requested that the defendant move out of their apartment by June, 1993. The defendant became very emotional, and she stated that she still loved Coccia and did not want to leave. Coccia reiterated that their romantic relationship was over and had been over for some period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In April, 1993, Coccia began an intimate relationship with Steller. Although Steller traveled to Vermont to see Coccia on several occasions, she did not stay at the apartment that Coccia shared with the defendant. Instead, Steller stayed at Pugliese\u2019s nearby vacation home. Coccia, in turn, frequently visited Steller and stayed at Steller\u2019s residence at 14 Red Orange Road, Middletown. Coccia did not inform the defendant of the nature of her relationship with Steller.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">In May, 1993, the defendant moved into an apartment owned by Natalie Jurgen. At that time, the defendant and Coccia both were employed by The Woods at Killington, another Vermont resort. Although they no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>were roommates, the two women remained friendly and continued to drive to work together. The defendant, however, repeatedly told Jurgen that she still loved Coccia and that she wanted her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The summer of 1993, Coccia decided to leave Vermont and move to Connecticut to be with Steller. Coccia discussed her plans with the defendant, who became veiy upset. Visibly shaken, the defendant stated that she wanted to resume her relationship with Coccia. The defendant told Coccia that it was all or nothing \u2014 she did not want to speak to Coccia again if Coccia was not willing to resume their intimate relationship. Coccia replied that she was sorry, but if it was all or nothing, it would have to be nothing. The defendant subsequently called Coccia, however, and indicated that she wished them to remain friendly.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">On August 13, 1993, Coccia left Vermont and moved into Steller\u2019s Middletown residence. The second victim, Ronald King, who was Steller\u2019s nephew, also lived at that address. Coccia took her dog, a small Pomeranian, with her when she moved to 14 Red Orange Road. Steller\u2019s house had a \u201cdog door\u201d in the kitchen, a hatch designed to allow the dog to enter and leave the house unassisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Coccia and the defendant remained friendly after Coccia moved to Middletown, and the two women exchanged telephone calls on a regular basis. The defendant, however, resented Steller. On August 23, 1993, she told a coworker that Steller was a \u201ccity slut dyke\u201d and that Steller was more or less holding Coccia captive and ruining Coccia\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">That fall, Coccia and Steller spent two or three weekends at Coccia\u2019s Vermont home. On those occasions, the defendant refused to visit Coccia because she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>not want to see Coccia with Steller. Instead, the defendant insisted that Coccia come alone to the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Coccia and Steller spent the first weekend in October, 1993, in Vermont. Before returning to Connecticut, Coccia informed the defendant that she would no longer visit the defendant alone at the defendant\u2019s apartment and that, if the defendant wished to see Coccia in the future, she would have to do so at Coccia\u2019s home when Steller was present. The defendant replied that she was unsure of what she was capable of doing under those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The next afternoon, Monday, October 4, 1993, the defendant and her daughter, Melody Jasmin, unexpectedly arrived at 14 Red Orange Road, having driven to Middletown in a rented car. The defendant told Coccia that she had been shopping in the Middletown area and had decided to stop for a visit. The real purpose of the visit, however, was to see the inside of Steller\u2019s house. During the visit, while chatting in the kitchen, Coccia told the defendant a story about having been locked out of the house and having had to crawl into the house through the \u201cdog door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">October 4,1993, was not the only time the defendant visited Red Orange Road. The defendant and Jurgen had made four trips to Middletown between August, 1993, and November, 1993. The first trip took place at the end of August, when the defendant asked Jurgen to drive her to Connecticut so that she could see where Coccia and Steller lived. On that trip the defendant planned to use magic marker to write epithets on Steller\u2019s car. It was dark when the defendant and Jurgen arrived at Steller\u2019s house, and the defendant exited Jurgen\u2019s vehicle and approached the house. She returned to Jurgen\u2019s automobile, however, without having written on Steller\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>A few weeks later, the defendant again asked Jurgen to drive her to Middletown. The defendant hoped to see where Steller, who was employed at Wesleyan University, worked. Upon arriving in Middletown, Jurgen drove to Wesleyan University. The defendant located Steller\u2019s car in a parking lot and photographed it. Jurgen then drove the defendant around the area adjacent to Red Orange Road. As they were driving through that neighborhood, the defendant asked Jurgen questions and took notes regarding routes in and out of the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">After their second trip to Connecticut, the defendant informed Jurgen that she planned to kill Steller. Nevertheless, in early October, 1993, Jurgen drove the defendant to Middletown a third time. The two women again drove around Red Orange Road and a neighboring street, Brush Hill Road. The defendant told Jurgen that she was planning to kill Steller at a stop sign on Brush Hill Road because she wanted Coccia back. The defendant blamed Steller for the breakup of her relationship with Coccia and planned to douse her with ether, set her car afire and stab her.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Approximately one week later, Jurgen and the defendant traveled to Middletown a fourth time. On that trip, Jurgen parked her car several blocks from Steller\u2019s home and remained in the car while the defendant walked off in the direction of Steller\u2019s house. The defendant returned to Jurgen\u2019s car approximately fifteen minutes later, and the two women then drove down Brush Hill Road again before returning to Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">After they had returned from their fourth trip to Connecticut, the defendant again told Jurgen that she planned to kill Steller on Brush Hill Road. She said that a coworker, Gordon \u201cButch\u201d Fruean, Jr., had agreed to accompany her to Middletown to assist. Jurgen noticed that the defendant had a black cap, gloves and a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>in her bag. The weapon in the defendant\u2019s bag, a thirty-two caliber handgun, had been given to Fruean by his father. The defendant told Jurgen she was going to use the gun to kill Steller and asked Jurgen to wish her luck.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The defendant and Fruean thereafter drove to Middle-town intending to ambush Steller at an intersection on Brush Hill Road. Steller, however, did not pass through the intersection that night. Fruean became nervous, and he and the defendant returned to Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The defendant subsequently asked Jurgen to drive her to Middletown again so that she could kill Steller. Jurgen refused. The defendant then made arrangements to pick up a rental car on November 1, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Before departing for work on November 1, 1993, Steller had erased her telephone answering machine tape and reset the machine, which was located on the kitchen counter. Steller and King then left the Red Orange Road residence together and drove to work at Wesleyan University in Steller\u2019s car. Coccia, the last person to leave 14 Red Orange Road that morning, before leaving placed her dog in its cage and checked that the windows and exterior doors were locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">That same day, November 1, 1993, the defendant picked up the rental car that she previously had reserved, and she and Fruean drove to 14 Red Orange Road. The defendant and Fruean entered the locked house by crawling through the \u201cdog door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Steller and King returned home from work around 3:30 p.m. and entered the house through the garage. When they went into the kitchen, the defendant and Fruean were already waiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">The defendant shot and attacked both of the victims as they entered the kitchen. During the scuffle, the telephone answering machine located on the kitchen counter was activated and recorded some of the audible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>portion of the events that were taking place in the kitchen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant shot Steller once and King three times. When the gun had been emptied, the defendant, realizing that the victims were still alive, asked Fruean for assistance. Fruean took a butcher\u2019s knife from a knife block located on the kitchen counter and handed it to the defendant, who proceeded to stab Steller and King several times. The defendant also used a serrated paring knife and a carving knife to stab the victims. Realizing that the victims, even then, still were alive, the defendant smashed a ceramic lamp on Steller\u2019s head and broke a glass mason jar over King\u2019s head. While striking King, the defendant cut her hand on the glass shards of the broken mason jar.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The defendant and Fruean left the three bloodstained knives used in the attack at the scene, but took the gun with them. Blood from the defendant\u2019s wounded hand subsequently was found on King\u2019s clothing, on the wall leading to the front door, on the carpet, on the walkway leading away from Steller\u2019s home and in the rental car. Lisa Flagg, a woman visiting a friend in the neighborhood, observed the defendant and Fruean leaving Steller\u2019s home at approximately 3:55 p.m. Upon leaving, the defendant and Fruean drove to a nearby pond and threw Fruean\u2019s gun into the pond. Fruean\u2019s father later identified the gun recovered from the pond as being the gun he previously had given to his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">When Coccia returned home from work at approximately 5:30 p.m., she found Steller and King dead on the kitchen floor. The stab wounds and the gunshot wound Steller suffered each was sufficient to have caused her death. King\u2019s death was caused by a combination of the stab and gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The defendant was charged with two counts of murder and one count of capital felony. She entered a plea of not guilty and elected to be tried by a jury. On November 3, 1995, she filed a motion in limine seeking an order prohibiting counsel from asking potential venirepersons: (1) \u201c[a]ny questions concerning attitudes and beliefs for or against the imposition of the death penalty\u201d; and (2) \u201c[a]ny questions by which it is directly or indirectly suggested that the defendant, if convicted of [c]apital felony, in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-54b (8) might suffer the penalty of death.\u201d The motion also sought to prohibit the excusal for cause, <em>prior to the guilt phase of the trial, </em>of prospective jurors who were unalterably opposed to capital punishment. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Jury selection for the defendant\u2019s trial consumed some forty court days,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> during which more than 150 venirepersons were voir dired. The trial court, over the defendant\u2019s objections, excused for cause twelve venirepersons on the ground that their opposition to the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors during the sentencing phase of the trial. The trial court also excused for cause three venirepersons who stated that if the defendant was found guilty, the death penalty should be imposed automatically. In light of the capital felony charges, the court granted each party thirty peremptory challenges. Of those, the state used thirty and the defendant used twenty-seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. Thereafter, the trial court conducted a separate sentencing hearing, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-46a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> before the same jury. The jury returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>a special verdict finding that the state had proved aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt regarding both the murder of Steller and the murder of King, and that the defendant had proved mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence. The trial court merged the two murder counts with the capital felony count and rendered a judgment of conviction accordingly, and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a (g). This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The defendant claims that article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution prohibits the identification and excusal for cause, prior to the <em>guilt phase </em>of a bifurcated capital felony trial, of venirepersons whose beliefs concerning the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors during the <em>sentencing phase </em>of the trial. Specifically, the defendant maintains that questioning venirepersons, prior to the guilt phase of the trial, about their beliefs regarding the death penalty, and excusing for cause those venirepersons whose opposition to the death penalty would interfere with the performance of their duties as jurors at the sentencing phase of the trial, results in a guilt phase jury that is not impartial because it is: (1) more \u201cconviction prone\u201d than a jury that is not death qualified; and (2) not composed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>a representative cross section of the community. The defendant argues that such venirepersons properly may be identified and excused for cause only at the sentencing phase of a bifurcated capital felony trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), we adopted an analytic framework for determining whether our state constitution affords Connecticut citizens greater individual liberties than does its federal counterpart. Specifically, we enumerated six factors to be considered: (1) persuasive relevant federal precedents; (2) the text of relevant constitutional provisions; (3) historical insights into the intent of our constitutional forebears; (4) related Connecticut precedents; (5) persuasive precedents of other state courts; and (6) contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms. Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuchman, </em>242 Conn. 345, 360, 699 A.2d 952 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>241 Conn. 502, 515-16, 699 A.2d 872 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 402, 680 A.2d 147 (1996). None of those factors supports the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Relevant Federal Precedent</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The United States Supreme Court first addressed the issue of \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of jurors in capital cases in <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1968). In <em>Witherspoon, </em>a state statute permitted the excusal for cause of \u201cany [venireperson] who shall, on being examined, state that he has conscientious scruples against capital punishment, or that he is opposed to the same.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 512. Thus, the statute at issue in <em>Witherspoon </em>not only permitted the excusal of venirepersons whose beliefs concerning the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair their ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>perform their duties as jurors, it also allowed the excusal for cause of venirepersons who were opposed to the death penalty even if their scruples against the death penalty would not interfere with the performance of their duties as jurors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The petitioner in <em>Witherspoon </em>argued that excusal for cause, <em>prior to the guilt phase of the trial, </em>of all venirepersons with scruples against the death penalty results in a jury \u201cnecessarily . . . biased in favor of conviction,\u201d thereby violating a defendant\u2019s right under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution to have his innocence or guilt determined by an impartial jury. Id., 516. The court, however, concluded that the petitioner had not presented sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the excusal, prior to the guilt phase, of venirepersons with scruples against the death penalty necessarily results in a more \u201cconviction prone\u201d jury. Id., 517-18. Consequently, the court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that the \u201cdeath qualification\u201d process utilized at his trial deprived defendants of their federal constitutional right to have their innocence or guilt determined by an impartial jury. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The court also considered, however, the effect that the \u201cdeath qualification\u201d process utilized at the petitioner\u2019s trial had at the sentencing phase. <em>Witherspoon </em>was decided before the court\u2019s decisions in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972), and <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976), and the then current Illinois death penalty statute provided jurors \u201cbroad discretion to decide whether or not [to impose the death penalty] in a given case.\u201d <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 519. Noting that under the Illinois statutory scheme, \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>juror\u2019s general views about capital punishment [played] an inevitable role in any such decision\u201d; id.; the court concluded that the excusal for cause of all venirepersons with scruples against the death penalty resulted in a jury that at sentencing was \u201cuncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.\u201d Id., 521. On that basis, the court held that \u201ca sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d Id., 522. The court stated, however, that this conclusion did not \u201crender invalid the <em>conviction, </em>as opposed to the <em>sentence, </em>in <em>[Witherspoon] </em>or any other case.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 522-23 n.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The court also suggested in a footnote in <em>Witherspoon </em>that the federal constitution did not prohibit the excusal for cause of venirepersons \u201cwho [make] unmistakably clear (1) that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) [whose] attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s <em>guilt.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) Id., 522-23 n.21. Thus, the court\u2019s decision in <em>Witherspoon </em>indicated that in capital criminal trials, two categories of venirepersons properly could be excused for cause on the basis of their opposition to the death penalty: (1) individuals whose beliefs would prevent them from performing their duties as jurors during the guilt phase of the trial; and (2) individuals whose beliefs automatically would prevent them from performing their duties as jurors during the sentencing phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d 841 (1985), which was decided after <em>Fur-man </em>and <em>Gregg, </em>the United States Supreme Court again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>considered the effect that a prospective juror\u2019s beliefs concerning the death penalty have on that individual\u2019s eligibility to serve as a juror in a capital case. In <em>Witt, </em>the court noted that its statement in <em>Witherspoon </em>that a venireperson could be excused for cause if his beliefs \u201cautomatically\u201d would prevent him from imposing a sentence of death was best understood in the context of the death penalty statute at issue in that case. Id., 418. The court clarified the standard for determining whether a venireperson properly may be challenged for cause on the basis of his beliefs regarding the death penalty. Specifically, the court concluded that the federal constitution permits the excusal for cause of venirepersons whose opposition to capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. Id., 424. Thus, as interpreted in <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Witt, </em>the federal constitution permits the excusal for cause of venirepersons whose opposition to the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors during either: (1) the guilt phase of the trial; <em>or </em>(2) the sentencing phase of the trial. For a venireperson\u2019s opposition to the death penalty to be considered as preventing or substantially impairing the performance of that individual\u2019s duties as a juror during the sentencing phase of the trial, so as to permit excusal for cause, the federal constitution does not require that the venireperson explicitly state that, upon conviction, he automatically would vote not to impose a sentence of death. Instead, the federal constitution permits the excusal for cause of venirepersons whose responses during voir \u2022 dire raise serious doubt as to their ability to follow the law during the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In 1986, the United States Supreme Court again addressed the issue of \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of venirepersons in <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>476 U.S. 162, 106 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>1758, 90 L. Ed. 2d 137 (1986). At the trial of the petitioner in <em>Lockhart, </em>the court had excused certain venirepersons for cause in accordance with the <em>Wilt </em>test. Id., 166. On appeal, the petitioner did not claim that any of the jurors who had served at his trial had been \u201cpartial\u201d in the sense that they had been unable to render a verdict based solely on the evidence and the trial court\u2019s instructions. Id., 167. Instead, relying on social science evidence, the petitioner contended that the excusal for cause, prior to the guilt phase, of venirepersons whose opposition to the death penalty would prevent them from performing their duties as jurors only at the sentencing phase of a capital criminal trial, results in a more \u201cconviction prone\u201d guilt phase jury, thereby depriving the defendant of his rights under the sixth amendment to have his guilt or innocence decided by: (1) a jury composed of a representative cross section of the community; and (2) an impartial jury. Id., 167-68. The United States Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that: (1) although the sixth amendment requires that juries be fairly selected from a venire pool comprising a representative cross section of the community, it does not require that the actual jury so selected be composed of a representative cross section of the community; id., 173-77; (2) the petitioner had not presented social science evidence establishing the hypothesis that \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of venirepersons prior to the guilt phase of a bifurcated trial results injuries that are more \u201cconviction prone\u201d; id., 168-73; (3) the sixth amendment right to trial by an \u201cimpartial\u201d jury requires only a trial by \u201cjurors who will conscientiously apply the law and find the facts\u201d; id., 178; and (4) consequently, even if the social science evidence had been capable of supporting a finding that the excusal for cause, prior to the guilt phase of the trial, of venirepersons whose beliefs preclude them from serving as jurors only during the sentencing phase of the trial results in juries that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>are more \u201cconviction prone,\u201d such a finding would not have been a ground for concluding that death qualified juries are not \u201cimpartial\u201d within the meaning of the sixth amendment. Id., 174. Thus, the court concluded that the federal constitution did not prohibit the excusal for cause, prior to the guilt phase, of venirepersons whose opposition to the death penalty would preclude them from serving as jurors at the sentencing phase of a capital trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In 1992, the United States Supreme Court examined once again the issue of \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of venirepersons in bifurcated capital felony trials. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992). At the trial of the petitioner in <em>Morgan, </em>the court had permitted the state, prior to the guilt phase of the trial, to ask potential jurors whether their opposition to the death penalty would prevent them from performing their duties as jurors. Id., 722. The trial court, however, had refused the petitioner\u2019s request to ask potential jurors whether, if the petitioner was convicted, they automatically would vote to impose the death penalty regardless of the facts. Id., 723. The United States Supreme Court concluded that the federal constitution guarantees defendants in capital cases the right to question and excuse for cause any venireperson who, upon conviction, would <em>automatically </em>vote to apply the death penalty regardless of the facts. Id., 735-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">To summarize, it is well settled that the federal constitution permits the identification and excusal for cause, prior to the guilt phase of a bifurcated capital felony trial, of venirepersons whose beliefs would preclude then from either: (1) serving as a juror during the guilt phase of the trial; <em>or </em>(2) serving as a juror during the sentencing phase of the trial. <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>supra, 469 U.S. 424. Excusal, <em>prior to the guilt phase, </em>of venirepersons whose beliefs concerning the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>of their duties at the sentencing phase, but not at the guilt phase, of the trial does not violate a defendant\u2019s rights under the sixth amendment to have his guilt or innocence decided by: (1) an impartial jury that (2) has been selected fairly from a venire pool composed of a representative cross section of the community. <em>Lockhart v. McCree, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 184. The federal constitution, moreover, not only permits questioning of venirepersons regarding their attitudes on the death penalty prior to the guilt phase of the trial, it also provides defendants a constitutional right to ask such questions. <em>Morgan v. </em>Illinois, supra, 504 U.S. 735-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">It is useful at this juncture to identify what the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim does not involve. The defendant does not argue that she was deprived of a trial by an impartial jury because the individuals who served as jurors at her trial were not \u201cimpartial\u201d in the sense that they were incapable of finding facts solely on the basis of the evidence presented and applying the law in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions. Nor does she contend that the venire panels from which the jury that served at her trial was selected did not consist of a representative cross section of the community. Instead, the defendant asks us to conclude that, as a matter of law, the identification<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and excusal for cause, prior to the guilt phase of a bifurcated capital felony trial, of venirepersons whose views about the death penalty would substantially impair their ability to serve as jurors at the sentencing phase results in a jury that is not \u201cimpartial\u201d because: (1) it is more \u201cconviction prone\u201d; and (2) it is not composed of a fair cross section of the community. In effect, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>maintains that the state constitution requires that \u201cpro-prosecution\u201d and \u201cprodefense\u201d attitudes be balanced across the jury that is selected to decide a defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt. Thus, the defendant contends that our state constitution incorporates a meaning of \u201cimpartial jury\u201d that the United States Supreme Court refused to adopt under the federal constitution in <em>Lockhart. </em>Federal precedent, therefore, does not support the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim; indeed, it is directly contrary to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The Text of Relevant Connecticut Constitutional Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">We turn our attention now to the second of the six <em>Geisler </em>factors \u2014 the language of the operative state constitutional provisions. Article first, \u00a7 19, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by article four of the amendments, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate . . . .\u201d Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments, further provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right ... to a speedy, public trial by an impartial jury. . . .\u201d Thus, the language of article first, \u00a7 8, is substantially the same as that of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, which provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . .\u201d We can discern nothing in the language of article first, \u00a7 8, to suggest that the meaning of the term \u201cimpartial jury\u201d in our state constitution is different from the meaning of that same term in the federal constitution\u2014 namely, a jury that is: (1) composed of individuals able to decide the case solely on the evidence and apply the law in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>(2) properly selected from venire panels comprising a representative cross section of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Historical Insights into the Intention of Our Constitutional Forebears</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We turn our attention now to the third <em>Geisler </em>factor, historical insights into the intention of our constitutional forebears. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gannon, </em>75 Conn. 206, 226-33, 52 A. 727 (1902), this court traced the development of the state constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury: \u201c[A] careful study of our colonial history . . . demonstrates . . . that when our Declaration of Rights was framed in 1818, the \u2018right of trial by jury,\u2019 with its <em>well known essential features as then established by our common law, </em>was one of those \u2018liberties and rights\u2019 recognized and established and declared to be forever after \u2018inviolate.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 231-32. This court noted in <em>Gannon, </em>moreover, that it was a \u201csettled doctrine of the common law\u201d that cases \u201cshall be tried by a jury . . . who shall find the matter of fact . . . <em>according to [the] law and [the] evidence </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Chief Justice Zephaniah Swift, writing in 1822, described the right to trial by an impartial jury that was incorporated by the state constitution in 1818: \u201cIt is a rule of the common law, that all questions of fact must be tried by the jury .... When an issue in fact, is to be tried, and the parties do not agree to put it to the judges, it must, of course be tried by a jury .... The mode of selecting, and returning jurors, is prescribed by statute. The civil authority ... in each town are to select from the freeholders, the number prescribed by law, whose names are returned to the town clerk, and put in the box. From these, the clerk . . . may cause fifteen to be summoned to attend the court, twelve of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>which, shall be designated by lot; and a deficiency may be supplied by any freeholder from the county, who is in such case denominated a talisman. An excellent mode to guard against what are sometimes called <em>packed juries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\u201cWhen the jurors are returned, and before they are sworn, the parties have a right to make their challenges. These are to the array, and to the polls. Challenges to the array, are an exception to the whole panel .... In England . . . where the sheriff has a discretionary selection of jurors among the freeholders of the county, it is reasonable that the array should be set aside where the returning officer is interested, or is guilty of any partiality, or misconduct. But in this state, as the . . . returning officers, can never exercise any discretion, but are to draw the number of jurors to be summoned, from the boxes in their respective towns, it is difficult to imagine any ground of challenge to the array for the partiality and misconduct of the returning officer. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\u201cChallenges to the polls, or to particular jurors, are 1, the want of qualifications, 2 for crimes, and 3 for partiality. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\u201c3. A juror may be challenged for suspicion of bias, or partiality, which may be either a principal challenge, or a challenge to the favour. A principal challenge is, when the cause assigned, carries evident marks of suspicion, either of malice, or favour. Thus when the juror is related to either of the parties, has been an arbitrator on either side, has an interest in the case . . . where he has been bribed, or has been a juror in the same cause, or is the party\u2019s master, servant, steward, attorney, landlord, or tenant, or has published his opinion upon the particular case, or has conversed with the parties . . . upon the subject in dispute, or has formed an opinion upon the merits of the case: these are principal causes of challenge, and if proved, cannot be overruled, but the juror must be excused. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u201cChallenges to the favour, are founded merely on probable circumstances of suspicion, as particular friendship or enmity to either of the parties: and where the court has reason to think that there is such a bias or prejudice on the mind of a juror, as renders it probable that there will not be a candid and fair trial, they have discretionary power to dismiss him: but they ought not to indulge any unreasonable and groundless suspicion of the party. ... If a sufficient number of jurors are not returned, or so many are challenged that enough are not left to complete the pannel, the court [shall] direct the sheriff to return a sufficient number of the freeholders of the county . . . who are called talismen.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 1 Z. Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1822) pp. 737-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Chief Justice Swift\u2019s writings make evident that the state constitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury incorporates two common-law rights derived from English law: (1) the right to trial by a jury that is properly selected from a venire panel composed of a representative cross section of the community, which right is secured by \u201cchallenges to the array\u201d; and (2) the right to trial by a jury composed of individuals capable of deciding the case solely on the basis of the evidence and in accordance with the law, which right is secured by \u201cchallenges to the polls,\u201d i.e., in modem terminology, challenges for cause. \u201cThe purpose and effect of [article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19] is to preserve ... as a political right \u2018the institution of jury trial, <em>in all its essential features as derived from our ancestors and [existent] by force of our common </em>law.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Gannon, [supra, 75 Conn. 232].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perrella, </em>144 Conn. 228, 231, 129 A.2d 226 (1957). The defendant has not cited, and we are not aware of, any historical source that indicates that the common-law right to trial by an impartial jury that was incorporated into our state constitution in 1818 provides criminal defendants not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>only with the rights to bring challenges to the array and to challenge individual venirepersons for cause because they are not capable of deciding the case solely on the basis of the evidence and in accordance with the law, but also the right to challenge the composition of a selected jury on the ground that \u201cproprosecution\u201d and \u201cprodefense\u201d attitudes are not balanced across the jury. Thus, historical insights into the intentions of our constitutional forebears do not support the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Relevant Connecticut Precedent</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We turn now to the next <em>Geisler </em>factor, relevant Connecticut precedent. We repeatedly have equated the common-law right to trial by an impartial jury that was incorporated into the state constitution in 1818 to that provided by the federal constitution: \u201c \u2018Jury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by juiy guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. . . . [T]he right to juiy trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors. . . . The modern jury is regarded as an institution in our justice system that determines the case <em>solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments given [it] in the adversary arena after proper instructions on the law by the court.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State v.

Thus, we previously have recognized that the state constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury provides criminal defendants the common-law right to bring a \u201cchallenge to the polls,\u201d i.e., to challenge prospective jurors for cause and to have excused from service those venirepersons who are unable to set aside preconceived notions and decide the case solely on the evidence and in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions on the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Regarding the composition of a venire panel, we have stated that article first, \u00a7 8, encompasses \u201c[t]he American tradition of trial by jury . . .

In 1972, article first, \u00a7 19, of the constitution of Connecticut was amended to provide in relevant part: \u201cThe right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate .... In all civil and criminal actions tried by a jury, the parties shall have the right to challenge jurors peremptorily .... The right to question each juror individually by counsel shall be inviolate.\u201d \u201c[T]he enactment of article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended, reflects the abiding belief of our citizenry that an impartial and fairly chosen jury is the cornerstone of our criminal justice system.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 630; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 845, 661 A.2d 539 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 625, 513 A.2d 638 (1986). \u201cOne of the principal purposes of individual voir dire [guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 19] is the discovery of factors <em>'that may predispose a prospective juror to decide a case on legally irrelevant grounds'; Rozbicki </em>v. <em>Huybrechts, </em>218 Conn. 386, 391, 589 A.2d 363 (1991); and thus provide a basis for a challenge for cause or for a peremptory challenge.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 146, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 161, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 511, 525 A.2d 509 (1987); <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>202 Conn. 158, 162, 520 A.2d 190 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>196 Conn. 667, 671-72, 495 A.2d 699 (1985). \u201c[I]f there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect his [or her] decision of the case, the party who may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>adversely affected should be permitted questions designed to uncover that prejudice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 217, 726 A.2d 531 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>197 Conn. 314, 318, 497 A.2d 387 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>143 Conn. 138, 142, 120 A.2d 152 (1956). \u201cThis is particularly true with reference to the defendant in a criminal case.

Thus, the state constitutional guarantee, provided in article first, \u00a7 8, of trial by an impartial jury is effectuated not only by correlative rights to challenge a jury array and to challenge prospective jurors for cause, it is also effectuated by the rights, provided in article first, \u00a7 19, to individual voir dire and to challenge prospective jurors peremptorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We reiterate that to support her state constitutional claim, the defendant does not claim that any of the jurors at her trial was partial in the sense that he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>she was unable to decide the case solely on the basis of the law and in accordance with the court\u2019s instruction. Nor does she claim that the trial court improperly refused to excuse, for cause or on the basis of a peremptory challenge, any of the jurors who served at her trial. The defendant also does not claim that the venire panels from which the jury that decided her case was selected were not made up of a representative cross section of the community. Instead, the defendant claims that it was the excusal of certain venirepersons, specifically individuals whose opposition to the death penalty precluded them from serving as jurors at the sentencing phase of the trial, but not at the guilt phase, that deprived her of trial by an impartial jury \u2014 a claim that we considered and rejected in <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 468. Connecticut precedent, therefore, also does not support the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Decisions of Courts of Other States</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">We turn our attention now to the next <em>Geisler </em>factor, relevant decisions of the courts of other states. The defendant has not cited, and we are unaware of, any case in which another state has adopted the defendant\u2019s conception of \u201cimpartial jury\u201d as a matter of state constitutional law. In fact, the common-law and federal standard of impartiality appears to have been followed for purposes of state constitutional law in all states that have addressed the issue of \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of a capital jury prior to the guilt phase of a capital trial.

The defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim is based on the proposition that, as a matter of fact, identifying and excusing for cause, prior to the guilt phase, venirepersons whose beliefs would substantially impair their ability to serve as jurors at the sentencing phase, but not the guilt phase of the trial, results in a jury that is more \u201cconviction prone.\u201d We reject that hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The defendant presented no evidence at trial to support her contention that identification and excusal for cause, prior to the guilt phase, of venirepersons whose beliefs concerning the death penalty preclude them from serving as jurors during the sentencing phase of a capital felony trial results in a more \u201cconviction prone\u201d jury. Moreover, the defendant explicitly declined the trial court\u2019s invitation to provide such evidence. Instead, the defendant now relies entirely upon findings made by two federal district courts on the basis of certain social science evidence that \u201cdeath qualified juries\u201d are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u201cconvictionprone.\u201d <em>See Keeten v.

In light of that conclusion, the district courts\u2019 findings that \u201cdeath qualified\u201d juries are more \u201cconviction prone\u201d can reasonably be said to be in dispute. Consequently, those findings are not the proper subject of judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Furthermore, our own thorough examination of: (1) the social science evidence presented in <em>Grigsby </em>and <em>Keeten </em>(social science evidence); (2) the reasoning of the District Courts and the Circuit Courts of Appeal in those cases; and (3) the United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Lockhart </em>of the social science evidence also persuades us that the social science evidence presented in those cases is not capable of establishing the defendant\u2019s hypothesis. That hypothesis, to reiterate, is that in Connecticut in 1999, the removal for cause, prior to the guilt phase of a capital felony trial, of venirepersons whose beliefs concerning the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors during the sentencing phase of a capital felony trial results in a more \u201cconviction prone\u201d jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The social science evidence on which the defendant now relies consists of fourteen studies. Five of the studies<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> did not even identify the participants whose beliefs concerning the death penalty would supposedly preclude them from serving as jurors at the sentencing phase, but not at the guilt phase, of a capital trial. Thus, those five studies are incapable of establishing the defendant\u2019s hypothesis that identification and excusal of venirepersons at issue in the present case \u2014 individuals whose beliefs concerning the death penalty preclude them from serving as jurors at the sentencing phase, but not at the guilt phase, of the trial \u2014 results in a more \u201cconviction prone\u201d jury. Accord <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 170-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Furthermore, eight of the nine remaining studies<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> only attempted to establish a correlation between views <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>on the death penalty and attitudes regarding certain other aspects of the criminal justice process, the <em>untested assumption </em>being that persons with \u201cproprosecution\u201d attitudes vote to convict criminal defendants more often than persons with \u201cprodefense\u201d attitudes. None of the eight studies involved an actual, or even a simulated, jury experience in which study participants: (1) were instructed as to the presumption of innocence and the obligation to decide the case solely on the evidence and in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions regarding the law; or (2) participated, under oath, in deliberations regarding a \u201cdefendant\u2019s\u201d innocence or guilt. We are not persuaded that the correlation these studies purport to have established between death penalty attitudes and certain other criminal justice attitudes is capable of either: (1) predicting jury voting behavior; or (2) establishing the defendant\u2019s hypothesis regarding the effect that identification and excusal for cause of certain venirepersons \u2014 individuals whose views on the death penalty would preclude them for serving as jurors at the sentencing phase, but not at the guilt phase, of the trial \u2014 has upon jury voting behavior. Accord id.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The final study on which the defendant relies is documented in C. Cowan, W. Thompson &amp; P. Ellsworth, \u201cThe Effects of Death Qualification on Jurors\u2019 Predisposition to Convict and on the Quality of Deliberation,\u201d 8 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 53, 62-63 (1984) (Ellsworth Conviction Proneness Study). This study is not based on current Connecticut data. Instead, it is based on data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>that was collected twenty years ago in California<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> from only 240 individuals. \u201cVoir dire\u201d took place during <em>telephone interviews in which subjects were asked only two multiple choice </em>questions: (1) \u201c \u2018Is your attitude toward the death penalty such that as a juror you would never be willing to impose it in any case, no matter what the evidence was, or would you consider voting to impose it in at least some cases? a) I would be unwilling to vote to impose it in any case, b) I would consider voting to impose it in some cases\u2019 and (2) \u201c \u2018Which of the following expresses what you would do if you were a juror for the first part of the trial? a) I would follow the [court\u2019s] instructions and decide the question of guilt or innocence in a fair and impartial manner based on the evidence and the law. or b) I would not be fair and impartial in deciding the question of guilt or innocence, knowing that if the person was convicted he or she might get the death penalty.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No <em>further </em>attempt was made to verify that the respondents were willing and able to put aside preconceived notions and decide a case solely on the basis of the evidence presented and in accordance with a court\u2019s instructions regarding the law. In addition, no attempt was made to ascertain whether respondents would be unable to serve as jurors because their views in favor of the death penalty would cause them automatically to impose a sentence of death. See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 735-36. Even assuming, without deciding, that the Ellsworth Conviction Proneness Study is methodologically sound, we do not believe that the \u201cdeath qualification\u201d process utilized in the study, which entailed <em>only two multiple choice questions posed over the telephone, </em>reasonably can be said to be representative of either the process by which venirepersons in Connecticut are questioned during voir dire about their death penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>attitudes or of the process by which venirepersons who have preconceived notions and biases that would preclude them from serving as jurors are culled from a Connecticut venire panel. For example, jury selection in the present case consumed forty full days during which the questioning of individual venirepersons lasted as long as two hours. We also are not persuaded that a single study based on data collected approximately twenty years ago from 240 California residents provides a proper basis for taking judicial notice that, despite the state constitutional guarantee of individual voir dire and peremptory challenges, the excusal for cause, prior to the guilt phase of a capital felony trial, of venirepersons whose views about the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors during the sentencing phase, but not at the guilt phase, of the trial, results in a more \u201cconviction-prone\u201d jury in Connecticut in 1999. The individuals questioned for the Ellsworth Conviction Proneness Study did not serve under oath as jurors in an actual capital trial and, once they had given two multiple choice answers regarding their beliefs concerning the death penalty, were not subjected to further voir dire scrutiny to ensure that they were capable of deciding the case solely on the basis of the evidence and in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Connecticut experience, moreover, does not support the defendant\u2019s hypothesis that the death qualification procedure utilized at her trial results in a more \u201cconviction prone\u201d jury. For example, in a capital felony case now pending before this court, <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>Docket No. SC 14801, the trial court excused for cause twenty-seven venirepersons who stated during voir dire that the death penalty should be imposed automatically in that case. Only seventeen venirepersons were excused on the basis of their opposition to the death penalty. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>224 Conn. 711, 724, 621 A.2d 250 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>(1993) (judicial notice properly may be taken of files of Superior Court cases); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 568, 580 n.15, 587 A.2d 116 (1991) (same). Put another way, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, the death qualification process resulted in the excusal for cause of twenty-seven supposedly \u201cproconviction\u201d venirepersons and only seventeen supposedly \u201cproacquittai\u201d venirepersons. Thus, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that, as the defendant maintains, death penalty beliefs are predictive of jury voting behavior, we still could not conclude that \u201cdeath qualification\u201d results in a Connecticut jury that is more, rather than less, \u201cconviction prone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">To summarize, none of the <em>Geisler </em>factors supports the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim. The state has a valid and important interest in having the same jury serve at the guilt and penalty phases of a capital felony trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 467 (\u201cIn most capital cases, the evidence presented to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s guilt also will be relevant to the determination of the existence of aggravating factors. . . . Thus, if different juries were required to consider the guilt and penalty issues, much of the same evidence would be likely to be presented to each of the juries.\u201d [Citation omitted.]). We conclude that article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut incorporates the standard of \u201cimpartial jury\u201d provided by the federal constitution, namely, a jury that is: (1) composed of individuals able to decide the case solely on the evidence and in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions regarding the law; and (2) properly selected from a venire panel that is composed of a representative cross section of the community. Identification and excusal for cause, prior to the guilt phase of a capital felony trial, of venirepersons whose views concerning the death penalty preclude them from serving as jurors at the sentencing phase, but not at the guilt phase, of the trial does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>violate the state constitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Finally, we note that, as a practical matter, the standard of \u201cimpartial jury\u201d advocated by the defendant would require not only that jurors be able to set aside preconceived notions and decide a case solely on the evidence and in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions, but also that \u201cproprosecution\u201d and \u201cprodefense\u201d attitudes \u2014 the very attitudes that the jurors have been determined to be capable of setting aside and that the jurors are sworn to set aside \u2014 be balanced across the jury. Even if we were to assume, without deciding, that it somehow would be possible to ascertain and balance jurors\u2019 criminal justice attitudes across ajury, the defendant\u2019s proposed standard of \u201cimpartial jury\u201d still would not be workable because it effectively would require the elimination of the use of peremptory challenges\u2014 challenges that are guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 19, of the constitution of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly excused venireperson F.V. because of her opposition to the death penalty. Specifically, the defendant claims that the court improperly concluded that F.V.\u2019s beliefs concerning capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair her ability to perform her duties as a juror in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>supra, 469 U.S. 419-21.

Specifically, the defendant contends that by stating to the jury that \u201cto be a substantial factor in producing the death the act must have continued down to the moment of injury or the death or at least down to the setting in motion of the final injurious force which materially produced or preceded the death,\u201d the trial court permitted the jury to convict the defendant of murder even if it concluded that: (1) the defendant did not inflict any wounds; (2) she merely inflicted superficial wounds; or (3) she only committed nonfatal acts such as breaking the lamp and glass jar over the victims\u2019 heads. The trial court, however, also instructed the jurors that \u201cthe state has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did . . . cause the [victims\u2019] death\u201d; that \u201c[a]n act . . . is the proximate cause of death when it substantially and materially contributes ... to the resulting death. It is the cause without which the death would not have occurred and it is a predominating cause, a substantial factor from which death followed as a natural, direct, and immediate consequence\u201d; that \u201c[t]he state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt . . . that the defendant caused the death of the particular individual\u201d; that \u201c[a]n act ... is the proximate cause of death when it substantially and materially contributes ... to the resulting death\u201d; and that \u201c[i]t is essential the physical acts of [the defendant] be a substantial factor in bringing about the death.\u201d There is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled into believing that it properly could convict the defendant of the victims\u2019 murders without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>first finding that the defendant had committed acts that caused the victims\u2019 deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The defendant also maintains that the trial court\u2019s instruction misled the jury by allowing it to convict the defendant even if it concluded that she had been only an accessory to the murders. The defendant impliedly contends that by stating to the jury that <em>\u201cin order for [the defendant] to be relieved of responsibility </em>under this theory of efficient intervening cause . . . you must find that the defendant and Mr. Fruean were not acting jointly to commit the death\u201d; (emphasis added); the trial court permitted the jury to convict the defendant of murder without first finding that she herself had caused the victims\u2019 deaths. The statement upon which the defendant relies, however, clearly indicates that the jury was to consider the question of joint action only if it had first determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct was responsible for the victims\u2019 deaths.

That court later explained that this protection concerned the removal of \u2018cognizable groups\u2019 by peremptory challenge, but not other groups subject to rational basis review. <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama, ex rel.

Given the unique role of peremptory challenges in this state, we cannot say that the balance should be struck differently under our constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>supra, 520. Individuals whose views about the death penalty preclude them from service as jurors at the sentencing phase, but not at the guilt phase, of a capital trial, however, do not constitute a \u201ccognizable group\u201d for equal protection purposes.

It is not essential that the defendant ... be the sole cause of death. It is not essential that her act or ads be the immediate cause of death. It is essential the physical acts of [the defendant] be a substantial factor in bringing about the death.

Any other criminal defendant, that does not face this ultimate penalty, has the benefit of a group of persons summoned to serve potentially as jurors that includes those who are opposed to the death penalty on moral or other grounds and would not vote for it. Similarly, if the state decides not to seek the death penalty, the defendant is able to have a representative venire.

I agree with Justice Marshall who cogently wrote in dissent: \u201cWith a glib nonchalance ill suited to the gravity of the issue presented and the power of [the] respondent\u2019s claims, [this] Court upholds a practice that allows the State a special advantage in those prosecutions where the charges are the most serious and the possible punishments, the most severe. The State\u2019s mere announcement that it intends to seek the death penalty if the defendant is found guilty of a capital offense will, under today\u2019s decision, give the prosecution license to empanel a jury especially likely to return that very verdict. Because I believe that such a blatant disregard for the rights of a capital defendant offends logic, fairness, and the Constitution, I dissent.\u201d Id., 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>The consequences of the majority upholding this automatic exclusion can be significant \u2014 in Connecticut, those persons who are opposed to the death penalty and who potentially could not put that belief aside amount to approximately 39 percent of our state population<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as measured by the legislators who voted against the death penalty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Based on this assumption, Connecticut voters are less supportive of the death penalty than the national population.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Before I proceed with my state constitutional analysis, let me put this case in its proper perspective. The defendant, Janet Griffin, like the defendant in <em>Lockhart, </em>does not claim that those who are opposed to the death penalty and cannot put that belief aside should <em>not </em>be excluded from the <em>penalty </em>phase of the trial if the defendant is found guilty of capital felony pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b. Rather, the defendant maintains that her constitutional rights are violated if the jury that deliberates her guilt at trial is death qualified. All that the defendant asks, as in <em>Lockhart, </em>is that her guilt or innocence be determined by a jury like those that sit in noncapital cases \u2014 one whose composition is not prosecution oriented and conviction prone.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Our state statutory scheme can accommodate both the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have her guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>or innocence decided by a jury that is drawn from a representative cross section of the population and the state\u2019s right to exclude in the penalty phase of a capital case those who could not put aside their opposition in deciding whether to impose the death penalty. If the defendant is found guilty of a capital felony by a jury that includes jurors who would not vote for the penalty of death based upon moral or other grounds, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (b) clearly authorizes the trial court to impanel a second jury that could be death qualified to determine the penalty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 520 n.18, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1968), recognized the appropriateness of a bifurcated trial when a death qualified jury could not be impartial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We have in the past insulated the jury from being exposed to prejudicial information by bifurcating capital trials. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 334, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995), the defendant moved to bifurcate the trial to prevent the jury from hearing evidence of his prior murder conviction before they determined whether he was guilty of the capital felony that was at issue before them. This court determined that the trial court should bifurcate the trial in cases where there was a risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>substantial prejudice. Id., 343-51. Because the trial court failed to bifurcate the trial in <em>Jones, </em>we reversed his conviction and ordered a new trial. Id., 359. We made clear that \u201cthe risk of such substantial prejudice is not outweighed by the state\u2019s interest in judicial economy.\u201d Id., 346. The majority simply ignores the precedential effect of <em>Jones, </em>which requires that the trial court bifurcate the trial when there is a risk of substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Indeed, because of the risk of substantial prejudice and in the interests of doing justice, there should be no need to rely on the state constitution to require bifurcation. Rather, under our \u201cinherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 397, 645 A.2d 535 (1994), on appeal after remand, 236 Conn. 561, 674 A.2d 416 (1996); common sense mandates that the guilt phase should be bifurcated and if the defendant is found guilty, the penalty phase be tried before another jury to exclude those jurors who would not vote for the penalty of death under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Despite the majority\u2019s failure to ensure that the defendant\u2019s trial was fair by ordering a bifurcation of her trial under our supervisory powers, the state constitution requires that a death qualified jury cannot decide the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence in a capital case. Justice Glass eloquently reminded us in <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 649, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992), that \u201c[i]t is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . . Although we have often relied upon decisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the [federal constitution] to define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>the protections provided by related provisions of our state constitution, we have at times determined that the state constitution affords greater protections to the citizens of Connecticut than does the federal constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. . . . We have stated, moreover, that [t]he Connecticut constitution is an instrument of progress, it is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally so that it fails to have contemporary effectiveness for all of our citizens.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Our interpretation of when the state constitution affords greater individual rights than the federal constitution is guided by the <em>Geisler </em>factors: \u201cIn order to construe the contours of our state constitution and reach reasoned and principled results, the following tools of analysis should be considered to the extent applicable: (1) the <em>textual </em>approach; see, e.g., <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>175 Conn. 586, 597-98, 402 A.2d 763 (1978), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>454 U.S. 958, 102 S.

Although the majority purports to be guided by these factors, they do so with their heads buried deeply in the sand. In my view, under an appropriate analysis of our state constitution, bifurcation of the guilt and penalty phases in a capital trial are mandated if necessary to assure that the jurors for the guilt phase are not death qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Text of the Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The plain language of the state constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a trial by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>impartial jury.

If this were so there would be no purpose for mandating that the venire be composed of a cross section of the population. No defendant has ever been tried before a venire; the venire is not the body that deliberates in the jury room; no defendant has ever been found guilty by a venire. If there is a . . . [constitutional] requirement that the venire represent a fair cross section of the community, it must logically be because it is important that the defendant have the chance that the petit jury will be similarly constituted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">\u201cIt follows, then, that the state constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury guarantees a party not the right to a jury composed of a cross section of the population, but a fair chance of obtaining such a jury. . . . In other words, a petit jury is inevitably . . . affected by the vicissitudes of the draw .... Accordingly, those procedures used to select the petit jury during the voir dire that may interfere with the chance that the petit jury will represent a fair cross section of the community are subject to constitutional scrutiny of the right to trial by jury under both \u00a7\u00a7 8 (criminal) and 19 (civil) of article first [of the Connecticut constitution].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 450-52, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 717-18, 631 <em>A.2d 288 (1993); State v.

See <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 186-87 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Beyond sheer numbers, researchers consistently find that the attitudes of death qualified jurors are distinguishable from those of other jurors. Attitudinal surveys that have sampled venirepersons, individuals who were eligible for jury service and members of the general population, consistently found that those who support the death penalty are more likely to hold prosecution perspectives.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> They are \u201cmore likely to believe that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>defendant\u2019s failure to testify is indicative of his guilt, more hostile to the insanity defense, more mistrustful of defense attorneys, and less concerned about the danger of erroneous convictions. <em>[Grigsby </em>v. <em>Mabry, </em>569 F.

In addition, \u201c]t]his proprosecution bias is reflected in the greater readiness of death-qualified jurors to convict or to convict on more serious charges. <em>[Grigsby </em>v. <em>Mabry, </em>supra, 569 F.

The majority maintains that their \u201cown thorough examination . . . persuades [them] that the social science evidence presented in <em>[Grigsby </em>and <em>Keeten, </em>that is relied upon by the defendant] is not capable of establishing the defendant\u2019s hypothesis . . . that in Connecticut in 1999, the removal for cause, prior to the guilt phase of a capital felony trial, of venirepersons whose beliefs concerning the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors during the sentencing phase of a capital felony trial results in a more \u2018conviction prone\u2019 jury.\u201d My simple answer to the majority\u2019s conclusion is that, putting the studies aside, anyone with any common sense and who has the experience of life, would be compelled to come to the conclusion that venirepersons who favor the death penalty are more conviction prone than those who oppose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Furthermore, their criticism unfairly minimizes the value of those sociological studies examining the relationship between attitudes and human behavior. The majority argues that in five of the studies, researchers did not identify participants who would be death qualified. While this is true, the subjects of these studies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>were either jurors or members of the general population who are potentially members of the jury pool. The majority also criticizes the remaining studies that correlate subjects\u2019 attitudes toward the death penalty with attitudes toward the criminal justice system but do not assess whether they would be more likely to vote for conviction. This criticism ignores the finding that the beliefs of those subjects are internally consistent; if subjects support the death penalty, they are more likely to hold proprosecution beliefs. A reasonable inference from these studies is that jurors with these beliefs are more likely to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The majority fails to recognize the \u201cessential unanimity of the results obtained by researchers using diverse subjects and varied methodologies.\u201d <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 189 (Marshall, J., dissenting). They would have us put common sense aside and a defendant\u2019s life on hold while we wait for the definitive sociological study of whether jurors who hold positive attitudes toward the death penalty are more likely to favor the prosecution and thus, vote to convict. \u201cThe evidence thus confirms, and is itself corroborated by, the more intuitive judgments of scholars and of so many of the participants in capital trials \u2014 judges, defense attorneys, and prosecutors.

The majority claims that \u201c[t]he state has a valid and important interest in having the same jury serve at the guilt and penalty phases of a capital felony trial. . . . In most capital cases, the evidence presented to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s guilt also will be relevant to the determination of the existence of aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">. . . Thus, if different juries were required to consider the guilt and penalty issues, much of the same evidence would be likely to be presented to each of the juries.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) The majority indicates that the state\u2019s interest injudicial efficiency, that is, not presenting the same evidence to two different juries, is more important than the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury. Clearly, the state has not satisfied their burden of proving a significant interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Although I realize that Justice Borden, who votes with the majority in the present case, dissented in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 359, I thought we had indicated in <em>Jones </em>that when we must choose between justice and judicial efficiency, we come down strongly on the side of justice. To reiterate a point set forth by the majority in <em>Jones, </em>the \u201c [conservation of judicial resources is insufficient justification to deny the defendant\u2019s request to bifurcate the trial where having the jury determine the truth of the prior murder conviction allegation concurrently with the currently charged murder poses a risk of substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Id., 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Sibling Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Although our sister states who authorize the penalty of death consistently have held that the death qualification of a jury passes constitutional muster, the concurring and dissenting opinions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramseur, </em>106 N.J. 123, 524 A.2d 188 (1987), are compelling. Justice O\u2019Hern, in his concurrence, pointed out the following: \u201cI need not even dwell on the question of whether death-qualified juries are conviction-prone juries. The point is that a jury selection process that systematically excludes all jurors who cannot state a commitment to the death penalty results in a jury that ... is not a truly representative cross-section of the community and deprives the capital defendant of a jury of his peers on the fundamental question of guilt or innocence.\u201d Id., 337. And Justice Handler, in his dissent in <em>Ramseur, </em>reasoned that death qualification violated New Jersey\u2019s \u201cconstitutional guarantees of a fair and impartial juiy as a matter of fundamental fairness.\u201d Id., 435. Justice Handler went on to state: \u201cI agree with Justice O\u2019Hem in his concurring opinion . . . that the inconvenience entailed in providing for a non death-qualified jury\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>one that is fair and impartial \u2014 in the trial of guilt is not too high a price to pay to vindicate [the] defendant\u2019s constitutional interests. There can be no question that the use of completely separate juries would solve the problem because guilt would be determined by a normally composed jury but penalty would be determined by a death-qualified jury. A prohibition of death-qualifying the jury for the guilt phase of capital trials would impose relatively insubstantial burdens on the state.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 434 (Handler, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The California Supreme Court likewise recognized the constitutional problem of death qualification: \u201cJurors undergoing death-qualification would have reason to infer that the judge and the attorneys personally believe the accused to be guilty or expect the jury to come to that conclusion. Only such an inference could serve to explain to the jurors why so much time and energy are devoted to an extensive discussion of penalty before trial. Provided with these cues from people who are not only experts in the courtroom but are also presumably acquainted with all the evidence in the case, the relevant law, and the \u2018correct\u2019 application of the one to the other, death-qualified jurors may themselves become more inclined to believe that the accused is guilty as charged.\u201d <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>28 Cal. 3d 1, 71, 616 P.2d 1301, 168 Cal. Rptr. 128 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Historical Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">In examining the intent of the framers of the state constitution, it is evident that the right to a trial by an impartial jury was a core principle in the development of our state constitution. Its inclusion reflects a profound understanding of how the state\u2019s power to prosecute is tempered by the rights of the criminal defendant. William Blackstone, writing in the 18th century, observed that \u201cthe founders of the English law have, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>with excellent forecast, contrived that . . . the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours, <em>indifferently chosen </em>and superior to all suspicion.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 151-52, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968). Our founding fathers included in the Bill of Rights, later incorporated into the constitution by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . .\u201d Soon after, every state, including Connecticut in its first formal constitution of 1818, mandated that the criminal defendant had the right to a trial by an impartial jury. See Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\u201cThose who wrote our constitutions knew from history and experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the voice of higher authority. The framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge . . . . [T]he jury trial provisions in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power \u2014 a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. Fear of unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal Governments in other respects, found expression in the criminal law in this insistence upon community participation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">It is against this historical background that the state constitution needs to be viewed. The right to trial by an impartial jury was incorporated into the state\u2019s first formal constitution in 1818. More recently, this court has reiterated that \u201c[j]ury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. . . . [T]he right to a jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>248 Conn. 39, 46, 726 A.2d 513 (1999). When a jury is selected from a pool that is conviction prone, it baffles me how anyone could determine such a potential juror could possibly be impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Conclusion of Discussion of <em>Geisler </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">In short, the death qualification of a jury that determines the guilt or innocence of the criminal defendant in a capital trial cannot pass state constitutional muster. Even if the costs of having separate juries to determine guilt and the penalty could be considered, they are insignificant. I thought it was \u201csettled that a State may not entrust the determination of whether a man is innocent or guilty to a tribunal \u2018organized to convict.\u2019 <em>Fay </em>v. <em>New York, </em>332 U.S. 261, 294 [67 S. Ct. 1613, 91 L. Ed. 2043 (1947)]. See <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510 [47 S. Ct. 437, 71 L. Ed. 749 (1927)]. It requires but a short step from that principle to hold, as we do today, that a State may not entrust the determination of whether a man should live or die to a tribunal organized to return a verdict of death.\u201d <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Although I do not believe that the death penalty can be constitutionally imposed under our state constitution, common decency should dictate that, at the very least, when this extreme and barbaric punishment is sought by the state, we level the playing field so the defendant can at least receive a fair trial in the determination of his guilt or innocence. Today, the majority compounds the brutality of the penalty of death by ensuring that a jury is death qualified and, therefore, more likely to convict the defendant at the guilt phase of the trial. In order to gain this tactical advantage, the state will from this day forward be encouraged to seek death in those marginal cases in which such a penalty should not have been sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">This probably will be the last case before my retirement in which I will have the opportunity to express my views with respect to the dreadful punishment of death and related matters. Civilized nations have barred this horrible punishment. Some of our sister states have also banned death as a punishment, including all of the New England states except one \u2014 Connecticut. I have pointed out in my dissents in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 523, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 552-54, 680 A.2d 147 (1996), <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 262, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 294, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995), that the penalty of death fails to comport with contemporary standards of decency and that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of our state constitution. I leave this court heartbroken because, as a result of one vote,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Connecticut is not among those enlightened states and nations to put an end to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>death penalty. But those who would have it must live with this stain of blood. The determination of the constitutionality of the death penalty is not in the control of the legislature but, rather, in this court and the majority has failed to recognize its unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-9\"> \u201cA death-qualified jury is one from which prospective jurors have been excluded for cause in light of their inability to set aside their views about the death penalty that would prevent or substantially impair the performance of [their] duties as [jurors] in accordance with [their] instructions and [their] oath.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>483 U.S. 402, 408 n.6, 107 S.

In addition, the study concluded that jury panels containing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>mix of [Wtifterspoon-excludables] and death-qualified subjects tended to view all witnesses more critically and remember the facts of the case more accurately than death-qualified jury panels.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> The Eighth Circuit, in <em>Grigsby </em>v. <em>Mabry, </em>supra, 758 F.2d 231-32, considered that \u201c [t]he second element of the <em>Duren </em>test relates to venires. However, given our earlier discussion and finding that there is no practical difference between exclusion from the venire and systematic exclusion for cause from the petit jury, we analyze the resultant petit juries. In this case we find the representation of [Wif/ierspoow-excludables] on the juries is not \u2018fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community . . . <em>Duren </em>[v. <em>Missouri, </em>supra, 439 U.S. 364].

It said nothing, however, about the prosecution\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to eliminate jurors who do not meet that standard and would otherwise survive death qualification. See Gillers, \u2018Deciding Who Dies,\u2019 129 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 85 n.391 (1980). There is no question that peremptories have indeed been used to this end, thereby expanding the class of scrupled jurors excluded as a result of the death-qualifying voir dire challenged here. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Velasquez, </em>26 Cal. 3d 425 [438 n.9, 606 P.2d 341, 162 Cal. Rptr. 306] (1980) (prosecutor informed court during voir dire that if a venireperson expressing scruples about the death penalty \u2018were not a challenge for cause, I would kick her off on a peremptory challenge\u2019). The only study of this practice has concluded: \u2018For the five-year period studied a prima facie case has been demonstrated that prosecutors in Florida\u2019s Fourth .Judicial Circuit systematically used their peremptory challenges to eliminate from capital juries venirepersons expressing opposition to the death penalty.\u2019 Winick, \u2018Prosecutorial Peremptory Challenge Practices in Capital Cases: An Empirical Study and a Constitutional Analysis,\u2019 81 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 39 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\u201cJudicial applications of the <em>Witherspoon </em>standard have also expanded the class of jurors excludable for cause. While the studies produced by respondent generally classified a subject as a Witherspoon-exdudable only upon his unambiguous refusal to vote death under any circumstance, the courts have never been so fastidious. Trial and appellate courts have frequently excluded jurors even in the absence of unambiguous expressions of their absolute opposition to capital punishment. Schnapper, \u2018Taking <em>Witherspoon </em>Seriously: The Search for Death-Qualified Jurors,\u2019 62 Texas L. Rev. 977, 993-1032 (1984). And this less demanding approach will surely become more common in the wake of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412 [105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d 841] (1985). Under Witt, a juror who does not make his attitude toward capital punishment \u2018unmistakably clear,\u2019 <em>Witherspoon </em>[v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 522 n.21], may nonetheless be excluded for cause if the trial court is left with the impression that his attitude will \u2018 \u201cprevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u201d \u2019 <em>[Wainwright </em>v.] <em>Witt, </em>supra, [433] (quoting <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 45 [100 S. Ct. 2521, 65 L. Ed. 2d 581] [1980]). It thus \u2018seems likely that <em>Witt </em>will lead to more conviction-prone panels\u2019 since \u2018 \u201cscrupled\u201d jurors \u2014 those who generally oppose the death penalty but do not express an unequivocal refusal to impose it \u2014 usually share thepro-defendantperspective of excludable jurors.\u2019 See Finch &amp; Ferraro, \u2018The Empirical Challenge to Death Qualified Juries: On Further Examination,\u2019 65 Neb.

I respectfully dissent from the conclusion of the majority that the practice of \u201cdeath qualification,\u201d that is, the exclusion from capital juries of an entire group of potential jurors who express beliefs in opposition to the death penalty during voir dire questioning, does not violate the state constitution. While it is clear that this question has been resolved against the defendant\u2019s claim under the federal constitution; <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>476 U.S. 162, 165, 106 S. Ct. 1758, 90 L. Ed. 2d 137 (1986); I hold to the belief that the majority opinion\u2019s analysis of the practice does not stand up under our state constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">In essence, I agree with the defendant\u2019s analysis of the state constitutional issue under the criteria set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). The defendant\u2019s conclusion that the Connecticut constitution should provide greater due process protection to criminal defendants than the federal constitution on the death qualification exclusion of jurors is compelling. It is axiomatic that \u201c[sjtates are free to provide greater protections in their criminal justice system than the Federal Constitution requires.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>463 U.S. 992, 1014, 103 S. Ct. 3446, 77 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>2d 1171 (1983). Indeed, this court has concluded in a number of criminal cases that our state constitution provides broader protections of individual rights than does its federal counterpart. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>240 Conn. 489, 505, 692 A.2d 1233 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 632, 620 A.2d 746 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 649, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992); <em>State v. Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 160, 579 A.2d 58 (1990). While the majority provides a rather tight analysis of the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim under most of the <em>Geisler </em>factors, it seems to me that the majority concludes too hastily under the \u201ceconomic and sociological\u201d factors, discussed in part IF of its opinion, that the empirical studies that suggest that death qualification produces a jury that is more prone to convict at the guilt phase and that, accordingly, a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial is thereby impaired should be rejected under a state constitutional analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">At the outset, I must say that I simply cannot overcome my intuitive agreement with the claim that death qualified juries are disposed to convict at the guilt phase. In my opinion, the empirical support for this claim, first set forth in <em>McCree </em>and supplemented by the defendant in this appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> merits far more consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>than that given by the majority. Early on, Justice Marshall dutifully observed that \u201c[t]he chief strength of [these studies] lies in the essential unanimity of the results obtained by researchers using diverse subjects and varied methodologies.\u201d <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 189. Justice Marshall further noted in his dissent that \u201c[t]he data strongly suggest that death qualification excludes a significantly large subset \u2014 at least 11 [percent] to 17 [percent]- \u2014 of potential jurors who could be impartial during the guilt phase of the trial. Among members of this excludable class are a disproportionate number of blacks and women. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\u201cThe perspectives on the criminal justice system of jurors who survive death qualification are systematically different from those of the excluded jurors. Death-qualified jurors are, for example, more likely to believe that a defendant\u2019s failure to testily is indicative of his guilt, more hostile to the insanity defense, more mistrustful of defense attorneys, and less concerned about the danger of erroneous convictions. . . . This pro-prosecution bias is reflected in the greater readiness of death-qualified jurors to convict or to convict on more serious charges. . . . And, finally, the very process of death qualification \u2014 which focuses attention on the death penalty before the trial has even begun \u2014 has been found to predispose the jurors that survive it to believe that the defendant is guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">As one commentary observed, \u201c[f]rom a social scientist\u2019s viewpoint the empirical question [whether death qualified juries are biased against the defendant on the issue of guilt] has been conclusively answered.\u201d R. Seltzer, G. Lopes, M. Dayan &amp; R. Canan, \u201cThe Effect of Death Qualification on the Propensity of Jurors to Convict: The Maryland Example,\u201d 29 How. L.J. 571, 581 (1986). It seems to me that the cost of ignoring the direction in which the empirical data leads us is too great. While I do not believe that a minute dissection of these studies is warranted in this dissent, I do contend that the empirical evidence raises serious questions about the practice of the death qualification of juries. A succinct summarization of these studies reflects the following: (1) jurors who withstand death qualification tend to be less solicitous of a defendant\u2019s due process rights and significantly more eager to convict; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>853 P.2d 327, 389 (Utah 1993) (Durham, J., dissenting); (2) death qualification disproportionately excludes blacks and women, groups who statistically have been shown to be more opposed to the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>penalty than whites and men; see W. White, \u201cThe Constitutional Invalidity of Convictions Imposed by Death-Qualified Juries,\u201d 58 Cornell L. Rev. 1176, 1187 (1973); (3) jury deliberations do not \u201cneutralize the voting propensities of individual death-qualified or excludable jurors\u201d; <em>Grigsby </em>v. <em>Mabry, </em>569 F. Sup. 1273, 1302 (E.D. Ark. 1983), aff'd, 758 F.2d 226 (8th Cir. 1985), rev\u2019d sub nom. <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 162; (4) jury panels that included <em>Witherspoon </em>excludables<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were able to remember facts more accurately than their death qualified counterparts; id., 1302; (5) death qualified jurors, as opposed to <em>\u201cWitherspoon </em>excludables,\u201d were more prone to believe prosecution than defense witnesses; see <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>28 Cal. 3d 1, 59-60, 616 P.2d 1301, 168 Cal. Rptr. 128 (1980); and (6) death qualified jurors maintained a higher standard of the concept of reasonable doubt than did jurors who were not death qualified; id., 59; see also W. White, supra, 58 Cornell L. Rev. 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">I am of the further opinion that the concerns of the state in opposition to alternatives to death qualification do not overcome my belief that the practice violates our state constitutional guarantees of a fair trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">While I am cognizant of the state\u2019s interest in the protection of \u201cneutrality\u201d on the penalty issue, and while I further acknowledge that the concerns about cost, time and judicial resources are valid ones, I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>not believe that, given the stakes involved, these concerns are compelling enough to change my position. Indeed, the idea that separate juries decide the issues of guilt and punishment as suggested by one commentator seems most prudent. See B. Winick, \u201cProsecutorial Peremptory Challenge Practices in Capital Cases: An Empirical Study and a Constitutional Analysis,\u201d 81 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 55-62 (1982). If the concern for assuring fairness in capital cases is to be taken seriously, surely implementing such an additional measure makes sense. Given the extraordinary delay that exists from the date of conviction to the date of actual execution of sentence in death penalty cases around the country, the concern about the excessive time factor involved in impaneling two juries is minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Finally, I propose that even if the defendant\u2019s argument regarding the state constitution falls short, this court should consider the invocation of our supervisory powers and eliminate the practice of death qualification of juries. Connecticut has long held to a sense of fairness and justice when the question involves our criminal justice system. In the past we have taken steps to ensure attainment of these noble goals by the use of our supervisory powers. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 336, 715 A.2d 1 (1998) (requiring trial court to conduct prehminary inquiry when presented with allegation of ethic bias on part of jury); <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>242 Conn. 523, 542, 700 A.2d 14 (1997) (requiring judicial explanation as to reasons for imposing greater sentence after trial than sentence previously imposed under plea agreement); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>241 Conn. 1, 15, 695 A.2d 1022 (1997) (requiring playing of videotaped deposition in open court); <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 250, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995) (special verdict form in capital case must include statement of jury\u2019s duties in determining defendant\u2019s capital penalty); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 346-47, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995) (requiring bifurcation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>in certain death penalty cases); <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 397-400, 645 A.2d 535 (1994) (requiring presence of trial judge during voir dire in criminal case), on appeal after remand, 236 Conn. 561, 674 A.2d 416 (1996). As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 346, \u201c[c]onservation of judicial resources is insufficient justification to deny the defendant\u2019s request to bifurcate the trial where . . . [the circumstances pose] a risk of substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d I see no impediment likewise to employ our supervisory powers in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\"> It is noteworthy that prior to <em>McCree, </em>several jurists in the lower federal courts provided sound, cogent dissenting opinions suggesting that the conclusion that the United States Supreme Court ultimately chose to adopt was undermined by a wealth of empirical evidence, which, for the most part, is relied upon by the defendant in the present case. Of course, it is a part of the historical record that in <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 184, Justice Marshall provided what is clearly the most compelling overall dissenting opinion in opposition to the practice of \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of jurors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\"> In <em>Keeten </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>578 F.
