J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV4\">In this certified appeal, the plaintiffs, Branhaven Plaza, LLC, and The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, Inc./Waldbaum\u2019s, Inc., appeal from the judgment of the trial court following the granting of an application by the named defendant, the inland wetlands commission of the town of Branford (commission), for an inland wetlands permit to the defendant Stop and Shop Supermarket Company (Stop &amp; Shop).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that the trial court, <em>Downey, J., </em>improperly dismissed the appeal, thereby upholding the commission\u2019s decision to approve Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application to conduct regulated activities associated with the construction of a supermarket. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The relevant facts are primarily undisputed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stop &amp; Shop filed an application with the commission for a permit to conduct regulated activities on property located at 1151, 1201 and 1219 West Main Street in the town of Branford, in connection with the proposed construction of a supermarket. The property in question consists of approximately 10.7 acres, and is located in the southwest part of Branford. There are three wetlands and one watercourse on the property. The first wetland, located in a topographical depression among mounds of fill and exposed bedrock, covers approximately 0.21 acres and is located in the central portion of the property. The second wetland, located south of the first wetland and separated from it by discarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>asphalt piles, covers approximately 0.026 acres. The third wetland, described as a wet meadow community, with shrubs and trees primarily located around its edge, is approximately 0.5 acres in size and is located in the southeastern section of the site. The watercourse is located in the southwestern portion of the site. It comprises some 0.11 acres and consists of a sparsely vegetated channel entering the property from the west and proceeding through the site in a southeasterly direction. Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s initial proposal called for eliminating the first and second wetlands and enhancing the area near the third wetland, which included creating a new wetland adjacent to the existing third wetland. In light of the proposed construction plan, the commission made a finding of \u201csignificant activity,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2.1cc of the Branford inland wetlands and watercourses regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on land containing certain areas regulated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cwetlands\u201d or \u201cwatercourses\u201d as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-38 (15) and (16).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result of this finding, the commission scheduled public hearings on Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application pursuant to \u00a7 9.1 of Bran-ford\u2019s inland wetlands and watercourses regulations. The plaintiffs inteivened in the matter pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and participated in the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">During the proceedings, Stop &amp; Shop modified its initial proposal and, rather than create a new wetland, proposed the construction of a detention or infiltration basin on the property. This change was made in response to concerns about on-site flood control. Subsequently, the commission members raised doubts about the sufficiency of the proposal and its effect on the watershed. Stop &amp; Shop responded to the commission\u2019s concern by proposing the payment of money and in-kind services for future off-site mitigation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>commission then accepted and integrated that proposal into the approval of the permit. On March 13, 1997, the commission approved Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application subject to nine conditions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Condition six provided that the \u201c \u2018[b]anking mitigation\u2019 offered by the applicant [is] to be accepted by the commission for future mitigation, restoration, improvement, and or study in the same watershed. This amount [is] to be not less than $25,000 plus a like amount of in kind professional/engineering services to be provided for the abovementioned purposes during the next four to five years. This funding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and gift of services is to be used at the discretion of the Inland Wetlands Commission only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the commission\u2019s decision to the trial court, claiming aggrievement pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Stop &amp; Shop filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to intervene properly. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and heard argument on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The plaintiffs claimed that the commission\u2019s decision was not supported by the record, and that the commission had abused its discretion by, inter alia, failing or refusing to follow its own regulations and the mandates of the General Statutes. The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the appeal, thereby upholding the commission\u2019s decision to approve the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The plaintiffs petitioned the Appellate Court for certification pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-43 (a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>8-8.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Appellate Court granted the petition. While the appeal was pending in the Appellate Court, Stop &amp; Shop moved to dismiss, claiming that the plaintiffs lacked standing to appeal in their capacity as intervenors. The Appellate Court denied that motion on January 27, 1999. This court then transferred the appeal to itself and issued a stay of execution. Thereafter, Stop &amp; Shop moved this court to dismiss the appeal for lack of standing and also moved to terminate the stay. This court postponed decision on these motions until the resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the merits discussed herein.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In this appeal, the plaintiffs contend that: (1) the trial court improperly concluded that the commission could accept the payment of money and in-kind services as mitigation for the impact of the proposed activity on the wetland; (2) the receipt of storm water drainage calculations from Stop &amp; Shop after the closing of the public hearing violated the plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights and was an improper delegation of the commission\u2019s duties; (3) the trial court improperly found that Stop &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Shop\u2019s failure to introduce affirmative evidence to support its claim of no feasible and prudent alternatives was excused where the commission was aware of the issue and its finding of no feasible and prudent alternatives was merely implicit in its decision; and (4) the trial court improperly found that substantial evidence existed to support the commission\u2019s finding that soil conditions were suitable for construction of a proposed infiltration basin. We agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 first claim. In light of our holding with respect to the first claim, it is not necessary to address the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">With regard to the first claim, the plaintiffs contend that the payment of money as mitigation for the destruction of wetlands is contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent and the purpose of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act (act). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45. Moreover, the plaintiffs maintain that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>212 Conn. 710, 722-23, 563 A.2d 1339 (1989), that off-site mitigation, under the circumstances of that case, was permitted under the act, is distinguishable from the facts of the present case. Stop &amp; Shop argues, to the contrary, that the trial court properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s approval of its application. According to Stop &amp; Shop, the facts of the present case are controlled by this court\u2019s holding in <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 722-23. We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Whether the trial court improperly concluded that the commission could accept the payment of money and in-kind services as mitigation is a matter of statutory interpretation. \u201cGenerally, [o]ur review of an agency\u2019s decision on questions of law is limited by the traditional deference that we have accorded to that agency\u2019s interpretation of the acts it is charged with enforcing. . . . We do not, however, accord special deference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>agency\u2019s decision when that decision involves a question of law [that] has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Church Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>250 Conn. 297, 303, 735 A.2d 805 (1999). Therefore, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case .... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>247 Conn. 126, 133, 717 A.2d 747 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The regulation of inland wetlands and watercourses is governed by the act. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45. The statement of purpose of the act, set forth in \u00a7 22a-36,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> indicates that \u201c[t]he inland wetlands and watercourses of the state of Connecticut are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed. . . . The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> delegates these objectives to municipalities, empowering them to effectuate the purposes of the act, and \u00a7 22a-42 (c)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>directs the municipalities to establish a commission and promulgate regulations governing the wetlands and watercourses in their respective communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Notwithstanding this broad delegation of power to the municipalities for the regulation of the state\u2019s wetlands and watercourses, the legislature has limited the scope of a municipality\u2019s conduct and its ability to enact regulations. Section 22a-42 (f) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny ordinances or regulations shall be for the purpose of effectuating the purposes of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, and, a municipality or district, in acting upon ordinances and regulations shall incorporate the factors set forth in section 22a-41 (a).\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (a) lists the relevant facts and circumstances that must be considered in passing on a permit application after determining that a proposed activity would impact wetlands. In particular, \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (4) provides a hierarchy of considerations for reviewing issues of mitigation: \u201cmeasures to (A) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (B) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (C) in the following order of priority: Restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources.\u201d The legislature, in 1996, amended the act to include this hierarchy. Public Acts 1996, No. 96-157, \u00a7 2; see Public Acts 1996, No. 96-269. Creation of this hierarchy was designed to foster varying types of mitigation. \u201c[T]he idea that one might actually create wetlands elsewhere as a compensatory kind of thing, or repair [a] damaged wetland either on site or elsewhere was something that we had not really embraced in the statutes before but certainly is being done to some limited extent by some commissions.\u201d 39 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 1996 Sess., p. 4719, remarks of Representative Jessie G. Stratton. \u201c[T]here is a hierarchy of considerations by an inland wetlands commission on mitigation measures, from the first effort which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>would be to prevent or avoid any kind of impact onto a wetland . . . [to] the rest of the hierarchy which is to restore, enhance, and create, protective, productive wetlands and water course resources.\u201d 39 S. Proc., Pt. 9,1996 Sess., pp. 2987-88, remarks of Senator Catherine W. Cook. In light of the hierarchical approach taken by the legislature, we conclude that the creation of wetlands is preferentially lower than all other types of mitigating measures, perhaps, in part, because of the uncertainty associated with the creation and restoration of wetlands. \u201cMitigation of wetlands, particularly creation and restoration, is an emerging science that has yet to show promising results. No one is really certain if we can truly \u2018create\u2019 a wetland and successfully replace the values and functions of a natural wetland that we have destroyed.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Environment, Pt. 3, 1996 Sess., p. 654, memorandum from Lisa Santacroce, director of environmental affairs at the Connecticut Audubon Society.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 710, this court examined the boundaries of permissible wetland mitigation under the act, addressing the issue of \u201coff-site\u201d mitigation. In particular, we addressed the issue of off-site creation and restoration of wetlands as mitigation. In deciding that the off-site mitigation, under the facts of the case, was reasonable in accordance with the act, this court held that the trial court acted within permissible limits. Id., 722-23. In <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc., </em>the commission had approved the application and issued the permit subject to a condition that, in exchange for the right to eliminate the wetland, the applicant would \u201cprovide reasonable compensation for wetland development or enhancement to be determined in the future . . . working directly with the applicant and other interested parties in [the] [t]own to identify, define and seek proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>approvals of said compensating activity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We premised our decision on the fact that \u201c[i]t is obvious from the record that the commission originally intended, as compensation for the pond to be filled, to have the applicants excavate a pond at [an off-site location] on Holland Brook in Earle Park, a public park in Glastonbury . . . .\u201d Id., 717-18. Thus, although the resolution adopted by the commission had not included this detail, the applicants remained responsible for actual mitigation, not merely the payment of money. This court concluded that \u201cnothing in the statute or regulations . . . prevented] a local wetlands commission from securing an agreement to provide off-site compensation for the loss of wetlands so long as the commission has considered the impact of the application on the subject property in accord with the policies outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45 of the General Statutes and the local regulations.\u201d Id., 722-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The facts of the present case are distinguishable from those of <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>In the proposed plan in the present case, Stop &amp; Shop, in essence, has removed itself from all responsibility by simply giving $25,000 plus a like amount of in-kind professional services to the commission, to be used at its discretion. Stop &amp; Shop is not obligated to perform <em>any </em>mitigation under this plan. Neither the commission nor Stop &amp; Shop has devised any proposal for the creation of new wetlands or the enhancement of existing wetlands. By providing monetary and in-kind contributions for an unspecified project in the future, Stop &amp; Shop has, in essence, without remediation, destroyed wetlands. Permitting such a scenario is contrary to the legislative purpose of protecting and preserving this state\u2019s wetlands and watercourses.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Furthermore, such a condition prevents any meaningful review of the adequacy of the mitigation because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>there is no plan of actual mitigation. The proposal is not sufficiently detailed to ensure that environmental consequences have been evaluated fairly. See <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Methow Valley Citizens Council, </em>490 U.S. 332, 351-53, 109 S. Ct. 1835, 104 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1989) (mitigation must be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been evaluated fairly). \u201cThe importance of the mitigation plan cannot be overestimated. It is a determinative factor in evaluating the adequacy of an environmental impact statement. Without a complete mitigation plan, the decisionmaker is unable to make an informed judgment as to the environmental impact of the project . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 347-48. Although the United States Supreme Court in <em>Robertson </em>dealt with the National Environmental Policy Act and the corresponding environmental impact statement, the spirit of that legislation is sufficiently similar to compare to the act and the proposed plan in this case. Here, the commission cannot adequately assess whether the proposal would sufficiently offset the project impact because there is no mitigation plan. Upholding such nebulous mitigation would fly in the face of the purposes of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In fact, the trial court in this case, while affirming the commission\u2019s approval of the permit application, noted that \u201c[t]he very statement of the claim should alert the commission to the pitfalls of embarking on a course of requiring or encouraging cash contributions as a condition of issuance of permits. Such a practice would give rise to perceived and, conceivably, real abuse and would be contrary to public policy.\u201d The notion that money and its in-kind equivalent could present the sole obstacle to obtaining a permit would severely undermine the rationale for enacting the legislation and the ultimate purpose of protecting wetlands and watercourses.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Because we have concluded that the trial court improperly concluded that the commission could accept the payment of money and in-kind services as mitigation for the destruction of wetlands, we must next decide whether that condition was an integral part of the commission\u2019s decision to grant the permit. See <em>Vaszauskas </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>215 Conn. 58, 66, 574 A.2d 212 (1990). In light of the purposes of the act, it is clear that, in general, mitigation measures are an integral component in the process of approving a permit that seeks to destroy wetlands. In the present case, the commission initially raised doubts regarding the sufficiency of the proposed mitigation measure, the construction of a detention basin on the property. In response to the commission\u2019s concern that the measure was insufficient, Stop &amp; Shop proposed the payment of money and in-kind services, and the commission then accepted and integrated the proposal into the approval of the permit. Thus, we conclude, under the circumstances of the case, that the commission\u2019s decision to grant Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s permit was reached only after the proposal for the payment of money and in-kind services was offered as mitigation and was, therefore, integral to the commission\u2019s decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment sustaining the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\"> The commissioner of environmental protection is also a defendant in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\"> Although the precise dimensions of the first and second wetlands on the site are disputed, the disparity is negligible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\"> Section 2.1cc of the Branford inland wetlands and watercourses regulations provides: \" \u2018Significant activity\u2019 means any activity including, but not limited to, the following activities which may have a substantial effect on the area for which an application has been filed, or on another part of the wetland or watercourse system;</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u201c1.

Section 22a-19 (a) allows any person to intervene so that private citizens are provided a voice in ensuring that the natural resources of the state remain protected. Because the plaintiffs filed a notice of intervention at the commission hearings in accordance with \u00a7 22a-19 (a), they had standing to appeal the environmental issues associated with that commission\u2019s decision. See <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>212 Conn. 710, 715, 563 A.2d 1339 (1989).

The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state\u2019s potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit, and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (a) provides: \u201cTo carry out and effectuate the purposes and policies of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45a, inclusive, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of the state to require municipal regulation of activities affecting the wetlands and watercourses within the territorial limits of the various municipalities or districts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c) provides: \u201cOn or before July 1, 1988, each municipality shall establish an inland wetlands agency or authorize an existing board or commission to carry out the provisions of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive. Each municipality, acting through its legislative body, may authorize any board or commission, as may be by law authorized to act, or may establish a new board or commission to promulgate such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>regulations, in conformity with the regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to section 22a-39, as are necessary to protect the wetlands and watercourses within its territorial limits. The ordinance establishing the new board or commission shall determine the number of members and alternate members, the length of their terms, the method of selection and removal and the manner for filling vacancies in the new board or commission. No member or alternate member of such board or commission shall participate in the hearing or decision of such board or commission of which he is a member upon any matter in which he is directly or indirectly interested in a personal or financial sense. In the event of such disqualification, such fact shall be entered on the records of such board or commission and replacement shall be made from alternate members of an alternate to act as a member of such commission in the hearing and determination of the particular matter or matters in which the disqualification arose.
