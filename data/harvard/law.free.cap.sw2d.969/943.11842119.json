Judgment was entered on August 25, 1994. On May 3, 1996, the petitioner filed for post-conviction relief alleging that he had pled guilty as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court below summarily dismissed the petition on the grounds that \u201cmeasured against the court record, the petition for post conviction relief is without merit.\u201d The petitioner now appeals, claiming that he was entitled to a hearing on his post-conviction claims. We agree and reverse and remand this matter for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-26\">Upon receipt of a petition for post-conviction relief, \u201cthe court shall examine the allegations of fact in the petition. If the facts alleged, <em>taken as true, </em>fail to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>petitioner is entitled to relief or fail to show that the claims for relief have not been waived or previously determined, the petition shall be dismissed.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 40-30-206(f) (Supp.1996) (emphasis added). In the instant case, the petitioner alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that he was thereby coerced into pleading guilty. In support of his claims, he alleged, among other things, that his attorneys failed to represent him properly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-4\">1. Failed to enter his plea in accordance with his wishes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-5\">2. Disregarded his suggestions for the \u201cdevelopment of or aggressive pursuit of any viable defenses;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-6\">3. Refused to file a motion for psychological evaluations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">4. Refused to contact witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-8\">5. Failed to respond to repeated communications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-9\">6. Informed him that the only responsibility to him \u201cwas not a defense which shall prevail at trial, but to get [him] the best deal (i.e., plea bargain), nor, for that matter, to have the jury find [him] innocent, nor no verdict due to the insufficiency of the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction of guilt;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-10\">7. Told him that his religion \u2014 Wieca\u2014 was on trial, not his crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">As a result of these failures, the petitioner contends, he \u201cwas coerced by them and their missleading advise of prevailing in the Appellate Courts of the State of Tennessee, to accept a plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">In reviewing the petitioner\u2019s allegations, the court below examined other matters contained in the record of the State\u2019s case against the petitioner and decided that the petitioner\u2019s allegations were without merit. We commend the court below for attempting to save the State the time, money and resources required to provide the petitioner with a hearing. However, in doing so, the court below overlooked its statutory duty to take <em>as true </em>the allegations contained in the petition, without regard to other matters contained in the record. Taken as true, the petitioner\u2019s allegations state a claim for relief. Accordingly, even if every single allegation is proved false, the petitioner is entitled to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">The judgment below is reversed and this matter is remanded for an evidentiary hearing in accordance with the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, T.C.A \u00a7 40-30-201 et. seq. (Supp.1996).</p>\n<judges id=\"b978-15\">BARKER and SMITH, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
