JOHN LANE.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b530-9\">The affidavit, which gives the justice jurisdiction in summary proceedings under the Landlord and Tenant act, must contain a statement of the facts which, under the statute, authorize the removal \u2014 statements of the affiant\u2019s conclusions from undisclosed facts are not sufficient.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-10\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b530-11\">Argued at February Term, 1889, before Justices Mague and Garrison.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-12\">For the plaintiff, <em>J.

Chamberlain.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b530-14\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b530-15\">Garrison, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZX2\">This writ of <em>certiorari </em>removes into this court the summary proceedings brought by the defendant to dispossess the prosecutor of the premises described in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">The affidavit, upon which the jurisdiction of the justice rests, states that Mary Jane Wooley is in possession of said premises, and that she has had and occupied them from November 11th, 1864, \u201cas the tenant at will of deponent [the defendant in <em>certiorari'], </em>without any special agreement between them for the termination of said possession.\u201d The affidavit, it will be noticed, fails to disclose any facts; it states neither the terms of the agreement, if there was any, nor the circumstances under which the possession began. The omission to state these jurisdictional facts is always held to be fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">In <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>549, the court, in a similar case, said: \u201c The affidavit is insufficient. It does not contain the facts. She [the plaintiff] swears that he [the defendant] is her tenant of a lot heretofore leased to him, but this is only her conclusions from facts which she has not disclosed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The propriety of this decision has never been judicially \u2022questioned. It has, on the contrary, been uniformly approved \u25a0and followed. <em>Schuyler </em>v. <em>Trefren, </em>2 <em>Dutcher </em>213; <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Sliker, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>432; <em>Brohn </em>v. <em>Jersey City Forge Co., </em>9 <em>Id. </em>74; <em>McQuade </em>v. <em>Emmons, Id. </em>397; <em>Layton </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>14 <em>Id. </em>380.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">There having been no jurisdiction below, the proceedings must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
