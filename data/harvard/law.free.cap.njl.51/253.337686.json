At the same meeting of the council the prosecutor presented a remonstrance, signed by himself and nine other citizens and taxpayers of the city, objecting to the granting of such license, on the ground, <em>inter </em>alia, that the recommendation was not in fact signed by twelve reputable freeholders, and thereupon the remonstrants asked the council to adjourn the proceedings for a reasonable time in order to afford them an opportunity to offer proof of the truth of their objection. The council refused the request and at once granted the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The power of the council to license inns and taverns was conferred by section 9 of the charter of Bordentown, approved February 13th, 1849 <em>(Pamph. L.,p. </em>35), and is to be exercised in the same manner and subject to the same provisions as in the courts of Common Pleas of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u2022 The case thus presented is on all fours with <em>Dufford </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>17 <em>Vroom </em>87, where this court decided that if, on such a remonstrance and request, the council practically -deny a hearing and refuse to investigate the fact alleged, they ignore their legal duty, and their resolution granting the license is invalid and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">In accordance with that decision, the action of council granting the license in the present case must be annulled, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
