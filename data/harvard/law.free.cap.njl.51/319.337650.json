It was said that the true test of the conformity of legislative action to the clause of the constitution to which the argument related, was the result of such action. And in support of this doctrine the case of the appeal of the <em>City of Scranton School District </em>v. <em>Lackawanna Iron and Coal Co., </em>reported in 113 <em>Penna. St. </em>176, was relied on. The question presented for consideration was whether a law was valid that was to take effect only when adopted by a municipal vote, in view of that clause of the constitution of Pennsylvania <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>which prohibited the enactment of local or special laws regulating the affairs of cities, and the court repudiated altogether that species of legislation, saying: \u201cThe law will be limited to one or more cities that do accept, and that makes it local. All our recent decisions are to the effect that if local results either are or may be produced by a piece of legislation, it offends against this provision of the constitution and is void.\u201d But it is plain that this rule of construction will not harmonize with the judicial interpretations given in this state to the corresponding provision of our fundamental law. It has been long settled in this state that an act creating municipal powers may be made dependent for its operative force upon its acceptance by the local popular vote. <em>City of Paterson </em>v. <em>The </em>Society, <em>&amp;c., </em>4 <em>Zab. 385; Paul </em>v. <em>Gloucester County, </em>21 Vroom 585, 604; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Hoagland, ante p. </em>62. And the hypothesis has in no instance been adopted or countenanced, that when a franchise or privilege has been tendered by the legislature to every locality, such tender is special or local because it may not be universally accepted. There is no prohibition in the constitution against the enactment of a general law which may, by possibility, produce local results. If we were to accept the doctrine that the effect that may result from a statute is the test of its constitutionality, it would appear to be impracticable to offer privileges to these municipalities, and every law to affect them would of necessity have to be a mandatory regulation. In every statute conferring franchises upon these public bodies to be used or not used at will, there is a potentiality that the result will be variant in different localities. A power to borrow money for a public purpose might be resorted to in some places and not in others, and hence dissimilar local effects would be produced. Under the rule as claimed it would be difficult to justify the grant to these municipalities of the prerogative of local legislation, as the obvious result is that no two localities will be subject to the same code of local laws. It seems to be manifest that a general law may, under some circumstances, produce a result local or special, but we find no constitutional inhibition against such legislation. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>an act, from its inherent force and scope, must necessarily produce a local and not a general result, or if it be illusively contrived for that purpose, it will fall under constitutional condemnation ; and this is the standard that has been applied by the courts of this state. Uor can it escape observation that if the other and opposite theory were to prevail, this singular situation might in some instances be presented of an act being declared to be void that was both general in its scope and purpose, and which in point of fact had produced, not a local \u25a0or special, but a general result, as, for example, if the present act had been accepted by all the cities of the state; and yet, according to the doctrine contended for, it would be necessary to declare the act invalid, inasmuch as there was inherent, in its constitution, the possibility of a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">But we have said that if an act be framed for a general purpose, and which is calculated to effect that end, such statute will not be unconstitutional for the reason that, in its execution, its entire object may not be effectuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">And from this principle it follows, as an unavoidable corollary, that the limitation in point of time for the adoption of the privileges of this law, cannot be regarded as an invalidating circumstance.' The statutory language in this respect is, that no election shall be held under its provisions after the 1st day of October, 1890. It is true, that this provision may eventuate in the production of different local results, but such \u25a0outcome is not the necessary effect of the law, and there is no indication that such an end was in view. This law is capable of coming into operation within the time prescribed, in every city in the state; it is, therefore, within the meaning of the \u25a0constitution, a general and not a local act, for, as has been just said, it must be regarded either as general or special at the time of its enactment, and it is not to be ranked in the former class by reason of the fact of its subsequent general adoption, nor in the latter class because of its partial rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In addition to these considerations, it seems to us that the \u2022question above discussed must be regarded as res <em>adjudicata </em>in this state. In the recent decision of the Court of Errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>in the cases arising under the act of 1888, regulating the sale-of ardent spirits, the rule was practically settled that it was the scope and object of a legislative act that constituted the test of its generality, and not the results that possibly might ensue in the course of its execution. The law referred to was-declared to be general, because it gave to each of the counties of the state the right to decide for itself whether it would or would not permit the designated liquors to be retailed within its domain, and although it was manifest that different results were likely to obtain in the counties, the constitutionality of the law was maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In the opinion of the court, the act in question is not in any respect out of harmony with the constitution of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The next contention to be considered relates to the election which has been held in Jersey City under the authority of the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Several objections have been urged by counsel against the legality of that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">First, it is insisted that the statute was not properly submitted according to its own directions to the popular vote. In this respect, the statutory authorization is <em>\u201c </em>that the board of aldermen or common council of any city may, by resolution, or the mayor of any city may, by proclamation, submit the question of the acceptance or rejection of this act to the voters of such city at any general or charter election to be held therein.\u201d In the present instance, the mayor being temporarily absent from the state, the president of the board of aldermen performed this function. By the charter of Jersey City, it is provided \u201c that in case of the absence of the mayor from the city, * * * the president of the board of aldermen shall be invested with the power and authority of the mayor until either the mayor resumes his duties,\u201d &amp;c. It is manifest that under the designated conditions it was the legislative intent to confer on the president of the board of aldermen not only a part, but the whole of the power resident in the chief executive of the city; he was empowered to do everything that the mayor, by virtue of his office, could do ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>.and the president of the board of aldermen thus becomes, in the specified contingency, mayor of the city <em>pro tempore. </em>This is the usual provision to be found in most municipal \u25a0charters; and there seems to be no ground for an inference, from the language of the statute we are now considering, that the law makers designed to confer the power in question only on those of that class of officials who had been elected to the position, to the exclusion of those persons who had come to it by substitution and by the appointment of the charter. There appears to be nothing in the nature of the authority bestowed, nor in the terms in which the grant is expressed, that, in any degree, intimates that the prerogative in question is to be confined to a certain class of the incumbents of the mayoralty, while, in point of fact, there is in this law a quite plain intimation that the legislature, when it intended to discriminate between the permanent and the temporary mayor, thought it necessary to do so in express terms. In the twentieth section of this act there is a provision to the effect that none of the appointments authorized by the statute.to be made by the mayor shall be made by \u201c any officer acting in the absence or disability of the mayor.\u201d The act, by an antecedent clause, had vested the appointing power in the municipal executive by his designation of \u201c mayor,\u201d and unless such designation, by its intrinsic force, would, in legislative estimation, have embraced not only the permanent .mayor, but also the official who, in his absence, was invested with the authority of the office, the prohibitory declaration in the clause just quoted is mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In view of this legislative action, and in consideration of the fact that by the charter of the city the mayor <em>pro tempore </em>is clothed, when legally in office, with all the powers and faculties of the municipal executive, it does not seem reasonable to believe that it was the design of the law makers, when they declared that the election in contemplation might be \u25a0called by the mayor, to exclude from such function the person who, although he had not been elected to the office, was <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>jure, </em>and by appointment of the charter, acting mayor of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">On this head our conclusion is, that under the existing circumstances, the president of the board of aldermen had the legal authority to proclaim the election in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">It is not necessary, therefore, to discuss the subject argued by counsel relative to the efficacy of the statute which was-subsequently passed for the purpose of validating this action of the acting mayor of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">A second objection to the preliminaries of the election under-examination is, that the president of the board of aldermen in his proclamation -misrecited, in an important particular, the act that was submitted to the voters for acceptance or rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The draft of this act, as it stood originally before the legislature, contained, at the close of section 2, the declaration that \u201c no more than two tax commissioners so appointed shall be-from the same political party,\u201d but that regulation was struck out before its final passage. By inadvertence the clause thus-eliminated was retained in the act as recited in the proclamation calling the election, and it is argued that this mistake vitiates the entire electoral procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">This position appears to us extravagant and untenable. The statute does not require its publication as an antecedent to the election, and in the proclamation it is referred to and designated by its title and the date of its enactment, and it would be singular indeed, if, by a mistake of an official, in the-doing of an entirely superrogatory act, an election relating to a-, matter of public importance, and in which the people at large-have an interest, should, <em>ipsofaeto, </em>be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The legal rule in matters of this nature is, that in order to invalidate the procedure the error complained of in the given case must appear from the proofs, or by necessary intendment, to have so affected the election as to have changed its result. In the case before us, there is nothing to indicate that the-mistake referred to, and which related only to a single class of officials, did, in point of fact, affect this election to the extent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of a single vote. On such a subject, the court is not permitted to indulge in a speculation resting altogether in the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">With respect to the objection touching the publication of the notice of the election, we are of opinion that it conformed to the statutory direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Nor, after careful examination, have we found the existence of any radical imperfection in the act auxiliary to the one just disposed of, and by authority of which this court is now in session. The law referred to is entitled \u201cA supplement to an act entitled \u2018An act concerning the government of cities of the state/\u201d approved April 6th, 1889, such supplement having been passed on the 19th of April, in the same year. The general object of this supplementary legislation is to settle expeditiously and in a summary way, all controversies arising which concern the rights or title of any person who has been appointed by a mayor of a city to office by virtue of the primary act. The scheme thus put on foot consists in a requirement that the chief justice of this court, on the application of any mayor, shall convoke a Supreme Court to hear and decide such litigation, and shall superintend and adjust the pleadings, so that the proper issue shall be formed. There is a provision that all parties claiming any right, title or interest in the office in dispute, shall be brought in and made parties to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In this procedure we do not find anything that is calculated to deprive these litigants of any substantial right. They are plainly entitled, by force of the system thus contrived, to all the rights and privileges that appertain to the trial of official title by virtue of the writ of <em>quo warranto. </em>The jurisdiction in both procedures belongs to the same tribunal; and if these litigants had been at issue on any matter of fact, and either of them had demanded a trial by jury, such trial would have been directed by the court, for, as the legislative direction is for*the court to try the case, the necessary implication arises, that the procedure is to be conducted in the ordinary mode. The parties have formed, by mutual arrangement, their own issues; have taken testimony to their satisfaction, and, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>out asking a trial by the country, have submitted, after argument, their litigation to this court for its adjudication. It seems obvious, therefore, that none of these contestants can complain that they have not had every advantage and safeguard which they would have possessed if the procedure had been according to the course of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The other questions presented in the arguments of counsel have been considered, but have not appeared to us to be of sufficient solidity to require special discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In fine, in our opinion, judgment of ouster should be entered against these incumbents who are holding possession of these offices by force of an election or appointment unde\u00bbthe old city charter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
