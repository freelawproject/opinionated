He was ordered removed to Venezuela, and that order became administratively final in September 2011. Llovera Linares wishes to file a \u201cU-Visa\u201d petition under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(U)(i), and he moved the district court for injunctive relief in the form of a certification that would allow him to file such a petition. The district court denied the motion, and Llov-era Linares now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">A U-Visa is a type of visa that \u201ccan be granted to victims of certain listed crimes who later help United States law enforcement officials investigate or prosecute those crimes.\u201d <em>Ordonez Orosco v. Napoli-tano, </em>598 F.3d 222, 224 (5th Cir.2010); \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(U). Llovera Linares contends that the district court erred in denying him relief because he has made out a prima facie case of eligibility for a U-Visa under \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(U)(i). A U-Visa petition must be accompanied by a certification from \u201ca Federal, State, or local law enforcement official, prosecutor, judge, or other Federal, State, or local authority investigating\u201d certain types of enumerated criminal activity of which the petitioning alien has been a victim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184(p)(l). The pertinent federal regulation requires that the person signing the certification have \u201cresponsibility for the detection, investigation, prosecution, conviction, or sentencing of qualifying criminal activity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.14(c)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-22\">Llovera Linares\u2019s U-Visa petition would be based on his claims that the law enforcement officials involved in the Broward County incident engaged in qualifying criminal activity. The decision whether to issue a certification for a U-Visa petition is a discretionary one. <em>Ordonez Orosco, </em>598 F.3d at 226-27. The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was not qualified to issue the certification for Llovera Linares, and the denial of Llovera Linares\u2019s motion for injunctive relief is AFFIRMED. Llovera also moves to have this court compel various agencies to launch an investigation into the Bro-ward County incident, and he requests that a judge of this court issue the certification that would allow him to file a U-Visa petition. These motions, as well as any other outstanding motions, are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-18\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
