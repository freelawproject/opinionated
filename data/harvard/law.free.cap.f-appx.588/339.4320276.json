He was sentenced to 130 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in denying Castillo an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Castillo challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to award him credit for acceptance of responsibility on the ground that he continued to use marijuana while on pretrial release, arguing that his use of drugs while on pretrial release was the result of an addiction and not indicative of a lack of acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">We review the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility \u201cunder a standard of review even more deferential than a pure clearly erroneous standard,\u201d and will affirm unless the denial is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Rudzavice, </em>586 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2009). Although a defendant who pleads guilty prior to trial and- truthfully admits relevant conduct may qualify for the reduction, \u201cthis evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.3). We have consistently upheld the denial of reductions for acceptance of responsibility where, as is the case here, defendants have violated the conditions of their pretrial release. <em>See United States v. Rickett, </em>89 F.3d 224, 227 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 180 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Hooten, </em>942 F.2d 878, 883 (5th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>911 F.2d 983, 985 (5th Cir.1990). In <em>Fincas, </em>we specifically rejected the argument that the district court had ruled improperly because the defendant\u2019s drug use \u201cdid not show a lack of contrition but, instead, was a result of his drug addiction.\u201d 99 F.3d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">Castillo has not denied that he used marijuana in violation of the express terms of the conditions of his pretrial release. Based on the undisputed evidence, the district court\u2019s determination that Castillo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1 was not without foundation. <em>Rudzavice, </em>586 F.3d at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
