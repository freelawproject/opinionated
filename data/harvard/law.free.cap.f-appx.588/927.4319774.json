The district court dismissed Elam\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Elam appeals. After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">I. FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">A. Convictions and Sentences in 1998</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">In October 1996, Elam robbed several victims at a drug store at gunpoint. In 1997, Elam was indicted on: (1) one count of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (\u201cCount 1\u201d); (2) one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (\u201cCount 2\u201d); and (3) one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (\u201cCount 3\u201d). In 1998, a jury found Elam guilty of all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">The maximum statutory penalties for Elam\u2019s three convictions were (1) 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for Count 1, (2) a mandatory term of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment for Count 2, and (3) life imprisonment for Count 3. Relevant to this appeal, the maximum statutory penalty for Count 3 increased from 10 years\u2019 imprisonment to life imprisonment because the sentencing court found that Elam had four prior state felony convictions that qualified him as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">Specifically, Elam\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) cataloged his extensive prior criminal activity, which yielded a criminal history category of VI. Elam\u2019s prior criminal activity included these Florida state court convictions: (1) two separate 1983 burglary convictions, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(3); (2) one 1989 conviction for the sale, purchase, or delivery of a controlled substance on or near school property, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(c); and (3) one 1994 conviction for possession with intent to sell, purchase, manufacture, or deliver cocaine, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(2)(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PSI noted that these four prior felony convictions were predicate offenses that qualified Elam as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and an armed career criminal under the ACCA and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">The applicable offense level under the career offender guideline was 32. The applicable offense level under the armed career criminal guideline was 34. Applying the higher applicable offense level,'the PSI determined that Elam\u2019s offense level was 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Based on his criminal history category of VI and an offense level of 34, Elam\u2019s mandatory guidelines range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">Elam, through counsel, objected to the PSI in several ways \u2014 both in writing and at his sentencing hearing. But, none of his objections related to his four prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>state felony convictions or his classification as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">On May 29, 1998, the district court sentenced Elam to a total sentence of 822 months\u2019 imprisonment, near the high-end of the guidelines range. This sentence was comprised of 240 months on Count 1; 262 months on Count 3, to run concurrently with the sentence on Count 1; and 60 months on Count 2, to run consecutively to the sentences on Counts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">B. Direct Appeal in 1998</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Elam appealed, arguing that the district court erred (1) by denying Elam\u2019s motion to suppress; (2) by denying his motion to sever Count 3 (i.e., being a felon in possession of a firearm); and (3) by admitting certain police testimony. This Court affirmed Elam\u2019s convictions and sentences on August 17,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">C. First \u00a7 2255 Motion in 2000</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">In November 2000, Elam filed an original 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, in which he argued only that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in ways unrelated to his sentence. On August 7, 2002, the district court denied Elam\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Elam did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">D. Instant \u00a7 2241 Petition in 2010</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">On July 26, 2010, Elam filed his first \u00a7 2241 habeas petition for a writ of habeas corpus. This petition is presently before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Elam argues that he is \u201cactually, factually, and legally innocent of being an armed career offender\u201d because he does not have the required felonies to qualify for the statutory ACCA sentencing enhancement in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(e). Elam acknowledges that he cannot raise these claims in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion because (1) he previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion and (2) he does not meet the statutory requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Notwithstanding the statutory bar to filing a second \u00a7 2255 motion, Elam argues that the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) permits him to raise his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition. Specifically, Elam argues that pursuing a remedy under \u00a7 2255 at this juncture would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause because (1) he \u201cis only allowed to file one original \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d and (2) \u201ca successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not meet the requirements of [the] issue [in his \u00a7 2241 petition] because he is arguing a statutory change in the law,\u201d rather than a constitutional change in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Elam argues that his two separate 1983 state burglary convictions were not violent felonies under the ACCA because (1) no violence occurred, nobody was armed, and nobody was present; (2) he pled guilty to entering the curtilage of a dwelling, rather than the dwelling itself; and (3) the Florida statute under which he pled guilty defined burglary more broadly than generic burglary is defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">Elam also argues that his 1994 state drug conviction was not a qualifying ACCA predicate offense. In particular, Elam argues that the Florida statute under which he pled guilty covers simple possession; and, therefore, it is unclear whether he committed simple possession or possession with intent to. sell.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>this Florida statute of conviction was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">On May 8, 2013, the district court determined that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) did not permit Elam to raise his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition. Therefore, the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Elam\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and, thus, dismissed Elam\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Elam now appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">A federal prisoner who wishes to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion must move this Court for an order authorizing the district court to consider such a motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (cross-referencing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244). We may grant such authorization only if the proposed motion contains claims premised on either (1) \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense,\u201d or (2) \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Elam acknowledges that his present claims do not satisfy the statutory requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Nevertheless, Elam attempts to attack the imposition of his sentence through a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. He can do so, however, only if the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e) opens the portal to relief under \u00a7 2241. And, \u00a7 2255(e) opens the portal to \u00a7 2241 only if \u201cthe remedy by [a \u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [Elam\u2019s] detention.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) is a jurisdictional provision. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 52, 190 L.Ed.2d 29 (2014). Thus, before the district court has subject matter jurisdiction to review a \u00a7 2241 petition, the petitioner must show that the savings clause is satisfied. <em>See id. </em>A hopeful \u00a7 2241 petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>See Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">Here, based on our binding precedent, Elam has not satisfied any of the requirements to access \u00a7 2241 through the savings clause portal in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1274 (11th Cir.2013); <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1343 (11th Cir.2013); <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"A5vO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>The district court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review Elam\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition on the merits. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1339-40.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Elam\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\">. Elam\u2019s prior criminal activity also included these Florida state court convictions: (1) three separate convictions for resisting an officer \u2014 in 1988, 1992, and 1993; (2) one 1992 conviction for marijuana possession; and (3) three separate convictions for obstruction of justice \u2014 in 1991, 1992, and 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-16\">. While the Guidelines are now treat as advisory, the Guidelines were mandatory at the time of Elam\u2019s sentencing in 1998. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 246, 125 S.Ct. 738, 757, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (holding that the guidelines must be treated as advisory).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b949-13\">. The government concedes that Elam\u2019s 1993 state drug conviction \u201cmight have been treated as only a third-degree felony.\u201d We note that, even without that 1993 conviction, Elam still had three ACCA-qualifying felony convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>tions, which were all that the ACCA enhancement required. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b950-10\">. The availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b950-11\">. As noted above, when a prisoner such as Elam previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h). These restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \"inadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b951-11\">. Elam also argues that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender. However, when sentencing Elam, the district court relied on the armed career criminal guideline, not the career offender guideline. Because the district court did not rely on the career offender guideline in sentencing Elam, we need not entertain Elam\u2019s arguments as to that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b951-27\">. Because we lack subject matter jurisdiction, we do not address the government's procedural default arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b951-8\">WILLIAM PRYOR, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AyV1\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">I concur that we must dismiss this petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See United States v.
