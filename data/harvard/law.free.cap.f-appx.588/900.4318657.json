Vig, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants, Dr. Satpal K. Shikh and her dental practice, All Care Dental.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vig claimed that the .defendants violated the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Vig first contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which asserted two new causes of action against the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Vig filed that motion in January 2013 \u2014 thirteen months after filing his original complaint and eleven months after filing his first amended complaint. The district court denied that second request to amend as untimely, both under the scheduling order and under local court rules requiring all motions to be .filed within thirty days after the beginning of discovery. Noting that it could nevertheless grant Vig\u2019s motion if he showed good cause, the district court refused to do so, because he had not alleged any previously unavailable facts and had not been diligent in pursuing the newly asserted causes of action. The district court correctly ruled that Vig had not shown good cause. He pointed to no new evidence to support his proposed second amended complaint, and there.is no reason that he could not have alleged, in an earlier pleading, the new claim it attempted to raise. Vig\u2019s untimeliness and failure to show good cause amount to a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d to deny him leave to amend, meaning the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Shipner v. E. Air Lines, Inc., </em>868 F.2d 401, 406-07 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that although district courts have discretion to deny leave to amend, they may only do so for a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Vig\u2019s second contention is that the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). For Vig to prevail on either his overtime or his minimum wage claims, FLSA must have \u201ccovered\u201d his employment. He argued at trial that his employment came within FLSA\u2019s \u201centerprise coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Josendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 1292, 1298-99 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining the distinction between enterprise and individual coverage). As a result, Vig needed to prove that the defendants employed him \u201cin an enterprise engaged in commerce.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206(a), 207(a)(1). All Care qualified as \u201can enterprise engaged in commerce\u201d only if it had (1) \u201cemployees engaged in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>merce,\u201d and (2) an \u201cannual gross volume of sales made or business done [that] is not less than $500,000.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A); <em>see also Josendis, </em>662 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">After Vig presented all of his evidence, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that he had failed to prove that All Care\u2019s annual sales were at least $500,000. The district court reserved ruling on the motion. When the defendants renewed that motion at the close of evidence, the district court granted it. The court found that Vig had presented no evidence of the defendants\u2019 annual sales. When questioned about this, Vig conceded that he had failed to do that. As a result, the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Because Vig failed to present evidence of FLSA coverage, all of his remaining arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-8\">. Vig's original complaint also named Rajen-drapal K. Shikh as a defendant. Because his first amended complaint made no allegations against her, the district court dismissed her from the case. Vig does not challenge that ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-9\">.
