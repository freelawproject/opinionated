While he concedes that, following his 2002 drug conviction, he violated the terms of his supervised release by being convicted of driving while intoxicated, he notes that the district court\u2019s finding that he assaulted a public servant resulted in a higher guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l) and 7B 1.4(a). In that regard, he contends that the testimony presented by the Government to show that he assaulted a public servant was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-21\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Spraglin, 418 </em>F.3d 479, 480 (5th Cir.2005). We must defer to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See United States v. Gon</em>c<em>alves, </em>613 F.3d 601, 609 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cIt is not this Court\u2019s function to pass on a district court\u2019s determination regarding the credibility of the witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Alaniz-Alaniz, 38 </em>F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.1994). Nevertheless, this court \u201cmay find testimony to be \u2018incredible as a matter of law,\u2019 if the witness testifies to facts that he \u2018physically could not have observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-22\">The magistrate judge (MJ) held a hearing to determine whether to revoke Lu-per\u2019s supervised release. After listening to the testimony of four police officers as well as the testimony of Luper and another witness in support of Luper, the MJ found that Luper assaulted one of the police officers, and the district court adopted the MJ\u2019s finding. We must defer to the district court\u2019s determination that the officers\u2019 testimony, which was not \u201cincredible as a matter of law,\u201d was credible. <em>See Alaniz-Alaniz, </em>38 F.3d at 791. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
