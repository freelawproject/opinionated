After his convictions for three counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child and one count of sexual battery on a victim who was less than 12 years old, Parker sought postconviction relief on the ground that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to respond adequately to a motion in limine to exclude evidence that his victims had recanted other allegations of abuse. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850. The Florida courts concluded that trial counsel performed de-ficiently, but Parker was not prejudiced by the deficient performance. Because the Florida courts reasonably applied clearly established federal law, we affirm the denial of Parker\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">When he collaterally attacked his convictions in state court, Parker argued that, had his counsel responded effectively to the motion in limine, he could have challenged the victims\u2019 credibility with evidence that they had previously recanted other accusations of abuse. Parker argued that he was convicted solely on the testimony of the three victims and the exclusion of evidence regarding their credibility was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">A Florida court denied Parker\u2019s motion, but the Second District Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The appellate court ruled that trial counsel performed deficiently because she was not familiar with <em>Joggers v. State, </em>536 So.2d 321 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1988), which held that a defendant accused of sexual abuse could impeach minor victims with evidence that they had recanted other allegations of sexual abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 326-27. The appellate court remanded for an evi-dentiary hearing to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>Parker was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">On remand, the Florida court denied Parker\u2019s motion summarily on the ground that his proffered impeachment evidence was inadmissible hearsay, but the appellate court reversed and remanded. The Second District Court of Appeals concluded that the lower court could not ascertain the character of the evidence without hearing any testimony from Parker\u2019s witnesses. The appellate court remanded with instructions for Parker to \u201cpresent admissible evidence \u2014 if he can \u2014 that had trial counsel effectively defended the State\u2019s motion in limine, he would have been able to properly impeach two of the victims with evidence that they had previously made and recanted similar accusations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">During the evidentiary hearing, members of Parker\u2019s family testified about pri- or accusations allegedly made by M.B. against Don Sports. Parker\u2019s stepdaughter, Helen Penniker Smith, testified that M.B., her stepdaughter, said that she was \u201ctouched\u201d by Don, Smith\u2019s former stepfather; M.B. did not identify where she had been touched but said that it made her uncomfortable; and M.B. repeated her accusation to Don and Smith\u2019s mother and then recanted. Smith acknowledged that she never mentioned the incident involving Don during previous hearings in Parker\u2019s case and that she believed the incident could have happened. Parker\u2019s wife, Jimmie, who formerly had been married to Don, testified that Don moved out of their house for a few months after being accused by M.B., even though M.B. had recanted the accusation. But Don testified that M.B. did not recant in Jimmie\u2019s presence. According to Don, M.B. apologized to him later and said she made up the story because she was mad at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Smith also testified that M.B. had accused Parker of instructing her to run around the house naked. Smith, opined that Parker\u2019s remark had been \u201cblown out of proportion,\u201d but Smith acknowledged that M.B. had never recanted the accusation. But Jimmie testified that M.B. had recanted. Jimmie explained that Parker made the remark because M.B. needed a bath and did not have any clean clothes to wear.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Jimmie testified that another one of her husband\u2019s victims, B.S., had falsely accused her father, Lester Smith, of molestation. B.S. told her mother and Jimmie that Smith \u201cmessed with her.\u201d B.S.\u2019s mother confronted Smith, but she did not inform the authorities because she needed Smith\u2019s assistance to pay for Christmas presents. Smith admitted to Jimmie, his adoptive mother, \u201cthat he did it thinking it was [his wife] in the bed with him,\u201d but Jimmie also did not report the abuse to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">The Florida court denied Parker\u2019s motion a third time on the grounds that the evidence was inadmissible and, alternatively, the evidence would not have changed the outcome of Parker\u2019s trial. Parker could not use the evidence to impeach the victims under <em>Jaggers, </em>the Florida court determined, because the testimony that established M.B.\u2019s accusation against Don was biased, \u201cunreliable[,] and overly vague,\u201d which destroyed its \u201cprobative value\u201d and its \u201cimpeachment value\u201d; M.S.\u2019s accusation against Parker did not involve sexual abuse; and B.S.\u2019s accusation against her father was not false. In the alternative, the Florida court ruled that the evidence would not have affected the outcome of Parker\u2019s case. The Florida court determined that \u201csome of the testimony further substantiate^] that the allegations of [M.B. and B.S.] were in fact true\u201d; the \u201cvery vague and imprecise\u201d testimony about Don touching M.B. would not have \u201cmaterially undermined\u201d M.B.\u2019s cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>ibility; the evidence that Parker told M.B. to run around naked \u201cwould not have impeached [M.B.\u2019s] credibility (because it turned out to be true), nor would it have materially harmed [Parker\u2019s] case (because it was essentially an innocent, non-abusive event that was somehow blown out of proportion ..and the testimony that Smith abused B.S. without repercussion from his family \u201cgreatly <em>bolster[ed] </em>[her] credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Parker filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the district court denied. The district court ruled that Parker could not prove he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance because the victims\u2019 earlier accusations were not admissible under Florida law and that the exclusion of the evidence did not violate Parker\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const. Amend. VI. The district court issued a certificate of appeal-ability to determine \u201cwhether trial counsel\u2019s deficient opposition to the State\u2019s motion in limine [sic] requesting the exclusion of any evidence regarding previous allegations of abuse made by the victims prejudiced Petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Mason v. Allen, </em>605 F.3d 1114, 1118 (11th Cir.2010). Our review is circumscribed by the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which \u201cimposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings, and demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>559 U.S. 766, 773, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1862, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Under the Act, a petitioner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court reached a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).. We presume that the findings of fact by the state court are correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">For Parker to prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must prove that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by the deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). It is not enough for Parker to prove that counsel\u2019s alleged errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the trial; Parker must prove that the allegedly deficient performance \u201cactually had an adverse effect on the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067. In other words, Parker cannot obtain a federal habeas relief unless \u201ccounsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">The district court correctly denied Parker habeas relief. The Florida courts concluded that the proffered impeachment evidence did not satisfy the standard for admissibility delineated in <em>loggers, </em>and we defer to that conclusion. <em>See Callahan v. Campbell, </em>427 F.3d 897, 932 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is a fundamental principle that state courts are the final arbiters of state law, and federal habeas courts should not second-guess them on such matters.\u201d (quoting <em>Herring v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>397 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2005))). And the Florida courts reasonably concluded that Parker failed to prove that, even if the proffered impeachment evidence had been admitted into evidence, the jury \u201cwould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>[not] have had a reasonable doubt respecting [his] guilt.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-69. The Florida courts found that Parker\u2019s proffered impeachment evidence as a whole tended to strengthen two of his victims\u2019 credibility, and Parker did not offer any evidence to impeach the credibility of his third victim. The Florida courts reasonably concluded that Parker was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Parker argues that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance denied him the opportunity to confront the victims, but we cannot review that claim. Appellate review is limited to the issues delineated in the certificate of appealability. <em>Jordan v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Carr., </em>485 F.3d 1351, 1356 (1 1th Cir.2007). Because Parker\u2019s argument is outside the scope of the certificate, we dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">We AFFIRM the denial of Parker\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
