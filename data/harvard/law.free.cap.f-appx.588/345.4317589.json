Ibarra-Alcarez had argued that \u201cextraordinary and compelling circumstances\u201d made him a good candidate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>for a sentence reduction. The district court concluded that the limited number of circumstances in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c) permitting the court to modify a previously-imposed sentence did not apply in Ibarra-Alcarez\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582 for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). To the extent that Ibarra-Alca-rez suggests that despite his having specifically referenced \u00a7 3582(c) in his motion, the district court should not have construed his motion as being filed pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c), his argument is unavailing because he cannot rely on any of his other statutory or procedural references as a vehicle to request a sentence modification. In particular, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.13 of the Sentencing Guidelines is merely a policy statement advising district courts when to grant a sentence reduction motion filed by the director of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). Also, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(p) merely outlines one of the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s duties. In addition, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(g) states that upon motion by the BOP, the sentencing court may reduce a minimum sentence term to time served. Given that Ibarra-Alvarez stated that his motion was being brought in conjunction with \u00a7 3582(c) and that the BOP had not filed a motion for a sentence reduction in Ibarra-Alcarez\u2019s case, it was not improper for the district court to construe his motion as being brought pursuant to \u00a7 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The sentence imposed upon a judgment of conviction is generally final and may be modified in only a limited number of circumstances such as (1) where the director of the BOP moves, as outlined in \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A), for a sentence reduction based upon \u201cextraordinary and compelling reasons\u201d and indicates that a reduction is consistent with the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; (2) where, as outlined in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant was sentenced based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission; (3) where permitted by the provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742; and (4) if the sentence is outside of the guideline range, where permitted by the provisions of \u00a7 3742. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(b); <em>United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1997) (noting that a district court\u2019s jurisdiction to correct or modify a final sentence is limited to those specific circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 3582(b)). None of the arguments raised in Ibarra-Alcarez\u2019s motion fell within any of these limited circumstances; therefore, the district court did not have jurisdiction to correct or modify his sentence. <em>See Bridges, </em>116 F.3d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ibarra-Alcarez\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672. Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
