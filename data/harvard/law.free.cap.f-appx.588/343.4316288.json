He argues that the district court plainly erred in determining that his Texas conviction for delivery of cocaine by actual transfer was a drug trafficking offense for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). He argues that the Texas statute criminalizes the \u201cadministering\u201d and \u201cdispensing\u201d of drugs, which is not covered by the Guidelines or 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). Because he did not present this argument to the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). To establish plain error, Monjaraz Salas must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute, and the clear or obvious error must have affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d 415, 419-423 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc). If he establishes that there was clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Monjaraz Salas has identified no prior Texas case applying the statute in an \u201cadministering\u201d or \u201cdispensing\u201d situation. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-61 (5th Cir.2014). A theoretical possibility that the statute might encompass types of conduct that would not qualify as a drug trafficking offense is insufficient. <em>United States v. Carrasco-Tercero, </em>745 F.3d 192, 197-98 (5th Cir.2014). Therefore, the district court did not commit plain error in determining that Monjaraz Salas\u2019s conviction was a drug trafficking offense for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) enhancement. <em>See Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 461-62 &amp; n. 5. For the same reasons, the district court did not commit plain error in determining that Monjaraz Salas\u2019s Texas conviction was also an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). <em>See id. </em>at 457 n. 1, 461-62 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
