He now appeals, arguing that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Because Rodriguez did not object to his sentence in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">Rodriguez argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to fulfill the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). He contends that because the illegal reentry offense level is based on a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record and because he was convicted of robbery six years ago, his resulting sentencing range was too severe. Rodriguez further contends that his sentence creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity because the median illegal reentry sentence in 2010 was 15 months of imprisonment. Rodriguez argues that his sentence does not accurately account for the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-22\">Because Rodriguez was sentenced within the advisory guidelines range, his sentence is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). That Rodriguez\u2019s prior robbery offense resulted in a light sentence and occurred six years before his illegal reentry offense does not suffice to rebut the presumption that his sentence is reasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). Further, his unwarranted-sentencing-disparity argument ignores \u201cthe enhancements or adjustments for the aggravating or mitigating factors that distinguish individual cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Willingham, </em>497 F.3d 541, 544 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-23\">Rodriguez is essentially asking to have his sentence vacated based on our reweighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. However, \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Rodriguez has not shown that the district court plainly erred when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>sentenced him to 48-months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
