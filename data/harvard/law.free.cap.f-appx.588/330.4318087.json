He argues that his 33-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to take account of his cultural assimilation and the fact that his criminal history category of VI overrepresented his criminal history. In connection with that argument, he states the requirements for a downward departure for cultural assimilation pursuant to Application Note 8 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">To the extent that Valencia-Cardenas contends that the district court erred in denying him a downward departure under Application Note 8 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based upon cultural assimilation, we lack jurisdiction to review his claim. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, Valeneia-Cardenas\u2019s arguments regarding his cultural assimilation and criminal history are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness given to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Valencia-Cardenas has failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. His sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
