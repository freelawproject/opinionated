He contends that his prior conviction for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 29.03(a)(2) does not constitute a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and that, for this reason, the district court erred in assessing the 16-level enhancement of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-19\">In support of his arguments, Hernandez-Mejia contends that his prior aggravated robbery offense does not qualify as the offense of robbery enumerated in the definition of crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 because his Texas statute of conviction incorporates all Chapter 31 theft offenses under the Texas Penal Code, including theft by deception. He contends that theft by deception falls outside the generic definition of theft and that the Texas aggravated robbery statute thus criminalizes conduct outside the generic meaning of robbery. Because theft by deception under Texas law does not deviate from the generic crime of theft, Hernandez-Mejia\u2019s argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d 437, 438 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">Hernandez-Mejia additionally argues that his Texas offense does not have an element requiring the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against another person and that, for this reason, the offense does not qualify as a crime of violence under the residual clause included in the definition of crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. The definition of crime of violence is an either/or proposition. <em>See United States v. Olalde-Hernandez, </em>630 F.3d 372, 374 (5th Cir.2011). Because Hernandez-Mejia\u2019s prior offense qualifies as the enumerated offense of robbery, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>address his argument about the residual \u201cforce\u201d clause. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
