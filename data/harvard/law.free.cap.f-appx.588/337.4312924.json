The district court sentenced him to 12 months in prison, within the range of 8-14 months recommended by the guidelines policy statement and below the three-year statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">Lawrence claims that the district court abused its discretion by not sentencing him at the bottom of the range. He contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2), and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-23\">Revocation sentences generally are reviewed under a \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(4). Although Lawrence objected generally to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence, he did not raise the specific grounds he now urges on appeal. Accordingly, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 332 (5th Cir.2013); <em>see Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (iterating the four-step plain-error standard of review). Under either standard, we would uphold the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-24\">We presume that the revocation sentence within the range is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-25\">In determining the sentence within the range, the district court considered Lawrence\u2019s history, his violations, his request to be allowed to remain on supervised release to enter a treatment facility to address his addiction, and his previous opportunity to remain on supervision while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>he attended a drug-treatment program. He essentially seeks to have this court reweigh certain \u00a7 3558(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 332 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Lawrence has not shown that the district court failed to consider any significant factors, gave undue weight to any improper factors, or clearly erred in balancing the sentencing factors. Thus, he has not rebutted the presumption that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
