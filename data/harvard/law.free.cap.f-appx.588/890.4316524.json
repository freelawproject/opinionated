Dawson challenges that sentence on two grounds. First, Dawson argues that the district court erred in giving him a two-level enhancement for an offense involving ten or more victims pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2B 1.1(b)(2)(A) because he reimbursed at least two of the eleven victims. Dawson also filed a motion to modify the record on appeal pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 10(e) to include evidence that he reimbursed a third victim. Second, Dawson argues that the district court clearly erred in determining that his offense conduct warranted a two-level enhancement for using sophisticated means under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). After careful consideration, we affirm Dawson\u2019s sentence and deny his motion to modify the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">Dawson pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. As area director of the Rural Utilities Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, Dawson defrauded various local water and electric authorities by way of fraudulent representations and promises. To accomplish the scheme, Dawson opened a checking account in the name of \u201cRyal Development Farm d/b/a/ Ricky Nelson Dawson,\u201d received checks that were intended as payments to the Department of Agriculture, and without authority, deposited the checks into the \u201cRyal\u201d account. Over the course of five years, Dawson deposited checks totaling $6,225,920.76 from ten different local water authorities and one electric utility. Dawson regularly transferred funds from the \u201cRyal\u201d account to other personal accounts he kept at different banks. Dawson also used funds from later checks to make payments to the authorities he had previously defrauded, as well as to the Department of Agriculture.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">At sentencing, Dawson objected to two findings made in the presentence report: first, that Dawson\u2019s offense involved ten or more victims, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2B1. l(b)(2)(A)(i), and second, that Dawson\u2019s offense involved \u201csophisticated means,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). The district judge overruled both objections, while noting that he would probably have imposed a lesser sentence if he had sustained either objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Dawson now challenges both findings. Dawson also filed a motion to amend the record under Federal Rule of Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Procedure 10(e) because he claims to have new evidence that proves he has reimbursed another victim of his crime since his sentencing. Though the district court denied a similar motion below, the motion is still pending before this Court. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Dawson argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by two points based on a finding that his offense involved ten or more victims. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(A)(i). We review <em>de novo </em>the interpretation and application of the Guidelines, including whether someone is a \u201cvictim.\u201d <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 632 (11th Cir.2007). The Guidelines Application Notes define a \u201cvictim\u201d as \u201cany person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection (b)(1).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 comment. n. 1. The Guidelines define \u201cactual loss\u201d as \u201creasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 comment, n. 3(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Dawson asks this Court to adopt the reasoning from <em>United States v. Yogar, </em>404 F.3d 967 (6th Cir.2005), in which the Sixth Circuit concluded that certain account holders were not victims within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) because they had been fully reimbursed by third parties following a temporary and minor loss. <em>Id. </em>at 971-72. However, in <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881 (11th Cir.2005), this Court specifically declined to follow <em>Yagar. See id </em>at 895. Beyond that, even when we assumed that <em>Yagar\u2019s </em>reasoning was correct, we held that people who had been reimbursed were still \u201cvictims\u201d under the Guidelines when they \u201csuffered considerably more than a small out-of-pocket loss and were not immediately reimbursed.... \u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Nikoghosyan, </em>408 Fed.Appx. 272, 274 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (\u201c[0]ur holding in Lee is consistent with the recently updated commentary for \u00a7 2B1.1, which defines a \u2018victim\u2019 without regard to whether an individual is subsequently reimbursed.\u201d). We are bound to follow this precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Here, Dawson repaid $799,172.79 to the West Dallas Water Authority five months after he took it, and reimbursed $28,000 to the Hobson Water System four months after he took it. The amounts were neither \u201csmall out-of-pocket loss[es]\u201d nor were they \u201cimmediately reimbursed.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>427 F.3d at 895. Lee\u2019s reasoning governs squarely here, and all eleven of the water authorities and electric utilities that suffered losses were \u201cvictims\u201d for the purposes of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">We also deny Dawson\u2019s related motion to modify the record on appeal. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(e)(2) provides that \u201c[i]f anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be certified\u201d by the parties\u2019 stipulation, the district court, or this Court. The Rule \u201cdoes not empower a district court to modify parties\u2019 stipulations or make new findings of fact after docketing of the appeal in the court of appeals.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>493 F.2d 906, 907 (5th Cir.1974) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, because evidence of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>reimbursed victim was never introduced before the district court, Dawson may not now supplement our record with this new evidence. We also decline to use our inherent power to supplement the record \u201cin the interests of justice.\u201d <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. City of Garden City, </em>235 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2000). Because we are bound by our prior decision in <em>Lee, </em>evidence of an additional victim that was reimbursed will not affect that outcome. Finally, even if we ignore <em>Lee, </em>it is not necessary to supplement the record in order to reduce the number of victims below ten. For each of these reasons, Dawson\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Dawson separately argues that the district court clearly erred in determining that his offense conduct involved \u201csophisticated means,\u201d resulting in a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). According to the Guidelines Notes, \u201csophisticated means\u201d refers to \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense\u201d and is often indicated by \u201c[c]onduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 comment, n. 8(B). This Court has said that \u201c[t]here is no requirement that each of a defendant\u2019s individual actions be sophisticated in order to impose the enhancement. Rather, it is sufficient if the totality of the scheme was sophisticated.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010). On clear error review, we reverse the district court only if \u201cwe are left with a definite and firm conviction that\u201d it erred. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Under this deferential standard of review, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in its \u201csophisticated means\u201d determination. Dawson\u2019s scheme was carried out over a five-year period. He used his managerial position with the Department of Agriculture and his specialized knowledge of the Department\u2019s loan and grant programs to produce forged and fraudulent documents containing prepayment and installment plans and instructing authorities to remit overpayments. <em>See United States v. Clarke, </em>562 F.3d 1158, 1166 (11th Cir.2009) (noting in approving a \u201csophisticated means\u201d determination that the scheme \u201ccovered a three-year period and required intricate planning\u201d). To transfer the money to himself and conceal that transfer, Dawson created a fictitious company, \u201cRyal Development,\u201d for ease in altering and depositing checks made out to \u201cRural Development.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 comment, n. 8(B) (noting that sophisticated means are often indicated by \u201c[ejonduct such as hiding assets ... through the use of fictitious entities\u201d). He further concealed his actions by transferring the stolen money among multiple accounts, and by using the money from later thefts to reimburse victims of earlier thefts. In sum, he received eighteen checks from eleven different water or electric authorities totaling over $6 million. While each individual act may not have been particularly \u201csophisticated,\u201d Dawson\u2019s overall scheme could surely be said to inyolve \u201csophisticated means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Although the three cases Dawson <em>cites</em>\u2014United <em>States v. Williams, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 941 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam), <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>500 Fed.Appx. 831 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam), and <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>497 Fed.Appx. 931 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam)\u2014may well have involved schemes more sophisticated than the one here, this Court has never established those cases as a floor for the \u201csophisticated means\u201d enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>ment. Dawson\u2019s conduct involved numerous steps, affected multiple victims, spanned several years, and required specialized knowledge. On this evidence, the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The district court\u2019s sentencing determination is AFFIRMED and Dawson\u2019s motion to modify the record on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-7\">.

City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
