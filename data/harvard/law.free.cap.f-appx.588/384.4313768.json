He contends that his conviction of evading arrest or detention using a motor vehicle under section 38.04 of the Texas Penal Code did not qualify as a violent felony for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). He further contends that the residual clause of the ACCA, which provides that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), is unconstitutionally vague and should be found void for vagueness. Hornyak concedes that his arguments are foreclosed, but he raises them to preserve them for further review, and he requests reexamination of <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531 (5th Cir.2009), in which we held that a conviction under \u00a7 38.04 qualifies as a violent felony, in light of <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). The Government moves for summary affirmance of Horn-yak\u2019s conviction, as all of his contentions are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In <em>Harrimon, </em>we held that a \u00a7 38.04(b)(1) offense is a violent felony under the ACCA because \u201cfleeing by vehicle poses a serious risk of injury to others.\u201d <em>Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d at 532-33, 536 (considering substantively identical version of \u00a7 38.04 to that at issue in this case). We have held in several unpublished opinions that <em>Sykes </em>validated our decision in <em>Harri-mon. See United States v. Spann, </em>562 Fed.Appx. 237, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 220, 190 L.Ed.2d 168 (2014); <em>United States v. Hoover, </em>548 Fed.Appx. 300, 301 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1804, 188 L.Ed.2d 769 (2014); <em>United States v. Standberry, </em>546 Fed.Appx. 381, 382 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. McCullough, </em>475 Fed.Appx. 983, 983 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>466 Fed.Appx. 390, 391 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Tubbs, </em>446 Fed.Appx. 705, 706 (5th Cir.2011). We also have rejected the arguments that the Texas statute for evading arrest with a vehicle is not a violent felony because it can be committed by fleeing in any vehicle, not just a motor vehicle, and that <em>Sykes </em>overruled <em>Harrimon </em>because it emphasized the use of a motor vehicle. <em>See Spann, </em>562 Fed.Appx. at 238; <em>Standberry, </em>546 Fed.Appx. at 382. Moreover, we have rejected the argument that the Texas offense of evading arrest might not constitute a violent felony because Texas law imposes different penalties based on the degree of risk posed by a defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>See United States v. Holston, </em>471 Fed.Appx. 308, 309 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>451 Fed.Appx. 415, 416 (5th Cir.2011). Finally, the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that the residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague. <em>United States v. Gore, </em>636 F.3d 728, 742 (5th Cir.2011) (citing <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">\u201cIt is a firm rule of this circuit that in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court, a panel cannot overrule a' prior panel\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999). Hornyak\u2019s contentions thus are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>AFFIRMED. Motion for summary affir-mance GRANTED.
