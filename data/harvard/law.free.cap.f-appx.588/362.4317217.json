Ramos contends that he was denied early release on the basis of a 26-year-old aggravated assault conviction and argues that the BOP\u2019s regulation that categorically excludes inmates from eligibility for early release based on any prior enumerated conviction, regardless of age, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-23\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Every federal prisoner with a substance abuse problem has the opportunity to participate in substance abuse treatment, and the BOP, subject to the availability of appropriations, must provide residential substance abuse treatment for eligible prisoners. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(1). Prisoners convicted of nonviolent offenses who successfully complete a treatment program are eligible for a reduction in sentence for a term not to exceed one year. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-24\">Under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.55(b)(4)(iv) (2009), however, prisoners who have a pri- or conviction for aggravated assault are deemed ineligible for \u00a7 3621(e) early release. Ramos insists that a stale conviction cannot be used as a basis for declaring him ineligible for early release. In <em>Handley v. Chapman, </em>587 F.3d 273, 282 (5th Cir.2009), however, we upheld \u00a7 550.55(b) and determined that the BOP\u2019s rationale for categorical exclusion did not violate the APA. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment, albeit on alternative grounds. <em>See Hanchey v. Energas Co., </em>925 F.2d 96, 97 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
