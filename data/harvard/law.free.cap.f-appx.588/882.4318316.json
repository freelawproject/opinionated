(\u201cLPS\u201d), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (\u201cFNIS\u201d), Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (\u201cFNF\u201d), Lender Processing Services Default Solutions, Inc. (\u201cLPSDS\u201d), and Dory Goebel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coursen\u2019s complaint challenges the 2006 foreclosure judgment on her home and purports to assert claims for violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cFDUTPA\u201d), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act (\u201cFCCPA\u201d), civil conspiracy, abuse of legal process, and violations of federal civil RICO statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961, 1962(b) and 1964. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">In 2001, Coursen executed and delivered a promissory note and mortgage to North American Mortgage Company. Shortly thereafter, Coursen began making mortgage payments to Washington Mutual Bank (\u201cWAMU\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">In September 2006, when Coursen failed to make several mortgage payments, WAMU \u2014 represented by SFG \u2014 filed a foreclosure action against her. Coursen contested the foreclosure action arguing, among other things, that WAMU lacked standing to foreclose. In October 2006, an assignment of mortgage (\u201c2006 AOM\u201d) was executed and recorded, assigning Cour-sen\u2019s mortgage to WAMU as attorney-in-fact for Fannie Mae.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">In November 2006, WAMU filed a motion for summary judgment. In support of its motion, WAMU filed an affidavit from Goebel (\u201cGoebel Affidavit\u201d), in which Goe-bel averred that Coursen\u2019s mortgage had been in default since May 2006 and set forth the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan. The state court granted WAMU\u2019s summary judgment motion and entered final judgment against Coursen on 27 November 2006 (\u201c2006 foreclosure judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">Despite obtaining final judgment, WAMU (which was later acquired by JPMorgan Chase, N.A.) continued to work with Coursen over the next several years as Coursen pursued a permanent loan modification. During that time, Coursen filed several motions to cancel the foreclosure sale and also sought to set aside the 2006 foreclosure judgment based on WAMU\u2019s alleged fraud. The state court denied Coursen\u2019s various attempts to vacate the foreclosure judgment. The foreclosure sale took place in November 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">In August 2010, Coursen filed this civil action in state court solely against \u201cJ.P. Morgan Chase, f/k/a Washington Mutual Bank.\u201d The state court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. In March 2012, Coursen filed the pertinent amended complaint in this case. Defendants removed the case to federal district court and then moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. In two reasoned and detailed opinions, the district court concluded that Coursen\u2019s claims against Defendants (1) were barred by federal and state litigation privilege, (2) were barred by collateral estoppel, (3) were untimely, (4) failed on the merits, and (5) failed because Coursen suffered no damages. The district court also concluded that Coursen\u2019s claims against LPS failed because LPS was not in existence when the 2006 foreclosure judgment was issued. Because Coursen had failed to allege facts connecting FNIS and FNF to her alleged harm, the district court concluded that FNIS and FNF were entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Shop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if the evidence establishes \u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCormick v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>333 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Having reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s orders, we see no genuine issue of material fact and no reversible error. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">About the timeliness of Coursen\u2019s claims, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Coursen\u2019s claims are time-barred. Each of Coursen\u2019s claims is governed by a statute of limitations ranging from between one and four years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Coursen argues only that Defendants engaged in unlawful acts (including mainly the preparation and execution of the 2006 AOM and the Goebel Affidavit) in an attempt to obtain improperly the 2006 foreclosure judgment. (Coursen does not challenge the actual foreclosure sale itself.) Because the complained-of injury was the 2006 foreclosure judgment, Coursen\u2019s claims accrued, at the latest, on 27 November 2006, when final judgment was entered against her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Coursen\u2019s corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>plaint was not filed until March 2012\u2014 more than five years after her claims accrued \u2014 each of her claims is barred by the pertinent statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Even <em>if </em>Coursen\u2019s claims had been timely and not otherwise barred, we agree that Coursen\u2019s claims fail on the merits because she has failed to establish all the necessary elements of her claims. In particular, Coursen has shown no damages resulting from Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct: a necessary element for each of her claims. Although her home was foreclosed upon, Coursen concedes that she failed to make several loan payments. As a result, Coursen defaulted on her mortgage loan and was subject to foreclosure. Coursen complains that she suffered damages in the form of losing her home, losing the equity in her home, having her credit damaged, and pain and suffering. Because these damages are attributable to Cour-sen\u2019s own failure to maintain her mortgage payments, Coursen cannot establish a causal link between her damages and Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct. Thus, Cour-sen\u2019s claims fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">For these reasons, and for the reasons given by the district court, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-10\">. Defendants JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., JPMor-gan Chase Bank, N.A., Washington Mutual Bank, and Federal National Mortgage Corporation have been dismissed and are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-6\">. In ruling on Defendants' motions for summary judgment, the district court applied correctly the summary judgment standard and considered expressly Coursen's \"Statement of Disputed Facts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\">. <em>See Olson v. Johnson, </em>961 So.2d 356, 359 (Fla.Ct.App.2007) (the statute of limitations for civil conspiracy is four years, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(o)); <em>Callaway Land &amp; Cattle Co. v. Banyon Lakes C. Corp., </em>831 So.2d 204, 208 (Fla.Ct.App.2002) (abuse of process claims are governed by a four-year statute of limitations, pursuant to Fla. Stat. 95.11(3)(p)); <em>S. Motor Co. v. Doktorczyk, </em>957 So.2d 1215, 1217 (Fla.Ct.App.2007) (four-year statute of limitations for filing claims under the FDUT-PA); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.77(4) (establishing a two-year statute of limitations for claims under the FCCPA); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d) (establishing one-year statute of limitations for claims under the FDCPA); <em>Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp; </em>Ass., <em>Inc., </em>483 U.S. 143, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 2767, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987) (imposing a four-year statute of limitations on civil RICO claims).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b905-14\">. We reject Coursen\u2019s argument that \u2014 because Defendants allegedly prevented her from discovering that she was a \"victim of fraud\u201d \u2014 her RICO claim did not accrue until later. Instead, Coursen's RICO claim accrued at the time of her injury \u2014 the 2006 foreclosure judgment-even if she had not yet discovered Defendants\u2019 alleged pattern of RICO acts. <em>See Rotella v. Wood, </em>528 U.S. 549, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 1080-81, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000) (federal civil RICO claims accrue upon discovery of the injury, not the discovery of the pattern of RICO activity). To the extent that FDCPA claims are subject to equitable tolling, Coursen has not established \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting equitable tolling of the accrual of her FDCPA claim. <em>See Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999) (\"Equitable tolling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>is appropriate when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d). And we are unpersuaded by Coursen\u2019s argument that the 2011 foreclosure sale constituted a \"new violation\u201d under the FCCPA, for purposes of restarting the statute of limitations clock: her argument runs this way \u2014 merely because the sale could not have taken place but for the 2006 foreclosure judgment, which relied in part on the offending Goebel Affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
