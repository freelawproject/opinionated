California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Cuellar has moved to strike the <em>Anders </em>brief, appoint substitute counsel, or proceed pro se on appeal. To the extent his motion raises claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we decline to consider them without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-21\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Cuellar\u2019s motion. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Cuellar\u2019s motion to strike the <em>Anders </em>brief, appoint substitute counsel, or proceed pro se on appeal is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
