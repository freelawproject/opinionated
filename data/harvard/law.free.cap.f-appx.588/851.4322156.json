He challenges his 292-month sentence, asserting that it was imposed in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights as interpreted in <em>Al-leyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). He also contends that -the district court wrongly denied his request for <em>coram no-bis </em>relief and his application for a writ of <em>audita querela.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">A federal prisoner seeking to collaterally attack the validity of his sentence generally must do so by filing a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). If he fails to obtain relief under \u00a7 2255, the prisoner may challenge his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in limited circumstances. <em>See id. </em>To proceed under that provision, a prisoner must satisfy a stringent jurisdictional test by showing that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See Bryant v. Warden, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1274 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation marks omitted). That jurisdictional test has five elements: (1) throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our binding precedent had specifically and squarely foreclosed the claim raised in his \u00a7 2241 petition; (2) after his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the Supreme Court overturned our binding precedent; (3) the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning our precedent applies retroactively on collateral review; (4) because of the Supreme Court\u2019s retroactively applicable decision, the petitioner\u2019s current sentence exceeds the statutory maximum; and (5) the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his claim. <em>See id.; see also Jeanty v. Warden, </em>No. 13-14931, 757 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">In this case, Garcia cannot meet the third <em>Bryant </em>element: that the Supreme Court decision on which his claim relies applies retroactively on collateral review. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. Asserting that his sentence is unlawful, Garcia relies exclusively on the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). But we recently held that <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>See Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1285 (noting that the \u00a7 2241 petitioner \u201cdoes not meet <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>third requirement because <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review\u201d). Therefore, <em>Jeanty </em>forecloses Garcia\u2019s claim, and the district court correctly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Garcia a writ of <em>coram nobis, </em>and it did not err when it denied him a writ of <em>audita querela. \u201cCoram nobis </em>relief is unavailable to a person ... who is still in custody,\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>181 F.3d 1274, 1274 (11th Cir.1999), and it is undisputed that Garcia is still in custody. A writ of <em>audita quere-la </em>is unavailable when a prisoner\u2019s claim is of the type that is cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175. Garcia\u2019s claim \u2014 that his sentence was imposed in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights\u2014 is of the type cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number><em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a) (\u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States ... may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\u201d)- Therefore, he is not entitled to a writ of <em>audita querela.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether Garcia was entitled to seek habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 and whether he was entitled to a writ of <em>audita querela. Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
