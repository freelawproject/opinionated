Giron appeals the district court\u2019s determination that his prior Texas conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance qualified as a drug trafficking offense warranting a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). He argues that the Texas statute criminalizes the \u201cadministering\u201d of drugs, which is not covered by the Guideline. Because Giron preserved this argument in the district court, our review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 548 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-25\">Giron has failed to show that there is a realistic possibility that a person either would be prosecuted for \u201cadministering\u201d methamphetamine as that term is defined under the Texas statute or could \u201cadminister\u201d methamphetamine in a manner that did not also constitute \u201cdispensing\u201d or \u201cdistributing\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014). Moreover, he has identified no prior Texas case applying the statute in an \u201cadministering\u201d situation. <em>See id. </em>at 460-61. A theoretical possibility that a statute might encompass types of conduct that would not qualify as a drug trafficking offense is insufficient. <em>See United States v. Carrasco-Tercero, </em>745 F.3d 192, 197-98 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-26\">Thus, the district court was correct in determining that Giron\u2019s conviction was a drug trafficking offense for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement. <em>See Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 461-62 &amp; n. 5. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-19\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
