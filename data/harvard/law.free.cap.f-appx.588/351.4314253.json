Ortega alleged that Texas Department of Correctional Justice (\u201cTDCJ\u201d) employees Brad Livingston, Jason Heaton, Barry Martin, Norvel Arnold, Kendall Richerson, and Keith January repeatedly canceled outdoor recreation and did not permit Ortega to exercise in the day room, that Ortega was unable to exercise in his dual-occupancy cell, and that TDCJ chief of classification Gary Messer did not classify Ortega for a single-occupancy cell, all in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ortega asserted that the lack of opportunity to exercise outside his cell interfered with his treatment for back pain that results from deteriorated spinal discs, arthritis, and bone spurs. Because the lack of exercise prevented such therapy, Ortega claimed, the dearth of out-of-cell exercise caused him pain, stress, and fear for his physical safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-22\">We review Ortega\u2019s challenge <em>de novo. See Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>(5th Cir.2009). We will uphold the dismissal for failure to state a claim if, taking Ortega\u2019s \u201callegations as true, it appears that no relief could be granted based on [his] alleged facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the district court properly dismissed for failure to state a claim, we do not consider separately whether the complaint was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">As to the defendants\u2019 knowledge of medical needs or inmates\u2019 need for out-of-cell exercise generally, Ortega contends that exercise is a basic human need, that his physician ordered physical therapy generally, and that he filed offender-medical-request forms that went unheeded. As to the defendants\u2019 actions, Ortega asserts that his prison unit \u201calways cancelled recreation\u201d and that \u201con some occasions\u201d all of the defendants cancelled outdoor recreation, while \u201con other occasions\u201d they denied him the opportunity to exercise in the day room. Such vague, conclusional, and inconsistent assertions fail to show the sort of subjective knowledge of, and wanton disregard for, Ortega\u2019s medical needs or a risk of serious harm as would state a claim under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Domino v. TDCJ, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The judgment is therefore AFFIRMED. Ortega\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. His motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is DENIED because the district court has already granted him authorization so to proceed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
