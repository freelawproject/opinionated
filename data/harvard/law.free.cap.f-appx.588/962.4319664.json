Hovind received a Notice of Deficiency in 2009 relating to the 1998 to 2006 tax years, based on Hovind\u2019s alleged failure to file an individual tax return for those years. Hovind timely filed a counseled petition to contest the deficiency in February 2010, alleging that he was not liable for any deficiency because Pensacola, Florida, where he lived during the years relevant to the deficiency notice, \u201cha[d] not been located within any internal revenue district since at least 1999.\u201d He also asserted that he was a minister of Creation Science Evangelism (\u201cCSE\u201d) and that the notice had improperly attributed CSE\u2019s income to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">More than three years later, on March 15, 2013, the Tax Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for entry of decision, finding that deficiencies, penalties, and additions to Hovind\u2019s tax were due as stated in the deficiency notice. In its final order, the Tax Court noted that Hovind had failed to respond to the Commissioner\u2019s motion as directed by the court in both January and February 2013. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">On appeal, Hovind argues that the Tax Court\u2019s final order was unconstitutional because, as a federal prisoner subject to frequent facility transfers, he had not received notice of relevant motions and orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further argues that his activities as a minister for CSE were not taxable and that the amounts in the deficiency notice were inconsistent with the IRS\u2019s internal records. After careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">We review for an abuse of discretion the Tax Court\u2019s entry of a decision on a notice of deficiency based on the petitioner\u2019s failure to properly prosecute a petition for a redetermination of the deficiency. <em>See Crandall v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>650 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir. Unit B July 1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">A notice of deficiency \u201cis the taxpayer\u2019s ticket to the Tax Court\u201d to obtain a rede-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>termination of his tax liability. <em>L.V. Castle Inv. Grp., Inc. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>465 F.3d 1248, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having received a notice of deficiency, a taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213. The Commissioner\u2019s determination of a tax deficiency is presumed correct, and the taxpayer has the burden of showing that it is erroneous. <em>Webb v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>872 F.2d 380, 381 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">If a petition for redetermination of any deficiency has been filed, the Tax Court may, nevertheless, dismiss the case and enter a decision against a petitioner for failure to properly prosecute the case or to comply with Tax Court orders or rules. Tax Ct. R. 123(b); <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453 (authorizing the Tax Court to prescribe rules to govern its proceedings). In that event, the Tax Court\u2019s decision dismissing the proceeding \u201cshall be considered as its decision that the deficiency is the amount determined by the secretary.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7459(d); <em>see also </em>Tax Ct. R. 123(d) (\u201cA decision rendered upon a default or in consequence of a dismissal, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, shall operate as an adjudication on the merits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The record shows that the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion for entry of an order establishing the deficiency based on Hovind\u2019s failure to prosecute the petition properly. <em>See Crandall, </em>650 F.2d at 660. Hovind repeatedly delayed Tax Court proceedings by failing to file responses to motions, participate in discovery, or follow court orders. He also consistently advanced frivolous arguments and refused to acknowledge the Tax Court\u2019s authority, asserting his individual sovereignty as a free inhabitant foreign to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">And our review of the events leading up to the final order in this case makes clear that, particularly from the perspective of the Tax Court, Hovind effectively had abandoned the case. Hovind\u2019s case had been set for trial in March 2012. In November 2011, Hovind\u2019s counsel filed a motion to withdraw Hovind\u2019s petition for a redetermination of any deficiency. Counsel stated in the motion that he had conferred with Hovind, that Hovind had \u201cno intention of proceeding in tax court at any time in the future,\u201d and that counsel was being terminated by Hovind upon completion of one task: dismissing the petition. The Tax Court denied the motion, asserting jurisdiction to decide the controversy, but struck the case from the trial calendar due to Hovind\u2019s unavailability for trial in March. The court directed the parties to file a status report by December 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">In December 2012, the Commissioner filed a status report stating that Hovind\u2019s counsel had informed the Commissioner that counsel had had no contact with Ho-vind since November 2011, despite attempts to contact him. Based on the status report and Hovind\u2019s earlier representation that he had \u201cno intention of proceeding in tax court,\u201d the Tax Court ordered the Commissioner to file a motion for entry of decision. The Commissioner did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">On January 9, 2013, the Tax Court ordered Hovind to respond to the Commissioner\u2019s motion by January 30, 2013, and warned him, \u201cFailure to comply with this Order will result in the granting of [the Commissioner\u2019s] motion and entry of decision sustaining the determinations set forth in the notice of deficiency on which this case is based.\u201d Instead of filing a response to the motion, Hovind filed a <em>pro se </em>affidavit, dated January 28, 2013, stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>ing that his attorney did not have authority to file the petition and that Hovind was never informed that retaining an attorney affected his \u201cindependence as a free inhabitant from U.S. court jurisdictions.\u201d The Tax Court construed the affidavit as a motion to withdraw counsel, granted it, and then extended Hovind\u2019s deadline to respond to the IRS\u2019s motion for entry of decision until March 6, 2013. The Tax Court also directed service of a copy of the motion to Hovind at the address listed in the \u00e1ffidavit, which also appears to be Hovind\u2019s currently listed address. Hovind did not respond. The Tax Court entered the final order in this case on March 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Given this record, including the explicit abandonment of the petition by Hovind, the extensive length of the proceedings, and the Tax Court\u2019s generous accommodation of Hovind, we are not persuaded that any alleged lack of notice prejudiced his ability to present his challenges to the deficiency notice to the Tax Court. Consequently, we conclude that the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Hovind\u2019s ease under both its own rules and this Court\u2019s precedent. Tax Ct. R. 123; <em>see Crandall, </em>650 F.2d at 659-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Finally, we decline to address Hovind\u2019s challenges to the merits of the deficiency judgment entered against him \u2014 that he is exempt from taxation as a minister of CSE and that IRS records contradict the Tax Court\u2019s decision \u2014 because these arguments were not timely and properly presented to the Tax Court for resolution. <em>Stubbs v.
