The district court denied the motion, finding that Wilbourn had consented to the search of his residence. Alternatively, the district court determined that the search was justified as a protective sweep.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">Wilbourn, in his opening brief, does not address the district court\u2019s protective sweep analysis. Although he addresses the issue in his reply brief, \u201c[t]his court does not entertain arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 203 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">This court \u201cwill not raise and discuss legal issues that [Wilbourn] has failed to assert.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Wilbourn has not addressed the denial of his motion to suppress on the basis that the search was justified as a protective sweep, he has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Additionally, because the ruling presents an independent, unchallenged ground for the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial on that basis without addressing Wilbourn\u2019s other arguments. <em>See United States v. Thibodeaux, </em>211 F.3d 910, 912 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Mitchell, </em>334 Fed.Appx. 665, 665-66 (5th Cir.2009) (holding that appellant abandoned, by failing to brief, any argument challenging the district court\u2019s alternative holding that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
