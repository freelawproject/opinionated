The district court dismissed Dixon\u2019s motion because it determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), did not apply retroactively, and Dixon\u2019s motion could have been timely only if it did. Dixon argues that <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively and that his \u00a7 2255 motion was timely filed within one year of that decision. He also contends that, based on <em>Johnson, </em>he was erroneously sentenced as an armed career criminal. The government agrees that <em>Johnson </em>is retroactive but argues that other reasons support affirming. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dixon\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">Dixon pled guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicated that the 15-year mandatory minimum set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) applied to Dixon, due in part to a 1983 Florida conviction for aggravated battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045. In April 2005, the federal district court sentenced Dixon to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, the minimum term under \u00a7 924(e)(1). Dixon appealed, and we affirmed on November 30, 2005, after determining that the grounds for Dixon\u2019s appeal were without merit. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>158 Fed.Appx. 202 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">Over five years later, Dixon filed his initial \u00a7 2255 motion, raising one claim. He asserted that the aggravated battery conviction should not have been considered a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), \u00a7 924(e), relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Johnson. </em>Specifically, he contended that the conviction was not a violent felony because he had pled guilty to the lesser included offense of \u201cculpable negligence.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>was issued on March 2, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">Dixon signed and dated the \u00a7 2255 motion on February 3, 2011, and declared under penalty of perjury that the motion was placed in the prison mailing system on that date. The district court, however, did not receive a copy of the motion until July 20, 2011. After obtaining from the district court clerk\u2019s office a copy of the envelope in which the motion was mailed, the government moved to dismiss Dixon\u2019s motion as untimely. According to the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>ment, Dixon did not tender the motion to prison officials for mailing until July 10, 2011, so his motion was not timely filed within one year of <em>Johnson. </em>Dixon responded that he had not attempted to manipulate the court by backdating the motion and that correspondence between him and the clerk\u2019s office showed that he had submitted the motion earlier than the government suggests, though the motion may not have been received by the court for unknown reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The district court, \u201cassuming without deciding\u201d that Dixon\u2019s motion was filed on February 8, 2011, nonetheless concluded that his motion was untimely because <em>Johnson </em>did not announce a new rule that was retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. Upon determining that <em>Johnson </em>was not retroactively applicable, the court reasoned that <em>Johnson </em>did not restart the time to file a \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Dixon did not file within one year of when his conviction became final in February 2007, the court dismissed Dixon\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely and denied a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Dixon now brings this appeal. We granted a COA on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred in finding that Dixon\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate was untimely filed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate is time barred. <em>Drury v. United States, </em>507 F.3d 1295, 1296 (11th Cir.2007). Our review of an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">A prisoner who is in custody under a federal sentence may move the district court to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence if he claims the right to his release upon the ground that his sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or federal law, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose his sentence, that his sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by law, or that his sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">Dixon\u2019s claim that he was erroneously sentenced under the ACCA is cognizable in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion because, if true, his sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by law. A defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 922(g), ordinarily is subject to a maximum term of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Under the ACCA, however, the same defendant is subject to a minimum term of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment if he has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Even with a qualifying claim, a federal prisoner must nonetheless file a motion to vacate in a timely fashion. Typically, a federal prisoner has one year from the date that his conviction became final to seek \u00a7 2255 relief in federal district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). However, \u00a7 2255 grants an additional one year for prisoners to file a motion to vacate from \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(f)(3). A court other than the Supreme Court may determine retroactivity under \u00a7 2255(f)(3). <em>Figuereo-Sanchez v. United States, </em>678 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>To determine whether a case is retroactively applicable, we have applied the rubric developed in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). Under <em>Teague, </em>we first ask whether the Supreme Court announced a new rule in the decision in question. <em>Figuereo-Sanchez, </em>678 F.3d at 1207. If so, we then ask \u201cwhether that new rule satisfies an exception to the general prohibition against the retroactive application of new rules on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1208. For a new rule to apply retroactively, it must be \u201csubstantive\u201d in that it \u201calters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes,\u201d or, if it is \u201cprocedural,\u201d it must be a \u201cwatershed rule[ ] of criminal procedure.\u201d <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351-53, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004) (quotations omitted); <em>see Figuereo-Sanchez, </em>678 F.3d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Under the \u201celements clause\u201d of the ACCA, the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than one year that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court defined the term \u201cphysical force\u201d in that clause to mean \u201cviolent force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d 559 U.S. at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">A Florida battery offense, however, requires only the slightest intentional physical contact, and a defendant could commit the offense through, for example, a non-consensual tap on the shoulder. <em>See id., </em>559 U.S. at 138, 130 S.Ct. 1265 (citation omitted). Accordingly, <em>Johnson </em>held that a Florida battery offense under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not categorically meet the elements clause\u2019s physical-force requirement, and, therefore, does not categorically constitute a violent felony under the elements clause. <em>See id., </em>559 U.S. at 135-45, 130 S.Ct. 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">The Supreme Court, however, emphasized that, despite its holding, the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d remains a viable means of proving that the defendant\u2019s prior Florida battery conviction constituted a violent felony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 144, 130 S.Ct. 1265. When a prior conviction is for violating a divisible statute (setting out alternative ways that an offense can be committed), courts may apply the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d to determine which alternative formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 144, 130 S.Ct. 1265; <em>see also Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). In this analysis, a court may consult a limited class of documents from the state trial record, \u201cincluding charging documents, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies, findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial, and jury instructions and verdict forms.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 144, 130 S.Ct. 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>The parties agree that <em>Johnson, </em>decided by the Court on March 2, 2010, recognized a new substantive rule that should be applied retroactively. Furthermore, it appears that <em>Johnson </em>impacts the analysis of whether Dixon\u2019s aggravated battery conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045 qualifies as a violent felony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute is divisible in that it specifies alternative ways of committing aggravated battery. Under \u00a7 784.045(l)(a), \u201cA person commits aggravated battery who, in committing battery: 1. Intentionally or knowingly causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement; or 2. Uses a deadly weapon.\u201d Under \u00a7 784.045(l)(b), however, a person can also commit aggravated battery \u201cif the person who was the victim of the battery was pregnant at the time of the offense and the offender knew or should have known that the victim was pregnant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">In light of <em>Johnson, </em>a conviction for aggravated battery under \u00a7 784.045 is not categorically a violent felony under the elements clause because, under \u00a7 784.045(1)(b), the offense can be committed by non-consensual intentional touching of a victim who is pregnant. <em>See Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 187-45, 180 S.Ct. 1265; <em>Small v. State, </em>889 So.2d 862, 863-64 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (discussing the elements of \u00a7 784.045(1)(b)). Nonetheless, though, it is clear that a conviction under either prong of \u00a7 784.045(1)(a) constitutes a violent felony for the ACCA because violent physical force is an element of the offense. <em>Tuner v. Warden Coleman FCI (Medium), </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1341 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2873, 186 L.Ed.2d 923 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Notwithstanding the limited scope of the COA, the government asks that we affirm the district court on the ground that the circumstances indicated in the PSR combined with Dixon\u2019s admission at the plea colloquy show that he was convicted of \u00a7 784.045(l)(a). <em>See Rozier v. United States, </em>701 F.3d 681, 686 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1740, 185 L.Ed.2d 798 (2013) (\u201c[W]hen determining whether an offense is a violent felony (or crime of violence) under the modified categorical approach, a district court can rely on the facts set forth in the [PSR] if they are undisputed and thereby deemed admitted.\u201d). The PSR described the offense, committed when Dixon was eighteen years old, as follows: \u201cCircumstances reflect that on August 10, 1986, the defendant fired a handgun at his girlfriend and another male individual. The male victim was shot on the hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">While the information in the PSR alone is insufficient for us to affirm on other grounds because it merely indicates that Dixon hypothetically could have been convicted of aggravated battery on the male victim, the record here reveals that, in support of a motion that Dixon filed seeking reconsideration, Dixon filed the information and judgment in the state-court case where he was convicted of violating \u00a7 784.045. This Court \u201cmay affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the [district court].\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007). The state-court information conclusively demonstrates that Dixon was charged with violating the violent-felony version of \u00a7 784.045 in that it charges Dixon with \u201cunlawfully committing] a battery upon Dewayne Victor Smith, by actually and intentionally touching or striking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>the said ... Smith against his will and in committing the said battery ... us[ing] a deadly weapon, to-wit: a pistol....\u201d Moreover, the judgment in the Florida case reflects that Dixon was convicted of \u201cCount 1,\u201d which is the charge described above. Thus, based on these documents and the details set forth by the PSR, it is clear that Dixon was convicted of committing an aggravated battery on the man present, not on his girlfriend. Necessarily, then, he was convicted under \u00a7 784.045(1)(a), which categorically qualifies as a violent felony, and, even if Dixon timely filed his motion and <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively, no error occurred when the district court sentenced Dixon as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Nor, as Dixon contends, does the record contain any support for his contention that he was actually convicted only of \u201cculpable negligence\u201d based on self-defense, not aggravated battery. On the contrary, the record soundly refutes Dixon\u2019s contention. The judgment entered in the Florida case states that Dixon was convicted of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045, which is the \u201c[aggravated battery\u201d statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The separate crime of \u201cculpable negligence\u201d is found at Fla. Stat \u00a7 784.05, and Dixon\u2019s judgment does not reflect anywhere on it that that is what he was convicted of.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Because the record demonstratively shows that Dixon was convicted of the version of \u00a7 784.045 that qualifies as a violent felony, even if he timely filed his motion and <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively, no error occurred when the district court sentenced Dixon as an armed career erimi-nal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dixon\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-8\">.
