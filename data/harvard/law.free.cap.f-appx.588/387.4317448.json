He challenges his 262-month sentence for the methamphetamine offense, asserting that the district court erred by imposing a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5) importation enhancement because (1) he did not import the methamphetamine and (2) there was no evidence that he engaged in jointly undertaken criminal conduct with the importer. However, the possession with intent to distribute imported methamphetamine \u201cwithout more\u201d subjects the defendant to the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5) enhancement. <em>United States v. Foulks, </em>747 F.3d 914, 915 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 219, 190 L.Ed.2d 167, 2014 WL 3509481 (Oct. 6, 2014) (No. 14-5236). Bar-reto Abiles alternatively asserts that this court erred in <em>United States v. Serfass, </em>684 F.3d 548, 549-50, 553 (5th Cir.2012), when it determined that there is no scienter requirement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5). We do not entertain this argument, as a panel of this court may not overrule the decision of another absent a superseding en banc or Supreme Court decision. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 <em>&amp; </em>n. 34 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Additionally, Barreto Abiles contends that the district court erroneously double counted his actions of drawing a firearm while fleeing from law enforcement by imposing the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 reckless endangerment enhancement along with the mandatory minimum 60-month sentence under \u00a7 924(c) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. Because he did not raise the objection before the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Medina-Torres, </em>703 F.3d 770, 773-74 (5th Cir.2012). Barreto Abiles must show an error that is clear or obvious that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">We find no plain error in the imposition of the the reckless endangerment enhancement because any such error would be \u201csubject to reasonable debate\u201d and therefore not clear or obvious. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. As a matter of first impression, it is not clear that either \u00a7 3C1.2 or \u00a7 2K2.4 on its face specifically prohibits double counting under the circumstances of this case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3C1.2, cmt. (n. 1); \u00a7 2K2.4, cmt. (n. 4); <em>United States v. Garcia-Gonzalez, </em>714 F.3d 306, 316 (5th Cir.2013) (\u201cDouble counting is prohibited only if the particular guidelines at issue specifically forbid it.\u201d). For example, Application Note 1 to \u00a7 3C1.2 does not expressly apply because Barreto Abiles did not receive a second guidelines <em>enhancement </em>based on his conduct of drawing the firearm while fleeing. Nor was his 60-month sentence under \u00a7 924(c) imposed \u201csolely on the basis of the same conduct\u201d as the \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement because the \u00a7 SCI.2 enhancement was based in part on Barreto Abiles\u2019s conduct in fleeing from law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">Likewise, the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.4 expressly bars only enhancements \u201cfor possession, brandishing, use, or discharge\u201d of a firearm when determining the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tence for the underlying offense. \u00a7 2K2.4, cmt. (n. 4). Barreto Abiles contends that this rule extends beyond the enhancements, that apply expressly to firearms to any enhancement that is related to a firearm in a particular case. He emphasizes that the district court imposed the reckless endangerment enhancement \u201cbased on [his] possession and manipulation of a weapon during flight\u201d and that the enhancement \u201ccould not have applied in the absence of the firearm,\u201d without which \u201cthere was merely flight.\u201d However, he cites no authority showing that the comment to \u00a7 2K2.4 has been applied to a non-firearm enhancement that was not specifically listed as an example in the commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
