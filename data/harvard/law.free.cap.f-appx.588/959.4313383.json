United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), to argue that his sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment. On appeal, Davis argues that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 2241 petition on the ground that he had not satisfied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d because <em>Alleyne </em>represented a new rule of constitutional law that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. He asserts that <em>Alleyne </em>is not an extension of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and it is retroactively applicable because it represents a watershed rule of criminal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-23\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Challenges to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, are properly brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The savings clause of \u00a7 2255, however, permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition that attacks the validity of his convictions and sentences pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Under the savings clause, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). We recently held that the savings clause is a jurisdictional provision, such that a petitioner must show that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d before the district court has jurisdiction to review the \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337-40 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">When a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from us before, filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). We have held that such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) <em>(\u201cGilbert </em>77\u201d). Consequently, a petitioner who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion that has been denied may not circumvent the prohibition on unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 filings simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Although the scope of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause has not been fully defined, we have noted that a petitioner meets the requirements of the savings clause when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a non-existent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999); <em>but see Turner v. Warden Coleman FCI (Medium), </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2873, 186 L.Ed.2d 923 (2013) (describing the three-part test in <em>Wofford </em>as \u201cdicta\u201d and noting that we have retreated from that test in <em>Gilbert </em>II). In <em>Williams, </em>we interpreted <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>holding as establishing two necessary conditions for a sentencing claim to be viable under the savings clause. <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343. First, the claim must be based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>Id. </em>Second, the Supreme Court \u201cmust have overturned a circuit precedent that squarely resolved the claim so that the petitioner had no genuine opportunity to raise it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, a petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">In our recent decision in <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), we addressed the question of whether a petitioner can use the savings clause to \u201copen the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241 where an erroneous application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) resulted in a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum. 738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). In that case, Bryant had filed a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>\u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, arguing that his 235-month sentence for an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) felon-in-possession conviction exceeded the 10-year statutory maximum penalty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1260-61. Specifically, he had contended that, under <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251 (11th Cir.2009), his \u25a0 prior conviction for a concealed firearm offense under Florida law no longer was considered a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA, such that he did not have the' three predicate convictions necessary to increase his maximum penalty from ten years to life imprisonment. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1257; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Based on a synthesis of <em>Wofford, Gilbert II, </em>and <em>Williams, </em>we held that, in order to show that his prior \u00a7 2255 motion had been \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d Bryant had to make a five-part showing. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. He had to establish that: (1) our precedent foreclosed the claim raised in his \u00a7 2241 petition .throughout sentencing, direct appeal, and his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (2) the Supreme Court overturned that binding precedent after his initial \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (3) the Supreme Court decision applied retroactively on collateral review; (4) as a result of that Supreme Court decision applying retroactively, the petitioner\u2019s current sentence exceeded the statutory maximum; and (5) \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause reached his claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In determining whether a new rule applies retroactively at step three of the <em>Bryant </em>test, new substantive rules generally apply retroactively, and the rule announced in a Supreme Court decision is substantive if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes. <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351-53, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522-23, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). By contrast, a rule is procedural if it regulates only the manner of determining the defendant\u2019s culpability, and new rules of criminal procedure generally are not retroactively applicable on collateral review unless they fall within one of two exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at 352-53, 124 S.Ct. at 2523; <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 310-11, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1075-76, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). First, such rules apply retroactively if they place \u201ccertain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 311, 109 S.Ct. at 1075 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, they will apply retroactively if they require the observance of \u201cthose procedures that ... are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d so-called \u201cwatershed rules of criminal procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 109 S.Ct. at 1075-76 (internal quotation marks omitted) (ellipsis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court expanded <em>Apprendi </em>by holding, in a direct appeal, that under the Sixth Amendment, \u201cfacts that increase mandatory minimum sentences must be submitted to the jury.\u201d 570 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 2163 (concluding that a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cbrandished\u201d a firearm within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) before an enhanced seven-year mandatory-minimum sentence may apply). The Court concluded that the distinction between facts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase only the mandatory minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>was inconsistent with <em>Apprendi </em>and the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at -, 183 S.Ct. at 2155.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Recently, in <em>Jeanty v. Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>757 F.3d 1283 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam), we addressed whether the district court erred in denying Jeanty\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which relied on <em>Alleyne. </em>In making our determination that Jeanty failed to meet the third <em>Bryant </em>requirement, we explicitly held that <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 1285. We explained that neither <em>Alleyne </em>itself nor any later Supreme Court decision has held <em>Alleyne </em>to be retroactive. <em>Id. Alleyne </em>was an application of the rule established in <em>Apprendi, </em>and we have repeatedly held that that rule does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 1285-86. Finally, every other circuit to address the issue in a published decision has concluded that <em>Alleyne </em>is not retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">In light of our decision in <em>Jeanty, </em>Davis cannot use \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause to collaterally challenge his sentence under \u00a7 2241 because the rule established in <em>Alleyne </em>is not retroactively applicable on collateral review. Therefore, Davis has not shown that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention, and the district court did not have jurisdiction to review his \u00a7 2241 petition brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
