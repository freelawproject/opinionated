It is undisputed that the firefighter\u2019s heart attack and death were caused by his exertion at that emergency. Upon application to the defendant Oaoard), the plaintiff was awarded the benefits provided by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9, but was denied the higher benefits provided by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100. The plaintiff then brought an action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>judicial review of the denial, purportedly pursuant to the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The obvious difficulty with this action is that the defendant is not an \"agency\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(2); and therefore the proceeding sought to be reviewed is not an \"adjudicatory proceeding\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 1[1]) subject to review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. The board is not a \"department, board, commission, division or authority of the state government,\u201d nor is it a \"subdivision of any of the foregoing.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(2), as amended through St. 1978, c. 552, \u00a7 13. Its jurisdiction is to administer a particular county retirement system, \"in general, an independent unit having its own separate assets and liabilities.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>County of Bristol, </em>329 Mass. 741, 746 (1953). G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20(3). Such a board functions with respect to employees of a county (and certain towns; G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 28[3] [5]) as part of the administration of a county, an entity characterized as \"a municipal corporation\u201d <em>(Essex County </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>153 Mass. 141, 142 [1891]; <em>Goodale </em>v. <em>County Commrs. of Worcester, </em>277 Mass. 144, 148-149 [1931]), which like a city or town is a \"territorial subdivision of the State bounded and organized by the Legislature for political purposes and the administration of government.\u201d <em>Goodale </em>v. <em>County Commrs. of Worcester, supra </em>at 148. A county body is thus no more an \"agency\u201d subject to G. L. c. 30A than a city or town body. See <em>Dixie\u2019s Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>357 Mass. 699, 702 (1970); <em>United Food Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>375 Mass. 238, 242 (1978); <em>Brignoli </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 829 (1973); <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Watertown, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 430, (1976). Nor has it ever been thought that such local bodies are subject to the detailed provisions for rule making and hearings embodied in G. L. c. 30A. See Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 43, 61 (1962) (\"Application of'Administrative Procedure Act,\u2019 to State agencies and schedule of agencies in their relation thereto\u201d) which lists the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board established pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4), but no county body.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Further, the plaintiff has not exhausted her administrative remedy for denial of benefits under \u00a7 100. Her remedy was by appeal to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4). See <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>337 Mass. 495 (1958); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass. 45 (1961); <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass. 58 (1961); <em>Teachers\u2019Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>346 Mass. 663 (1964); <em>Easthampton Contributory Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 347 </em>Mass. 777 (1964) \u2014 cases in which the Supreme Judicial Court has reviewed decisions of the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board with reference to widow\u2019s benefits under the parallel provision of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Neither of the parties has raised these matters (see <em>Assuncao\u2019s Case, </em>372 Mass. 6 [1977]). Rather, they entered into an \u201cAgreed Statement of Material Facts,\u201d presumably pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(4) <em>(c), </em>as amended by St. 1976, c. 411, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 2, providing for review on \u201ca statement of the case agreed to by the agency and the parties.\u201d This statement set out the proceedings and stipulated that: \u201cIf the circumstances surrounding the death of Lt. Buteau, as set forth above, constitute an \u2018accident\u2019 or injury as those terms are used in c. 32, \u00a7 100, then his widow is entitled to the benefits provided in that section. If the events described do not constitute an 'accident\u2019 or 'injury\u2019 within the terms of the statute, then t]ie plaintiff, who is receiving benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9, is entitled to nothing further, and the suit should be dismissed.\u201d We take that to mean that the board agrees to reconsider its decision if the firefighter\u2019s death as a result of a heart attack can, as a matter of the construction of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100, be the result of \"injuries\u201d sustained by the firefighter. However, the defendant\u2019s brief does not argue that death from a heart attack could not be construed as death from \"injuries\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 100. It has apparently abandoned that ground for deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>sion \u2014 as well it might, since that view is very likely erroneous. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>346 Mass. 663 (1964). <em>Easthampton Contributory Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>347 Mass. 777 (1964). See <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>337 Mass. 495 (1958). That the relationship of the heart attack to the plaintiffs duty must be proved without the benefit of the presumption of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 94, does not make the heart attack any the less an \"injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The defendant instead raises two different issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">(1) whether \u00a7 100 requires an \"accident\u201d rather than merely an \"injury\u201d at the scene of the emergency and</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">(2) whether, assuming an \"injury\u201d is sufficient, it was sustained \"while at the scene of... any emergency\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100, as amended through St. 1978, c. 487, \u00a7 18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">However, we do not decide these questions because we believe this is a particularly appropriate case in which to apply the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and to refrain from \"frustrating the statutory scheme\u201d <em>(Gallo </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, </em>374 Mass. 278, 288 [1978]) by bypassing the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board. The Contributory Retirement Appeal Board has been given broad fact-finding powers. <em>Quincy Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>340 Mass. 56, 61 (1959). <em>Masiello </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>360 Mass. 856, 857 (1971). \"[A] court should not act upon subject matter peculiarly within the agency\u2019s specialized field without taking into account what the agency has to offer .. ..\u201d <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>377 Mass. 746, 753 (1979). <em>Selectmen of Framingham </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>366 Mass. 547, 554 (1974). The subject matter and the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ministrative procedure here involved make pertinent the considerations applicable in the administration of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act where \"[t]he policies underlying the exhaustion doctrine have been particularly applicable.\u201d <em>Assuncao\u2019s Case, </em>372 Mass. at 9. The issues tendered by the defendant are not matters of jurisdiction (contrast <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>320 Mass. 467, 468 [1946]; <em>Lahey Clinic Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Health Facilities Appeals Bd., </em>376 Mass. 359, 371-372 [1978]; but see <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 450 [1973]). Nor are they questions of law in which administrative fact finding is not implicated. Contrast <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District Commn., </em>371 Mass. 691, 699 (1977); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>377 Mass. 217, 221-222 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In any event the action must be dismissed. <em>Brignoli </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 829 (1973). See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>377 Mass. 746, 754-755 (1979). The State Administrative Procedure Act does not give us power to review the defendant\u2019s decision, and the consent of the parties cannot enlarge the scope of the act. However, in view of the defendant\u2019s stipulation (see also note 1, <em>supra) </em>and the questionable basis for the decision, the dismissal is without prejudice, and we assume that the defendant will reconsider its decision and enter a new decision which the plaintiff, if aggrieved thereby, may be able to appeal under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The present judgment \"denying all relief,\u201d being inappropriate (cf. <em>Duato </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>359 Mass. 635, 639, 641-642 [1971]), is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered dismissing the action. Costs shall be taxed to neither party.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> At oral argument the defendant agreed that if the first issue should be decided against the defendant it would be fair to remand the matter to the board for additional evidence on the second issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
