L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, of the following question of law: May an employee who has incurred an injury specified in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and who receives unemployment benefits under c. 151A, also receive partial incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The plaintiff lost his right arm in an industrial accident in 1967 and was subsequently employed on a seasonal basis in a job specially created for him. For approximately four months every winter he was laid off from that job due to the seasonal nature of the work and his inability to perform the other work previously assigned to him during the winter months. During those periods of unemployment he received unemployment compensation benefits, which he seeks to supplement with partial incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, up to the amount \u00f3f his former weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Following a conference pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7, a single member of the Industrial Accident Board in 1975 ordered the insurer to pay partial incapacity benefits for those periods. At the request of the insurer a hearing was held before another single member in 1976, who ordered payment of benefits for a subsequent period when no unemployment benefits were received but denied the claim for partial incapacity benefits for the periods in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>question, on the ground that to allow the claim would be to allow \"double benefits,\u201d contrary to the intent of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The reviewing board adopted this single member\u2019s decision, with a slight modification not at issue here. The employee appealed, and a Superior Court judge entered judgment affirming the reviewing board\u2019s decision and reported the question of law, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, to the Supreme Judicial Court, which referred the question to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We answer the question reported to us in the affirmative. We conclude that .under the provisions of c. 151A, \u00a7 25(d), because the employee has an injury specified in c. 152, \u00a7 36, he is entitled to receive partial incapacity benefits under c. 152, \u00a7 35, up to the amount of his average weekly wage prior to the injury for the periods in question. This conclusion accords with the construction given to c. 151A, \u00a7 25(d), by the court in <em>Pierce\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 649, 655-656 (1950).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case an employee suffered a back strain which precluded him from working for a period of time. He filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation for that period, during which he' was receiving unemployment benefits. The court considered the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>of c. 151A, \u00a7 25(d), and concluded that since the employee was not suffering from a specific injury included in c. 152, \u00a7 36, he was barred from recovering workmen\u2019s compensation for the same period in which he was receiving unemployment benefits. The court reasoned that the Legislature had intended a single exception to be made \"in favor of those who sustain partial incapacity from one of the specific injuries mentioned in said \u00a7 36,\u201d and stated that payment of unemployment benefits to those \"who are receiving compensation by reason of partial incapacity due to an industrial injury is now restricted to those whose partial incapacity has resulted from the loss of an arm or a leg or some one of the other specific injuries enumerated in \u00a7 36 ....\u201d <em>Pierce's Case, supra </em>at 655, 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The insurer contends that the construction given to c. 151A, \u00a7 25(d), in <em>Pierce\u2019s Case </em>was contrary to the intent of the statute, which, the insurer argues, was to permit only payments made under c. 152, \u00a7 36, and not other payments for injuries specified in \u00a7 36, to be received at the same time as unemployment benefits. We note, however, that the Legislature has amended c. 151A, \u00a7 25, numerous times since the opinion in <em>Pierce </em>was issued in 1950, but has left the portion of \u00a7 25(d) construed in <em>Pierce </em>unchanged. It must be presumed, therefore, that the Legislature has adopted the construction of the statute given it in <em>Pierce\u2019s Case. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartnett, 3 </em>Gray 450, 451 (1855). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>346 Mass. 294, 297 (1963). See also <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 736 (1977), in which the court stated, \"[W]e must bear in mind that considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>weigh heavily in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court\u2019s interpretation of its legislation.\u201d See generally 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 49.05, at 30 (4th ed. Supp. 1979). The fact that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, has been amended to include many more types of injuries does not render the court\u2019s construction in <em>Pierce </em>invalid, since it was c. 1.51A, \u00a7 25(d), and not c. 152, \u00a7 36, which the court construed in <em>Pierce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The allowance of the employee\u2019s claim for partial incapacity benefits will not result in the payment of \"double benefits.\u201d In <em>Pierce\u2019s Case supra </em>at 655-656, the court commented that the Legislature apparently intended to create two separate systems through workmen\u2019s compensation and unemployment benefits, the first to compensate for loss in earning capacity due to industrial injury and the second for unemployment due to depressed business conditions. The Legislature, however, in c. 151A, \u00a7 25(d), as an exception to the general rule, permitted a person incapacitated by an injury specified in c. 152, \u00a7 36, to receive both partial incapacity benefits and unemployment benefits, apparently because of a recognition that \"in such a case it might reasonably be assumed that the workman would not only suffer a diminution of his earning capacity due directly to his injury but would be further handicapped in securing employment during a period of business depression due to his visible maimed or handicapped condition ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. Noting the exception made for employees \"suffering from a specific injury included in \u00a7 36,\u201d one writer has stated that the exception \"does not result in the employee receiving a combined payment in excess of his average weekly wage when gainfully employed, as the board will usually set the employee\u2019s earning capacity at an amount equal to or above the unemployment benefit. Then his compensation for partial incapacity is based on the difference between such earning capacity and his former average weekly wage, as provided in [G. L. c. 152,] \u00a7 35.\u201d Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 616, at 731-732 (1968). See generally 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 57.65 (1976); 4 <em>id. </em>\u00a7 97.20 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Here the employee worked in a job specially created for him because of his injury, and his unemployment during the winter months was due to the seasonal nature of that job and also to the fact that he was unable, as a result of his handicap, to perform the other types of work that he had previously done during those months. The combina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tion of unemployment benefits supplemented by partial incapacity benefits will merely bring his income up to the level of his \u201caverage weekly wage before the injury\u201d (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35) in compensation of the loss he suffered as a result of that injury, and in no way involves a duplication of any payments to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The question is answered in the affirmative, and the judgment is reversed in so far as it affirms the reviewing board\u2019s denial of the claim for partial incapacity payments. Judgment is to be entered in accordance with the principles enunciated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> Chapter 152, \u00a7 36, provides additional compensation for specified injuries. See <em>Vouniseas\u2019s Case, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 134 n.3 (1975). Until 1953 all payments under \u00a7 36 were required to be made in weekly increments. The section was amended by St. 1953, c. 64, to authorize such payments to be made in a bulk sum. The latter was made the exclusive method of payment by St. 1972, c. 741, \u00a7 1, but the present case is governed by the statute as amended through 1966, c. 584. <em>Id. </em>at 134 n.l.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"> Chapter 152, \u00a7 35, as amended through St. 1967, c. 482, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6, provides that \"[wjhile the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, the insurer shall pay the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to the entire difference between his average weekly wage before the injury and the average weekly wage he is able to earn thereafter,\u201d subject to certain specified limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\"> Chapter 151A, \u00a7 25(d), as appearing in St. 1951, c. 763, \u00a7 9, provides that no unemployment benefits shall be paid to an individual for \"[a]ny period with respect to which he is receiving or has received or is about to receive compensation for partial or total disability under [workmen\u2019s compensation laws], but not including payments for certain specified injuries under [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36]....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\"> The court in <em>Pierce\u2019s Case, supra, </em>held that the judge who had reported the question whether an employee was entitled to receive workmen\u2019s compensation during a period in which he was receiving unemployment benefits was without power, no decree having been entered, to report the case, and the report was discharged. The court, however, elected to address the merits of the case, stating that \"we think it appropriate to express our opinion on the merits of this question,\u201d since the issues had been fully argued, and since \"[a] decision will assist the Industrial Accident Board in the performance of its duties, as this question of law is certain to be presented soon if it is now left without decision. It is an important question and is of general public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653-654.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
