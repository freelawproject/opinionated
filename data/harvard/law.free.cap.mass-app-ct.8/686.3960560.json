(Ryan), proceeded to trial in the Superior Court on so much of its complaint as alleged that the defendant, Leggat, McCall &amp; Werner, Inc. (Leggat), had intentionally interfered with the contractual relationships between Ryan and two of its employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ryan alleged that Leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>gat had offered them employment, thereby inducing and otherwise causing them to breach their five-year employment contracts with Ryan. When Ryan completed presenting its evidence, Leggat made a motion which the trial judge treated as one filed under Mass.R.Civ.P. 41(b)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 365 Mass. 804 (1974); he made findings of fact pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816-817 (1974), and ordered the claim dismissed on its merits. We affirm the ensuing judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We summarize the facts as taken from the judge\u2019s findings. John B. Griffith and Sargent L. Goodchild were employees of Ryan, a commercial and industrial real estate brokerage firm which is a business competitor of Leggat. Although employment contracts in this field of business are rare, especially for a fixed term of years, both men had five-year contracts with Ryan, and these contracts were in effect at the times material to this dispute. For some time prior to August of 1975 the two men had been dissatisfied with their employment situations at Ryan, and they had resolved to leave the firm, although they had set no definite termination date. Each sought the advice of his attorney about leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Ryan, Griffith doing so as early as April, 1975. Their plan, then, was to form a new brokerage firm along with two other Ryan employees. The four men engaged in discussions about this plan from June 8 through August 13, 1975; they prepared financial proposals and cash flow data and submitted this information to a business consultant and a venture capital specialist for their review. These steps to go into business for themselves continued as late as July 31, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">During the first two weeks of August, 1975, Griffith did not perform services for Ryan in any \u201cmeaningful way.\u201d On August 4 Goodchild contacted a principal at Leggat, requesting an employment interview with that firm. They arranged an appointment for that afternoon, and Goodchild met with most, if not all, of Leggat\u2019s principals. He told them he was leaving Ryan due to longstanding problems. He further advised them that he and Griffith, as well as other employees, were exploring the possibility of establishing their own firm but that he also wished to explor\u00e9 the possibility of working at Leggat. On August 6 Griffith also contacted Leggat to arrange for an appointment; the next day he met with a principal of Leggat and related to him substantially the same facts as Goodchild had. He repeated that information to all of Leggat\u2019s principals on August 11, adding that he and Goodchild had consulted with their attorneys concerning their employment contracts and that each had been advised that he was free to leave Ryan. In reliance on this last statement, all of Leggat\u2019s principals met with Griffith and Goodchild that same afternoon, and they told the two men that Leggat would employ them if and when they left Ryan. Griffith and Goodchild resigned from Ryan three days later, and thereafter Leggat hired them.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Ryan argues that it was error to allow the motion to dismiss because its evidence established a prima facie case and the burden of proof had shifted to Leggat to show justification for its actions. In <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>322 Mass. 356, 360 (1948), the court stated: \u201cThe governing principle of law is set forth in Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 766, in these words, \u2018. . . one who, without a privilege to do so, induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to... enter into or continue a business relation with another is liable to the other for the harm caused thereby.\u2019 Our own decisions appear to be in accord with this statement. ... As in other instances where justification is required, the burden of proof was upon the defendant to establish the existence of such an occasion.\u201d In <em>Pino </em>v. <em>Trans-Atlantic Marine, Inc., </em>358 Mass. 498, 504 (1970), the court, in its approval of the <em>Owen </em>holding, noted that in <em>Tye </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>160 F.Supp. 666, 667-668 (D. Mass. 1958), it was held that the burden was on the plaintiff to prove malice rather than upon the defendant to prove justification. It was determined in <em>Pino, </em>358 Mass. at 504, that the plaintiff did prove malice, as defined in <em>McGurk </em>v. <em>Cronenwett, </em>199 Mass. 457, 462 (1908) (\u201cin its legal sense it means a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just cause or excuse\u201d), and in <em>Grammenos </em>v. <em>Zolotas, </em>356 Mass. 594, 597 (1970) (\u201c[i]f such interference was intentional and without lawful justification it was malicious in law although it arose from good motives and without express malice\u201d). Based upon these cases, Ryan insists that it sustained its burden of proof and thus the motion should not have been allowed, and Leggat should have been required to go forward and prove a privilege or justification for its conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We note first that in passing upon a motion under the \u201d second sentence of rule 41(b)(2) a trial judge is not limited to that standard of proof required for a directed verdict (see e.g., <em>Petrangelo </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>356 Mass. 696, 697 [1970]; <em>E. H. Hall Co. </em>v. <em>U. S. Plastics Corp., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 169, 171 [1974]); rather, the judge is free to weigh the evidence and resolve all questions of credibility, ambiguity, and contradiction in reaching a decision. See <em>Huber </em>v. <em>American President Lines, Ltd., </em>240 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>778, 779 &amp; n.2 (2d Cir. 1957); <em>A &amp; N Club </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>404 F.2d 100, 103 (6th Cir. 1968); <em>Woods </em>v. <em>North Am. Rockwell Corp., </em>480 F.2d 644, 645-646 (10th Cir. 1973); <em>Shull </em>v. <em>Dain, Kalman &amp; Quail, Inc., </em>561 F.2d 152, 154-155 (8th Cir. 1977), cert, denied, 434 U.S. 1086 (1978); 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2371 (1971). See also Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 41.10 (1977). Consistent with those criteria, the trial judge made those findings of fact which we have previously summarized and concluded that Leggat had not intentionally interfered with the contracts and that it had neither induced nor otherwise purposely caused the business relationships between Ryan and its two employees to be discontinued. If the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are proper, then the question of Leggat\u2019s \u201cmalice\u201d or \u2018lack of justification\u201d are irrelevant, because there was no interference or wrongful act in the first instance and Ryan failed in its attempt to show a right to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Ryan argues that the facts upon which the conclusions are based are clearly erroneous<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the findings and conclusions are \u201ctainted by an error of law.\u201d <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 674 (1977). Because a review of the transcript indicates that the findings are warranted by the evidence, we next determine whether the findings and conclusions are free from error and are \u201cconsistent with the relevant legal standards.\u201d <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Brink, </em>372 Mass. 257, 263 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The trial judge concluded that because Leggat reasonably relied upon the representations of Griffith and Goodchild, it did not know of the five-year term provisions of their contracts and, therefore, did not intentionally and maliciously interfere with Ryan\u2019s contractual relations with its employees. Ryan relies upon <em>McGurk, </em>199 Mass. at 461-462, <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Moskovitz, </em>260 Mass. 523, 525-526 (1927), and <em>Grammenos, </em>356 Mass. at 596-597, for the proposition that knowledge of the mere existence of a contract imposed a duty upon Leggat to refrain from offering the men employment and urges that the fact that Leggat was mistaken in its belief as to the men\u2019s immediate availability does not excuse its action. It appears that the defendants in those.cases, however, had knowledge of the specifics of the contracts in question, and their conduct was not excused merely because they were motivated by, or had acted out of, a mistaken belief as to the legal significance of the known facts. See <em>Engine Specialties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bombardier Ltd., </em>330 F. Supp. 762, 768 n.5 (D. Mass. 1971), aff\u2019d 454 F.2d 527 (1st Cir. 1972); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766, Comment (e), (Tent. Draft No. 14, 1969); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766, Comment (i) (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the judge found that Leggat had no knowledge of the terms of the contract, it became germane for him to consider why. If Leggat\u2019s offers of employment were based upon an intentional and wilful ignorance of the facts, its conduct was no more excusable than if based upon a mistaken belief of the legal significance of known facts. The judge found that Leggat\u2019s reliance upon the representations of Griffith and Goodchild was reasonable in the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>cumstances. Service contracts for a specific term of years were extremely rare in the real estate brokerage business, and the men had told Leggat that their attorneys had advised them they were free to leave Ryan and that they were committed to doing so. The judge, therefore, was not clearly wrong in concluding that Leggat\u2019s ignorance was not due to a wilful refusal to ascertain the facts before making offers of employment or to an improper desire to induce or otherwise cause the men to leave their employment with Ryan. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>11 F.Supp. 497, 513 (S.D.N.Y. 1935), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 85 F.2d 61 (2d Cir. 1936); <em>United Aircraft Corp. v. Boreen, </em>413 F.2d 694, 699 (3d Cir. 1969); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766, Comment h.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In addition to concluding that Leggat had not intentionally interfered with Ryan\u2019s contractual relations, the judge concluded that Leggat had not induced or otherwise purposely caused Griffith and Goodchild to leave Ryan. In reliance upon <em>Pino, </em>358 Mass. at 501, Ryan asserts the trial judge is in error because Griffith\u2019s and Goodchild\u2019s resignations were the foreseeable, natural, and probable consequences of Leggat\u2019s offers of employment. What Ryan overlooks, however, is that in <em>Pino </em>the trial judge found that the defendants knew their conduct would result in the plaintiff\u2019s loss of employment, and that the defendants \u2018\u201cintentionally took the action they did well knowing what the result would be,\u201d\u2019 (358 Mass. at 501) and it was therefore purposeful. It is settled law that \u201cwhether the actor\u2019s conduct caused the third person to break his contract with the other raises an issue of fact.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Comment o. See <em>Owen, </em>322 Mass. at 360-361; <em>M.F. Roach Co. </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>355 Mass. 731, 732 (1969). Here the judge found that Griffith and Goodchild had already decided to leave Ryan before Leggat offered them employment and that Leggat had neither recruited the men nor solicited their services. Thus, his conclusion that Leggat had not induced or otherwise purposely caused the men to discontinue their employment with Ryan was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by the evidence, are free from any errors of law, and are consistent with relevant legal standards. <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc., </em>372 Mass. at 675. <em>Brink, </em>372 Mass. at 263. They also establish that Ryan failed to show it was entitled to relief because its evidence did not show that Leggat had intentionally interfered with Ryan\u2019s contractual rights by inducing or otherwise purposely causing Griffith and Goodchild to discontinue their relations with it. Because of this failure, the trial judge correctly ordered the dismissal of the claim on its merits pursuant to rule 41(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-13\">Ryan also alleged in its complaint that Leggat had wrongfully used confidential information obtained from its two former employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ees. This second claim was separated from the claim of wrongful interference with contractual relationships, and after the order of dismissal was entered on the first claim, Ryan proceeded with its evidence on the second claim. That second claim ended in a finding for Leggat which Ryan does not now contest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\"> The applicable portion of Mass.R.Civ.P. 41(b)(2) provides: \u201cAfter the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court as trier of the facts may then determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\"> That j udgment was entered after the finding for Leggat on the second claim.

Leggat urges us not to review the sufficiency of the evidentiary basis of the findings because of Ryan\u2019s failure to comply with Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), and 18(b), 365 Mass. 865(1974). We decline to adopt Leggat\u2019s position, and we review the findings and the conclusions of law in all respects.
