(Continental), supplied labor and materials to Salvo &amp; Armstrong Steel Company, Inc. (Salvo), in connection with the latter\u2019s subcontract to provide and install metalwork in a publicly funded project constructed for the New Bedford Housing Authority (Authority). Salvo failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>pay Continental, thereby precipitating this suit for labor and materials by Continental against Salvo and its surety, the American Insurance Company (American). It appears that Continental, prior to commencing suit, lost its rights against the project\u2019s general contractor, F. L. Collins &amp; Sons, Inc. (Collins), and Collins\u2019 surety, Travelers Insurance Company, on the bond posted in conformance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. Those rights had been lost as a result of Continental\u2019s tardiness in complying with the notice provisions set forth in the third paragraph of \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pleadings and submissions (bids, contracts, the bond and affidavits) evolved into cross motions for summary judgment. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(a)(b), 365 Mass. 824 (1975). The judge denied the defendants\u2019 motions, allowed the plaintiff\u2019s, and permitted Continental a recovery of $7,390 against Salvo and American. In so doing the judge found that American\u2019s bond was written for Salvo to benefit Collins, but that Continental could reach the bond as a third-party beneficiary thereof. Despite the bond\u2019s adherence to the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, he concluded that certain language in the bond was ambiguous and ruled that the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of permitting Continental a recovery on the bond. Although the appeal must be dismissed for lack of entry of a judgment (Mass.R.Civ.P. 58[a], as amended, 371 Mass. 908 [1977], <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Bendetson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 561 [1978]), because the issues have been fully briefed we express our views that the recovery permitted Continental against Salvo was correct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but that the recovery permitted against American was erroneous. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>will pave the way for the entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">1. The process of bidding and bonding on this public project followed the pattern established for such procedures in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in \u00a7\u00a7 44A through 44L. Collins, the general contractor, obtained the bond required by \u00a7 29 of c. 149 in favor of the authority to secure the payment by Collins\u2019 subcontractors for labor performed or furnished and materials used or employed in the projects. Because of the exposure of Collins and its surety under \u00a7 29 of c. 149 to parties who contracted with the various subcontractors, Collins requested (as expressly authorized by \u00a7 44H) that its principal subcontractors, including Salvo, be bonded. Salvo\u2019s bond, written by American, contained the promises set forth in the margin<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in language which tracked virtually word for word the requirements for this type of bond spelled out in the third paragraph of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">American asserts correctly that it has written a statutory performance and payment bond pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, designed solely to benefit Collins. The bond\u2019s promises are twofold: (1) to secure to <em>Collins </em>the performance of Salvo\u2019s metalwork subcontract; and (2) to indemnify <em>Collins </em>in the event Collins became obligated under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, to pay any of Salvo\u2019s subcon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>tractors. These promises must be construed in view of the third paragraph of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, inserted by St. 1960, c. 771, \u00a7 6, which defines the scope and contents of a subcontractor\u2019s bond and which expressly states that \u201c[a] performance and payment bond furnished by the subcontractor at the request of a general contractor . . . <em>shall be for the benefit of the general contractor . . . </em>[emphasis supplied]. \u201d This language and the insertion of the present third paragraph into \u00a7 44H four years after the insertion of \u00a7 44H itself (by St. 1956, c. 679, \u00a7 1) and three years after the rewriting of c. 149, \u00a7 29 (by St. 1957, c. 682, \u00a7 1), which broadened the range of remedies available to parties dealing with subcontractors against the general contractor and its surety,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> lead to the conclusion that a bond written in strict conformity with the terms of \u00a7 44H is for the benefit of the general contractor alone. See generally <em>Claycraft Co. </em>v. <em>John Bowen Co., </em>287 Mass. 255, 257 (1934); <em>Waite Hardware Co. v.Ardini &amp;Pfau, Inc., </em>339 Mass. 634, 637-638 (1959); <em>James D. Shea Co. </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 912 (1975), which limit the range of obligees and beneficiaries of payment and performance bonds to those parties enumerated either in the bond or in the statute. See also <em>Scaduto </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>340 F.2d 293, 300 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 380 U.S. 978 (1965) (applying Massachusetts, law). This conclusion is also buttressed by a comparison of the language in \u00a7 44H tying the benefits of a bond written thereunder to the general contractor with the language in \u00a7 29A of c. 149,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as amended by St. 1972, c. 399, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>which permits a third party such as Continental in a <em>private </em>construction contract to claim the benefits of a subcontractor\u2019s bond where the terms of the bond so permit. The absence of anything comparable to \u00a7 29A with reference to the interrelationship of \u00a7 29 and \u00a7 44H bonds further suggests that the Legislature did not intend direct suits by sub-subcontractors on subcontractor\u2019s bonds. See and compare <em>Powers Regulator Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. and Guar. Co., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 913 (1979) (where on a private project, a subcontractor\u2019s bond, containing language unnecessary to the general contractor\u2019s protection was held under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29A, to have promised payment to a person supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract), with <em>Mosaic Tile Co. </em>v. <em>Rusco Prod, of Massachusetts, Inc., </em>350 Mass. 433, 437 (1966) (where a supplier of materials to a subcontractor was denied recovery against the subcontractor\u2019s bond because the benefit to claimants under \u00a7 29 \u201ccovers only bonds given by the general contractor and does not affect a payment security bond from a subcontractor to the general contractor\u201d). The <em>Mosaic Tile </em>case is particularly instructive because the claim made and rejected in that case under \u00a7 29 is similar to the claim made by Continental under \u00a7 44H in this action. In view of the foregoing discussion and the predominant legislative facts, we cannot accept Continental\u2019s argument that the bond which secured to Collins the performance of Salvo\u2019s subcontract was meant to give Continental the right to sue American if it was not paid. The purpose of that promise in this \u00a7 44H bond is aimed at performance and was to protect Collins in the event Salvo should default on the metalwork by requiring American to reimburse Collins for costs incurred to hire another subcontractor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>complete Salvo\u2019s work. Similarly, the indemnification promise in the bond was exclusively for Collins\u2019 benefit and secured payment in the event of the imposition of liability on Collins under \u00a7 29 of c.149. Continental cannot claim to have been shortchanged because of the express remedy afforded it by the first and third paragraphs of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, against Collins and its surety, a remedy which has been construed to provide broad protection to those in Continental\u2019s position. See <em>M. Lasden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Decker Elec. Corp., </em>372 Mass. 179, 183 (1977), and cases cited. The decision <em>in. Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Alexander Indus., Inc., </em>211 A.2d 919 (Del. 1965), relied upon by the plaintiff as justifying recovery is inapposite. That case was decided on general suretyship principles inapplicable here because of our particular statutory framework. Other cases brought to our attention by Continental are also not persuasive because they do not involve statutes similar to ours, or because they also base their analysis on general suretyship principles that in effect permit parties in Continental\u2019s position to recover on a general contractor\u2019s bond but not on a subsidiary bond from the subcontractor to the general contractor. See generally <em>Graybar Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>50 N.J. Super. 289 (1958); <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Foundation Constructors, </em>105 N.H. 470 (1964); <em>Acoustics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>118 N.J. Super. 361 (1971); <em>Amelco Window Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>127 N.J. Super. 342 (1974). Furthermore, Continental\u2019s reliance on \u00a7\u00a7 165 &amp; 166 of the Restatement of Security (1941) is misplaced. Our statutory double bond system does not precisely fit either of the situations described in those sections. By analogy, however, the bond under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, explicitly creates third-party beneficiary rights while the bond under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, explicitly excludes them \u2018because there is no indicated purpose to benefit [a third party].\u201d Restatement of Security, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 166, Comment a.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>2. There remains for brief discussion whether the recent decision in <em>Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart </em>v. <em>SCA Servs. Inc., </em>378 Mass. 535 (1979), enhances Continental\u2019s position. That case swept aside many cobwebs that had been spun around our third party beneficiary rules and allowed third parties found to be intended creditor beneficiaries of a contract to seek its enforcement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart </em>does not apply here because the terms of the promised performance in American\u2019s bond are restricted by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, to benefit the general contractor, a circumstance which excludes claimants such as Continental at the threshold from intended beneficiary status. See 4 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 800 at 173-177 (1951); 2 Williston, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 402 &amp; 403 (3d ed. 1959). See also <em>Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart </em>v. <em>SCA Servs. Inc., supra </em>at 545 n.17. Thus, the <em>Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart </em>decision was not meant to be a vehicle to disrupt the symmetry of the relevant provisions of c. 149 or to create new levels of risk not contemplated by \u00a7 44H or bargained for by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The defendants may move in the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment which (a) finds Salvo indebted to Continental in the amount of $7,390 and (b) finds for American in Continental\u2019s claim on its bond with Salvo.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-5\"> Continental gave written notice to Collins of a possible claim against the general contractor and its surety well beyond the sixty-five day period specified for the notice by the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\"> The defendant Salvo failed to allege any specific facts which established the existence of a genuine, triable issue on the question of its indebtedness to Continental for the balance owed for the work performed and materials supplied by the latter on its subcontract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 29, is made applicable to projects built by housing authorities by virtue of G.
