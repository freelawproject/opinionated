The trial judge ruled that the decision of the reviewing board, which affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the single member, was not warranted by the evidence. The decision by the single member held that Swasey\u2019s automobile accident arose out of and in the course of his employment. \"On judicial review the decision of the board must be accepted as final, if supported by the evidence and not tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 680 (1970). We reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">We take the facts from the evidence presented to the single member. Lehigh Design Company, Inc. (Lehigh), located in Waltham, was in the business of hiring people in the engineering profession and then assigning and dispatching them to their clients, which were companies in need of engineering services. Swasey, an engineering aide technician, interviewed with Lehigh for purposes of employment by it, and Lehigh hired him in the late summer of 1965 to work on a project for one of Lehigh\u2019s clients, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), in Poughkeepsie, New York. During his interview with Le-high, Swasey stated that the salary offered by Lehigh would not permit him to travel between his home in Arlington, Massachusetts, and Poughkeepsie, a distance of 200 miles each way. Lehigh told Swasey that he would also receive per diem compensation at a rate of $1.25 an hour up to a forty-hour maximum of $50 a week; he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>apply that money to food and lodging in Poughkeepsie, or to travel, or to a combination of both, whichever he might choose to do. Because of this extra money, Swasey took the position with Lehigh, and he was assigned to IBM in Poughkeepsie. According to the agreement between Le-high and IBM, Swasey was under the immediate control and direction of IBM, but in all other respects he was under Lehigh\u2019s control. Lehigh required him to file work reports describing how many hours he worked and the services he performed. He was paid by Lehigh, which made the necessary deductions for State and Federal taxes and social security benefits. Lehigh also provided him with workmen\u2019s compensation insurance, and the cost of this was included in IBM\u2019s payment to Lehigh for Swasey\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">While working in Poughkeepsie, Swasey lived in a room which he rented by the week for $25; he cooked his meals in his room on a hotplate, and he took one meal a day at IBM, spending about $12 a week for food; he travelled to and from Arlington in his own car every weekend, leaving Poughkeepsie on Friday night. On October 29, 1965, a Friday, he returned to his room after work, prepared his time reports, did some personal chores, napped and left for Arlington at about 10:30 p.m. While he was travelling through Westfield about 1:00 a.m. his car slammed into a tree, and he suffered a severe hip injury which kept him hospitalized until November 28, 1965, and out of work until June of 1966. At that time he was still on crutches, but he returned to work at IBM, staying until December, when Lehigh transferred him to General Dynamics in Rochester, New York. While assigned to General Dynamics he was paid by Lehigh on the same hourly and per diem basis. He would travel to Arlington only once a month due to the increased distance between his home and his work site. He left this project because his expenses began to exceed his per diem compensation, and because the pain in his hip had increased in duration and intensity, causing him mental stress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>which in turn resulted in a deterioration of his work performance. After leaving General Dynamics he next found work for himself with two electronic corporations in Waltham, but he was laid off from one job because he could not perform the heavier, more physically demanding labor required of him, and he voluntarily left the second job when it became apparent to him that he was not doing his share of the work. In all his jobs, Swasey\u2019s duties as an engineering aide technician involved both intellectual and physical work; he designed and assembled electronic circuits, and as the components became larger through the assembly process the construction of the units required more physical effort and agility on his part. As his pain grew worse he worked less and less, stopping altogether in 1972, when he filed his claim for compensation benefits. For the next three years he was under psychiatric and orthopedic care, and he ultimately had a prosthetic hip attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The single member found that the per diem money was a term of Swasey\u2019s employment contract and that he would not have taken the job without it. He further found that Swasey\u2019s job required both physical and intellectual labor, and that his pain made it difficult for him to perform his physical responsibilities and concentrate on the intellectual aspects of his work. The single member ruled that the hip injury \"arose out of and in the course of\u2019 Swasey\u2019s employment and resulted in his total incapacitation for work. The reviewing board affirmed the single member\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">1. Workmen\u2019s compensation benefits are available to an eligible employee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suffering an injury \"arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and in the course of his employment, or arising out of an ordinary risk of the street while actually engaged, with his employer\u2019s authorization, in the business affairs or undertakings of his employer....\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26, as amended by St. 1973, c. 855, \u00a7 1. <em>Brigham\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 140 (1964). <em>Caron\u2019s Case, </em>351 Mass. 406 (1966). The insurer argues that, because Swasey was travelling to his home for the sole purpose of visiting his family, he is precluded from receiving benefits by the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, which provides that ordinarily an employee injured on the way to or from work is not entitled to compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is because \u201cthe employment relationship is suspended from the time the employee leaves his work to go home until he resumes his work.\u201d <em>Zenith Natl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Bd., </em>66 Cal. 2d 944, 947 (1967). Compare <em>Caron\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 409. The insurer relies upon <em>Wormstead </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Saugus, </em>366 Mass. 659, 664 (1975), for the proposition that the rule must be here applied because Swasey did not demonstrate that his \"injury occurred during a period (1) for which he was being paid, (2) when he was on call, and (3) while he was engaged in activities consistent with and helpful to the accomplishment of [the functions of his employment].\u201d <em>Wormstead </em>does not restrict our focus to those \"factors\u201d in reviewing the nature of Swasey\u2019s employment; indeed, it specifically holds that we must \"look at the plaintiffs employment in all of its aspects,\u201d <em>id., </em>which includes \"the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the employment.\u201d <em>Papanastassiou\u2019s Case, </em>362 Mass. 91, 93 (1972). <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The evidence warranted a finding that Swasey\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. The \"going and coming\u201d rule has no application to this case because when Swasey\u2019s employment is viewed in its entirety, his travel was of such a nature that it brings him within \"that class of'travelling workers\u2019 not barred from receiving compensation.\u201d <em>Wormstead, supra </em>at 667. Although Swasey\u2019s employment did not require continuous mobility, it did impel travel, and \"where it appears that it was the employment which impelled the employee to make the trip, the risk of the trip is a hazard of the employment.\u201d <em>Caron\u2019s Case, 351 </em>Mass. at 409. Swasey was employed by Lehigh not merely as an engineering aide, but, rather, as an engineering aide whom Lehigh, due to the very nature of its business, would assign and dispatch to distant areas, like Poughkeepsie and Rochester, to work on a specific project until completion or reassignment. It was to the benefit of Lehigh\u2019s business interests that its employees travel, and it knew that its employees did not relocate their families with each assignment but would, instead, make periodic visits home. This is obvious from Lehigh\u2019s payment of a per diem amount for purposes of living or travel expenses, whichever the employee might choose. Swasey elected to do both, and the per diem compensation was sufficient to cover the costs of his choice. Although Swasey was not injured during the hours he worked at Poughkeepsie, he was injured while engaged in an activity which constituted a critical and substantial incident of his employment for which he received compensation. Therefore, Swasey\u2019s accident could properly be found to be within the \"risk of the street while actually engaged ... in the ... undertakings of his employer,\u201d that is, travelling from his IBM worksite (see <em>Papanastassiou\u2019s Case, </em>362 Mass. at 93, 94), and we will not overturn the finding of the single member. <em>Josi\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 415, 416 (1949). <em>Brigham\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. at 141. <em>Galloway\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 427, 428 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>2. The insurer argues that Swasey is barred from receiving benefits because it did not receive notice of the injury \"as soon as practicable after the happening thereof,\u201d nor did Swasey file his claim for benefits within one year after the occurrence of the injury, all as required by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 487, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, it is well established that this notice provision is not a bar to a claim if the employer knew of the injury or if the lack of notice did not prejudice the insurer. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 44.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Perrotta\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 737, 739 (1945). <em>Leminen\u2019s Case, </em>353 Mass. 772, 772-773 (1968). The failure to file a claim within the period specified in \u00a7 41 is also excusable upon a showing of lack of prejudice to the insurer. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 49.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The single member found that \"late notice and claim are excused by the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 49, as to knowledge and want of prejudice.\u201d While the insurer raises a substantial question as to whether Lehigh was sufficiently apprised of the facts surrounding Swasey\u2019s injury so that it would have knowledge of the possibility of a compensable claim (see <em>Hatch\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 259, 262 [1935]; <em>Curtin\u2019s Case, 354 </em>Mass. 45, 47 [1968]), we need not reach that question because the single member\u2019s finding of lack of prejudice to the insurer,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under both \u00a7 44 and <em>\u00a7 49, is </em>supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>evidence and will not be disturbed. <em>Wnukowski\u2019s Case, </em>296 Mass. 63,64 (1936). <em>Clifford\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 129,132 (1958). <em>Ogonowsky\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 468, 470 (1959). Although Swasey had the burden of proving lack of prejudice to the insurer, he was not required to disprove all the possibilities in order to meet this burden <em>(Kangas\u2019s Case, 282 </em>Mass. 155, 158 [1933]); it was sufficient for him to introduce evidence \"from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that the insurer suffered no prejudice.\u201d <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465, 469. <em>Berthiaume\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 186,191 (1951). The insurer here argues, but without support in the evidence, that Swasey\u2019s late filing resulted in its inability to investigate and enforce any possible third-party liability pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 1965, c. 487, \u00a7 1A,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> its inability to locate possible witnesses, and its inability to secure orthopedic and psychiatric examinations of Swasey. In addition to presenting medical records which documented that he received prompt, competent, and thorough treatment for his injuries, Swasey presented evidence from which it could be found that a timely notice and filing under \u00a7 41 and a prompt investigation thereafter would not have unearthed anything more favorable to the insurer. See <em>Gaffner\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 566, 568 (1932); <em>Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. at 159; <em>Wheaton\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 504, 507 (1941); <em>Pena\u2019s Case, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 455-456 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">3. The insurer next argues that the single member\u2019s findings that Swasey was totally incapacitated and that this was a result of his injury are unsupported by the evidence. These findings were adopted by the reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>board, and it is not our function to overturn them, even if the board could have made different findings, unless they were based upon an error of law <em>(Josi\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. at 416) or unsupported by any rational view of the evidence. <em>Wnukowski\u2019s Case, </em>296 Mass. at 64. <em>Clifford\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. at 132. The findings suffer from neither of those defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">4. The insurer properly contends that the single member\u2019s findings of Swasey\u2019s right to additional compensation benefits because of his dependent children were unwarranted on the evidence presented to him. Swasey was awarded $30 a week additional benefits, or $6 a week for his wife and each of his four children as provided by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35A, as amended through St. 1959, c. 566, \u00a7 4. This provision extends a conclusive presumption of dependency to certain children described within \u00a7 35A(c), which description includes children under eighteen years of age. The only evidence presented to the single member concerning Swasey\u2019s children was his testimony that they were born in 1949, 1952, 1953, and 1960. Children over eighteen years of age and not otherwise within the scope of \u00a7 35A(c) cannot be included in a determination of added compensation for dependents because they are not dependent upon the disabled employee for support. See <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 444, 448 (1954). The single member awarded \u00a7 35A benefits to Swasey for all his children for the periods October 31,1965, to June 1,1966, and August 1, 1972, to date and continuing. There are no findings which indicate how those determinations were made. In light of the dependents\u2019 birth dates and \u00a7 35A(c), we must conclude that these findings are unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the claim for compensation is reversed, and a judgment is to be entered remanding the case to the Industrial Accident Board for further findings on the issue of additional benefits under \u00a7 35A(c) in conformity with this opinion and on the basis of the evidence presently in the record. Swasey is to have the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> Lehigh provided workmen\u2019s compensation protection for its employees, G.
