His complaint sought cancellation of a note and mortgage given in connection with the financing of the sale on the ground of mutual mistake or fraud. He also sought rescission of the purchase and reimbursement for over-payments made on the note because of an error in calculating the land area conveyed by the deed. The defendants admitted an error in the description of the land conveyed, asked that the amount due on the note be reduced proportionately and counterclaimed for the proportional amount due and unpaid under the note.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dispute was referred to a master (Mass. R. Civ. P. 53, 365 Mass. 817 [1974]), who concluded that the sale was not vitiated by mutual mistake or fraud and that the defendants were entitled to the sum of $84,716 as the adjusted amount still owing on the note. The master left the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the note to the judge. The judge overruled the plaintiff\u2019s objections to the report, ordered it adopted, and, after an evidentiary hearing, made an assessment of costs and attorney\u2019s fees on the note. Judgment was entered accordingly. The plaintiff appeals, claiming that the master\u2019s general findings of no mutual mistake or fraud are not supported by the evidence, that the master applied the wrong standard of proof in reaching his result, and that the judge erred in the award of counsel fees. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">1. <em>Procedural issue. </em>The plaintiff has submitted as part of the appendix in excess of 150 transcript pages of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>evidence before the master. He asks us to review this evidence and conclude that the master took an erroneous view of numerous questions of fact. This we decline to do. <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Wallach, </em>366 Mass. 622, 626 (1975). <em>Blakeley </em>v. <em>Pilgrim Packing Co., </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 19, 20 n.2 (1976). In view of the recurring frequency of the reproduction on appeal of evidence before a master with the request that the master\u2019s findings be measured against the evidence, we reiterate that \u201cabsent an order that a master file a transcript with his report, such a transcript is not part of the record on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>Aronson, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 182, 186 (1976). The proper method by which a party may preserve his right to raise the question whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support a master\u2019s findings of fact is precisely set forth in Rule 49, \u00a7 7, of the Superior Court, as amended (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> So far as the record discloses no requests for summaries of evidence were filed as required by the rule, nor did the plaintiff observe the procedures described in the rule as prerequisites for obtaining summaries. Bare unsupported objections to findings or statements in the objections that certain of the master\u2019s findings did not conform to the plaintiff\u2019s requested findings of fact are insufficient. Failure to follow the requirements of the rule confines review to matters apparent on the face of the report. See generally <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>Aronson, supra </em>at 190 (decided under the 1974 version of the rule). Requests to act otherwise seek to impose unwarranted burdens on trial and appellate courts and clash with the purpose of a master\u2019s referral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\u2014 \u201cto have the facts settled ... and to put the case in a position where nothing remains to be done except for the judge to apply correct principles of law to the facts found.\u201d <em>Shelburne Shirt Co. </em>v. <em>Singer, </em>322 Mass. 262, 265 (1948). <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Wallach, supra </em>at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">2. <em>Master's findings. </em>When the evidence is not reported or otherwise summarized, the master\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive unless \u201cthey are mutually inconsistent, contradictory, plainly wrong or vitiated in view of the controlling law.\u201d <em>Wormstead </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Saugus, </em>366 Mass. 659, 660 (1975), quoting from <em>Selectmen of Hatfield </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>362 Mass. 821, 825 (1973). <em>First Crestwood Corp. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Middleton, 3 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 234, 235 (1975). In this light we summarize the master\u2019s material findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Anthony G. Chambers and his mother owned two parcels of agriculturally zoned land in Mansfield, the first containing 10.59 acres, the second containing approximately fifty acres. They had inherited the land from Chambers\u2019 father, who had entered a contract with a construction company for the sale of gravel from the fifty-acre parcel. The zoning board of appeals granted a permit with conditions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for the removal of the gravel, and the construction company filed a $40,000 performance bond. In 1968, upon completion of the gravel removal, the performance bond was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Chambers\u2019 mother lived on the smaller parcel, but Chambers himself was a Connecticut resident who only visited the site once or twice during the gravel removal operations. Chambers and his mother authorized a family friend, one Alpert, to act as a finder for the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>fifty-acre parcel. Alpert was only authorized to convey offers, and he was given no authority to negotiate or bargain for the sellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Covich is an experienced builder and developer of commercial and residential properties who had previously developed a single-family residential subdivision in Mansfield. In the spring of 1972 Covich became interested in the Chambers property. He approached Alpert, who arranged a meeting between Covich and the sellers, at. which time an offer to purchase was made by Covich but not accepted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ten months of negotiations ensued, culminating in the signing of a sale agreement on February 12, 1973, for the fifty-acre parcel at a price of $2,500 per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Before he entered the agreement, Covich engaged a registered engineer and surveyor who had been a member of the Mansfield planning board during the period of the gravel excavation and who was aware of its removal. The engineer searched the records of the zoning board for the contour map referred to in the special permit (note 4, <em>supra) </em>but was unable to obtain it because the records had been destroyed by a fire. He also walked the perimeter of the land in early 1973 and knew on his first inspection that fill would be needed for certain lots. The engineer prepared a preliminary plan prior to the closing and discovered that the proposed form of deed overstated the area of the property by about five acres.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Prior to signing the sale agreement, Covich had also walked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>boundaries with his engineer and knew that gravel had been removed from the property. The master found that Covich made a conscious choice not to dig test holes or to perform percolation tests to determine the water table, although he had done so in other developments and would not have been prevented from so doing on this tract. The master also observed on his view a swamp in the southeast section of the land. The master found that Chambers knew that the performance bond had been released but that Covich was unaware of its release before he agreed to purchase the property. He also found that Chambers did not rely on the bond\u2019s release or performance of the conditions of the permit in entering the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">A closing took place on June 1 or 4,1973, during which Chambers and his mother, for consideration of $137,875, sold to Covich a parcel of land \u201ccontaining 55.15 acres more or less.\u201d Covich paid $39,984 including the original deposit in cash, and executed a promissory note for $97,891, secured by a mortgage on the land.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In December, 1973 (six months after the closing), Covich dug test holes on the property. In the holes dug, the water table varied from six inches to thirty-four inches below the surface. This did not meet the minimum depth requirement of the State Sanitary Code that ground water disposal fields should not be constructed in areas where the maximum ground water elevation is less than four feet below the bottom of the disposal field. The parties stipulated that prior to the date of the agreement 497,168 cubic yards of gravel had been removed from the land and that Chambers was aware of this removal. Without considering the fill necessary for the roads, it was estimated that 150,000 cubic yards of fill would be necessary to make forty to forty-five buildable lots.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Although he concluded that Chambers knew about Covich\u2019s plan to develop the property prior to signing the sale agreement, the master found \u201cno evidence that ... Chambers was aware of the water table problem or that he had enough knowledge so that he was put on notice that a water problem existed.\u201d He found that \u201cit is good engineering practice to dig test holes to find the water table before purchasing land, a step which plaintiff failed to take.\u201d He detected no evidence that either Chambers or his mother made a false representation as to the property upon which Covich could have relied. He concluded that there was no evidence of reliance on the gravel permit or the bond prior to the parties\u2019 entering the contract and that no mutual mistake had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">3. <em>Standard of proof. </em>Relying on certain gratuitous language in the report,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the plaintiff claims that the master erroneously replaced the usual preponderance standard with one of proof \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d as the measure of evidence justifying rescission for mutual mistake. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">We note first that the plaintiff filed a list of specific objections to the report. None of the objections brought to the judge\u2019s attention the current claim as to the standard of proof. An objecting party has the duty of alerting the judge to those specific parts of the report he questions, because \u201c[t]he report clearly [is] not objectionable as a whole ... [and the judge] could not be required to assume the burden of separating the good from the bad.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Associated Transp. Inc., </em>345 Mass. 55, 58 (1962) (defendant unsuccessfully sought to have the report expunged in its entirety on the ground that there was error in the standard of care applied by the auditor). The rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>governing master\u2019s reports in non-jury actions also specifically require that the objections \u201cclearly\u201d state their grounds, a requirement that forecloses objections that have not been expressed to the judge reviewing the report. Mass.R.Civ.P. 53(e)(2), 365 Mass. 820 (1975). See also <em>Freitas </em>v. <em>Olson &amp; Appleby, Inc., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 801 (1976). This misstep adversely affects the plaintiff\u2019s right to raise the claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">However, we think the master was correct in applying the stricter test of clear and convincing proof to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When reformation of a written contract is sought for mistake, it is established that \u201c [reformation will not be decreed unless the facts required for such a decree are proved convincingly and to the entire satisfaction of the court. A preponderance of the evidence is said not to be enough.\u201d 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 615, at 743 (1960). Accord, <em>Stockbridge Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Hudson Iron Co., </em>107 Mass. 290 (1871); <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>Greenman, </em>283 Mass. 601, 614 (1933); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 870, n.10 (1975); 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2498(3) (3d ed. 1940). \u201cAnd the principle applies where cancellation for such a mistake is sought.\u201d <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>Greenman, supra </em>at 613. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra </em>at 870 n.10. As Professor Corbin points out, the rule derives from the fact that \u201c[t]he document itself, duly executed and introduced in court, has weight as evidence of mutual agreement. If supported by one party\u2019s testimony that there was no mistake of the sort justifying reforma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>tion... the testimony of the other party must be well supported in order to overcome the weight of the evidence against him.\u201d 3 Corbin, Contracts, <em>supra </em>at 745-746. This is also generally the rule in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> All of these are expressions of standards designed in the last analysis to impress upon the trier of fact the special degree of attention, care, and scrutiny that he must bring to the evidence before finding for a party seeking nullification of a written agreement. See generally <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra </em>at 876 (Quirico, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The plaintiff claims that there was \u201ca basic assumption on which the contract was made\u201d concerning which both parties were mistaken. See <em>Dover Pool &amp; Racquet Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brooking, </em>366 Mass. 629, 633 (1975). This is tantamount to an assertion that the parties did not have a meeting of the minds. In such a case it was incumbent upon the plaintiff when faced with the fully integrated agreement to establish his theory by a measure of proof that convinced the master that the parties had never agreed on certain essential terms. The master\u2019s approach to the dispute displayed an adequate grasp and application of the principles governing the standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>4. <em>Elements of mutual mistake. </em>The plaintiff claims that the master\u2019s conclusion that a mutual mistake had not occurred \u201cwas based upon a fundamental misconception and misunderstanding of the legal principles applicable\u201d and that his subsidiary findings compel a general finding of mutual mistake. To the contrary, we conclude that the subsidiary findings inexorably lead to the result reached by the master: that any mistake was entirely unilateral and that the risk was assumed by Covich.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">A recent distillation of the principles concerning the doctrine of mistake is contained in the Restatement. \u201cA mistake is a belief that is not in accord with existing facts.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 293 (Tent. Draft No. 10,1975). \u201cWhere a mistake of both parties at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party unless he bears the risk of the mistake. ...\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 294. \u201cA party bears the risk of a mistake when ... he is aware, at the time the contract is made, that he has only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake relates, but treats his limited knowledge as sufficient....\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 296. Our cases are substantially in accord with these rules. See <em>Spurr </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>99 Mass. 463, 466 (1868); <em>Kyle </em>v. <em>Kavanagh, </em>103 Mass. 356, 359-360 (1869); <em>Jeselsohn </em>v. <em>Park Trust Co., </em>241 Mass. 388, 392 (1922); <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>346 Mass. 76, 80 (1963); <em>Dover Pool &amp; Racquet Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brooking, supra </em>at 632-634. While it is clear that a party seeking rescission need not show even an innocent misrepresentation of some material assumption which forms the basis of his bargain in order to make out a case of mutual mistake of fact <em>(White </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 80), it is also elementary that both parties must share the erroneous state of mind as to the basic assumption on which the contract was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>made.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Dover Pool &amp; Racquet Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brooking, supra </em>at 632-633, and cases cited. See also <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Buttrick, </em>165 Mass. 547, 548-549 (1896). Avoidance is not permitted just because one party is disappointed in the hope that the facts accord with his wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In this case the master\u2019s internally consistent subsidiary findings and reasonable inferences which we may draw therefrom <em>(Bills </em>v. <em>Nunno, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 279, 283-284 [1976]) establish that it was Covich, not Chambers, who was an expert on land development; that Covich approached the finder and pursued the purchase of the land; that neither party relied upon the release of the performance bond as a basis for entering the contract; and that Covich was unaware of the release until after he offered to purchase the land. In light of his written offer, which would have required Mrs. Chambers to undertake percolation tests, we think two inferences are compelling: that Covich did not rely on anyone else\u2019s knowledge, representations or belief as to the controlling facts concerning the water table; and that in failing to insert a similar condition in the purchase and sale agreement, Covich voluntarily assumed the risk as part of his bargain that the land might not have adequate drainage for the necessary septic systems. Further findings which buttress the master\u2019s conclusion that the mistake, if any, was unilateral or the risk assumed, include ones to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the effect that Chambers would not have understood the importance of the water table had he known about it; that the presence of a swamp in one section of the parcel was readily apparent (which could have put both the engineer and Covich, but not Chambers, on notice of a high water table); that the engineer knew from his first inspection that at least some of the parcels required fill; that Covich himself usually took the precaution of making certain simple tests for water table level before purchasing land; that it was good engineering practice to make these tests; and that it was Covich who decided not to do so. This is not a case like <em>Dover Pool &amp; Racquet Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brooking, supra, </em>where both parties recognized the importance of the zoning ordinance to the buyer\u2019s proposed use and were simply mistaken as to a change in applicable zoning regulation. Nor is it a case like <em>White </em>v. <em>White, supra, </em>where neither party intended the result that their choice of language produced. Neither party to a contract can rescind it \u201cbecause the known and assumed risk turned out to be greater than either or both expected it to be.\u201d <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>352 Mass. 628, 632 (1967), quoting from <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>317 Mass. 86, 88 (1944). Leaving these contracts intact will not produce an unconscionable result, and Covich has not demonstrated that it is impracticable for him to perform or that the purpose of the contract has been frustrated in a sense sufficient to provide a remedy. See generally Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 281 and 285 (Tent. Draft No. 9,1974). Both the master and the judge correctly concluded that this was a case of \u201cconscious ignorance or deliberate risk taking on the purchaser\u2019s part\u201d <em>(Dover Pool &amp; Racquet Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brooking, supra </em>at 637), a situation which precludes relief. As Mr. Justice Sutherland observed, \u201cwhether the agreement was made reluctantly, or appellant got the worst of the bargain, are matters unnecessary to be considered. It is enough that, without fraud [mistake] or coercion, [he] did agree.\u201d <em>Savage Arms Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>266 U.S. 217, 221 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>5. <em>Attorney's fees and costs. </em>Covich\u2019s final argument challenges the validity of the judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees on the note. The note provides for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the collection of any unpaid balance due. When the claims were brought, the first installment was not yet due; thereafter, it became due and was not paid. The counterclaim which sought payment of the unpaid balance on the note and fees and costs attributable to collection, although filed after the conclusion of the master\u2019s hearings, was fully tried before the master by agreement of the parties. We find no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s argument that because the counterclaim was filed after the hearings concluded, collection of the sums due under the note was not in issue. The argument overlooks the manifest purpose of permitting the evidence pertaining to the counterclaims to be heard with the merits of the original complaint - \u201cto effectuate the settlement in one proceeding of controversies so closely connected as appropriately to be combined in one trial in order to prevent duplication of testimony, to avoid unnecessary expense to the parties and to the public, and to expedite the adjudication of suits.\u201d <em>Potier </em>v. <em>A.W. Perry, Inc., </em>286 Mass. 602, 608 (1934). <em>Stubbert </em>v. <em>Sergio, </em>335 Mass. 91, 93 (1956). We also conclude that fees attributable to the defense of the rescission and cancellation actions were properly awarded under the terms of the note because the successful resistance of these claims was intrinsic to establishing a default on the note as a predicate for its collection. Finally, there was competent evidence in support of the judge\u2019s assessment of the fees in keeping with standards set out in <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>284 Mass. 563 (1933), and <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 415, 418 (1975), and the record reveals no arbitrariness, injustice or abuse of discretion in the amount of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\"> These claims and admissions were contained in the defendants\u2019 amended answer, which was filed and allowed by the judge after the completion of the hearings before the master.

Care is all the more necessary when the asserted mistake relates to a writing, because the law of contracts, as is indicated by the parol evidence rule and the Statute of Frauds, attaches great weight to the written expression of an agreement. This is commonly summarized in a standard that requires the trier of the facts to be satisfied by \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 before reformation is decreed. Each case must, however, turn on its particular facts, and the evidentiary weight to be attached to a writing will depend, in part, on its inherent credibility in the light of those facts. Once the court is convinced that the writing fails to express the agreement of the parties, the writing loses its usual evidentiary effect with respect to other matters, such as the ascertainment of the parties\u2019 actual agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\"> A party may avoid a contract for unilateral mistake only if he does not bear the risk of the mistake and the other party either knows of his mistake or the mistake has the effect of rendering the contract unconscionable. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 295 (Tent. Draft No. 10, 1975). Historically, a bargain was considered unconscionable if it was \u201csuch as no man in his senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand, and as no honest and fair man would accept on the other.\u201d <em>Hume </em>v. <em>United States, </em>132 U.S. 406 (1889), quoting <em>Earl of Chesterfield </em>v. <em>Janssen, </em>28 Eng. Rep. 82,100 (Ch. 1750). Later, a contract was determined unenforceable because unconscionable when \u201cthe sum total of its provisions drives too hard a bargain for a court of conscience to assist.\u201d <em>Campbell Soup Co. </em>v. <em>Wentz, </em>172 F.2d 80, 84 (3d Cir. 1948).
