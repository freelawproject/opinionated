L. c. 209, \u00a7 3, as in effect prior to St. 1975, c. 558, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where the deed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>acknowledged only by the wife. The judge dismissed the husband\u2019s complaint brought on March 19, 1975, to set aside the conveyance, ruling that the wife\u2019s acknowledgment was sufficient to validate the deed. On the wife\u2019s counterclaim for declaratory relief, the judge declared the deed valid and binding between the parties and effective to convey title to the wife. We agree with the judge\u2019s ruling, for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The facts are not in dispute. On June 25, 1969, the Gordons acquired the land in question as tenants by the entirety. Their relationship before and after the purchase of the property was marked by marital discord. Toward the end of 1970 they had resumed a joint marital domicil in Boston and were in the process of trying to improve their relationship. On December 14, 1970, following a conversation between the spouses on the preceding day, Mrs. Gordon went to an attorney and told him, \u201cHarry wants the deed changed into my name.\u201d On December 15,1970, Mrs. Gordon picked up a deed prepared by the attorney, dated December 15, 1970, with the names of both spouses typed on the acknowledgment portion of the deed. That evening, in the bedroom of their home, Mr. Gordon signed the deed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Gordon signed it on the morning of December 16,1970, and took it, by herself, to a notary public before whom she acknowledged the instrument to be the free act and deed of herself and of her husband. Mr. Gordon was not present at that time. The notary affixed his signature and seal below the recitation that both had personally appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>before him and acknowledged the instrument as their free act and deed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mrs. Gordon then took the deed to the attorney with instructions to have it recorded. For some unexplained reason, the deed was not recorded until July 6,1971. On October 11,1974, Mrs. Gordon commenced a divorce action which subsequently resulted in a final judgment of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The issue before us is whether the wife\u2019s acknowledgment is sufficient to validate the deed under G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That statute, as in effect prior to St. 1975, c. 558, \u00a7 2, expressed a legislative decision to allow transfers of real property between husband and wife, and to impose upon such transfers the requirement that a deed between husband and wife be \u201cduly acknowledged and recorded ... .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The principal function of an acknowledgment is that it is required for the recording of a deed, and furnishes formal proof of the authenticity of the execution of the instrument when presented for recording. See <em>McQuatt </em>v. <em>McQuatt, </em>320 Mass. 410, 413-414 (1946). In ordinary circumstances, title to real estate may be trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>ferred by a deed which has not been acknowledged, and such deed is good against the grantor and his heirs and those having actual notice. G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1941, c. 85. By G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 3, however, the acknowledgment and recording of a deed between husband and wife was made a statutory prerequisite and is necessary to the validity of the deed. The purpose of the provision requiring acknowledgment and recording, as expressed by the court in <em>Malaguti </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>262 Mass. 555, 564 (1928), \u201cwas to. prevent the deception and defrauding of creditors by making gifts of real property ineffective unless evidenced by recorded deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">General Laws c. 209, \u00a7 3, does not specify by what method a deed between spouses is to be \u201cduly acknowledged.\u201d For aid in construction we turn to G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 30, which provides that the \u201cacknowledgment of a deed ... shall be by one or more of the grantors or by the attorney executing it.\u201d A \u201cgrantor\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Eleventh, as \u201cevery person from or by whom a freehold estate or interest passes in or by any deed ... .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Peirce, </em>165 Mass. 359 (1896), the court held that a husband alone can acknowledge a deed of his wife\u2019s separate property where his interest is only an estate by curtesy and he is a \u201cgrantor\u201d only in the sense that he is releasing his curtesy rights. Accord, <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>9 Gray 56 (1857); <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>11 Allen 538 (1866).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Poor, </em>6 Pick. 86, 87-88 (1827), the court held that, under a predecessor statute to c. 183, \u00a7 30, acknowledgment of a deed by one grantor was suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>ficient, even though the deed was not acknowledged by the other grantor, who was solely seized of that part of the property at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We think that the liberal judicial construction given to the word \u201cgrantor\u201d as it now appears in G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 30, should be applied in the present case. The husband contends that the only interest that could be conveyed by the deed is the freehold interest of the husband, and that he alone is the grantor of that interest. We take this argument to mean that it is the husband alone who is relinquishing interest in the property and thus is the only true \u201cgrantor.\u201d However, we agree with the judge\u2019s ruling that, when a husband and wife holding lands as tenants by the entirety convey such property, both husband and wife are grantors, not the husband alone. The nature of the tenancy by the entirety is such that, as defined at common law, both husband and wife have one and the same interest. See 4A Powell, Real Property par. 620 (Rohan ed. 1978).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The spouses hold one indivisible estate in them both and in the survivor, this concept being founded \u00f3n the common law doctrine that, in law, husband and wife constitute but one person. See <em>Bernatavicius </em>v. <em>Bernatavicius, </em>259 Mass. 486, 487 (1927). With regard to the present case, we need not rely directly on this rather abstruse concept of a fictitious unity of persons,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in view of the foregoing judicial interpretations of the word \u201cgrantor\u201d in c. 183, \u00a7 30. We conclude that either spouse alone could acknowledge the deed in question, since both at the time of conveyance had a freehold interest in the property, both joined in executing and signing the deed, and both spouses, therefore, were grantors within the meaning of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Eleventh.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>The husband argues that the wife cannot be a grantor because she is also the grantee of the deed, and one cannot convey by deed to oneself. While it is true that a person cannot convey to himself alone<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Park, Conveyancing, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 57), that is not the case here, where the freehold interest which was held by both the husband and wife was transferred to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Since the wife was one of the grantors to the deed, her acknowledgment alone satisfies the requirements of c. 183, \u00a7 30, making the deed \u201cduly acknowledged\u201d pursuant to c. 209, \u00a7 3, and effective to pass title to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-13\"> \u201c [Conveyances of real estate . . . between husband and wife shall be valid to the same extent as if they were sole, except that no such conveyance of real estate shall have any effect, either in passing title or otherwise, until the deed describing the property to be transferred is duly acknowledged and recorded . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">By St. 1975, c. 558, \u00a7 2, the statute was rewritten so that acknowledgment and recording of transfers of property between husband and wife are no longer required to validate such transfers. General Laws c. 209, \u00a7 3, now provides that \u201c[transfers of real and personal property between husband and wife shall be valid to the same extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>as if they were sole.\" Pursuant to G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 29, a certificate of acknowledgment or proof of the due execution of a deed is required to be endorsed upon or annexed to the deed before it can be recorded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\"> In his complaint, the husband alleged that he had not signed the deed, and that the signature on the deed was not his. The judge expressly found, however, that the husband did sign the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">In his motion for a new trial and on appeal the husband no longer makes this contention, but relies on an alternative contention, first alleged in his amended complaint, that the deed was not validly acknowledged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\"> The deed recites that \u201cHarry L. Gordon and Cecile H. Gordon . .. for consideration paid, grant Cecile H. Gordon ... the land----\u201d The deed is signed by both parties, and by a notary public in the acknowledgment portion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\"> The husband makes no argument based on the fact that the acknowledgment incorrectly recited that Mr. Gordon \u201cpersonally appeared\u201d before the notary public. It is undisputed that he did not so appear. As the judge found, however, that alone would not be fatal to the conveyance here, since the wife\u2019s own acknowledgment was properly made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b878-11\"> At common law, transfers of property directly between husband and wife were prohibited, although such transfers could be made through a third person. See, e.g., <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>154 Mass. 537 (1891). The common law was modified by St. 1912, c. 304, a precursor of G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 3, permitting transfers of real property between spouses, but requiring acknowledgment and recording. It was not until St. 1954, c. 395, \u00a7 2, which rewrote G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 8, that a conveyance of real estate by a person to himself and his spouse as tenants by the entirety was made valid, and in <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>332 Mass. 329 (1955), it was held that, under c. 209, \u00a7 3, one spouse could terminate a tenancy by the entirety by conveying his or her interest in it directly to the other spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b879-6\"> \u201c[T]he term \u2018grantor\u2019 is the most common and comprehensive word used to mean one who transfers, by any mode of conveyance, property in houses or lands.\u201d <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>5 Mass. 438, 471-472 (1809).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\"> \u201cAlthough the [cited] cases could be considered authority for the proposition that a valid acknowledgment can be made by a husband alone where the grantors have held as tenants by the entirety, they would no. longer apply to an acknowledgment by the husband of land owned entirely by the wife because of the... married women statutes.
