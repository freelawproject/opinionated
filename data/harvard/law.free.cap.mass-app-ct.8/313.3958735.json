L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, from the dismissal of an indictment charging the defendant with breaking and entering into a building in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny, and larceny.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was allowed (by the motion judge) on double jeopardy grounds on June 22, 1978, when the case was called for trial in the Superior Court for the second time. Trial of the case had originally begun on April 6, 1978, before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>different judge (the trial judge). During that day the jury were empanelled, both parties made openings, and the jury heard testimony from two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. On the following day, a Friday, after a lobby conference the judge declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">It is undisputed that, when the mistrial was declared, jeopardy had attached within the meaning of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969). The defendant had obviously been \"put to trial before the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 479 (1971). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, </em>370 Mass. 288, 291-292 (1976). As stated in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 503-505 (1978), \"Because jeopardy attaches before the judgment becomes final, the constitutional protection also embraces the defendant\u2019s 'valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u2019 [Citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. at 484, <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 466 (1978), and <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689 (1949).]... Even if the first trial is not completed, a second prosecution may be grossly unfair. It increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused, prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted. The danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed. Consequently, as a general rule, the prosecutor is entitled to one, and only one, opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.... [However] retrial is not automatically barred when a criminal proceeding is terminated without finally resolving the merits of the charges against the accused. [This is] [because of the variety of circumstances that may make it necessary to discharge a jury before a trial is concluded, and because those circumstances do not invariably create unfairness to the accused .. .\u201d (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The Court went on to say, \"Yet in view of the importance of the right, and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial, the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His burden is a heavy one. The prosecutor must demonstrate \u2019manifest necessity\u2019 for any mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">From our examination of the transcript of the hearing of June 22, 1978, on which the dismissal was based, supplemented by the transcript of the hearing on June 29, 1978, on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to vacate the order of dismissal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we are convinced that the motion judge was warranted in rejecting the justification for aborting the trial offered by the Commonwealth \u2014 simply that \"when the judge stated he would not be there the Commonwealth and defense counsel had no other choice.\u201d But it is undisputed that the trial judge was leaving for a week\u2019s vacation beginning the following Tuesday and declared a mistrial because he could not finish the trial on the preceding Friday and Monday. We do not conceive of circumstances in which a judge\u2019s vacation plans would constitute \"manifest necessity\u201d and justify subjecting a defendant to the expense and strain of another trial. <em>People </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>48 N.Y.2d 1, 10 (1979) (\"Weighed in the balance of judicial obligations, a necessary change in travel plans is of little significance\u201d). If there could be such extraordinary circumstances, the burden was on the Commonwealth to adduce them. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>434 U.S. at 505; <em>Dunkerley </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>579 F.2d 141,146 (2d Cir. 1978), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 1090 (1979). The Commonwealth made no attempt to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The Commonwealth argues in the alternative that the defendant (as put in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief) \"should not be permitted to successfully oppose a retrial two months later when he did not voice any objection to the mistrial at the time of the trial judge\u2019s ruling.\u201d That may have some relevance to the question whether the trial was terminated \"without the defendant\u2019s consent,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. at 480, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 579 (1824),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and therefore, absent \"manifest necessity,\u201d gave rise to a double jeopardy claim \u2014 or putting it otherwise whether, the defendant consenting, his claim to rights under the double jeopardy clause was waived. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gori, </em>282 F.2d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 1960), aff d, 367 U.S. 364 (1961), referring to \"the now well settled view that waiver or consent by the defendant barred his later resort to the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In our case the motion judge was well justified in failing to find consent, which \u2014 since a waiver of constitutional rights is involved \u2014 it was the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to establish. The motion judge could accept, as he apparently did, the representations by defense counsel at the June 22 hearing and reiterated at the June 29 hearing that defense counsel had requested that the trial go forward and indeed that he had offered to \"shorten up\u201d the trial by eliminating some of the corroborating witnesses. This is undisputed, and indeed the prosecuting attorney stated that \"[t]he Commonwealth was as much dismayed as defense counsel when this case was mistried.\u201d In the circumstances it is of little significance that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>upon emerging from the lobby conference the defense counsel did not record an objection or exception to the announcement to the jury of the mistrial \u2014 save as an exception might have become the vehicle for appeal, had the defendant been convicted a second time. But the defendant chose the route of a motion to dismiss (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>257 Mass. 535, 537 [1926]; <em>Thames </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 477, 478 [1974]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, </em>370 Mass. 288, 290 [1976]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 384 [1979]); and the motion judge was free to entertain it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 892 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">This is not a situation in which defense counsel stood silent without making his position known and the totality of the circumstances was such that the Commonwealth could be said to have carried its burden of showing waiver of the double jeopardy claim. See generally <em>Mistrial and </em>Double Jeopardy, 49 N.Y.U.L Rev. 937, \u00a7 3, at 948-951 (\"Consent to Mistrial\u201d) (1974); 63 A.L.R.2d 782, \u00a7 3, at 788-790 (\"Particular conduct generally; express and implied consent\u201d) (1959). The position of defense counsel was as clear as in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>593 F.2d 415, 417 (1st Cir. 1979), in which counsel, as in this case, had indicated that they wished to proceed with the trial and the court held on appeal \u2014 as we do in this case \u2014 that there was no \"manifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial. The Commonwealth did not seriously argue before the motion judge that defense counsel\u2019s failure to record an objection created any ambiguity in his position which misled the trial judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The Commonwealth\u2019s brief suggests that the trial judge may have relied on the lack of an objection and quotes the following from the explanation which the trial judge gave to the jury on declaring a mistrial. \"I\u2019ve explained to counsel and they have been very understanding about this.\u201d The transcript of the aborted trial (see note 2, supra) was not before the motion judge; and the prosecuting attorney, neither at the hearing on the motion to dismiss nor at the hearing on the motions to vacate, found this remark significant enough to call to the motion judge\u2019s attention. We cannot see how speculation as to the purport of this ambiguous sentence could have changed the motion judge\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing indictment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-13\"> The Commonwealth waived its appeal from the dismissal of an indictment for a related misdemeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\"><em> We </em>treat the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to vacate (heard one week after the motion to dismiss) as within the ambit of our review of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">We have also before us the transcript of the aborted trial in April, 1978 (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, last par.). However, the transcript was apparently not before the motion judge since it was not available until the following December. We therefore do not consider it in reviewing the action of the motion judge. <em>Thames </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 477, 478 n.2 (1974). In any event, the circumstances of the aborted trial were related in substance to the motion judge and are not in dispute. (The motions were heard on representations of counsel.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\"> This classic phraseology is also found in Massachusetts cases treating our common law and statutory double jeopardy rules. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholes, </em>13 Allen 554, 556 (1866). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Micheli, </em>258 Mass. 89, 91 (1927). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, </em>370 Mass. 288, 292 (1976).
