The defendant has filed numerous assignments of error under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, but since we decide that the judgments must be reversed and a new trial ordered, we shall discuss only those matters which are necessary to our decision or which are likely to arise at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">1. The errors which require reversal concern evidence introduced during the trial which showed that, although the defendant was not informed of the time of the robbery, he knew exactly when it had occurred. This evidence was damaging to the defendant and, indeed, in his closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the defendant\u2019s statement showing his knowledge of the time of the robbery as \"of pivotal importance in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">The problem with the evidence is. that it involved both a prosecutorial error of judgment and inadmissible hearsay. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion for production of his statements,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was allowed. Three days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>before trial the Commonwealth produced a number of statements, but did not include the statement referred to as \"of pivotal importance\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. The defense first learned of it when a State trooper, David Kenney, testified during the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief. Kenney testified that on the night of the defendant\u2019s arrest he had overheard the defendant say to his alleged partner<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the robbery, \"They can\u2019t get us for robbing that station, at that time we were next door. We watched Monday Night Football and before that we\u2019d watched Logan\u2019s Run on television.\u201d The defendant immediately objected, asked for a dismissal based on prosecutorial misconduct, then for a mistrial, and, finally, moved to strike the statement. After the prosecutor told the court that he had first learned of the statement approximately twenty to thirty minutes before Kenney took the stand, the judge ruled the statement admissible and denied all of the defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The prosecutor was at fault in not informing defense counsel of the statement prior to putting Kenney on the stand. He failed to comply with his duty of disclosure which continued \u201cduring\u201d as well as \u201cbefore trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>377 Mass. 887, 893 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s ruling demands reversal. However, we need not determine whether reversal on this ground alone is required. Here, the prosecutorial error was compounded by the introduction of inadmissible hearsay, which, when combined with the defendant\u2019s statement as to his whereabouts at the time of the robbery, was clearly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The hearsay evidence was introduced by the Commonwealth on redirect examination of Trooper Kenney. Earlier, following Kenney\u2019s testimony as to the defendant\u2019s statement concerning his whereabouts, the defense had sought, on cross-examination of this witness, to elicit testimony that although Kenney had not told the defendant the time of the robbery, he could have learned about the time from other sources. The defense established that three other State troopers had been with the defendant for between ten and thirty minutes prior to Kenney\u2019s arrival and that Kenney did not know whether any of these officers had told the defendant the time of the robbery. Defense counsel continued his questioning, and the trooper testified that he later became aware of what had transpired. Defense counsel asked no question as to what Trooper Kenney had subsequently learned. The relevant colloquy between defense counsel and Trooper Kenney is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>On redirect examination, over the defendant\u2019s objection and exception, the prosecutor was allowed to ask Trooper Kenney a series of questions relating to the conversations he had had with the other State troopers after they had left the defendant\u2019s apartment. More particularly, the prosecutor asked Trooper Kenney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">Q. \u201cAnd what did you ask them?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">A. \u201cI asked each officer who was present if they had mentioned any time to Mr. Howard or Mr. Patrickson<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> concerning when the robbery occurred, or anything that would indicate to Mr. Howard or Patrickson what time period we were interested in. They replied, \u2019No.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The answers given to Trooper Kenney by the other troopers, who did not testify at trial, could not be offered to prove the fact that they had not told the defendant the time of the robbery. \u201cThe broad rule on hearsay evidence interdicts the admission of a statement made out of court which is offered to prove the truth of what it asserted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>351 Mass. 489, 491 (1966), <em>S.C., </em>353 Mass. 684 (1968). The Commonwealth argues, however, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cataldo, </em>326 Mass. 373, 377 (1950), and 1 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 15 (3d ed. 1940), that the defendant opened up the question of Trooper Kenney\u2019s \u201cstate of awareness\u201d and, therefore, that the hearsay evidence was admissible \u201cto prevent the jury from being imposed on with a partial truth.\u201d We disagree. Unlike the situation in Cataldo,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant here did not himself introduce any hearsay evidence; he did not ask Trooper Kenney to recount the conversations he had had with the other officers. Thus, the impermissible type of evidence was not first introduced by the defendant. Moreover, the evidence was not needed to rehabilitate the witness or prevent the jury from being misled. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosey, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 138, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>142 (1977). The only purpose for which it could have been offered was to prove an irrelevant collateral matter which had no bearing on the defendant\u2019s guilt, namely Trooper Kenney\u2019s \"state of awareness\u201d after he left the defendant\u2019s apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pleasant, </em>366 Mass. 100, 103 (1974). See also <em>Mowry </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Allen 67, 68-69 (1864). However, the prosecutor did not use the evidence for this limited purpose. On the contrary, he used the evidence entirely for the impermissible purpose of showing the truth of the statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Permitting this testimony under the narrow state of awareness exception to the hearsay rule \"would in effect permit the introduction of such declarations to prove their truth\u201d and would \"allow the exception to swallow the rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>351 Mass. at 493. The evidence should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Nor do we accept the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant suffered no prejudice by the introduction of the hearsay. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument belies the Commonwealth\u2019s claim. See note 6. It is evident that the error was not harmless. (For discussions concerning the standard of harmless error, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>371 Mass. 803, 813 [1977]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 635 [1973]; and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>377 Mass. 503, 510-511 &amp; n.8 [1979].)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">2. We next turn to questions of identification which may recur on retrial. The defendant argues that the differences between the pictures of him and the other pictures in each of the two sets shown to the victim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>robbery were inherently impermissibly suggestive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the second set of pictures, which contains the most significant differences, is very similar to the array discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 398-401 (1979), and we consider the defendant\u2019s claim foreclosed as to both sets by that decision. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>369 Mass. 892, 894-895 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The defendant also alleges error in that the judge refused to sanitize the photographs in the first set, as requested by the defendant, by separating the double view pictures. The defendant claims that he wanted to introduce these pictures in evidence and that the judge\u2019s failure to order the photographs cut in half and put on separate exhibit sheets was error. This is not a situation where the prosecution is introducing the pictures and should \"sanitize\u201d double type pictures so as to avoid the suggestion that the defendant has a prior police record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>351 Mass. 37, 42-43, 45-46 (1966), <em>S.C., </em>354 Mass. 249, 258, 259, 261-262 (1968), cert, denied, 393 U.S. 1039 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gerald, </em>356 Mass. 386, 388 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 309 (1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fosher, </em>568 F.2d 207, 214 (1st Cir. 1978). Here, the defendant wanted to introduce the photos to the jury so they could decide whether the pictures were so suggestive as to cast doubt on the victim\u2019s subsequent identification of the defendant. It was for the judge to determine whether photographs presented to the jury in a form different from the array presented to the victim would have reflected the situation fairly and would have been of assistance to the jury. He might well have thought that a separation of the pictures, which would require placing two tan tapes<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the defendant\u2019s pictures, would not have truly represented the pictures shown to the victim. It was within his discretion to refuse to separate the photographs. See <em>Charles L. Hazelton &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Teel, </em>349 Mass. 617, 622 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-12\"> The motion asked the court to \"order the Commonwealth to permit the defendant to inspect and copy all statements, either written or transcribed, and reduce to writing any oral statements made by the defendant and provide the defendant with a copy of such writing, which statements ...
