Barkin from his position as Director of Milk Control. See G. L. c. 20, \u00a7 8. The central question is whether the procedural protections of G. L. c. 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u00a7 9A (the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act), and G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16, apply to the position of Director of Milk Control. We agree with the conclusion of the trial judge that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 20, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barkin was appointed Director of Milk Control by the commission on March 11, 1971, and the appointment was approved by the Governor on March 26* 1971, On April 22,1977, the commission notified Barkin by letter that it intended \u201cto reconsider an earlier ... decision to retain you\u201d and that it would conduct a hearing before taking a vote on reconsideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the hearing was completed, the commission voted unanimously on June 10,1977, to terminate Barkin as Director, effective June 17, and notified him by letter of its decision. On June 16,1977, the commission notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the State Board of Retirement (Retirement Board) of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Barkin subsequently requested a hearing before the Retirement Board. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2). After that hearing, the Retirement Board determined that \"no fair summary of the facts\u201d of Bar kin\u2019s termination had been filed with the board, \"as required by Section 16 of Chapter 32,\u201d and ordered that he be reinstated as director. The commission refused to reinstate Barkin, and sought judicial review of the board\u2019s decision by filing an action in the nature of certiorari. The case was heard together with two actions brought by Barkin against the commission \u2014 one under G. L. c. 231A seeking a determination that the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act applied to the position of Director of Milk Control, and the other in the nature of mandamus seeking enforcement of the Retirement Board\u2019s order that Barkin be reinstated. The parties agreed that, for the purposes of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Barkin was a veteran who held an office which was not classified under G. L. c. 31, not an elective office nor an appointive office for a fixed term, and not an office or position under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 7. The parties also agreed that, for the purposes of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Barkin was a member of Group 1 of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>retirement system and a veteran with at least ten years\u2019 creditable service.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">1. Section 9A of c. 30 \u2014 the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act \u2014 does not extend to every position not expressly exempted by the language of the section. See <em>Cieri </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>343 Mass. 181,185-187 (1961) (\u00a7 9A not applicable to the position of designee of Commissioner of Insurance to the Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liability Policies and Bonds under G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 8A); <em>Hanley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>355 Mass. 784 (1969) (\u00a7 9A not applicable to the position of Deputy Commissioner of Insurance under G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7); <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>375 Mass. 227, 231-233 &amp; n.9 (1978) (\u00a7 9A not applicable to the position of examiner in the Fraudulent Claims Board of the Division of Insurance under G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Barkin attempts to distinguish the <em>Cieri, Hanley </em>and <em>Dwyer </em>cases on the ground that the statutes which created the positions involved in those cases (G. L. c. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8A) gave the commissioner the specific power not only to appoint, but also to remove.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Barkin argues that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>because the statute which created his position is silent as to removal (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>he can only be removed according to the procedures specified by the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We disagree with such a narrow interpretation of the cases. The test for deciding whether a position is exempted from the sweep of the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act is not whether the statute creating the position contains express language regarding removal, but rather whether the statute suggests a legislative intention that the position be exempt. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Committee on Rules of the House of Representatives, </em>331 Mass. 135, 137-138 (1954). The Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act does not apply to positions \"given over to free administrative discretion by statute.\u201d <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra </em>at 231 n.8. We think the position of Director of Milk Control is clearly a position given over to such free administrative discretion. The Director of Milk Control is the highest full-time position within the Division of Milk Control. The Director is appointed by the Milk Control Commission, which consists of three members who serve staggered six-year terms. G. L. c. 20, \u00a7 7. The Director\u2019s duties are established by the commission. G. L. c. 20, \u00a7 8 (note 2, <em>supra). </em>The Director is required to enforce the orders, rules and regulations of the commission, to investigate complaints, and to initiate legal proceedings to enforce compliance with commission orders, rules and regulations. G. L. c. 94A, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 22. It is illogical that the Legislature could have intended the administratively awkward result that one could be appointed Director of Milk Control, could acquire tenure under the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act, could outlast any of the members of the commission which appointed him, and could then successfully resist the efforts of the commission to remove him at its pleasure. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Committee on Rules, </em>331 Mass. at 137. See also <em>Cieri </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>343 Mass. at 186. The power to remove a person from a position need not be explicit; it can be implied. <em>Adie </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>303 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>295, 300 (1939); <em>Furlong </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>305 Mass. 455, 456-457 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">2. As the position of Director of Milk Control is one from which the holder may be removed at pleasure, the Retirement Board had no authority under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), to order Barkin\u2019s reinstatement. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>343 Mass. 502, 508 (1962). See <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>343 Mass. 202, 206 (1961). At most, the only requirement was that the Retirement Board receive notice from the commission of Barkin\u2019s termination. That requirement was met by the commission\u2019s letter of June 16, 1977.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">3. Finally, Barkin argues that his termination was ineffective because no affirmative contemporaneous action was taken by the Governor after receiving a copy of the notice of termination from the commission. The trial judge made no explicit finding on this point, but an affidavit signed by the Governor was introduced at trial, apparently without objection, in which the Governor stated that he \"approved\u201d the termination. If the Governor\u2019s approval was required to render Barkin\u2019s termination effective (compare G. L. c. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8A, note 6, <em>supra), </em>a question which we do not decide, the evidence of his approval was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The judgments and the orders entered February 16, 1978, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\"> General Laws c. 20, \u00a7 8, as appearing in St. 1953, c. 604, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\"The commission, subject to the approval of the governor and council, shall appoint a director of the division of milk control, whose title shall be director of milk control, hereinafter referred to as the director.

Subject to appropriation, the commission may appoint such other employees as may be necessary in order to execute effectively the functions by sections seven to nine, inclusive, and by chapter ninety-four A, vested in the commission and the director, respectively. The commission may expend for the necessary traveling expenses of its members, director and employees, incurred in the performance of their official duties, and for salaries, services and other necessary expenses of the commission, such sums as may be appropriated therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\"> Among the matters cited by the commission as reasons for reconsidering its earlier decision to retain Barkin were (a) that Barkin had been convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts of failure to file income tax returns, and that his appeal from that conviction had been dismissed, and (b) that Barkin had been suspended from the practice of law by the Supreme Judicial Court. The commission also stated in the letter that, in its opinion, Barkin was \"not entitled to the protections provided by Civil Service laws,\u201d but that the commission had \"decided to be guided by the notice and hearing procedures therein prescribed as a matter of convenience.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\"> General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 9A, as appearing in St. 1947, c. 242, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\"A veteran, as defined in section twenty-one of chapter thirty-one, who holds an office or position in the service of the commonwealth not classified under said chapter thirty-one, other than an elective office, an appointive office for a fixed term or an office or position under section seven of this chapter, and has held such office or position for not less than three years, shall not be involuntarily separated from such office or position except subject to and in accordance with the provisions of sections forty-three and forty-five of said chapter thirty-one to the same extent as if said office or position were classified under said chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The amendment to the section effected by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 8, is not material here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), as amended through St. 1967, c. 826, \u00a7\u00a7 21-23, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">\"The removal or discharge of any member in service classified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Group 1, Group 2 or Group 4 who has attained age fifty-five and has completed fifteen or more years of creditable service, or any member so classified who has not attained age fifty-five but who has completed twenty or more years of creditable service, or any such member who is a veteran and has completed ten or more years of creditable service, shall not become effective unless and until a written notice thereof containing a fair summary of the facts upon which such action was based has been filed with the board....

That letter, dated July 29,1977, was delivered to the board after completion of the hearings and obviously was not considered by the board. No contention is made that the commission\u2019s stated reasons in its July letter were \"gross subterfuge.\u201d See the <em>Welch </em>case, 343 Mass. at 508.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
