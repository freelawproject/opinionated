J.</author>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Defendant appeals his conviction for murder, ORS 163.115. He raises 10 assignments of error, nine of which we reject without discussion. In his sixth assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a mistrial on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant had moved for a mistrial after the prosecutor asked one of the investigating officers, on redirect examination, whether defendant had requested measurements of the damage that defendant\u2019s vehicle caused to the wall of a garage. The officer replied that the defendant had not requested any measurements. Defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s question impermissibly shifted to defendant the burden of presenting evidence of his own innocence and, thus, the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The facts pertinent to defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial are few, and, because defendant was convicted by a jury, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>342 Or 596, 598, 157 P3d 198 (2007), <em>cert den, </em>552 US 1113, 128 S Ct 906, 169 L Ed 2d 753 (2008); <em>State v. Worth, </em>231 Or App 69, 218 P3d 166 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 718 (2010). On May 7, 2007, defendant drove with his passenger, Ontiveros, to defendant\u2019s former residence where his wife, the victim, was living. Defendant and the victim were estranged. The victim had filed an action for dissolution of their marriage, and defendant had moved out of the residence. Defendant stopped his Lincoln Navigator SUV alongside the curb of the residence for approximately four to five seconds. The victim was gardening in the front yard of the residence. Defendant could observe her from his vantage point. The garage door of the residence was open, and defendant could see a red Corvette sports car, which belonged to the victim, in the garage. Defendant leaned over to Ontiveros, tapped him on the knee, and said, \u2018Watch this.\u201d Defendant pressed on the accelerator of the Navigator, causing the vehicle to speed forward, striking the victim and carrying her into the garage, where the Navigator struck the Corvette and the rear wall of the garage. The force of the impact killed the victim and knocked the garage off its foundation, partially collapsing the roof. Responding officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>found the victim pinned beneath the Navigator. The officers found defendant lying uninjured alongside the Navigator, repeatedly saying, \u201cI want to die.\u201d Ontiveros, who was standing in the driveway, told the first officer who contacted him that \u201cshe\u2019s in there. He ran her over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Defendant was charged with a single count of murder under ORS 163.115.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, defendant argued that the police had conducted an inadequate investigation because they had jumped to the conclusion that he had intentionally murdered the victim. Because of that inadequate investigation, defendant argued, the police had failed to gather certain exculpatory physical evidence. That contention dovetailed with defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance (\u201cEED\u201d) under ORS 163.135.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In part, defendant\u2019s EED theory was that, when he arrived at the residence and saw the red Corvette inside the garage, he had become enraged and decided to kill himself by crashing the Navigator into the Corvette. Defendant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that the victim had been bent over behind a Japanese maple tree in the front yard of the residence and, because the Navigator was not high enough above the ground for defendant to see over the tree, defendant had not seen the victim before pressing the Navigator\u2019s accelerator.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Detective Burdick of the Milwaukie Police Department was one of several investigating officers on the scene on the morning of the crime. Burdick testified about the portions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the investigation that he had conducted, as well as his knowledge of what other investigators had done at the scene. During cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel pressed Burdick about the damage to the garage that defendant\u2019s vehicle caused.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I will show you Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 185, a photograph of one of the walls that was damaged when a vehicle went through the garage; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201c[Burdick]: Right. That looks to be the garage wall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That was pushed out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201c[Burdick]: That was pushed out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Off the foundation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201c[Burdick]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And that\u2019s an accurate photograph, I believe somebody from your office took it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201c[Burdick]: I believe so. I don\u2019t remember from that angle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Now I\u2019m going to show you what\u2019s been marked Defendant\u2019s exhibits 186 and 187. Does that also show you the garage, entry portion of the garage, where the Navigator would have entered in the garage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u201c[Burdick]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Let\u2019s look at 186 and 187. The Navigator has struck the entryway to the garage door, didn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-16\">\u201c[Burdick]: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-17\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And that entryway damage is not noted on any photograph that you produced, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-18\">\u201c[Burdick]: Will you repeat that one more time please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-19\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s the closest photographs we have of that entry way damage isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-20\">\u201c[Burdick]: I\u2019m not sure offhand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The total station, State\u2019s Exhibit 3 that I put up now, doesn\u2019t mark the damage on that wall does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">\u201c[Burdick]: I don\u2019t believe it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: There are no measurements whatever that say how high up on the wall it was damaged, are there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201c[Burdick]: I think you\u2019d probably have to speak to the CRAFT folks that measured that scene. I\u2019m having trouble testifying to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: But you didn\u2019t measure, locate diagram, do anything with the damaged entryway area, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201c[Burdick]: Again, sir, I\u2019m going to have to defer to the CRAFT team. I wasn\u2019t part of that aspect of the investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: You spent four different trips driving from [defendant\u2019s apartment] to [the residence]. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">\u201c[Burdick]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And on each one of those trips, you ended up at that garage. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">\u201c[Burdick]: I pulled into the driveway by the front path. I don\u2019t think \u2014 I think I stopped probably 15 feet shy of the garage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: On each of those trips, you could have gotten out of your vehicle and measured how high up on that wall the vehicle struck, couldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">\u201c[Burdick]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And yet on none of the trips have you documented the damage that was done to the wall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-17\">[Burdick]: No sir:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>On redirect examination the prosecutor asked Burdick.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Detective Burdick, [defense counsel] was asking you about damage to the garage wall of the [victim\u2019s] home, I think one of the sides of the garage wall. Do you see where I\u2019m talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201c[Burdick]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: And he asked you if anybody had measured kind of the height that the damage was or taken measurement of that damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201c[Burdick]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Did anybody, either the state or the defense, ever ask you to take those measurements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">\u201c[Burdick]: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">After the last exchange, defendant immediately moved for a mistrial, arguing that \u201cthe only burden we have concerns the extreme emotional disturbance that we have filed. We hold no burden to gather evidence or to directing evidence. I believe that such is a direct comment, an attempt to shift the burden of proof to the defendant.\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">\u201c[The Court]: In this case, the defense is raising a defense of diminished capacity \u2014 bear with me just a moment. You also have a defense of extreme emotional disturbance. And the defense, by its cross-examination of Detective Burdick, has suggested by its questions that exculpatory evidence may exist in this case but for the inadequacies of the state\u2019s investigation, that evidence would be available for the defense to present at this trial. The question is whether it is appropriate rebuttal for the State to bring out evidence that suggests to the jury that the defendant, through his attorney, also had the means to gather exculpatory evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">\u201cGiven that the defense has that burden in this case and given that by its questions of this [witness] it has suggested that there would be evidence available that is otherwise not available due to the inadequacies of the state\u2019s investigation, this court considers it to be appropriate rebuttal for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the State to bring out evidence that suggests to the jury that the defendant, through his attorney, also had the means to gather exculpatory evidence. That is my ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Defendant was convicted by the jury. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Larson, </em>325 Or 15, 22, 933 P2d 958 (1997). \u201cThe trial judge is in the best position to assess the impact of the complained-of incident and to select the means (if any) necessary to correct any problem resulting from it.\u201d <em>State v. Wright, </em>323 Or 8, 12, 913 P2d 321 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Defendant renews his argument on appeal, arguing that, during the redirect examination of Burdick, \u201c[t]he prosecutor was essentially saying that defendant had the burden of establishing his innocence, that he has failed to meet that burden, and that he should be convicted of murder because he failed to do so.\u201d We disagree. <em>State v. Lincoln, </em>250 Or 426, 443 P2d 178 (1968), is instructive. In <em>Lincoln, </em>the defendant had been charged with the burglary of a gas station and was apprehended at the scene by several police officers. <em>Id. </em>at 427. At trial, the state did not call as witnesses all of the officers at the scene when the defendant was apprehended, and the defendant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that that omission demonstrated that \u201cthe state had not disclosed all of the information it possessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district attorney argued, in rebuttal, that the defendant knew that he could have called the officers as witnesses. Defendant moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that \u201c[t]here is no rule which prevents the state from commenting on [a] defendant\u2019s failure to call witnesses other than the defendant which were available to him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We relied on <em>Lincoln </em>in <em>State v. Galloway, </em>202 Or App 613, 123 P3d 352 (2005), <em>vac\u2019d on other grounds, </em>345 Or 315 (2008). In <em>Galloway, </em>the defendant moved for a mistrial after the prosecutor told the jury in closing argument, \u201c \u2018[I]n this trial you folks haven\u2019t heard a single thing about alibi.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620. The trial court denied the motion, and we affirmed. Relying on <em>Lincoln, </em>we concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s argument to the jurors in the present case that they had heard no testimony regarding alibi was not a comment on defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>rather to alert the jury that the defense had not put on <em>any </em>evidence regarding an alibi.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Although <em>Lincoln </em>involved a prosecutor\u2019s comment on a defendant\u2019s ability to call witnesses, its reasoning applies equally to the issue in this case, that is, defendant\u2019s ability to procure the measurements of the damage to the garage wall that was caused by his vehicle. The prosecutor\u2019s question to Burdick on redirect examination served the same purpose as the district attorney\u2019s jury argument <em>iaLincoln: </em>it alerted the jury to the fact that defendant could have procured the evidence that defendant had faulted the police for not gathering. The prosecutor was entitled to rebut defendant\u2019s implication that the state had failed to gather potentially exculpatory evidence because the investigating officers had jumped to the conclusion that defendant had intentionally murdered the victim. The prosecutor\u2019s narrow question to Burdick directly rebutted that implication. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> ORS 163.115 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201c(1) Except as provided in ORS 163.118 and 163.125, criminal homicide constitutes murder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201c(a) When it is committed intentionally, except that it is an affirmative defense that, at the time of the homicide, the defendant was under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\"> ORS 163.135 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201c(1) It is an affirmative defense to murder for purposes of ORS 163.115(l)(a) that the homicide was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance if the disturbance is not the result of the person\u2019s own intentional, knowing, reckless or criminally negligent act and if there is a reasonable explanation for the disturbance. The reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance must be determined from the standpoint of an ordinary person in the actor\u2019s situation under the circumstances that the actor reasonably believed them to be. Extreme emotional disturbance does not constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
