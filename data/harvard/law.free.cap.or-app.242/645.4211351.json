ORS 164.057. The state appeals from a pretrial order suppressing defendant\u2019s self-incriminating statements and the physical evidence obtained as a result of those statements. <em>See </em>ORS 138.060(l)(c) (allowing state appeal from an \u201corder made prior to trial suppressing evidence\u201d). Defendant made two confessions, first to private investigators and then to the police, in the course of successive interviews. The issue on appeal is whether those confessions can be given in evidence in light of ORS 136.425(1), which provides for exclusion of confessions or admissions of a defendant where \u201cmade under the influence of fear produced by threats.\u201d The state contends that defendant\u2019s initial confession to private investigators should not have been suppressed under ORS 136.425(1) because the statute applies only to governmental officials and not private investigators. The state further argues that, even if the first confession is inadmissible, defendant\u2019s subsequent confession to police was sufficiently attenuated from the first confession and, accordingly, it should not have been suppressed. We conclude that the trial court properly suppressed the first confession, but that the second confession should have been admitted into evidence. Thus, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings of fact where there is evidence in the record to support them, but we assess anew whether those findings and the record on review establish that defendant\u2019s statements were involuntary under the statute. <em>State v. Foster, </em>303 Or 518, 529, 739 P2d 1032 (1987); <em>State v. Aguilar, </em>133 Or App 304, 307, 891 P2d 668 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">We state the facts consistently with those standards of review. Defendant was employed as a courier for FedEx. A large number of packages were missing from defendant\u2019s worksite, and the company initiated an investigation. As part of that inquiry, two FedEx investigators, Ladd and Lewis, interviewed defendant in a conference room at the FedEx offices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The interview lasted 30 minutes. Ladd questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>defendant for the first half of the interview. During that time, defendant denied any knowledge of or involvement in the disappearance of the packages. Lewis then intervened, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">\u201cIt\u2019s apparent that you took this stuff, so now we\u2019re at a crossroads, okay? * * * We\u2019re <em>at a point where either we handle it in-house here, in FedEx, or we can turn everything we have over to the [police department], and then they handle it from there. </em>Now if you choose that route, there\u2019s nothing you can do. They\u2019ll be going to get search warrants for your house, for your mother\u2019s house. They\u2019ll go through all of your stuff. It\u2019s just gonna be a big mess, okay? * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">\u201cAt this point, our base concern here at FedEx is we want to know, we need to make a customer happy. And if we can make the customer happy, then they don\u2019t come back on [defendant], okay? And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad guy, okay? <em>If I had thought you were a bad guy I would\u2019ve taken all this stuff and we would\u2019ve given it to the [police department] and said, You gotta jack him up, we\u2019re done with him,\u2019 okay ? I don\u2019t feel that way. </em>You\u2019ve got a lot of stuff going on in your life right now, and I know it. People do boneheaded things, okay? But <em>where we go now is what\u2019s going to decide your future. </em>* * * <em>Nobody but who\u2019s in this room needs to know.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">(Emphases added.) Defendant then made inculpatory statements and agreed to take the investigators to his house to recover some of the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On the way to his house, defendant expressed second thoughts about proceeding. Nonetheless, one of the investigators reassured defendant, stating, \u201cYour continued cooperation with us is appreciated. This is going to make sure that we keep the D.A. out of this.\u201d Defendant allowed the investigation to continue. After stolen property was recovered from his house, the investigators informed defendant that he needed to return to the office to provide a written statement and that he would then be free to leave. At the office, defendant wrote a statement with assistance from Ladd and Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">According to defendant\u2019s testimony, Ladd then said, \u201cListen, I need you to give a statement to the police. We just need a third party to kind of document what\u2019s been said here, what\u2019s going on. * * * It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re being arrested.\u201d A City of Corvallis uniformed police officer, Officer Glock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>entered the conference room. Ladd remained in the room during police questioning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Glock indicated that she knew what was going on and was aware that Ladd and Lewis had recovered property from defendant\u2019s house. Glock advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, telling him that they were just \u201ca matter of housekeeping, * * * just a formality.\u201d When she asked defendant if he knew why the police were present, defendant answered, \u201cProbably to arrest me.\u201d When asked why he made that statement, defendant explained that he \u201cwanted to see if [the officer] said * * * that basically the deal was off with the FedEx representatives, or see if she basically confirmed what they were saying, that \u2018no, I\u2019m not necessarily going to arrest you. I\u2019m just here to get a * * * third party statement documentation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Glock responded to defendant\u2019s supposition of impending arrest, \u201cNot necessarily. * * * That could be a possibility but it\u2019s ultimately up to your company how they want to handle this.\u201d Ladd nodded along with the officer\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Defendant subsequently repeated his inculpatory statements to Glock, and she sought consent to search defendant\u2019s house. Defendant told Glock that all of the stolen property had been recovered and did not immediately consent to a search. However, a second officer joined the interview and told defendant that, if he consented, the police could ensure that defendant\u2019s wife and children would be away from the house at the time of the search. According to defendant, the officer stated, \u201cIf not, I have more than enough evidence from what\u2019s recovered in the other room there that we\u2019ll just go ahead and take you down to the jail, hold you there, we\u2019ll get a warrant, and then we\u2019ll show up over there with six or eight marked cars, have your family sit on the front lawn in front of all the neighbors while we search the house.\u201d Defendant then consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The trial court suppressed all of defendant\u2019s incul-patory statements and the property recovered from his residence. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">\u201cThe question before the Court is whether or not defendant\u2019s confession was, voluntary or in violation of statutory or constitutional protections. Based on the totality of the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, the court finds that defendant did not make a voluntary confession. The express and implied promises of immunity from criminal prosecution given to the defendant by the Fed Ex investigators render [ ] his statements to them involuntar [y]. Because there was not a sufficient break in time or location between the Fed Ex investigation interviews and the interview by law enforcement investigators, statements made by defendant in response to subsequent interrogation and evidence seized after his involuntary confessions must also be suppressed. Unsolicited statements by the defendant are admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">On appeal, the parties agree that there is no constitutional basis for excluding defendant\u2019s first confession, inasmuch as there was no state action to procure it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state contends that the trial court incorrectly excluded defendant\u2019s statement to the FedEx investigators as an involuntary confession under ORS 136.425(1). As noted, that statute provides that a confession or admission \u201ccannot be given in evidence against the defendant when it was made under the influence of fear produced by threats.\u201d According to the state: (1) ORS 136.425(1) does not apply to confessions induced by promises of leniency but instead operates to exclude only confessions induced by threats; (2) the statute does not apply to confessions elicited by private persons; and (3) ORS 136.432, an antisuppression statute, bars the exclusion of evidence based on a statutory violation. We conclude that defendant\u2019s initial confession was properly suppressed under ORS 136.425(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The state\u2019s contentions about the scope of ORS 136.425(1) present questions of statutory construction. In construing a statute, we examine the text of the statute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>context, along with any relevant legislative history, to discern the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). ORS 136.425(1) (2007)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">\u201cA confession or admission of a defendant, whether in the course of judicial proceedings or otherwise, cannot be given in evidence against the defendant when it was made under the influence of fear produced by threats; nor is a confession only sufficient to warrant the conviction of the defendant without some other proof that the crime has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The first part of that provision, by its terms, applies only to confessions or admissions \u201cmade under the influence of fear produced by threats.\u201d The statute makes no mention of confessions induced by promises of leniency. Nonetheless, the state\u2019s contention that ORS 136.425(1) applies only to confessions induced by threats and not those spurred by promises of leniency has been rejected in numerous cases, beginning with <em>State v. Wintzingerode, </em>9 Or 153, 1881 WL 1363 (1881). In that case, the court held that, although the original predecessor to ORS 136.425(1) purported to extend only to confessions induced by threats, the statute was not intended to abrogate the common-law rule that applied also to confessions induced by promises of leniency. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62. Subsequent cases have reaffirmed that principle by stating that the statute incorporates the common-law rules on involuntary confessions. <em>See, e.g., Foster, </em>303 Or at 525 (ORS 136.425(1), an expression of the common-law rules, prohibits statements made under the influence of threats or promises); <em>State v. Smith, </em>301 Or 681, 690-93, 725 P2d 894 (1986) (explaining that \u201c[w]e know of no case that interprets or applies ORS 136.425 independently of the common-law rules on confessions and admissions\u201d and holding that the statute excludes confessions induced by threats or promises); <em>State v. Ely, </em>237 Or 329, 332, 390 P2d 348 (1964) (under <em>former </em>ORS 136.540 (1957), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 136.425 (1973/74), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>state must show that a defendant\u2019s statement is made \u201cwithout the inducement of either fear or hope\u201d); <em>State v. Morris, </em>83 Or 429, 439, 163 P 567 (1917) (citing an earlier codification <em>of </em>ORS 136.425(1) <em>for </em>the proposition that a confession, to be deemed voluntary and admissible, cannot be \u201cinduced by hope or fear\u201d); <em>State v. Moran, </em>15 Or 262, 265, 14 P 419 (1887) (explaining that \u201c[i]t must be taken as settled in this State that [an earlier codification of ORS 136.425(1)] is only declaratory of the common-law rule\u201d that a court must determine whether a \u201cconfession has been obtained by the influence of hope or fear applied by a third person to the prisoner\u2019s mind\u201d); <em>Aguilar, </em>133 Or App at 308 (confessions induced by promises of immunity \u201cwere involuntary as a matter of law\u201d under both Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution and ORS 136.425(1)). Consistently with those cases, we conclude that ORS 136.425(1) operates to exclude confessions induced by promises of leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The state\u2019s second contention \u2014 that ORS 136.425(1) operates to exclude only confessions made to police or government officials and not those made to private persons \u2014 raises a more difficult question. On its face, the statute applies to any \u201cconfession or admission of a defendant\u201d without regard to whether the statement is given to a private or a public actor. That, however, does not end the inquiry. We construe the statute\u2019s meaning in light of its pertinent legislative history. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72. The state argues that, prior to 1957, the statute explicitly applied to statements made \u201cin the course of judicial proceedings, or <em>to a private person\u201d </em>General Laws of Oregon, Crim Code, ch XXII, \u00a7 214, p 478 (Deady 1845-1864) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>subsequent codifications. In 1957, the Legislative Assembly amended the statute to apply to incriminating statements made \u201cin the course of judicial proceedings <em>or otherwise\u201d See </em>Or Laws 1957, ch 567, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). The state contends that the removal of the phrase \u201cor to a private person\u201d and the substitution of \u201cor otherwise\u201d suggests a legislative intent to narrow the scope of the statute to apply only to confessions or admissions made to public officials, and not private persons. According to the state, ORS 136.425(1) should be construed consistently with that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>When construing a statute, we give words of common usage their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). \u201cOtherwise\u201d is a word of common usage. <em>State v. Snyder, </em>337 Or 410, 424, 97 P3d 1181 (2004). \u201cOtherwise\u201d is variously defined as \u201cin a different way or manner,\u201d \u201cin different circumstances : under other conditions,\u201d \u201cin other respects,\u201d or simply \u201cNOT.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1598 (unabridged ed 2002). As used in the statute, then, \u201cotherwise\u201d indicates that an involuntary confession may be excluded whether it is made in the course of judicial proceedings or in different circumstances. Stated differently, the statute excludes involuntary confessions whether made during judicial proceedings or not. Thus, the terms of the statute are broadly inclusive. According to its plain meaning, the statute proscribes involuntary confessions of all kinds, without regard to when or to whom a confession was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Further contextual guidance can be found in the \u201ccorroboration\u201d clause of the statute. <em>See </em>ORS 136.425(1) (\u201c[N]or is a confession only sufficient to warrant the conviction of the defendant without some other proof that the crime has been committed.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That provision, which requires corroboration of a confession as a predicate to conviction, draws no explicit distinction among the types of confessions to which it applies. Moreover, it has been applied to private confessions subsequent to the 1957 amendments. <em>See, e.g., State v. Kelley, </em>239 Or App 266, 243 P3d 1195 (2010) (holding that confessions made by the defendant to a friend and during a group therapy session were uncorroborated and thus were insufficient to warrant conviction). Presumably, both the vol-untariness requirement and the corroboration requirement in ORS 136.425(1) operate consistently with each other; that is, in the absence of a contrary indication, a natural reading of the statute suggests that either both provisions apply to private confessions or both do not. <em>See Pete\u2019s Mountain </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number><em>Homeowners v. Ore. Water Resources, </em>236 Or App 507, 518, 238 P3d 395 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 131 (2011) (\u201cIt is a longstanding principle of statutory construction that words may be assumed to be used consistently throughout a statute.\u201d); <em>see also Dept. of Human Services v. H. R., </em>241 Or App 370, 377, 250 P3d 427 (2011) (favoring internally consistent construction of statute). Thus, because the corroboration provision applies to confessions made to private persons, we infer that the voluntariness provision similarly applies to confessions made to private persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">This inference is not undercut by the legislative history of ORS 136.425(1). The removal of the specific reference to \u201ca private person\u201d in 1957 could suggest an intent to abolish the statute\u2019s application to private confessions. <em>See Belinskey v. Clooten, </em>237 Or App 106, 111, 239 P3d 251 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 601 (2011) (noting that wording changes are relevant context for purposes of statutory construction and that \u201cnew language in a statute ordinarily signals a change in the statute\u2019s meaning\u201d). If that were the only change in text, that argument would be more credible. But the legislature made a companion change \u2014 that the statute applies to confessions made \u201cotherwise\u201d than in a judicial proceeding. That change signaled an intent to <em>broaden </em>the scope of the statute. The combination of both changes could give rise to a conclusion that the legislature intended to clarify that the statute applies not only to \u201cjudicial\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d confessions, but to any confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We also observe that the legislature, in its 1957 amendments, created subsection (2) of <em>former </em>ORS 136.540, <em>renumbered </em>ORS 136.425(2) (1973/74).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Or Laws 1957, ch 567, \u00a7 1. That provision prohibits the admission of certain evidence of a defendant\u2019s conduct while \u201cin the custody of a peace officer.\u201d If the legislature had intended subsection (1) to have the meaning advanced by the state \u2014 that is, if it intended to limit the ambit of ORS 136.425(1) to confessions made to public officials \u2014 it could have employed similarly precise language in that section as it did in subsection (2), instead of making the much broader reference to confessions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\u201cotherwise\u201d obtained. <em>See, e.g., Dept. of Transportation v. Stallcup, </em>341 Or 93, 101, 138 P3d 9 (2006) (rejecting a construction that \u201cwould ignore the legislature\u2019s use of a different term within the same statute\u201d); <em>Lane County v. LCDC, </em>325 Or 569, 578, 942 P2d 278 (1997) (explaining that \u201cwe do not look at one subsection of a statute in a vacuum\u201d); <em>State v. Keeney, </em>323 Or 309, 316, 918 P2d 419 (1996) (noting that each term in a statute is assumed to have a distinct meaning).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The legislative history does not shed light on why the reference to \u201ca private person\u201d was dropped from the statute. <em>See Foster, </em>303 Or at 525 (so stating). However, as noted, the voluntariness provision in ORS 136.425(1) was placed with a companion provision requiring corroboration of \u201ca confession\u201d without regard to whether it was a private confession. Moreover, that subsection is juxtaposed with another allied subsection, adopted at the same time, which narrowly and explicitly applies only to revelatory conduct of a defendant while \u201cin the custody of a peace officer.\u201d In light of that context and the broad wording of ORS 136.425(1), we conclude that the legislature intended the statute to apply, as it had before, to confessions made to private persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">That construction of ORS 136.425(1) is consistent with cases applying the statute subsequent to the 1957 amendments. Those cases suggest, albeit somewhat opaquely, that the statute applies in circumstances where an involuntary confession is elicited by private persons. <em>See Ely, </em>237 Or at 331-35. In <em>Ely, </em>the defendant, a schoolteacher, was accused of sexually molesting one of his students. The defendant made a self-incriminating statement to school officials and the victim\u2019s parent after they promised not to prosecute the defendant, although they warned the defendant that his statement could be used against him. The state argued \u201cthat since the confession was made when the defendant was not in custody, and was made to private citizens, there is no question about its admissibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. The court rejected that argument, explaining that \u201c[a] correct interpretation of our own cases * * * would require the exclusion of an involuntary confession, whether made to law enforcement officers or to other persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The court in <em>Ely </em>did not elucidate the legal basis for that proposition,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but it apparently relied upon <em>State v. Green, </em>128 Or 49, 61-62, 273 P 381 (1929), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Brewton, </em>238 Or 590, 395 P2d 874 (1964). <em>Green, </em>in turn, cited a common-law rule prohibiting the use of involuntary confessions induced by \u201cpersons not in authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although it is difficult to discern <em>Green\u2019s </em>significance to ORS 136.425(1), the court in <em>Ely </em>seemed to recognize the ongoing viability of the rule in <em>Green </em>notwithstanding the existence of the statute. Thus, whatever the source for that rule, the <em>Ely </em>court did not view the amendments to <em>former </em>ORS 136.540 to be inconsistent with or to otherwise preclude application of a rule proscribing evidence of involuntary private confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The Supreme Court discussed that issue again in <em>Foster, </em>303 Or at 524-29. In that case, the defendant confessed to his involvement in a murder after police made references to community threats, <em>i.e., </em>threats made by private persons, during the course of interrogating the defendant. The court declared that, although the legislative history of ORS 136.425(1) did not reveal why the reference to \u201ca private person\u201d was removed from the text, the statute was nonetheless an expression of the common-law rule against coerced confessions. <em>Id. </em>at 525. Consequently, it noted that the statute would prohibit the admission in evidence of an out of court confession induced \u201cby anyone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The case, however, involved a confession to the police that was induced by private persons. Thus, <em>Foster </em>did not construe the statute to prohibit involuntary confessions made to private persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><em>Foster </em>does hint that such a construction would be apt. The court contrasted the statutory rule on involuntary confessions with that of Article I, section 12, which \u201chas no application to the action of private individuals who are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>employed by or acting under the orders or directions of, or in concert with,\u201d a governmental officer or agent. <em>Id. See also State v. Jancsek, </em>302 Or 270, 284 n 7, 730 P2d 14 (1986) (noting that the constitutional provision, which applies only against governmental action, \u201cis in contrast to the common-law rule against coerced confessions, which was codified among the earliest Oregon laws\u201d and which \u201ccurrently appears, in substantially the same language, at ORS 136.425(1)\u201d). Thus, those cases intimate that the statute does apply to confessions elicited by and communicated to private persons. For all of the above reasons, we reject the state\u2019s argument that ORS 136.425(1) does not bar involuntary confessions induced by private persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The state advances no argument that defendant\u2019s statements were not induced by the FedEx investigators\u2019 promises or that defendant could not have reasonably relied on the promises not to prosecute. <em>See Ely, </em>237 Or at 334-35 (the defendant reasonably could have believed that his confession would be used against him only in matters of employment); <em>Aguilar, </em>133 Or App at 308 (a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances would have believed that the officer was offering immunity). We conclude that defendant, in making his initial confession, reasonably could have believed the FedEx investigators\u2019 promises not to prosecute him. Moreover, the evidence supports a finding that his initial confession was induced by those promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The state nonetheless contends that defendant\u2019s initial confession should not be suppressed because ORS 136.432 precludes suppression of evidence based upon a statutory violation. ORS 136.432 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">\u201cA court may not exclude relevant and otherwise admissible evidence in a criminal action on the grounds that it was obtained in violation of any statutory provision unless exclusion of the evidence is required by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">\u201c(1) The United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">\u201c(2) The rules of evidence governing privileges and the admission of hearsay; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">\u201c(3) The rights of the press.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>We have previously held that ORS 136.432 was not intended to supersede statutes containing an internal exclusionary directive. <em>State v. Thompson-Seed, </em>162 Or App 483, 491, 986 P2d 732 (1999). In <em>Thompson-Seed, </em>we stated that \u201cORS 136.432 is construed only to constrain the courts from creating new rules of exclusion and not to repeal existing statutory rules of exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, ORS 136.425(1) contains an explicit directive that involuntary confessions \u201ccannot be given in evidence against the defendant.\u201d That is a preexisting statutory rule of exclusion. Therefore, a violation of ORS 136.425(1) is grounds for excluding a confession, notwithstanding ORS 136.432. <em>See State v. Hoehne, </em>163 Or App 402, 407 n 5, 989 P2d 469 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 252 (2000) (\u201cORS 136.432 does not repeal preexisting statutory rules of exclusion, such as ORS 136.425(1).\u201d). Consequently, the trial court properly suppressed defendant\u2019s initial confession to the FedEx investigators under ORS 136.425(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Although defendant\u2019s initial confession was properly suppressed, it does not necessarily follow that the physical evidence obtained as a result of that confession should have been suppressed as well. Indeed, ORS 136.425(1), on its face, makes no mention of derivative evidence or the physical \u201cfruits\u201d of an involuntary confession. However, the state makes no argument specifically challenging the trial court\u2019s exclusion of that physical evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the state\u2019s argument concerning that evidence is apparently wholly contingent upon obtaining a reversal of the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the confessions. Thus, because we uphold the suppression of defendant\u2019s first confession, we do not disturb that portion of the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the physical evidence obtained as a result of that confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Next, the state contends that the trial court erroneously suppressed defendant\u2019s subsequent confession to police under an \u201cexploitation of illegality\u201d or \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d theory. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 US 471, 484-88, 491-92, 83 S Ct 407, 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963) (applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>\u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine under the federal exclusionary rule to evidence obtained following violations of the United States Constitution); <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 21-36, 115 P3d 908 (2005) (applying similar \u201cexploitation analysis\u201d under the Oregon exclusionary rule to evidence obtained after violations of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution); <em>cf. State v. Vondehn, </em>348 Or 462, 475-76, 236 P3d 691 (2010) (applying a \u201cderives from\u201d test to evidence obtained after violations of Article I, section 12). The state argues that defendant\u2019s second confession was not the product of unlawful police conduct and that an exploitation analysis is inapplicable where the source of the preceding \u201cillegality\u201d is instead private conduct. Regardless, the state argues that there was sufficient temporal separation and other intervening circumstances \u2014 including the administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u2014 to attenuate the taint of any prior illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Defendant responds that, \u201c[s]ince 1881, Oregon courts have applied a fruit-of-illegality analysis and an ongoing-coercion test to the question of when subsequent confessions or admissions must be excluded because of a prior involuntary confession.\u201d (Citing <em>Wintzingerode, </em>9 Or at 164-65.) Defendant argues that, here, the police officer engaged in subterfuge by downplaying the import of her questioning, in essence perpetuating (and therefore exploiting) the earlier promises of leniency made by the FedEx investigators. Further, defendant argues that the circumstances had not significantly changed between the first and second confessions: the confessions took place in the same location and within a short time of each other; one of the investigators provided reassurances immediately before police questioning; the investigator remained in the room during the police questioning; the police officer minimized the significance of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings; and the officer effectively entrenched the promises of immunity by stating that it was \u201cultimately up to [defendant\u2019s] company how they want to handle this.\u201d In any event, defendant contends that his confession to police was involuntary \u201cin and of [itself]\u201d under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The trial court\u2019s order does not explicitly identify the legal basis for its decision to exclude the second confession. However, it does say that \u201cthere was not a sufficient break in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>time or location\u201d between the initial interview by FedEx investigators and the subsequent interview by police. Moreover, the arguments at the suppression hearing were primarily focused on a \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d analysis. Thus, it seems likely that the court excluded the second confession because it was procured by exploitation of an earlier confession that was inadmissible under ORS 136.425(1). We conclude that that was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"> \u201cExploitation occurs when police take advantage of their unlawful conduct, for example by using information that the conduct produced, or by trading on information unlawfully obtained in order to leverage consent, waiver, or some concession from the accused.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. O\u2019Farrell, </em>191 Or App 627, 632, 83 P3d 931 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005) (citation omitted). Exclusion of evidence based on an exploitation analysis, however formulated, is required as a means of enforcing a person\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 24 (explaining that the \u201cOregon exclusionary rule is a constitutionally mandated rule that serves to vindicate a defendant\u2019s personal rights\u201d and, as such, extends to evidence obtained as a result of violations of Article I, section 9); <em>see also Vondehn, </em>348 Or at 475-76 (explaining exclusionary rule under Article I, section 12). The purpose of the exclusionary rule \u201cis to restore a defendant to the same position as if \u2018the government\u2019s officers had stayed within the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 24 (citation omitted). That court-created exploitation rule applies to evidence obtained as a result of unlawful governmental action.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Here, there was no predicate violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Nor was there any predicate unlawful conduct by the police or, for that matter, anyone. Defendant\u2019s initial confession was suppressed under ORS 136.425(1). That statute does not make a private threat or promise of leniency unlawful. It merely excludes from evidence confessions obtained \u201cunder the influence of fear produced by threats\u201d or hopes induced by promises of leniency. We know of no case where a judicially created exploitation analysis has been applied to evidence obtained as a result of private conduct, much less private conduct that is not unlawful itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Instead, the question is whether ORS 136.425(1) itself requires exclusion of the second confession because that confession was made \u201cunder the influence of [the same] fear\u201d or hope that induced the first confession. As noted, the text of ORS 136.425(1) says nothing about derivative evidence or subsequent confessions obtained under the lingering effects of an earlier involuntary confession. Nonetheless, defendant cites <em>Wintzingerode, </em>9 Or at 164-65, for the proposition that, where a confession is obtained through improper means, subsequent confessions are presumed also to be involuntary and excluded absent a showing that the circumstances had changed and the motives for the original confession had ceased to operate. In <em>Wintzingerode, </em>the Supreme Court recited the common-law rule that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">\u201calthough an original confession may have been obtained by improper means, yet subsequent confessions of the same or of like facts, may be admitted, if the court believes that from the length of time intervening, or from proper warning of the consequences of confession, or from other circumstances, that the delusive hopes or fears, under the influence of which the original confession was obtained, were entirely dispelled. * * * [I]n the absence of any such circumstances, the influence of the motives proved to have been offered, will be presumed to continue and to have produced the confession, unless the contrary is shown by clear evidence, and the confession will therefore be rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">9 Or at 164-65 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (holding that successive confessions made by the defendant were inadmissible). The <em>Wintzingerode </em>rule on successive confessions was last relied on in 1958, <em>see State v. Nunn, </em>212 Or 546, 551, 321 P2d 356 (1958), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Neely, </em>239 Or 487, 395 P2d 557 (1964), and <em>State v. Brewton, </em>238 Or 590, 395 P2d 874 (1964) (\u201cThe state and the defendant are agreed upon the principle, established in Oregon since 1881, that when a prior confession is obtained by improper inducement, a presumption arises that any subsequent confession is also the product of such inducement, and the second confession is not admissible unless the presumption is overcome by an affirmative showing that before the second confession was made the hopes or fears which induced the former one had been dispelled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Although ORS 136.425(1) is an expression of the common-law rule on involuntary confessions, <em>Foster, </em>303 Or at 525; <em>Smith, </em>301 Or at 690 (\u201cWe know of no case that interprets or applies ORS 136.425 independently of the common-law rules on confessions[.]\u201d), the analysis articulated in <em>Wintzingerode </em>\u2014 examining whether successive confessions were made \u201cunder the influence of\u2019 the threats or promises that induced the first confession \u2014 flows from the text of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We directly apply ORS 136.425(1) then, rather than a common-law principle, to determine whether the second confession to the police was made \u201cunder the influence of\u2019 the promises that induced the first confession to the FedEx investigators. There was a high level of continuity between defendant\u2019s initial confession to the FedEx investigators and his subsequent confession to police. The interview with police occurred immediately after and in the same room as the initial interview. At the conclusion of the initial interview, Ladd in essence reinforced the promises of leniency when he stated that the police were there merely to \u201cdocument what\u2019s been said\u201d rather than to arrest defendant. Ladd remained in the room during police questioning. Although the officer advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, she minimized them as being a \u201cmatter of housekeeping.\u201d Moreover, when defendant guessed that the police were there to arrest him \u2014 a statement that was, according to defendant, intended to find out if \u201cthe deal was off with the FedEx representatives\u201d \u2014 the officer responded that it was ultimately up to the company, and Ladd nodded along in apparent affirmation of that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">On the other hand, the arrival of a uniformed police officer would have alerted defendant to a change in circumstances. Importantly, the officer advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. That advice included the warning that anything defendant said could be used against him in a court of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the officer suggested that the warnings were just a formality, there is no contention that the warnings themselves were defective or incomplete in any way, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>defendant seemed to understand the import of the officer\u2019s presence, notwithstanding his later testimony, when he stated that she was probably there to arrest him. The officer acknowledged that that was a possibility, despite saying that it was ultimately up to FedEx.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We conclude that the arrival of the officer and the warnings administered to defendant were sufficient to dispel the \u201cdelusive hopes * * * under the influence of which the original confession was obtained.\u201d <em>Wintzingerode, </em>9 Or at 164. <em>Wintzingerode </em>explicitly states that circumstances such as a \u201cproper warning of the consequences of confession\u201d will have a dispelling effect. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court in <em>Wintzingerode </em>reversed the trial court\u2019s admission of subsequent confessions where the confessions were made on the same day, while still in custody, with \u201cthe inducement to make the original confession being still in full force and not withdrawn, <em>and no warning having been given.\u201d Id. </em>at 165 (emphasis added). Given <em>due Miranda </em>warnings here, the second confession, then, was not \u201cmade under the influence of [the same] fear\u201d or hope that induced the first confession. Consequently, the trial court erred in excluding defendant\u2019s second confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Although defendant makes some argument that the second confession was independently involuntary because of the actions of the police officer, <em>see Vondehn, </em>348 Or at 481 n 9 (voluntariness is always a requirement for admission of incriminating statements, even if <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been given); <em>Foster, </em>303 Or at 528-29 (discussing whether police had converted threats made by private citizens into their own threat, thereby violating ORS 136.425(1)), he specifically <em>disclaimed </em>such an argument below. The state relied upon that disavowal in not offering further evidence of the police interview at the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is likely that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the record would have developed differently had the argument been pursued before the trial court. Thus, we decline to address it as an alternative basis for affirmance. <em>See Biggerstaff v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>240 Or App 46, 56, 245 P3d 688 (2010) (declining to exercise discretion to affirm on an alternate basis where the contentions \u201cwere not preserved, much less fully developed\u201d in the proceedings below).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Because we reverse the trial court\u2019s suppression of the second confession, the state argues that we should also reverse suppression of the physical evidence obtained by the police subsequent to that confession. Defendant does not challenge the validity of his consent to a police search or the recovery of that evidence except as the fruits of an involuntary confession to the police. Thus, we have no occasion to separately analyze that issue. Accordingly, we reverse the suppression of the physical evidence obtained by the police subsequent to defendant\u2019s second confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\"> The interview was tape-recorded and admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing.
