J.</author>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for one count of second-degree assault, ORS 163.175, and two counts of fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160. On appeal, he contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in allowing \u201cdefendant to proceed <em>pro se </em>without obtaining a valid waiver of counsel\u201d and in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) on the count of second-degree assault. An extended recitation of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. For the reasons stated below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u201c[B]ecause the relief for an erroneously denied MJOA \u2014 entry of a judgment of acquittal \u2014 is more complete than the remedy of remanding for a new trial[,]\u201d <em>State v. Lavadores, </em>230 Or App 163, 165 n 2, 214 P3d 86 (2009), we begin by addressing defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in denying his MJOA on the count of second-degree assault. As pertinent to that count, a person commits second-degree assault if the person \u201cknowingly causes physical injury to another by means of a * * * dangerous weapon[.]\u201d ORS 163.175(1)(b). In turn, a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is defined as \u201cany weapon, device, instrument, material or substance which under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used, is readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d ORS 161.015(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">At trial, the victim testified, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201cSomehow I got up and he pushed me back down and he grabbed the back of my head \u2014 well, my hair, because I usually wear like a ponytail, and then \u2014 so, he grabbed that and was holding me around my waist and then threw me back down on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201cAt first, you know, it was \u2014 it was like a rock or a log or \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what it was. It was just \u2014 and there was repetitious. Just over and over. I think there was a \u2014 later they found, you know, like a big bald spot where he had ripped out some of my hair because it\u2019s \u2014 the force of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cOf pulling on my hair and pulling it back and forth as he was lifting my body up and down with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">\u201c[DISTRICT ATTORNEY:] Okay. And as your body would come down, what was your face making contact with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201c[VICTIM:] Later I found out it was the log.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Defendant moved for an MJOA, contending that the state had failed to adduce sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that he used a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d Relying on the victim\u2019s testimony, the trial court denied the motion, reasoning that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, \u201cthere is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that that element has been met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying the MJOA. Specifically, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cDefendant was charged with assault in the second degree for causing physical injury by means of a dangerous weapon. The alleged weapon was a log. However, defendant did not use the log in a manner that could cause serious physical injury because he did not deliberately strike the victim\u2019s face against the log; rather, the victim\u2019s face hit the log as defendant repeatedly pushed the victim\u2019s body into the ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s contention. The victim\u2019s testimony was sufficient evidence from which a fact-finder could conclude that the log was a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d <em>See State v. Reed, </em>101 Or App 277, 790 P2d 551, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 195 (1990) (reasoning that a concrete sidewalk was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d when the defendant struck the victim\u2019s head against it). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s MJOA concerning the count of second-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in allowing him to proceed <em>pro se </em>without obtaining a waiver of counsel. The state concedes that \u201cthe trial court committed reversible error by allowing defendant to proceed <em>pro se </em>without first obtaining a valid waiver of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, defendant is entitled to a new trial on all three counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\"> <em>See State v.

A waiver of the right to counsel is valid only if the defendant understands that (1) he or she has the right to counsel; and (2) there are risks inherent in self-representation. The state can establish a valid waiver by showing that the trial court engaged the defendant in a colloquy that verified the defendant\u2019s understanding of the risks of self-representation.\u201d (Citations and footnotes omitted.)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> Our disposition obviates the need to address defendant\u2019s other assignments of error concerning various trial-related rulings and the failure of the trial court to merge certain convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
