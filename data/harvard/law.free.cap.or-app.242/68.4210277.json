He pleaded guilty to the charges and received consecutive sentences on the robbery convictions. He then filed a petition for post-conviction relief in which he alleged that his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate in failing to object when the court imposed those consecutive sentences without expressly making the required findings. <em>See </em>ORS 137.123(5)(b) (the court may impose consecutive sentences for convictions arising out of a \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted course of conduct only if\u2019 the court finds that the two crimes \u201ccaused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury or harm to the victim or caused or created a risk of causing loss, injury or harm to a different victim\u201d). The post-conviction court granted petitioner his requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Defendant now appeals, arguing that petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced as a result of trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the lack of express findings. <em>See Trujillo v. Maass, </em>312 Or 431, 435, 822 P2d 703 (1991) (to prevail on a post-conviction claim for inadequate assistance of counsel, a petitioner must \u201cshow, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts demonstrating that trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment <em>and that petitioner sujfered prejudice as a result\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Defendant points out that, had petitioner\u2019s trial counsel objected, the trial court \u201ccould easily have made findings that would satisfy ORS 137.123(5)(b), because the indictment alleged separate victims for the two robbery charges.\u201d Defendant is correct. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the lack of express findings regarding separate victims did not prejudice petitioner; the error would have been easily remedied had it been brought to the trial court\u2019s attention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The post-conviction court therefore erred in granting post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment denying post-conviction relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> Petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel was unable to identify any meritorious arguments that would allow this court to affirm the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
