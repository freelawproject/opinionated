OAC asserts that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that any negligence of OAC\u2019s agent Coast to Coast Event Services, Inc. (Coast to Coast) is the negligence of OAC and in repeating that principle in a comment to the jury about the instruction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Plaintiff was seriously injured when she fell approximately 40 feet from a railing enclosing the 300-level smokers lounge during a Portland Trail Blazers basketball game at the Rose Garden. Plaintiff filed a complaint against OAC, the developer and owner of the arena, and Coast to Coast, the company that provided security services at the basketball game.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Plaintiff and Coast to Coast settled before trial. Then plaintiff filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>asking the court to exclude evidence that Coast to Coast was formerly a party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the motion was granted, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint to conform the pleadings on the dismissal of Coast to Coast as a party. The third amended complaint alleged that, \u201c[a]s a corporation, [OAC] acted through its officers, employees, and agents, including [Coast to Coast], <em>who were at all times material herein acting within the course and scope of those relationships.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The third amended complaint also provided that \u201c[OAC] contracted with [Coast to Coast] to provide part of its security services at The Rose Garden.\u201d The third amended complaint listed nine specific allegations of negligence against OAC.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201c[OAC] was negligent in one or more of the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\u201ca. In choosing not to post any warning signs in the east 300 level outdoor smokers lounge to protect customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>from the risk and danger of falling from the bench-like platform to the ground level below, such as of the type posted in the similar 200 level \u2018Preferred\u2019 or \u2018Club\u2019 and the \u2018Suite\u2019 level outdoors smokers lounges directly below the east 300 level outdoor smokers lounge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\u201cb. In choosing not to have a window, wall, fence or some other barrier to prevent customers from falling from the bench-like platform in the east 300 level outdoors smokers lounge to the ground over forty feet below;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201cc. In choosing not to have or implement adequate policies or procedures requiring its employees <em>or </em>agents[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] to look for customers sitting on the bench-like platform in the east 300 level smokers lounge and warn those customers not to sit there due to the dangers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cd. In choosing not to have or implement adequate policies or procedures requiring its employees <em>and other agents </em>to inform [OAC] of repeated incidents wherein its personnel observed customers at The Rose Garden in potentially dangerous situations so that [OAC] could then take safety measures to protect its customers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201ce. In choosing to have moveable picnic tables in the east 300 level smokers lounge that could be used to access and sit on the bench-like platform;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cf. In choosing not to have adequate policies or procedures requiring its employees <em>or agents </em>to take reasonable steps to prevent the moveable picnic tables in the east 300 level smokers lounge from being used to access and sit on the bench-like platform;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cg. In having unsafe premises due to having a large horizontal concrete area directly behind part of the bench-like platform in the east 300 level smokers lounge, which tended to give an impression that the bench-like platform could safely be used for seating, that stops midway so that a portion of the bench-like platform does not have the horizontal concrete area behind it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201ch. In having nighttime lighting in the east 300 level smokers lounge that did not adequately illuminate the end of the large horizontal concrete area directly behind part of the bench-like platform, thereby making it unreasonably difficult to notice that only half of the bench-like platform had a large horizontal concrete area behind it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201ci. In choosing not to use its video security surveillance system to have a surveillance camera adequately directed into the east 300 level smokers lounge, thereby failing to obtain information from that source about customers on the bench-like platform so that they could be protected from the risk of harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">(Emphasis added.) The parties agreed to limit the evidence to the scope of the third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Over the course of the 10-day trial, both parties called Coast to Coast employees to testify as witnesses about the types of security Coast to Coast provided for OAC. Plaintiff proposed a verdict form that asked the jury to determine if Coast to Coast was negligent and in what proportion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> OAC opposed plaintiffs proposed verdict form, arguing that negligence by Coast to Coast should not be included in the jury verdict form because, \u201c[i]n this particular case, this has been tried as if we are responsible for all the actions of Coast to Coast\u201d and including Coast to Coast on the verdict form would attribute liability to OAC twice. OAC\u2019s attorney stated that OAC would \u201cassume the responsibility\u201d for Coast to Coast, and suggested that the court instruct the jury that \u201cto the extent Coast to Coast is at fault, assign it to us.\u201d As OAC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>requested, the trial court ruled that Coast to Coast would not be included in the jury verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Accordingly, plaintiff proposed the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cCoast to Coast Event Services was the agent of the defendant Oregon Arena Corporation. Any negligence of Coast to Coast Event Services is the negligence of the defendant Oregon Arena Corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">OAC\u2019s attorney objected to plaintiffs proposed jury instruction. OAC argued that, because the allegations of fault in the pleadings were all personal to OAC and there were no pleadings to support independent negligence of Coast to Coast, the instruction was in error. The court overruled OAC\u2019s objection. The court gave the proposed instruction and also told the jury, \u201cAnd just to be clear, in this case, * * * there\u2019s the direct liability of OAC and then there\u2019s the principal-agent liability as to Coast to Coast. That\u2019s all under OAC as already [has] been explained.\u201d OAC took exception to the instruction and the court\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The jury found that OAC was 50 percent at fault and plaintiff was 50 percent at fault. The jury found that plaintiff had economic damages of $2,750,000 and noneconomic damages of $1,500,000. Accordingly, the court awarded plaintiff damages of $2,125,000 (50 percent of the total damages found by the jury).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> OAC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The two related issues on appeal are whether the trial court erred (1) in instructing the jury that any negligence of Coast to Coast is the negligence of OAC, and (2) in repeating that principle in its comment to the jury about the instruction. OAC renews the argument that it made to the trial court: The jury should not have been instructed that any negligence of Coast to Coast is the negligence of OAC, because there were no pleadings to support independent negligence of Coast to Coast. Plaintiff responds that the court properly instructed the jury as to the legal effect of OAC\u2019s delegation of responsibility to Coast to Coast as its agent. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>addition, plaintiff argues that the jury instruction was consistent with OAC\u2019s theory of the case. We agree with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We begin with an overview of the agency principles applicable to this case. An agent is one who is subject to the control of another and acts on behalf of the other. <em>Vaughn v. First Transit, Inc., </em>346 Or 128, 136, 206 P3d 181 (2009). Generally, a principal is not liable in tort for physical injuries caused by the action of its nonemployee agents unless the principal intended or authorized the result or manner of performance of the agent. <em>Id. </em>at 137. Stated differently, a principal is liable for the actions of a nonemployee agent only if those actions are \u201cwithin the actual or apparent authorization of the principal.\u201d <em>Jensen v. Medley, </em>336 Or 222, 231, 82 P3d 149 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In <em>Lipman Wolfe v. Teeples &amp; Thatcher, </em>268 Or 578, 587, 522 P2d 467 (1974), the Supreme Court held that when a storekeeper has an independent contractor perform work that increases the danger to the storekeeper\u2019s customers but the storekeeper continues to invite customers, the storekeeper is vicariously liable for the negligence of the independent contractor. <em>See also Bryant v. Sherm\u2019s Thunderbird Mkt., </em>268 Or 591, 602, 522 P2d 1383 (1974) (\u201c[A] storekeeper cannot delegate to any third party his duty to his customers to keep the premises reasonably safe.\u201d). Thus, a landowner cannot delegate its responsibility to keep the premises safe for its business invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Here, OAC concedes that Coast to Coast was its agent and OAC\u2019s duty to maintain the safety of the Rose Garden was a nondelegable duty. Despite these concessions, OAC argues that the court erred in instructing the jury that \u201c[a]ny negligence of [Coast to Coast] is the negligence of [OAC].\u201d The argument is two-fold: (1) In the absence of allegations specifying the ways in which Coast to Coast was negligent, the jury should not have been allowed to consider Coast to Coast\u2019s negligence; and (2) by instructing the jury that \u201cany\u201d negligence of Coast to Coast is the negligence of OAC, the court gave the jury \u201cfree rein to speculate about \u2018any negligence\u2019 of Coast to Coast, and then to attribute that unpleaded negligence, whatever it might be, to OAC.\u201d In other words, OAC contends that the instruction allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>jury to hold OAC responsible even for negligence by Coast to Coast that would otherwise be outside the scope of OAC\u2019s acknowledged vicarious liability as Coast to Coast\u2019s principal, even though the third amended complaint alleged that, at all material times, Coast to Coast was acting within the course and scope of its services for OAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The first prong of OAC\u2019s argument \u2014 that, under ORCP 18 A,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plaintiff was required to allege the specific ways in which Coast to Coast was negligent \u2014 derives from <em>Holger v. Irish, </em>316 Or 402, 851 P2d 1122 (1993). In <em>Holger, </em>the Supreme Court held that an operating room surgeon was not vicariously liable for the negligence of nurses in the operating room. <em>Id. </em>at 413. In the process, the court explained that, \u201cunder ORCP 18 A, a pleader is required to state <em>in what way </em>the defendant allegedly was negligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407 (emphasis in original). Given the way in which this case was pleaded and tried, OAC\u2019s reliance on <em>Holger </em>is misplaced. Plaintiffs complaint specifically alleged that OAC was negligent in \u201cchoosing not to have or implement adequate policies or procedures requiring its employers or agents to look for customers sitting on the bench-like platform in the east 300 level smokers lounge and warn those customers not to sit there due to the dangers[.]\u201d It also specifically alleged that OAC was negligent in \u201cchoosing not to have or implement\u201d policies requiring its employees or agents to inform OAC of customers observed in potentially dangerous situations and requiring employees and agents to prevent moveable picnic tables from being used to access the platform from which plaintiff fell. At the same time, plaintiff further alleged \u2014 and OAC conceded \u2014 that Coast to Coast was OAC\u2019s agent; moreover, there was evidence in the record that OAC hired Coast to Coast to handle \u201cimplementation\u201d of safety policies in the Rose Garden. Thus, the complaint specifically alleged the ways in which agents, including Coast to Coast, failed to implement safety policies, and the jury was properly allowed to consider Coast to Coast\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The second prong of OAC\u2019s argument focuses on the use of the phrase \u201cany negligence.\u201d As noted above, OAC contends that the instruction invited the jury to consider \u201cany\u201d evidence of negligence by Coast to Coast, whether or not that negligence had been alleged in the complaint. Again, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In addition to instructing the jury that \u201c[a]ny negligence of [Coast to Coast] is the negligence of [OAC],\u201d the court instructed the jury that it could decide only the questions framed by the pleadings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201cThe questions to be decided in a lawsuit are defined in certain formal papers filed in court by the parties. We call these pleadings. These consist of the plaintiffs complaint which sets forth the plaintiffs claims as to the facts, the defendant\u2019s answer in which the defendant either admits or denies various claims of the defendant and sets forth any additional claims or defenses on which the defendant relies, and then the plaintiffs reply in which the plaintiff admits or denies the various claims or defenses in the defendant\u2019s answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201cBy these pleadings, questions of fact are presented, and it\u2019s these questions and only these that are submitted for your determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Thus, the jury was instructed that the negligence of Coast to Coast for which OAC could be held liable was limited by the specifications of negligence in the complaint. Further, the complaint alleged that Coast to Coast acted within the course and scope of its services to OAC at all material times. Given those limitations and OAC\u2019s position that it was responsible for Coast to Coast\u2019s conduct, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that OAC was responsible for \u201cany\u201d negligence by Coast to Coast. In light of the strictures of those instructions, the jury would have understood that \u201cany negligence\u201d referred to negligence within the scope of the pleadings, and the jury instruction was not an invitation to go beyond the pleadings. <em>See Maas v. Willer, </em>203 Or App 124, 129, 125 P3d 87 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 411 (2006) (\u201cWe review jury instructions as a whole and will reverse only if we can fairly say that the instructions probably created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the jurors that affected the outcome of the case.\u201d). The trial court did not err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>in giving plaintiffs proposed jury instruction and did not err in giving the additional comment to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> Plaintiff also filed suit against Ellerbe Becket, Inc., the designer of the Rose Garden.
