ORS 419C.400(2). Thus, we review the record <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the allegations of the delinquency petition have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional finding arose out of the following incident. At about 10:30 p.m. on August 7, 2008, the victim was driving home from work when something hit and shattered the windshield of her car. Pieces of glass fell into her lap and onto the seat of the car. At the time, she was heading west along Philomath Boulevard in Corvallis, just past 15th Street; the soccer fields of the Oregon State University campus abutted the road on her right. She immediately pulled over onto the shoulder and called her husband to tell him what had happened. She also got out of the car and \u201clooked around to see if there was anything on the road\u201d and found a rock, \u201cabout the size of a tennis ball.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The victim\u2019s husband, meanwhile, \u201cjumped in [his] car\u201d and drove to the scene; he called the police while en route. As he drove by the soccer field on 15th Street \u2014 while still on the phone with the 9-1-1 dispatcher \u2014 he saw two young men \u201cwalking * * * out of the grass.\u201d He was in visual distance of his wife\u2019s car at that time. He \u201cslowed to look at them just to take note, and they looked at me and looked nervous and started walking faster.\u201d He described the two people and what they were wearing to the 9-1-1 dispatcher. He continued on and arrived where his wife was parked within \u201cfive to ten minutes\u201d after the incident had occurred. After determining that the car was drivable, the victim drove the car home (about 20 blocks) and waited for her husband to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The victim\u2019s husband then drove back east on Philomath Boulevard and turned on 15th Street to see if he could discover where the two young men had gone. When he did not see them, he turned up Western to head home. A couple of blocks away, near Reser Stadium, he spotted the same two young men whom he had seen coming out of the soccer field earlier. He called the police and pulled over in the stadium parking lot to wait for them to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">While he was waiting, the two young men sat down and were talking in front of the driveway to an apartment complex on the corner of 26th and Western, directly across from the Reser Stadium parking lot. The police arrived and interviewed the two men, later identified as youth and Jackson-Grixgby, then age 18. Youth denied knowing anything about the rock-throwing incident. Jackson-Grixgby initially denied any involvement, but, when the officer asked him again \u2014 after explaining that police had the rock that had been used to break the window and explaining the capabilities of the crime lab related to DNA and fingerprint tests \u2014 he admitted that he was the person responsible for breaking the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">At the hearing on the petition, Jackson-Grixgby testified that he and youth were \u201cgood friends\u201d and that they spent time together \u201c[a]lmost every day.\u201d He said that he lived in an apartment less than a mile from Reser Stadium and youth lived about five blocks from there. As to the events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>of August 7, he testified that he had ridden his bike to youth\u2019s house where the two had \u201chung out and played videogames\u201d until they decided to go to a market to get some food. From the market, they went over to a gravel parking lot near the soccer field. There, they sat by a sand pile and \u201cate food and hung out\u201d until, at some point, they \u201cdecided to throw rocks at a car.\u201d They both collected rocks from the gravel parking lot and carried them over to the other side of a fence by the highway. According to Jackson-Grixgby, they both then began throwing rocks at passing cars, while standing about five feet from the highway and hiding behind a bush. They threw rocks at several cars until they realized, by the sound, that one of the cars had been hit. At that point, they ran across the soccer field to Western. They stopped to rest on Western across the street from the parking lot at Reser Stadium, where the police saw them and began asking them about the rock-throwing incident. Jackson-Grixgby testified that he did not know whether it was his rock that had hit the car window. He also testified that he had been convicted, based on a guilty plea, of criminal mischief and reckless endangerment based on the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The state filed a petition for jurisdiction over youth based on acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute recklessly endangering another person, ORS 163.195,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and second-degree criminal mischief, ORS 164.354.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of the state\u2019s evidence, youth moved for a dismissal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He contended that, because there was inadequate corroboration of Jackson-Grixgby\u2019s accomplice testimony under ORS 138.440, the evidence was insufficient to support jurisdiction. The juvenile court disagreed, denied youth\u2019s motion, and found youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court for the acts alleged in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">On appeal, youth renews the argument that he made below. Relying primarily on <em>State v. Carroll, </em>251 Or 197, 444 P2d 1006 (1968), he asserts that the evidence corroborating Jackson-Grixgby\u2019s testimony is insufficient because it merely shows that youth was with Jackson-Grixgby close in time and place to the incident without evidence that the two \u201c \u2018were together at a place and under circumstances not likely to have occurred unless there was criminal concert between them.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Carroll, </em>251 Or at 200.) The state counters that the evidence is sufficient; it also argues, for the first time, that ORS 136.440 is inapplicable in juvenile delinquency proceedings, and that we should affirm the juvenile court\u2019s ruling on that alternative basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We need not reach the state\u2019s alternative basis for affirmance, because, even assuming that ORS 136.440 applies (and that Jackson-Grixgby is an accomplice), we conclude that there was sufficient corroborating evidence to connect youth with the acts alleged in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\"> ORS 136.440 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201c(1) A conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it is corroborated by other evidence that tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense. The corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances of the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Thus, \u201c[i]f the corroboration must be supplemented by testimony by the accomplices in order to connect the defendant with the crime it is insufficient.\u201d <em>State v. Caldwell, </em>241 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>355, 360, 405 P2d 847 (1965). Rather, to sustain a conviction, the testimony of an accomplice must be corroborated by evidence \u201ctend[ing] to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense\u201d; evidence \u201cmerely show[ing] the commission of the offense or the circumstances of the commission\u201d is not enough. ORS 136.440(1). We recently synthesized the relevant principles as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">\u201cUnder [ORS 136.440], the corroboration must fairly and legitimately tend to connect the defendant with the crime, \u2018so that it can in truth be said that his conviction is not based entirely upon evidence of the accomplices.\u2019 <em>[State v.]Torres, </em>207 Or App [355, 360, 142 P3d 99 (2006)] (citations and internal quotations [and brackets] omitted * * *). The corroboration is sufficient \u2018if there is some evidence, however slight, tending to connect the defendant with the crime.\u2019 <em>State v. Walton, </em>311 Or 223, 242, 809 P2d 81 (1991) (citing <em>State v. Caldwell, </em>241 Or 355, 361, 405 P2d 847 (1965)). The corroborating evidence may be circumstantial and need not independently corroborate each material fact required to sustain a conviction. <em>State v. Boone, </em>213 Or App 242, 247-48, 160 P3d 994, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>215 Or App 428, 169 P3d 1274 (2007); <em>see also Walton, </em>311 Or at 243. <em>A defendant\u2019s association with the accomplice, without more, is not enough to corroborate the accomplice\u2019s testimony. \u2018Before independent evidence of a defendant\u2019s association with an admitted accomplice will furnish the corroboration necessary, it must appear that the defendant and the accomplice were together at a place and under circumstances not likely to have occurred unless there was criminal concert between them.\u2019State v. Carroll, </em>251 Or 197, 200, 444 P2d 1006 (1968) (citations [and brackets] omitted). If any evidence other than the accomplice\u2019s testimony tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime, then the trier of fact decides whether the accomplice\u2019s testimony has been corroborated. <em>Walton, </em>311 Or at 243.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\"><em>State v. Foster, </em>221 Or App 108, 113, 188 P3d 440 (2008) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Here, the corroboration evidence includes testimony that the victim\u2019s car\u2019s windshield was shattered by something hitting it and the tennis-ball sized rock that was found immediately thereafter near the victim\u2019s car. That evidence, however, tends to \u201cmerely show[ ] the commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>offense or the circumstances of the commission\u201d; it does not \u201ctend[ ] to connect\u201d youth with commission of that crime. ORS 136.440(1). Accordingly, it alone is insufficient to corroborate Jackson-Grixgby\u2019s accomplice testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">However, the record also includes the victim\u2019s husband\u2019s testimony that he saw youth with Jackson-Grixgby five to 10 minutes later and very close to the location where the windshield-shattering incident took place; that youth and Jackson-Grixgby appeared nervous and began walking faster when the victim\u2019s husband slowed down to look at them; and that he saw them again not long afterward sitting in front of an apartment building a few blocks away.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Youth contends that that evidence is not sufficient under ORS 136.440, focusing on the following statement from Carroll:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201cBefore independent evidence of defendant\u2019s association with an admitted accomplice will furnish the corroboration necessary, it must appear that the defendant and the accomplice were together at a place and under circumstances not likely to have occurred unless there was criminal concert between them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">251 Or at 200. In youth\u2019s view, that standard has not been satisfied in this case because, given other evidence that youth and Jackson-Grixgby were friends; that the location was near their homes; and that they had engaged in other, benign activities in the area that evening, the record demonstrates that youth and his alleged accomplice \u201cwere together in the location of the incident under circumstances that <em>were </em>likely to have occurred for a reason other than criminal activity.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Youth gives <em>Carroll </em>more weight than it can bear. In <em>Carroll, </em>the defendant was convicted of uttering and publishing a forged bank check. 251 Or at 198. His accomplice testified that the defendant had given her the forged check and had her cash it, which she did and gave the defendant the proceeds. She also testified that, on a different occasion roughly two weeks earlier, she had attempted to cash another forged check at a store while the defendant drove around the parking lot waiting for her. When she was unsuccessful, the two then went to another store; the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>again waited for her in the car \u2014 a lilac-colored Chevrolet \u2014 in the parking lot, while she went into the store. There, the accomplice cashed an insufficient funds check on her own account. A witness testified that she had seen the defendant and the accomplice together on that date in a lilac-colored car in that store\u2019s parking lot. The witness also testified that she had seen the accomplice in the store writing a check. <em>Id. </em>at 198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The Supreme Court concluded that the witness\u2019s testimony was insufficient to corroborate the defendant\u2019s criminal involvement with the forged check that the accomplice had cashed on the later date. <em>Id. </em>at 200. In that context, the court explained the statement quoted above, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\u201cThe fact that defendant awaited in an automobile on the store\u2019s parking lot while [the accomplice] cashed an insufficient funds check on her own account is not such evidence as would lead a reasonable person to believe that defendant criminally participated in the cashing of the check because this is a circumstance that is likely to occur without there having been any concert between them. The evidence being insufficient to connect defendant criminally with the [earlier] occasion it cannot so connect him in any way with the [later] occasion with which he is charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 200-01. Thus, the corroborating evidence that the court rejected in <em>Carroll </em>\u2014 that of association between the defendant and the accomplice \u2014 occurred on a date nearly two weeks before the incident for which the defendant was charged and at a separate location. The only evidence of the association also related to a different event than the event leading up to the crime for which the defendant was charged. And, the circumstances of that event \u2014 the accomplice cashing a bad check on her <em>own </em>account \u2014 the court found, was reasonably likely to occur without any involvement by the defendant. Because it thus did not tend to connect the defendant with that crime, the court concluded, it certainly could not connect him to the crime for which he was charged. It was under those circumstances that the court concluded that evidence of association between the defendant and an admitted accomplice was insufficient without evidence that it was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>unlikely for them to be together unless there was criminal concert between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Likewise, in <em>State v. Jones, </em>2 Or App 42, 465 P2d 719 (1970), we held that the evidence was insufficient to corroborate the admitted accomplices\u2019 testimony that they and the defendant had burglarized a retail store. The evidence offered to corroborate the accomplices\u2019 testimony showed only that a burglary had been committed; that the defendant, who regularly visited the store, had been in the store earlier on the evening of the burglary; and that he was seen with the accomplices and others still in the general vicinity later that same evening. <em>Id. </em>at 43. We noted that there was \u201cno corroborative evidence showing that defendant was in possession of the fruits of the crime, or that the accomplices were at the scene of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43-44. Citing <em>Carroll, </em>we concluded that there was \u201cnothing suspicious or unusual about the place or circumstances\u201d of the association \u2014 the individuals were all friends and near some of their homes, <em>Jones, </em>2 Or App at 45 \u2014 thus, the defendant and the accomplices were \u201cnot together \u2018under circumstances not likely to have occurred unless there was criminal concert between them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44 (quoting <em>Carroll, 251 Or </em>at 200). <em>See also Torres, </em>207 Or App at 362 (witness\u2019s testimony that he observed the defendant in an accomplice\u2019s company on one occasion insufficient to show that the defendant and the accomplice \u201cwere jointly engaged in criminal conduct on that occasion, much less that they jointly engaged in the criminal conduct at issue\u201d in the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The circumstances here are markedly different. In addition to evidence that the offenses were committed <em>(i.e., </em>the victim\u2019s testimony and the rock), the victim\u2019s husband testified that he saw youth and his accomplice leaving a field very close to the scene of the crime approximately five minutes after it occurred. It was late at night, and it can reasonably be inferred from the victim\u2019s husband\u2019s testimony that no one else was around. Moreover, there was evidence that youth appeared nervous and began walking faster when he saw the victim\u2019s husband. In short, the corroboration in this case is not dependent on mere association between youth and Jackson-Grixgby, such that it is necessary to also show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>that the circumstances of their association were not likely to have occurred but for some criminal activity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, the fact that youth and Jackson-Grixgby may have had other, noncriminal, reasons to be together at the time and place of the crime does not defeat the corroborative value of the evidence in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We conclude that, even if ORS 136.440 applies, the corroboration evidence in this case \u201cfairly and legitimately tend[s] to connect [youth] with the commission of the crime[.]\u201d <em>State v. Brake, </em>99 Or 310, 314, 195 P 583 (1921); <em>accord Torres, </em>207 Or App at 360; <em>see also Caldwell, </em>241 Or at 361 (corroboration is sufficient \u201cif there is some evidence, however slight, tending to connect the defendant with the crime\u201d); <em>Walton, </em>311 Or at 243 (corroboration evidence may be circumstantial and not every material fact required for conviction need be independently corroborated); <em>State v. Rose, </em>45 Or App 879, 882, 609 P2d 875 (1980) (corroborating evidence need not be adequate in itself to support conviction if it fairly tends to connect the defendant with commission of the crime). Hence, the testimony of Jackson-Grixgby can properly be considered in this case. Moreover, the court necessarily found his testimony to be credible, a finding to which we defer. Based on Jackson-Grixgby\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in the record, we find that youth is within the jurisdiction of the court based on the offenses alleged in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\"> The juvenile court, inexplicably, entered two judgments of jurisdiction based on the same conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> The notice initiating the appeal in this case was filed before the effective date of Oregon Laws 2009, chapter 231, section 2 (June 4, 2009), which amended ORS 19.415 to change the <em>de novo </em>standard of review in equitable proceedings.
