J.</author>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Defendant was convicted of, among other offenses, rape in the first degree with a firearm (Count 1), ORS 163.375; sodomy in the first degree with a firearm (Count 2), ORS 163.405; and unlawful use of a weapon (Count 3), ORS 166.220. Defendant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2 under ORS 137.700 (Ballot Measure 11), and to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 3 under the \u201cgun minimum\u201d statute, ORS 161.610. Defendant appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by imposing the 60-month gun minimum sentence consecutively to the Measure 11 sentences, because doing so resulted in a total incarcerative term of 260 months, in violation of the 200 percent rule codified at OAR 213-012-0020(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">OAR 213-012-0020 establishes the \u201c200 percent rule\u201d; it provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201c(1) When the sentencing judge imposes multiple sentences consecutively, the consecutive sentences shall consist of an incarceration term and a supervision term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201c(2)(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the presumptive incarceration term of the consecutive sentences is the sum of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201c(A) The presumptive incarceration term or the prison term defined in OAR 213-008-0005(1) imposed pursuant to a dispositional departure for the primary offense, as defined in OAR 213-003-0001(17); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201c(B) Up to the maximum incarceration term indicated in the Criminal History I Column for each additional offense imposed consecutively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">\u201c(b) The total incarceration term of the consecutive sentences, including the incarceration term for the primary offense, shall not exceed twice the maximum presumptive incarceration term or the prison term defined in OAR 213-008-0005(1) imposed pursuant to a dispositional departure of the primary sentence except by departure as provided by OAR 213-008-0007.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">As we explained in <em>State v. Langdon, </em>151 Or App 640, 646, 950 P2d 410 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>330 Or 72, 999 P2d 1127 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>(2000), OAR 213-012-0020(2) \u201caddresses only consecutive sentences that involve presumptive or dispositional departure sentences. Under the sentencing guidelines, a statutorily mandated sentence is neither a presumptive nor a departure sentence.\u201d Accordingly, we held that, \u201c[b]ecause Ballot Measure 11 sentences are mandatory sentences, they are not subject to the 200/400 percent limitation of OAR 213-012-0020.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Defendant does not dispute that his Measure 11 sentences are controlled by <em>Langdon; </em>rather, he argues that, because a \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentence is not a statutorily mandated sentence, it is subject to the 200 percent rule, and the trial court erred by imposing such a sentence consecutively to the Measure 11 sentences. The \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentence is set out in ORS 161.610, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">\u201c(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 161.605 or 137.010 (3) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (6) of this section, if a defendant is convicted of a felony having as an element the defendant\u2019s use or threatened use of a firearm during the commission of the crime, the court shall impose at least the minimum term of imprisonment as provided in subsection (4) of this section. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">\u201c(4) The minimum terms of imprisonment for felonies having as an element the defendant\u2019s use or threatened use of a firearm in the commission of the crime shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, upon the first conviction for such felony, five years</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">\u201c(5) If it is the first time that the defendant is subject to punishment under this section, rather than impose the sentence otherwise required by subsection (4)(a) of this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">\u201c(b) For felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, impose a lesser sentence in accordance with the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Defendant argues that, because his conviction for unlawful use of a weapon was the \u201cfirst time that [he was] subject to punishment under\u201d ORS 161.610, the trial court had discretion to impose a lesser sentence than the mandatory 60 months\u2019 imprisonment term required by ORS 161.610(4)(a). It follows, defendant reasons, that his \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentence was not a \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence and, thus, is subject to the 200 percent rule of OAR 213-012-0020(2). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>125 Or App 655, 658, 866 P2d 1245 (1994), we held that \u201ca gun minimum sentence is not a presumptive guidelines sentence!,] [i]t is a mandatory term.\u201d That conclusion followed from the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cshall\u201d in ORS 161.610(3), which requires a sentencing court to \u201cimpose at least the minimum term of imprisonment as provided in subsection (4) of this section.\u201d That the court could, in some circumstances, impose a guidelines sentence pursuant to ORS 161.610(5)(b) is beside the point; the court did not do so in this case. Accordingly, because the 60-month sentence under ORS 161.610(4)(a) is a mandatory minimum sentence, the trial court did not violate OAR 213-012-0020(2) by imposing that sentence consecutively to defendant\u2019s Measure 11 sentences on Counts 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
