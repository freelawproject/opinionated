J.</author>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">This case is on remand from the Oregon Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Parker, </em>225 Or App 610, 202 P3d 205 <em>(Parker I), adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>227 Or App 413, 206 P3d 259 (2009) <em>(Parker II), </em>and remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or 297, 244 P3d 360 (2010) <em>(Ashbaugh II). State v. Parker, </em>349 Or 663, 249 P3d 1281 (2011) <em>(Parker III). </em>In <em>Parker I, </em>we vacated the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence found during the search of defendant\u2019s person and remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether \u201cdefendant subjectively believed that the officers had significantly restricted his freedom of movement.\u201d 225 Or App at 616. Our holding in that regard was predicated on our decision in <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App 16, 200 P3d 149 (2008) <em>(Ashbaugh I), </em>which the Supreme Court reversed in <em>Ashbaugh II. </em>The issue on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ashbaugh II, </em>the encounter between defendant and the officers constituted a seizure under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained below, we conclude that it did. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">With two amplifications noted below, we take the material facts and a description of the procedural history of this case from our decision in <em>Parker I, </em>in which we noted that \u201c[t]he trial court expressly found both the police officers\u2019 and the defendant\u2019s accounts of the facts to be \u2018accurate, and a fair recitation of what occurred.\u2019 \u201d 225 Or App at 612.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cConsistently with that finding, the salient facts here are as follows: On May 23, 2006, defendant was a passenger in a pickup truck stopped by Portland Police Officers Cioeta and Boman for expired license plate tags. Boman asked the driver and the other passenger for their identification and obtained their information. Cioeta asked defendant if he had any outstanding warrants; defendant replied that he did not. Cioeta then asked for defendant\u2019s identification, wrote down defendant\u2019s information[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] returned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>identification, and then immediately returned to the police vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">\u201cThe officers ran all the occupants\u2019 information and checked them for warrants. In the meantime, at least one additional police vehicle arrived on the scene. Boman then asked the driver and another passenger to get out of the truck. The driver was cited for driving while suspended. Boman conducted a patdown search of the other passenger, informed him he was under arrest for an outstanding warrant, and placed him in custody. Cioeta then approached defendant and asked him to get out of the truck. Cioeta asked defendant if he had any weapons; defendant denied that he did.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Cioeta then asked for permission to search defendant, and defendant consented. Cioeta conducted a patdown search of defendant and retrieved a switchblade knife from defendant\u2019s pants pocket. Defendant was arrested and subsequently charged with carrying a concealed weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201cBefore trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence. The trial court denied that motion, concluding that \u2018regardless of anything that happened before, the consent was freely given and was voluntary.\u2019 Following a stipulated facts trial, the court convicted defendant of carrying a concealed weapon, ORS 166.240(1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 612-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">As we explained in <em>Parker I, </em>the only issue on appeal was whether the encounter between defendant and the officers was a seizure under Article I, section 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">\u201cOn appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Defendant contends that he was unlawfully seized unsupported by reasonable suspicion and that the subsequent inculpatory physical evidence was obtained by exploitation of that unlawful seizure in violation of Article I, section 9. The state\u2019s sole response on appeal is that the encounter between defendant and the officer did not constitute a stop. The state argues that Cioeta did not stop defendant when he asked defendant for his identification because the record does not disclose that defendant was aware that he was the subject of an inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cThe state does not dispute that, on this record, Cioeta acted without reasonable suspicion or that, under the analysis of <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 34-35, 115 P3d 908 (2005), defendant\u2019s consent to the search was sufficiently causally related to the officer\u2019s conduct that the former was the \u2018exploited\u2019 product of the latter. <em>See id. </em>(after a defendant presents a minimal factual nexus between a defendant\u2019s consent to search and a prior, unlawful seizure, the state has the burden to prove that such consent was independent of, or only tenuously related to, the prior unlawful seizure).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">225 Or App at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Our analysis and disposition of that issue was framed by reference to the construct that we had adopted in <em>Ashbaugh I, </em>in which we concluded that \u201cwhether the encounter between the officer and defendant [rose] to the level of a <em>Holmes </em>type (b) stop\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> implicated \u201cconjunctive subjective and objective <em>components </em>\u2014 viz., the defendant subjectively believed that he or she was significantly restrained <em>and </em>that belief was objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Parker I, </em>225 Or App at 614 (emphasis in original). Ultimately, relying on our decision in <em>State v. Highley, </em>219 Or App 100, 180 P3d 1230 (2008), <em>rev allowed, </em>350 Or 130 (2011), we concluded that \u201ca reasonable person in defendant\u2019s situation could understand that he or she was the subject of an investigation.\u201d <em>Parker I, </em>225 Or App at 616. Accordingly, that conclusion necessitated a remand for the trial court \u201cto address, and render findings, as to whether, before Cioeta elicited defendant\u2019s consent to search, defendant <em>subjectively </em>believed that the officers had significantly restricted his freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In <em>Ashbaugh II, </em>the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Ashbaugh I. </em>In <em>Ashbaugh II, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cabandoned] forthrightly the subjective component of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>part of the <em>Holmes </em>part (b) test\u201d and explained the proper inquiry for determining whether a person has been seized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">\u201cA \u2018seizure\u2019 of a person occurs under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution: (a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) if a reasonable person under the totality of the circumstances <em>would </em>believe that (a) above has occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">349 Or at 316 (emphasis in original). As the court indicated, the guiding principle in determining whether an encounter is a constitutionally significant seizure is whether the officer has manifested a \u201cshow of authority\u201d that restricts an individual\u2019s \u201cfreedom of movement.\u201d Id. at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Given that repudiation of <em>Ashbaugh I, </em>on which our initial decision was predicated, it is patent that we erred in our original disposition, <em>viz., </em>a remand for the trial court to make findings concerning defendant\u2019s subjective belief as to whether his freedom of movement had been restricted. <em>Parker I, </em>225 Or App at 616. Accordingly, we must determine whether the encounter between defendant and the officers constituted a seizure under the principles explained in <em>Ashbaugh II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">More specifically, the issue is whether defendant was seized, and therefore stopped, when officer Cioeta (1) asked defendant if he had any warrants, (2) requested defendant\u2019s identification, (3) wrote down defendant\u2019s name and date of birth, and (4) then immediately returned to his vehicle and ran a check to determine whether defendant was the subject of any warrants. In resolving that issue, our decisions in <em>Highley </em>and <em>State v. Radtke, </em>242 Or App 234, 255 P3d 543 (2011), are highly instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">In <em>Highley, </em>which antedated <em>Ashbaugh I </em>and was not predicated on our bifurcated construct there, a police officer asked the defendant, who had been a passenger in a vehicle, whether he was on probation. 219 Or App at 102-03. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Thereafter, the officer requested the defendant\u2019s identification, wrote down the defendant\u2019s information from the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, returned the license, and then immediately walked back to his police vehicle and \u201cran a check.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. In rejecting the state\u2019s argument that there was \u201cno evidence supporting] a conclusion that defendant knew that he was the subject of an investigation,\u201d we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">\u201cGiven that defendant was a passenger rather than the driver of the car and thus not the subject of the traffic violation investigation, and further, that the officer had just inquired about defendant\u2019s probationary status, a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would believe that the officer wrote down the identifying information and then immediately returned to his car with that information in order to run some type of records check.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 108. Ultimately, we concluded that, in the totality of the circumstances, the defendant understood that he was under investigation and was not free to leave and that such an understanding was objectively reasonable. <em>See Hall, </em>339 Or at 19 (\u201c[W]e find it difficult to posit that a reasonable person would think that he or she was free to leave at a time when that person is the investigatory subject of a pending warrant check.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Radtke, </em>which we decided after the Supreme Court vacated and remanded our original decision in that case for reconsideration in light of <em>Ashbaugh II. </em>In <em>Radtke, </em>\u201cwithout suspicion that [the defendant] was involved in criminal activity, the officer asked for and received her name and date of birth, wrote that information in a notebook, asked her if she was carrying anything illegal, and, when she said that she was not, asked for and received consent to search her.\u201d 242 Or App at 236. However, unlike in <em>Highley, </em>the officer \u201cdid not \u2018run\u2019 that information to determine whether there was some reason to detain [the defendant].\u201d <em>Radtke, </em>242 Or App at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We reasoned in <em>Radtke </em>that \u201ctaking a person\u2019s identification for the purpose of checking on the person\u2019s status is one way in which a police officer can show authority that, in combination with other circumstances, can convey to the person whose identification has been obtained that he or she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239-40. Ultimately, applying the principles explained in <em>Ashbaugh II, </em>we concluded that, under the circumstances,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">\u201c[a] reasonable inference from [the] sequence of events is that [the officer] took [the] defendant\u2019s name and date of birth for the purpose of running a check on her, and the reason that he had not done so in no way indicated that he was not going to \u2014 in other words, that the investigatory process had commenced and was ongoing up to the point of arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 240. Several circumstances bolstered that inference, including that, \u201cin addition to taking her information, [the officer] also questioned [the] defendant about illegal activity, albeit in a calm and nonconfrontational voice.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Here, the officer (1) asked defendant, a passenger in a stopped vehicle, if he had any warrants; (2) requested defendant\u2019s identification; (3) wrote down defendant\u2019s name and date of birth; and (4) then immediately returned to his vehicle and ran a check to determine whether defendant was the subject of any warrants. At no point did the officer indicate that defendant was free to leave. Under those circumstances, which are materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Highley, </em>we conclude, as we did in <em>Radtke, </em>that a reasonable person would conclude that he or she was the subject of an investigation and not free to leave. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> As described below, 242 Or App at 391, the state does not dispute that the officer acted without reasonable suspicion or that defendant\u2019s consent to search was the unattenuated product of any unlawful seizure. Accordingly, the only issue in this case is whether defendant was unlawfully seized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> In particular, Cioeta asked defendant for his name and date of birth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\"> At no time during the encounter did Cioeta tell defendant that he was free to leave.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> Our reference to a <em>\u201cHolmes </em>type (b) stop\u201d derives from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 409-10, 813 P2d 28 (1991), in which the court held that a person is \u201cseized\u201d for purposes of Article I, section 9,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">\u201c(a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) whenever an individual believes that (a), above, has occurred and such belief is objectively reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\"> <em>Cf.
