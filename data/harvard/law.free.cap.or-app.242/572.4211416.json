J.</author>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Defendant appeals from his conviction for private indecency, ORS 163.467. Defendant exposed himself to the victim, who was in custody and awaiting trial as she sat in the hallway of the Washington County \u201cOld Jail\u201d facility. Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the victim had not been in a place where she had a \u201creasonable expectation of privacjf\u2019 within the meaning of ORS 163.467. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Defendant was convicted after a trial to the court. Accordingly, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact, drawing all reasonable inferences, could have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994). Defendant was being held in a holding cell in the Old Jail facility in Washington County. The Old Jail is so named because it was once the county jail, but is now primarily used as a holding facility for inmates being held while awaiting court proceedings or before being transported to the county jail. The facility primarily consists of a long hallway with doors leading to a number of holding cells and offices for court staff and county corrections officers. Along the walls of the hallway are rows of chairs that are used by people being temporarily held in the facility. Three of those chairs are reserved for female inmates; male inmates are generally lodged in the adjacent holding cells. In addition, individuals participating in the county\u2019s \u201cwork in lieu of jail\u201d program receive their assignments at one of the offices located off the hallway. The hallway is not open to the public, but it is open to judges, court staff, maintenance personnel, and, on occasion, tour groups escorted by county corrections personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Defendant was lodged in a holding cell located off the hallway of the facility. The cell had a barred window that allowed passersby to observe individuals inside the cell from roughly the waist up. The victim, who was awaiting a court proceeding in an unrelated criminal case, was seated in a chair across from the holding cell. From that chair she could see through the barred window into the cell and could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>observe defendant. The victim testified that she observed defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">\u201cstanding, like, pretty much in front of the bars, and he was touching himself. And then I reacted. And I think it was like \u2014 because I slightly looked and sat up, I looked toward the deputy\u2019s office, or where they sit at the desk, to my left. And [defendant] stopped and he started pacing around the cell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\u201cAnd then he waited, like, maybe two, three minutes and then he went to the far end wall, where I could see him. And he was just leaning up against the wall, like, you know, with his head back. And he pulled out his \u2014 his penis and was playing with it, and looking at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">\u201cAnd I kind of noticed from the side of my eye and I looked, and then I didn\u2019t react this time. I just kind of looked away and kept talking to the girl next to me. And then I got up real quick after he was just kept \u2014 continued doing it, and I got up and I told Officer Pope.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The victim testified that it appeared to her that defendant was masturbating. Pope, a county sheriffs deputy assigned to the Old Jail, testified that, after the victim reported defendant\u2019s conduct, he went to the holding cell and told defendant to \u201cknock that off.\u201d Defendant had his back turned to Pope, and he did not say anything in reply. Pope moved the victim to a bench away from the holding cell and arranged for defendant to be immediately transported to the county jail. Later, defendant was interviewed by police detectives and told them that \u201che receives sexual gratification from exposing himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Defendant was charged with a single count of private indecency under ORS 163.467. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of private indecency if the person exposes the genitals of the person with the intent of arousing the sexual desire of the person or another person and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">\u201c(a) The person is in a place where another person has a reasonable expectation of privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">\u201c(b) The person is in view of the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">\u201c(c) The exposure reasonably would be expected to alarm or annoy the other person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u201c(d) The person knows that the other person did not consent to the exposure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">\u201c(2) Private indecency is a Class A misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201c(3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a person who commits the act described in subsection (1) of this section if the person cohabits with and is involved in a sexually intimate relationship with the other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201c(4) For purposes of this section, \u2018place where another person has a reasonable expectation of privacy\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, residences, yards of residences, working areas and offices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">After the state rested at trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. Defendant argued that the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in ORS 163.467 imported the constitutional standards applicable to claims under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant argued that, because neither constitution affords incarcerated persons a \u201cright to privacy,\u201d the victim had not been in a place where she had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The trial court denied the motion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s actually a very creative argument. I \u2014 I do feel if we can refer to the Old Jail- \u2014 if we can refer to the location of the incident as the Old Jail * * *. [I]t\u2019s still used as a jail facility. It connect \u2014 it actually connects right up to the second floor, and that\u2019s where we bring inmates to and from the Old Courthouse. And \u2014 and of course, as testified, that\u2019s where we hold inmates to bring them over to trial. And we also do other things like work in lieu of jail there, and booking, and things like. But it\u2019s definitely a jail facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">\u201cNow the question is, what is a place that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy? And it\u2019s defined by statute for us. So, under ORS 163.467 the Legislature defined what that is, and they didn\u2019t limit to it, limit it to that, but they tried to \u2014 tried to give us an idea of what areas they were talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201cAnd you sort of have to take a \u2014 you kind of have to wonder, well, if a place is not open to the general public, then it must be a place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. And it would be hard to think of a place where \u2014 if it\u2019s not public, why would it not be private?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">\u201cAnd it\u2019s an interesting fact pattern that we now find ourselves in a situation where we have a jail facility, and the argument is, is that that\u2019s not a place that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cAs far as this particular location goes, I do believe it is a place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy because it is a lot like, or very similar to, or is \u2014 it\u2019s a working area. It\u2019s a * * * there\u2019s an office there. It fits the definition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Defendant was convicted by the court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In ORS 163.467(4), the legislature defined \u201cplace where another person has a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.467. Again, that subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cFor purposes of this section, \u2018place where another person has a reasonable expectation of privacy\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, residences, yards of residences, working areas and offices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Defendant does not assert that, if the statute provides inmates with a right of privacy that the constitutions do not, the statute is unconstitutional. Thus, whether defendant exposed himself to the victim in a place where she had \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d is a question of statutory interpretation, not constitutional construction. To discern the legislature\u2019s intent, we consider the statutory text, context, and any relevant legislative history. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">In this case, the state argues that the victim was in a \u201cworking area,\u201d which is a specifically protected area under ORS 163.467(4). Defendant disagrees. The legislature has not defined \u201cworking area,\u201d so we give the term its plain meaning. The dictionary definition of \u201carea\u201d includes, as pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201c4 a: a clear or open space within a building!.] * * * b : a definitely bounded part or section of a building set aside for a specific purpose &lt;the house has a large kitchen ~ &gt;[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>115 (unabridged ed 2002) (boldface in original). The dictionary definitions of \u201cworking,\u201d when used as an adjective, include: \u201cadequate to permit work to be done[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2635. The pertinent definition of \u201cwork\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201c1 : activity in which one exerts strength or faculties to do or perform * * * b : the labor, task, or duty that affords one his accustomed means of livelihood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 2634 (boldface in original). Thus, as applicable in this case, \u201cworking area\u201d means a clear or open space within a building, or a definitely bounded part or section of a building set aside for a specific purpose, that is adequate to permit a person to engage in activity in which the person exerts strength or faculties to accomplish the activity, or to engage in the labor, task, or duty that affords the person their livelihood.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Applying that definition to the evidence in the record in this case, the factfinder could have found that the hallway of the Old Jail facility is a \u201cworking area\u201d and thus a \u201cplace where another person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d Although not open to the public, the hallway is used by county corrections officers in the course of their duties and is open to court staff, judges, and maintenance personnel, as well as inmates in custody and individuals participating in the county work in lieu of jail program. The evidence showed that the hallway is both a \u201cclear and open space within a building,\u201d as well as a \u201cbounded part or section of a building\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that is set aside for use by various persons for \u201cwork.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\"> We have examined the legislative history offered by the parties and have conducted our own review and have found nothing that bears on the question of what constitutes a \u201cplace where another person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d The legislative history indicates that the legislature intended ORS 163.467 to fill a \u201cloophole or a void\u201d in the law where acts that would otherwise be punishable under the public indecency statute, ORS 163.465, could not be punished because they did not take place in or in view of a public place. By adding a provision for private indecency, such conduct would be criminalized. <em>See </em>Audio Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Criminal Law, HB 2612, May 12,1999, at 0:02.56 (statement of Rep Floyd Prozanski) http://www.leg.state.or.us/listn/ archive/archive.l999s/SJUD-199905121500.ram (accessed May 4, 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-5\"> As noted, defendant\u2019s sole argument is that the hallway of the Old Jail is not a place where the victim had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
