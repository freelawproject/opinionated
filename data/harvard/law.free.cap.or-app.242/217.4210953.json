J.</author>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Petitioner seeks review of an order of the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision in which the board concluded, after conducting a murder review hearing, that petitioner was not likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time. Petitioner argues that the board erred in refusing to allow him to cross-examine the district attorney who spoke at the hearing, and in failing to swear in the district attorney as a witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained below, petitioner\u2019s argument concerning the administration of oaths or affirmations is not preserved, and we do not consider it. As for his argument concerning cross-examination, for the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the board did not err, and affirm the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Petitioner was convicted of aggravated murder in 1983, for which he received a life sentence with a minimum term of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. ORS 163.105(2) (1981). Pursuant to ORS 163.105(3) (1981), petitioner requested a murder review hearing, at which the board was required to determine whether petitioner \u201cis likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time.\u201d If the board so finds, it is required \u201cto convert the terms of the prisoner\u2019s confinement to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole or work release\u201d pursuant to ORS 163.105(4) (1981). Subsection (3) further provides: \u201cThe proceeding shall be conducted in the manner prescribed for a contested case hearing under ORS 183.310 to 183.550,\u201d subject to certain exceptions not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Petitioner\u2019s murder review hearing was held on August 1, 2007. After petitioner presented evidence, the board permitted Mark Huddleston, the district attorney who had prosecuted petitioner for the aggravated murder, to speak. Huddleston began by noting that he had been called to the scene of the murder shortly after it had occurred. He described his view of petitioner\u2019s institutional disciplinary record, the psychological evaluations of petitioner, and petitioner\u2019s own testimony at the hearing, opining that petitioner had not met his burden of demonstrating that he could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>rehabilitated within a reasonable time. When Huddleston concluded his statements, petitioner asked if he could question Huddleston, and the board chair replied that he could not. Petitioner asked if Huddleston had been sworn in, and the chair replied that he had not, but added: \u201cWould you like me to swear him in?\u201d Petitioner did not respond to that question, but instead asserted that, if Huddleston was a witness, petitioner should be entitled to cross-examine him. The chair replied: \u201cHe\u2019s the District Attorney, and he gets to make a statement at this type of hearing.\u201d The board then allowed petitioner to make a rebuttal statement in response to Huddleston\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">After the hearing, the board concluded that petitioner was not likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time. Petitioner sought administrative review and raised the issues described above concerning Huddleston\u2019s statements. The board responded that ORS 144.120(7) authorized the procedure that it used to receive Huddleston\u2019s statements at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On judicial review, petitioner challenges the board\u2019s refusal to permit him to cross-examine Huddleston, and he also asserts that the board erred in failing to administer an oath or affirmation to Huddleston. We reject petitioner\u2019s argument concerning the oath or affirmation. As noted, when petitioner raised that issue to the board, the chair offered to administer an oath or affirmation to Huddleston, should petitioner wish him to do so. Petitioner did not request that such an oath or affirmation be administered. Thus, petitioner waived the right to assert the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We turn to petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning the board\u2019s refusal to permit him to cross-examine Huddleston. As noted, ORS 163.105(3) (1981), which governs murder review hearings, provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he proceeding shall be conducted in the manner prescribed for a contested case hearing under ORS 183.310 to 183.550.\u201d ORS 183.310 to 183.550, in turn, comprise the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). ORS 183.450(3), which pertains to evidence in contested cases, provides, in part, that \u201c[e]very party shall have the right of cross-examination of witnesses who testify.\u201d Petitioner acknowledges that ORS 183.450(3) does not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to orders concerning inmates \u201cconfined in a Department of Corrections facility.\u201d ORS 183.315(5)(a). Petitioner asserts, however, that even if the APA provision concerning cross-examination does not <em>directly </em>apply here, the board has, in effect, adopted that APA provision by a rule: OAR 255-032-0030.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That rule, which governs evidence in murder review hearings, provides: \u201cThe Board and the inmate will have the right of cross-examination of each witness that testifies, and will have the right to submit rebuttal evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The state responds that Huddleston was not a \u201cwitness\u201d and, thus, OAR 255-032-0030 does not apply to his statements. The state relies on OAR 255-032-0025, which governs the manner in which murder review hearings are conducted, and provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">\u201c(5) Pursuant to ORS 144.120, the district attorney from the committing jurisdiction has the right to appear at the hearing, or to submit a written statement concerning the crime and the inmate. The district attorney may be represented by a designee if he/she wishes. The district attorney\u2019s statement should be concluded within 15 minutes. The Board may allow the statement to exceed that period when additional time is needed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">ORS 144.120(7), in turn, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201cThe victim, personally or by counsel, and the district attorney from the committing jurisdiction shall have the right to appear at any hearing or, in their discretion, to submit a written statement adequately and reasonably expressing any views concerning the crime and the person responsible. The victim and the district attorney shall be given access to the information that the board or division will rely upon and shall be given adequate time to rebut the information. Both the victim and the district attorney may present information or evidence at any hearing, subject to such reasonable rules as may be imposed by the officers conducting the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">We interpret administrative rules \u201cunder the same analytical framework we apply when construing statutes.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Birmingham v. Department of Forestry, </em>209 Or App 736, 743-44, 149 P3d 600 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 644 (2007). In the present case, the board has construed its own rules, OAR 255-032-0025 and OAR 255-032-0030, to the effect that a district attorney who makes a \u201cstatement\u201d pursuant to OAR 255-032-0025(5) is not a \u201cwitness who testifies,\u201d as that phrase is used in the rule pertaining to cross-examination, OAR 255-032-0030(5). As explained below, we conclude that the texts of those rules, viewed in context, confirm the board\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The most pertinent context is found in other subsections of OAR 255-032-0025, which describes the manner in which the hearing shall be conducted. Thus, we reproduce subsection (5) in context with two other subsections of that rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201c(3) The initial testimony of each <em>witness </em>shall <em>not </em>exceed <em>ten minutes. </em>The presiding Board member may grant the witness additional time upon a finding that further testimony is likely to be relevant to the board\u2019s decision. The presiding Board member may exclude or limit irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious testimony and evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201c(4) Pursuant to ORS 144.120, the crime victims have the right to appear at the hearing, or to submit a written statement concerning the crime and the person responsible. For the purposes of these rules, victim means any person determined by the prosecuting attorney, the court, or the Board to have suffered direct financial, psychological, or physical harm as a result of a crime and, in the case of a victim who is a minor, the legal guardian of the minor. The victim may be represented by counsel or a designee of the victim\u2019s choice. If a <em>victim </em>chooses to speak, his/her <em>statement should be concluded within 15 minutes. </em>The Board may allow the victim to exceed that period when additional time is needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201c(5) Pursuant to ORS 144.120, the district attorney from the committing jurisdiction has the right to appear at the hearing, or to submit a written statement concerning the crime and the inmate. The district attorney may be represented by a designee if he/she wishes. The <em>district attorney\u2019s statement </em>should be concluded within <em>15 minutes. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Board may allow the statement to exceed that period when additional time is needed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">(Emphasis added.) As can be seen from those provisions, OAR 255-032-0025 distinguishes between \u201cwitnesses\u201d in subsection (3), who are generally permitted ten minutes of \u201ctestimony,\u201d and a \u201cvictim\u201d or \u201cdistrict attorney\u201d in subsections (4) and (5), each of whom are generally allowed 15 minutes to make their \u201cstatements.\u201d In short, OAR 255-032-0025 indicates that the board distinguishes between the testimony of witnesses and the statements of district attorneys or victims. Thus, it is logical to conclude that the reference to a \u201cwitness that testifies\u201d in OAR 255-032-0025 is intended to refer to a \u201cwitness\u201d as that term is used in OAR 255-032-0025(3), not to a \u201cdistrict attorney\u201d or \u201cvictim\u201d as those terms are used in OAR 255-032-0025(4) and (5). In sum, the wording of the board\u2019s rules is internally consistent, and supports the board\u2019s conclusion that petitioner was not entitled to cross-examine Huddleston regarding his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Because OAR 255-032-0025 implements ORS 144.120(7), however, we also are required to consider whether the board\u2019s denial of cross-examination in these circumstances was forbidden by that statute. We conclude that it was not. ORS 144.120(7) provides, in part, that victims and district attorneys \u201cmay present <em>information or evidence </em>at any hearing, subject to such reasonable rules as may be imposed by the officers conducting the hearing.\u201d ORS 144.120(7). (Emphasis added.) That statute, like OAR 255-032-0025, refers to two different things: information and evidence. The district attorney here provided information, in the form of opinions and recommendations, that were not in the nature of evidence such as would require him to be regarded as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Finally, we address petitioner\u2019s argument that the board\u2019s denial of cross-examination under these circumstances constituted an impermissible denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Petitioner relies on <em>United States v. Comito, </em>177 F3d 1166 (9th Cir 1999), and our decision in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>221 Or App 394, 190 P3d 455 (2008), in which we interpreted and applied <em>Comito. </em>Initially, we note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Comito </em>and <em>Johnson </em>related to revocation proceedings and were based on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 US 471, 92 S Ct 2593, 33 L Ed 2d 484 (1972). As the Oregon Supreme Court indicated in <em>Stogsdill v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 332, 154 P3d 91 (2007), due process pertaining to the deferral of a parole release date, unlike revocation of release, is not analyzed under <em>Morrissey, </em>but rather is subject to the more general three-part procedural due process test set out in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 96 S Ct 893, 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner does not argue that the process utilized by the board concerning statements by district attorneys at murder review hearings is unconstitutional under that test, and we decline to undertake such an analysis in the absence of an adequately developed argument by petitioner. Suffice it to say that petitioner has cited no authority, and we are aware of none, indicating that a process that permits a petitioner to adduce rebuttal after a district attorney\u2019s remarks, as does the process at issue here, is insufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> We reject without discussion petitioner\u2019s additional argument that the board erred in considering a psychological evaluation that petitioner asserts was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the issues at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\"> Because, as explained below, this case turns on whether Huddleston was a \u201cwitness,\u201d we need not decide whether ORS 183.450(3) could have some application in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\"> In <em>Mathews, </em>the court stated that the following three factors are pertinent to the procedural due process inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">424 US at 335.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
