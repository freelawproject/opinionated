J.</author>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Defendant was convicted on two counts of unlawful use of a weapon, ORS 166.220, two counts of recklessly endangering another person, ORS 163.195, and several other misdemeanor crimes. He argues on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on one of the reckless endangerment counts and that the court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence on one of the unlawful use of a weapon counts. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s argument concerning the motion for judgment of acquittal. However, we agree with defendant that the court erred in imposing the upward departure sentence. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Because defendant was convicted, we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Gibson, </em>338 Or 560, 562, 113 P3d 423, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 1044 (2005). In the early hours of the morning, defendant went to the house of his in-laws where his wife and children were staying, demanded entry, and threatened to kick in the door. Defendant\u2019s wife and father-in-law let him in, and he proceeded to argue with and yell at them. Defendant\u2019s wife observed that he was intoxicated. Defendant insisted on seeing his children, and he threatened to use pepper spray on his father-in-law if he was not allowed to see them. Defendant then used the pepper spray on his wife and father-in-law and went up the stairs to find the children. When defendant grabbed his five-year-old son, his mother-in-law fled into a bathroom with defendant\u2019s two-year-old son and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Defendant kicked in the door to a bedroom, and then, after determining that the younger child was in the bathroom, threatened to kick in that door as well. Defendant showed his wife and father-in-law his pocketknife and said that someone was going to get hurt. Defendant\u2019s father-in-law then asked his wife, defendant\u2019s mother-in-law, to open the bathroom door, which she did. At that point, defendant took the younger child from his mother-in-law. Defendant kicked a hole in a wall, pushed his wife ahead of him and carried the two children down the stairs, through the area where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>he had previously discharged pepper spray. Throughout the episode, defendant continued to yell at the other adults. At some point, he put down the two-year-old, and his wife picked up the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The police arrived and, because an officer could hear yelling and screaming inside the house, he entered with a stun gun drawn. When he saw the police, defendant grabbed his wife, who was still holding the younger child, and used her as a shield. Police officers then subdued defendant and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and he was convicted by the court. At sentencing, the state sought an upward departure sentence on defendant\u2019s conviction for unlawful use of the pocketknife against his father-in-law. As a ground for the departure sentence, the state relied on OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(E), which provides that \u201c[u]se of a weapon in the commission of the offense\u201d may provide a basis for an upward departure sentence. Defense counsel argued that the use of that departure factor was not appropriate for a conviction for unlawful use of a weapon, because OAR 213-008-0002(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201cIf a factual aspect of a crime is a statutory element of the crime or is used to subclassify the crime on the Crime Seriousness Scale, that aspect of the current crime of conviction may be used as an aggravating or mitigating factor only if the criminal conduct constituting that aspect of the current crime of conviction is significantly different from the usual criminal conduct captured by the aspect of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The trial court indicated that it generally agreed with defendant that aggravating factors should not be the same as elements of the crime, but added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201cI think the argument would have greater merit, but the fact is that there are other crimes, so the aggravating factor under use of a weapon isn\u2019t limited to just the offense that involves the weapon. I mean, the weapon was used in this incident and could be a factor of whether or not you were charged with Unlawful Use of a Weapon, so I do find there was use of a weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The trial court\u2019s statement might be understood to suggest that the questioned departure factor could be used to enhance sentences for crimes other than unlawful use of a weapon. That, however, is not what the court did. Rather, it imposed an upward departure sentence on an unlawful use of a weapon conviction, based on a finding of \u201c[u]se of a weapon in the commission of the offense.\u201d OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">ORS 166.220(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201cA person commits the crime of unlawful use of a weapon if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201c(a) Attempts to use unlawfully against another, or carries or possesses with intent to use unlawfully against another, any dangerous or deadly weapon as defined in ORS 161.015; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\u201c(b) Intentionally discharges a firearm, blowgun, bow and arrow, crossbow or explosive device within the city limits of any city or within residential areas within urban growth boundaries at or in the direction of any person, building, structure or vehicle within the range of the weapon without having legal authority for such discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">On the count at issue here, the indictment charged defendant with violating subsection (l)(a) in that he \u201cdid unlawfully attempt to use and possess with intent to use unlawfully against [his father-in-law], a knife, a dangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The state a1gues that proof that a person \u201cattempts to use\u201d or \u201ccarries or possesses with intent to use\u201d a weapon unlawfully suffices to establish unlawful use of a weapon under ORS 166.220(l)(a). It follows, the state reasons, that \u201cuse of a weapon\u201d under OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(E) is not equivalent to the statutory element \u201cunlawful use of a weapon\u201d under ORS 166.220. The state\u2019s argument assumes that the \u201cuse of a weapon\u201d departure factor necessarily requires more, or different, proof than does the crime embodied in ORS 166.220(l)(a). However, both the crime and the departure factor are phrased in the same terms, namely, \u201cuse of a weapon.\u201d There is no reason, based on its text or context, to conclude that the departure factor was meant to cover different conduct from what is necessary to constitute a violation of ORS 166.220(l)(a). In fact, in <em>State v. Nyquist, </em>226 Or App 245, 247, 203 P3d 240, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 213 (2009), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>held that, where a jury had found the defendant guilty of unlawful use of a weapon under ORS 166.220(l)(a), the trial court\u2019s reliance on \u201cuse of a weapon\u201d as a departure factor for the imposition of a sentence on another related crime was not a plain error that we would correct on appeal, because \u201cthere is no legitimate debate that the jury found <em>the same departure fact </em>relied on by the trial court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In sum, we do not agree with the state\u2019s implicit assumption that the \u201cuse of a weapon\u201d departure factor necessarily requires a different type or greater quantum of proof than is necessary to establish \u201cunlawful use of a weapon\u201d under ORS 166.220(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Thus, the decisive issue on appeal reduces to whether \u201cthe criminal conduct constituting that aspect of the current crime of conviction is significantly different from the usual criminal conduct captured by the aspect of the crime,\u201d OAR 213-008-0002(2), thus justifying the use as a departure factor of a factual aspect of a crime. The state argues that doing so was appropriate in this case, because it could have proved that defendant violated ORS 166.220(l)(a) merely by adducing evidence that defendant \u201carrived at his wife\u2019s parents\u2019 house armed with a knife,\u201d whereas, because he brandished the knife at his father-in-law, his conduct went beyond what was required for commission of the charged offense. Again, we disagree. On this record, we cannot conclude that the state could have proved the charged offense merely by establishing that defendant had arrived at the house with a pocketknife in his pocket.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As described above, the only evidence supporting the inference that defendant <em>intended </em>to unlawfully use the knife, which is an element of the charged offense, was the evidence that he brandished it and made a threat. We cannot say on such a record that defendant\u2019s conduct evincing the intent aspect of unlawful use of a weapon was so different from the usual criminal conduct captured by the intent aspect of the offense that it could support the imposition of a departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-6\"> In that respect, we note that defendant was acquitted of a charge of burglary based on an allegation that he entered his in-laws\u2019 house \u201cwith the intent to commit the crimes of * * * unlawful use of a weapon * * * and recklessly endangering another person therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
