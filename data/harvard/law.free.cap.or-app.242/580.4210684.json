J.</author>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Petitioner, State of Oregon through the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD), appeals the circuit court\u2019s judgment in a writ of review proceeding that affirmed respondent Crook County\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determination that respondent Shelley Hudspeth (Hudspeth) has a vested right to complete development of a 59-lot residential subdivision in compliance with county and state waivers issued pursuant to Ballot Measure 37 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, DLCD contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court misconstrued applicable law in sustaining the county\u2019s determination that Hudspeth has a vested right to complete that development because there was inadequate consideration of the expenditure ratio factor (viz., the ratio of expenditures to total project costs). In response, Hudspeth contends that, as to the merits, the circuit court properly determined that, under the circumstances of this case, she had a vested right but that, as a preliminary matter, the appeal must be dismissed because DLCD lacks standing to pursue it. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that (1) DLCD has standing to appeal; and (2) consistently with our decision in <em>Friends of Yamhill County v. Board of Commissioners, </em>237 Or App 149, 238 P3d 1016 (2010), <em>rev allowed, </em>349 Or 602 (2011), the circuit court should have remanded the decision to the county to determine the total project cost and to give proper weight to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>expenditure ratio in the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we deny the motion to dismiss and remand the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">For purposes of appeal, the following facts are undisputed. Measure 37 waivers from the county and the state allowed for the development of a 59-lot subdivision on Hudspeth\u2019s property. Hudspeth obtained tentative approval from the county for a subdivision<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and expended hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop the property before Measure 49 became effective on December 6, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Thereafter, Hudspeth applied for a determination from the county that she had a vested right to complete and continue the use described in the Measure 37 waivers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hudspeth\u2019s application indicated that the total project budget was $5,081,946. That figure, however, did <em>not </em>include the cost of residences that would ultimately be constructed in the subdivision. DLCD submitted written comments in response to Hudspeth\u2019s application that consisted of \u201cguidelines for applying vested right common law in the context of Measure 49\u201d that were developed by DLCD and the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>of Justice. According to DLCD, it offered the guidelines \u201cfor the county to consider in reviewing this application and requested] that it be included in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The county\u2019s planning director concluded that Hudspeth had a vested right to complete and continue the use described in the waivers. As pertinent to the issues on appeal, in considering the expenditure ratio factor, the county\u2019s planning director determined that Hudspeth \u201cha[d] spent over $500,000 in \u2018allowed expenditures\u2019 * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, the planning director determined that \u201cthe cost of individual residences shall not be included in the total project costs for completion for the subdivision and that those costs are relative to future land use approvals for site plan review and building permits.\u201d Accordingly, the director calculated the ratio of allowed expenditures <em>(i.e., </em>$502,300) to total project cost <em>(i.e., </em>$5,081,946) to be 9.88 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Pursuant to a county procedure, DLCD appealed the planning director\u2019s determination to the Crook County Court. As pertinent here, and as identified in its notice of appeal to the county court, DLCD\u2019s primary contention was that \u201c[t]he director should have included the cost of individual residences in total project costs for the use that applicant seeks to vest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In response, Hudspeth noted that \u201c[t]he ratio test is one factor of many to be considered in the vesting determination\u201d and that \u201cthe case law does not require that the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>cost of building the homes be considered in the ratio test,\u201d particularly where, as here, she \u201c[did] not intend to build homes, but rather intend[ed] to sell buildable lots.\u201d Alternatively, Hudspeth contends that, if the cost of the residences is included in the denominator of the expenditure ratio, any determination of that cost would be purely speculative. Nevertheless, Hudspeth asserts that \u201c[t]he cost of homes could be as low as $100,000 (double wide manufactured homes)\u201d and that, even assuming that the cost to complete each of the 59 residences was as much as $200,000, the resulting expenditure ratio demonstrated that \u201cthis development [had] vested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The county court affirmed the planning director\u2019s decision. Although the county court generally incorporated the planning director\u2019s findings and conclusions into its order, it specifically stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c[tjhe total cost of the project need not include the costs of the homes which is determined by this Court to be too speculative and there is no direct authority on point requiring this Court to include the costs of the homes for this project; however, the Court also finds that even with the cost of homes included in the calculation, with a minimum cost of $100,000 per dwelling, there is a sufficient substantial investment directly related to the establishment of the residential subdivision, which was made in good faith, to vest this development!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">DLCD sought review of the county court\u2019s order in the circuit court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As pertinent to the dispositive issue in this appeal, the circuit court issued a letter opinion in which it concluded that \u201ca specific determination of the denominator in the ratio of investment to total cost of development is not required in every case.\u201d Further, the court reasoned that, \u201c[e]ven if a specific ratio is required by Oregon law, which I believe it is not, the county alternatively found that, if the cost of homes is included in the calculation at $100,000 per dwelling[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] there was sufficient and substantial investment to vest the development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Consistently with its letter opinion, the court entered a judgment, sustaining the local government\u2019s determination that Hudspeth had a vested right to complete the development of her property and dismissing DLCD\u2019s writ of review. DLCD appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Thereafter, Hudspeth filed a motion to dismiss, contending that \u201cDLCD does not have statutory authority to appeal the Circuit Court\u2019s decision.\u201d In response, DLCD noted that the issue concerning its authority had not been raised below and appeared to question whether that issue was the proper subject of a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, invoking the then-extant 2009 version of ORS 197.090(2)(a), DCLD contended primarily that it had authority to participate in the proceedings in this case, which concerned a vested right that \u201c[arose] from a Measure 37 order issued by DLCD.\u201d That statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cSubject to local government requirements and the provisions of ORS 197.830 to 197.845, the director may participate in and seek review of a land use decision, expedited land division or limited land use decision involving the goals, acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulation or other matter within the statutory authority of the department or commission under ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197. The director shall report to the commission on each case in which the department participates and on the positions taken by the director in each case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In granting Hudspeth\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Appellate Commissioner reasoned, in part, that ORS 197.090(2)(a) (2009)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201c[was] susceptible to two different readings. It can be read to provide that DLCD may participate in and seek review of a land use decision, an expedited land division, or a limited land use decision, provided that it involves one or more of these matters: a statewide land use goal, an acknowledged comprehensive plan, a land use regulation, or any other matter within the statutory authority of DLCD or the [Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC)] under ORS chapters 195,196 and 197. Alternatively, it can be read to provide that DLCD may participate in and seek review of (1) a land use decision, an expedited land division, or a limited land use decision that involves statewide land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>use goals, an acknowledged comprehensive plan, or a land use regulation, or (2) any other matter within the statutory authority of DLCD or the Commission under ORS chapters 195,196 and 197.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u201cWhether a property owner may develop property in a manner that otherwise violates state land use laws on the basis of a claimed vested right in a Ballot Measure 37 waiver is a \u2018matter within the statutory authority of the department or Commission under ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197.\u2019 It follows that, if ORS 197.090(2)(a) has the second meaning described above, DLCD had standing to initiate the writ of review proceeding and to appeal from the circuit court\u2019s disposition of that matter. However, the court determines that the correct reading of the statute is the first alternative described above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Ultimately, the commissioner concluded that \u201cDLCD has authority to participate in and seek review of a matter if, at a minimum, the matter is a land use decision, an expedited land division, or a limited land use decision\u201d and that, because a vested rights determination is not one of those types of decisions, \u201cDLCD lack[ed] standing to appeal the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">DLCD petitioned for reconsideration of the commissioner\u2019s order. In response, this court\u2019s Motions Department issued an order allowing reconsideration, vacating the commissioner\u2019s order, and \u201cdefer[ring] a ruling on Hudspeth\u2019s motion to dismiss to the department that decides the appeal on its merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Thereafter, as the parties were in the process of completing their appellate briefs, the legislature amended ORS 197.090(2)(a), <em>see </em>Or Laws 2010, ch 8, \u00a7 8 (Spec Sess), in a manner that completely undercut the Appellate Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that DLCD had authority to participate in and seek review of only land use decisions, limited land use decisions, or expedited land divisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Signifi-cantly, one purpose of the amendment was to \u201c[c]larif[y]\u201d DLCD\u2019s \u201cstanding in litigation.\u201d Staff Measure Summary, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 1049, Feb 8, 2010.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Shortly after the amendment became effective, the parties completed their appellate briefs in which they addressed the effect of the amendment on the pending motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Because it implicates our jurisdiction, we begin by addressing Hudspeth\u2019s contention that DLCD lacks standing to appeal because a common-law vesting decision is not a \u201cmatter within the statutory authority of [DLCD] * * * under ORS chapter 195, 196, and 197\u201d as required by ORS 197.090(2)(a)(B). Specifically, Hudspeth contends that \u201c[t]here is no reference in either Measure 49 or ORS Chapter 195 which provides any statutory authority to [DLCD] or [LCDC] to review, issue decisions in, participate in, or appeal common law vesting decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Conversely, DLCD contends that the 2010 amendments to ORS 197.090(2)(a) demonstrate that it has standing to bring this appeal. Specifically, DLCD asserts that, pursuant to ORS 197.090(2)(a)(B), \u201c[i]mplementation of Measure 37 and Measure 49 unquestionably fall within [its] statutory authority * * * under ORS chapters 195 (where Measure 49 is codified), 196 and 197 (where Measure 37 is codified)[,]\u201d particularly where, as here, it was the entity that granted one of the waivers that is at the heart of the vesting determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">As we understand it, Hudspeth\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of standing is predicated on her contention that DLCD lacks statutory authority to participate in a proceeding concerning a vesting determination and to seek review of that determination. Even assuming that DLCD must have the requisite statutory authority in order to have standing to appeal,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> DLCD had such authority in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">As previously indicated, 242 Or App at 587-88, 588 n 10, the scope of DLCD\u2019s authority to participate in and seek review of various decisions and matters is governed by ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>197.090(2)(a) as amended by the legislature in 2010. That statute now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">\u201cSubject to local government requirements and the provisions of ORS 197.830 to 197.845, the director may participate in and seek review of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201c(A) A land use decision, expedited land division or limited land use decision involving the goals or involving an acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations implementing the plan; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u201c(B) Any other matter within the statutory authority of the department or commission under ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">By breaking the text of the statute into two distinct subparagraphs, the legislature has unambiguously expressed its intention that DLCD has authority to participate in and seek review of (1) particular decisions concerning land use, ORS 197.090(2)(a)(A), and (2) <em>\u201c[a]ny other matter </em>within the statutory authority\u2019 of DLCD or LCDC, ORS 197.090(2)(a)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">As the parties have correctly noted, this case does not involve a land use decision as contemplated in ORS 197.090(2)(a)(A).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 195.305(7) (\u201cA decision by a public entity that an owner qualifies for just compensation under * * * sections 5 to 11, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, * * * and a decision by a public entity on the nature and extent of that compensation are not land use decisions.\u201d). Accordingly, the issue reduces to whether this case involves \u201c[a]ny other matter within [DLCD\u2019s] statutory authority\u2019 pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ORS 197.090(2)(a)(B). Resolution of that issue, in turn, requires an understanding of DLCD\u2019s statutory authority concerning the Measure 37 waiver that it issued to Hudspeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Corey v. DLCD, </em>344 Or 457, 460, 184 P3d 1109 (2008), Measure 37</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u201crequired public entities that enact and enforce land use regulations to pay a landowner whose property is affected by any such regulations \u2018just compensation,\u2019 which the statute generally defined as an amount equal to the \u2018reduction in the fair market value of the affected property interest\u2019 resulting from enforcement of any land use regulation enacted after the date of acquisition of the property by the landowner or a family member of the landowner. <em>[Former] </em>ORS 197.352(1) - (3) * * *. The provision authorized affected landowners to make a \u2018written demand for compensation\u2019 to the regulating entity, <em>[former] </em>ORS 197.352(5)[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Alternatively, the public entity had the option of waiving the applicable land use regulations instead of paying compensation. <em>Former </em>ORS 197.352(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">As specifically noted in DCLD\u2019s Measure 37 waiver in this case, under the then applicable administrative rules, Hudspeth\u2019s claim was referred to DLCD \u201cas the regulating entity.\u201d Pursuant to OAR 125-145-0020(12) (Mar 13, 2006),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a \u201cregulating entity\u201d is \u201can Agency that has enacted or enforced, or has authority to remove, modify or not to apply, the Land Use Regulation(s) identified in the Claim.\u201d Ultimately, according to its terms, \u201cthe Director of the DLCD [issued the waiver] as a final order of DLCD and [LCDC] under ORS 197.352, OAR 660-002-0010(8), and OAR 125, division 145[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Accordingly, DLCD\u2019s Measure 37 waiver \u2014 one of the waivers that is at the heart of the vesting proceeding in this case \u2014 was clearly a matter within its statutory authority. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>follows that, because that waiver was a \u201cmatter within [DLCD\u2019s] statutory authority,\u201d DLCD may \u201cparticipate in and seek review of\u2019 proceedings concerning that waiver, including a proceeding to determine whether Hudspeth had a vested right to complete and continue the use described therein. ORS 197.090(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">As previously noted, DLCD did participate in the local proceedings. 242 Or App at 584. Specifically, it submitted comments before the planning director and appealed his decision to the county court according to local procedure. That participation gave DLCD standing, pursuant to ORS 195.318, to seek review of the county court\u2019s order in the circuit court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Once the circuit court entered its judgment in the writ of review proceeding, DLCD had standing to appeal to this court. <em>See </em>ORS 34.100 (providing, in part, that, \u201c[f]rom the judgment of the circuit court on review, an appeal may be taken in like manner and with like effect as from a judgment of a circuit court in an action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In sum, DLCD had authority to participate in and seek review of the proceeding concerning its Measure 37 waiver and, in light of its participation, had standing to ultimately appeal the circuit court\u2019s judgment to this court. Accordingly, we deny Hudspeth\u2019s motion to dismiss and proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In that regard, DLCD contends that the circuit court erred in sustaining the county court\u2019s determination that Hudspeth has a vested right to complete the residential development. In support of that contention, DLCD reiterates that the circuit court erred in concluding that \u201cthe county was not required to take into account the cost of building houses\u201d when it determined the denominator of the expenditure ratio. Further and relatedly, DLCD contends that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>calculating the denominator, the cost of completion of a residence must be established in the record and cannot be assumed as occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Conversely, Hudspeth contends that the cost of residences need not be included in the denominator of the expenditure ratio. Alternatively, she acknowledges that \u201cthere is no precise number for the cost of homes\u201d in this case, but contends, nevertheless, that she has made a substantial investment even if \u201can assumed cost of $200,000 [per residence] was used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We have previously addressed contentions identical or closely similar to those of the parties in this case. In <em>Biggerstaff v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>240 Or App 46, 54, 245 P3d 688 (2010), we summarized the pertinent governing principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201cIn <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>we reasoned that, in determining whether a vested right exists in this context, consideration of the expenditure ratio is \u2018necessary.\u2019 237 Or App at 178. More recently, in <em>Kleikamp v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>240 Or App 57, 65-66, [246] P3d [56] (2010), we reiterated the fundamental underpinnings of our directive in <em>Friends of Yamhill County. </em>More specifically, we noted that, in all but the most exceptional case, \u2018a landowner\u2019s proof of \u201csubstantial expenditures\u201d is the <em>sine qua non </em>of a vesting determination\u2019 and that, \u2018[flor vesting purposes, we understand that the concept of \u201csubstantial expenditures\u201d * * * requires an examination of both the absolute amount expended and the percentage yielded by the expenditure ratio.\u2019 <em>Kleikamp, </em>240 Or App at 66.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cConsideration of the expenditure ratio requires, in turn, that a landowner demonstrate the total project cost\u2014 that is, \u2018the <em>likely costs </em>of completing the particular development sought to be vested <em>based on construction costs as of December 6, 2007.\u2019 Friends of Yamhill County, </em>237 Or App at 178 (emphasis added). Significantly, in <em>Kleikamp, </em>[240 Or App at 66-67,] we also explained that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201c \u2018a cogent assessment of total project cost (and, concomitantly, the expenditure ratio) will, in turn, require particular identification of the development that the property owner sought to vest as of December 6, 2007. * * * Thus, it is incumbent on the property owner to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the likely total project cost in relation to the size and character of the structures that the owner contemplated building in compliance with a Measure 37 waiver as of December 6, 2007.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">(Third brackets and omissions in <em>Biggerstaff.) See also Davis v. Jefferson County, </em>239 Or App 564, 573-74, 245 P3d 665 (2010) (concluding that \u201cthe reviewing court erred in affirming the county\u2019s decision when the county did not consider the extent of the actual project costs, including the costs of home construction, in making the vested right determination\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 575 (reasoning that \u201c[t]he county\u2019s alternative finding that the project investment was still substantial, even assuming that homes were to be included in the total cost of the project, is speculative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Consistently with those principles, we conclude, as we did in <em>Friends of Yamhill County, Biggerstaff, </em>and <em>Kleikamp, </em>that the circuit court \u201cshould have remanded for the county to determine the extent and general cost of the project to be vested and to give proper weight to the expenditure ratio factor in the totality of the circumstances. <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>237 Or App at 178.

Measure 37 essentially provided that public entities that enacted or enforced land use regulations that adversely affected the fair market value of a claimant\u2019s property either had to pay just compensation or waive the offending regulations. Measure 37, however, was controversial. The potential disruptive effect of Measure 37 development, together with a lack of clarity in Measure 37\u2019s provisions, led to calls for a revision of the measure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u201cUltimately, the 2007 Legislative Assembly referred to the voters a substitute statute, Ballot Measure 49, that narrowed the effect of Measure 37, including a reduction in the degree of residential development allowed under a requested Measure 37 waiver.
