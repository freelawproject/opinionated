The board held that the notice of closure was premature, because there was insufficient information at the time of closure from which to determine impairment and disability with respect to claimant\u2019s compensable shoulder condition. Claimant contends that the notice of closure was not premature, because the evidence available to the ARU was sufficient to allow a determination of claimant\u2019s level of impairment and disability. This case involves a question of statutory interpretation, specifically, whether ORS 656.268(l)(a) requires that information sufficient to close a claim must be present at the time of closure or whether the information may be provided at the time of reconsideration of the notice of closure. We hold that the board did not err in concluding that the information must exist at the time of the notice of closure and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The facts are undisputed. In September 2005, claimant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for a left arm condition caused by lifting boxes and pallets at work. In October 2005, SAIF accepted a claim for a shoulder condition, \u201cleft shoulder subacromial bursitis,\u201d with a date of injury of August 8, 2005. In February 2006, SAIF modified its acceptance to include \u201cleft lateral epicondylitis,\u201d a condition of the elbow. Thus, claimant has two accepted conditions, for the left shoulder and the left elbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In April 2007, claimant submitted to a physical capacities evaluation with respect to her elbow. The evaluation revealed that claimant had diminished grip strength on the left, limitations with reaching forward, and an inability to engage in repetitive activity or to reach overhead. The physical therapist found similar limitations on the right side. In the \u201cconclusions\u201d section of the report, the physical therapist stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201cLimitations in functional capacity for return to work regarding her elbow injury would include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201c1. Ongoing left elbow pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\u201c2. Decreased strength at the left elbow musculature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201c3. Limited ability to lift and carry moderate to heavy loads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\"><em>\u201c4. </em>Inability to use the left upper extremity for repetitive activity and reaching overhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201c5. Limited ability to push/pull with left arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201c[Claimant\u2019s] ability to perform physical activities would place her in the sedentary to light range for activities up to shoulder level and in the sedentary range for activities above the shoulder level or at arm\u2019s reach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">On May 22, 2007, Dr. Sedgewick, claimant\u2019s attending physician, performed a closing examination for the elbow condition. Sedgewick found claimant\u2019s elbow to be medically stationary. He agreed with the findings of the physical capacities evaluation that claimant had \u201cdiminishment in function on a repetitive basis and problems with weights greater than 10 pounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">On May 24, 2007, SAIF sent Sedgewick a letter asking Sedgewick to concur with the permanent findings and work capacities described in the physical capacity evaluation, or \u201cprovide your own closing exam with impairment findings due to the accepted left shoulder subacromial bursitis and left lateral epicondylitis.\u201d Sedgewick checked boxes indicating that he concurred in the findings outlined in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">On June 7, 2007, SAIF issued a notice of closure determining that claimant became medically stationary on May 22, 2007, and awarding permanent partial disability benefits, including 16 percent loss of the whole person for left arm impairment, as well as a work disability benefit. Claimant requested reconsideration of the notice of closure by the ARU, asserting that the claim had been prematurely closed because neither the closing examination nor the physical capacity evaluation provided ranges of motion for the shoulder and because she was entitled to additional benefits for permanent partial disability. Claimant also checked a box on the reconsideration request form indicating that she believed \u201cthe information used to determine permanent disability was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>incorrect, incomplete, or unclear\u201d and that additional information was being sought from the attending physician, pursuant to ORS 656.268(6)(a)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On August 7, 2007, Sedgewick concluded that claimant\u2019s shoulder condition was medically stationary and that claimant\u2019s limitations on reaching and working above shoulder level were due to the accepted shoulder condition. Sedgewick stated that the limitations described in the May 22, 2007, physical capacities evaluation applied to both the elbow and the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On August 13, 2007, claimant filed an amended request for reconsideration of the notice of closure, withdrawing her contention that she was not medically stationary on the date of closure and that the claim had been prematurely closed. She also withdrew her challenge to the impairment findings used to determine her permanent partial disability. She asserted that she should be awarded additional permanent partial disability based on chronic conditions that significantly limited the repetitive use of her left arm and left shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On August 23, 2007, the ARU issued an order on reconsideration rescinding the notice of closure as premature. The order concluded that, at the time of closure, there was no evidence that claimant\u2019s accepted left shoulder condition was medically stationary and the insurer had insufficient information from which to determine permanent disability. Claimant requested that the department abate and reconsider the order on reconsideration and subsequently filed a request for hearing challenging the order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Claimant argued at the hearing that Sedgewick\u2019s finding on August 7, 2007, that claimant\u2019s left shoulder was medically stationary must relate back to Sedgewick\u2019s last examination of claimant on May 22, 2007, pursuant to OAR 436-035-0035(4). Claimant further argued that on reconsideration of a notice of closure, the ARU must consider evidence available after claim closure as to both claimant\u2019s medically stationary status <em>and </em>as to the sufficiency of information concerning her level of impairment to determine whether the claim was prematurely closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The ALJ agreed with claimant with respect to claimant\u2019s medically stationary status. Citing <em>Schuening v. J. R. Simplot &amp; Company, </em>84 Or App 622, 625, 735 P2d 1, <em>rev den, </em>303 Or 590 (1987), the ALJ concluded that evidence that was not available at the time of closure could be considered in determining whether the accepted conditions were medically stationary at the time of closure. The ALJ concluded that the medical information available at the time of reconsideration established that both of claimant\u2019s accepted conditions were medically stationary before SAIF closed the claim on June 7, 2007. The ALJ explained that Sedgewick\u2019s August 7, 2007, finding that claimant\u2019s left shoulder condition was medically stationary related back to Sedgewick\u2019s last examination of claimant on May 22, 2007, pursuant to the relevant department administrative rule. <em>See </em>OAR 436-035-0035(4) (\u201cThe date of examination, not the date of the report, controls the medically stationary date.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">However, the ALJ disagreed with claimant with respect to the necessary informational foundation for rating claimant\u2019s impairment. The ALJ noted that ORS 656.268(l)(a) requires claim closure when \u201c[t]he worker has become medically stationary and there is <em>sufficient information </em>to determine permanent disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A department administrative rule, OAR 436-030-0020(2), defines what constitutes \u201csufficient information\u201d to determine permanent impairment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ determined that, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the time of closure, SAIF did not have before it \u201csufficient information\u201d as defined in the administrative rule to determine impairment for claimant\u2019s left shoulder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Citing ORS 656.268(1)(a), OAR 436-030-0020(2), and the board\u2019s order in <em>Judith Brown, </em>56 Van Natta 2213, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>56 Van Natta 2628 (2004), the ALJ further explained that the evidence that constitutes \u201csufficient information\u201d must exist in the record at the time of claim closure, and that Sedgewick\u2019s August 7, 2007, report, therefore, did not establish that the information necessary to determine claimant\u2019s permanent disability was available on the date of closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">On claimant\u2019s appeal, the board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order. The board explained, also relying on its order in <em>Brown, </em>that a post-closure report cannot satisfy the requirement of \u201csufficient information\u201d for purposes of claim closure. It is not enough, the board explained, that the information existed at the time of reconsideration. Under ORS 656.268(l)(a), as interpreted by the board in <em>Brown, </em>the information must have existed at the time of claim closure. The board concluded that \u201cthe appropriate time for determining whether sufficient information exists to close a claim is when the claim is closed, not during the reconsideration proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On judicial review, claimant acknowledges that she did not obtain measurements or findings for determining impairment for her shoulder before claim closure, but continues to assert that the department should not have rescinded its notice of closure. She contends that ORS 656.268(l)(a) and its context, specifically ORS 656.268(6)(a)(B), ORS 656.268(6)(b), and ORS 656.268(7)(b), show that the legislature contemplated that information about a claimant\u2019s level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>of impairment submitted to the ARU during the reconsideration process may be used to determine whether a claim was prematurely closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In relevant part, ORS 656.268 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\u201c(1) * * * The insurer or self-insured employer shall close the worker\u2019s claim, as prescribed by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and determine the extent of the worker\u2019s permanent disability * * * when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201c(a) The worker has become medically stationary and there is sufficient information to determine permanent disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u00ab(5) * Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201c(e) If, upon reconsideration of a claim closed by an insurer or self-insured employer, the director orders an increase by 25 percent or more of the amount of compensation to be paid to the worker for permanent disability and the worker is found upon reconsideration to be at least 20 percent permanently disabled, a penalty shall be assessed against the insurer or self-insured employer and paid to the worker in an amount equal to 25 percent of all compensation determined to be then due the claimant. <em>If the increase in compensation results from information that the insurer or self-insured employer demonstrates the insurer or self-insured employer could not reasonably have known at the time of claim closure, from new information obtained through a medical arbiter examination or from a determination order issued by the director that addresses the extent of the worker\u2019s permanent disability that is not based on the standards adopted pursuant to ORS 656.726(4)(f), the penalty shall not be assessed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\u201c(6)(a) * * * At the reconsideration proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">\u201c(A) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">\u201c(B) Pursuant to rules adopted by the director, <em>the worker or the insurer or self-insured employer may correct information in the record that is erroneous and may submit any medical evidence that should have been but was not submitted by the attending physician or nurse practitioner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>authorized to provide compensable medical services under ORS 656.245 at the time of claim closure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">\u201c(C) If the director determines that a claim was not closed in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, the director may rescind the closure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201c(b) If necessary, <em>the director may require additional medical or other information with respect to the claims </em>and may postpone the reconsideration for not more than 60 additional calendar days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201c(7)(a) ***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\u201c(b) If neither party requests a medical arbiter and the director determines that <em>insufficient medical information is available to determine disability, the director may refer the claim to a medical arbiter appointed by the director.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">(Emphasis added.) In claimant\u2019s view, the quoted subsections, the italicized portions in particular, show that the legislature sought to avoid the reopening of closed claims and contemplated that the determination of whether a claim was prematurely closed could be made based on evidence before the ARU in the reconsideration proceeding, including additional evidence allowed and submitted during the reconsideration proceeding pursuant to ORS 656.268. Therefore, claimant concludes, the body of information sufficient to determine permanent disability and that gives rise to an obligation to close a claim under ORS 656.268(l)(a) may be supplied during the reconsideration proceeding. The resolution of that question is a matter of statutory construction, to which we apply the familiar methodology of <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), as amplified in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">In our view, by stating that a claim shall be closed <em>\u201cwhen </em>* * * [t]he worker has become medically stationary and <em>there is </em>sufficient information to determine permanent disability,\u201d (emphasis added), ORS 656.268(l)(a) unambiguously requires that the \u201csufficient information\u201d necessary to close the claim be present at the time of the insurer\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>closure. That reading of the text of ORS 656.268(l)(a) is supported by viewing that subsection within the context of the statute as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The statute provides for claim closure on grounds other than those stated in ORS 656.268(1)(a). <em>See </em>ORS 656.268(l)(b) - (d). It also provides a process for requesting claim closure and contesting the failure of an insurer to close a claim. <em>See </em>ORS 656.268(5)(b), (d). A claim closure may give rise to numerous issues that may be contested by the parties under ORS 656.268. In particular, if a notice of closure is based on ORS 656.268(l)(a), as in this case, the claimant may object that the claim was closed prematurely, or the claimant may object to the rating of disability, or both. An insurer or self-insured employer may object to the findings used to rate impairment in the notice of closure. ORS 656.268(5)(c). To make any objection, a claimant, insurer, or self-insured employer must request reconsideration by the department. ORS 656.268(5)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">As claimant notes, the reconsideration process allows for correction and supplementation of the information used to close the claim. <em>See </em>ORS 656.268(6)(a)(B) (insurer or claimant may correct record or submit medical evidence that should have been submitted at time of claim closure); ORS 656.268(6)(b) (department director may require additional information); ORS 656.268(7)(b) (director may refer claim to medical arbiter even if no party objects to determination of disability). But the problem with claimant\u2019s reliance on those provisions is that she assumes that because in some circumstances the statute permits consideration of evidence adduced during the reconsideration proceeding to determine certain issues, the legislature intended to allow the use of any such evidence to determine all issues that may be associated with claim closure under ORS 656.268.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">As noted, in affirming the ALJ, the board relied in part on its order in <em>Brown. </em>The board in <em>Brown </em>had ruled that the department could not consider supplemental evidence from a medical arbiter on the issue of sufficiency of information at the time of claim closure. The board in that case had explained that to do so would make little sense when, under ORS 656.268(7), a medical arbiter is always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>appointed <em>after </em>a claim closure, when a concern is raised with the impairment findings used in the notice of closure. <em>Brown, </em>56 Van Natta at 2629. As the board concluded in <em>Brown, </em>the structure of the reconsideration proceeding provided for in the statute, coupled with the plain language of ORS 656.268(l)(a), indicates that the legislature did not intend that in every reconsideration of a claim closure, any new information available at the time must be considered, no matter what the contested issue may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Information provided on reconsideration pursuant to those provisions claimant relies on in ORS 656.268 might indeed indicate that the claimant\u2019s disability was not properly rated in the notice of closure, or that the claimant was not medically stationary at the time of closure. However, the addition of further medical opinions or reports prepared regarding the claimant\u2019s impairment after the claim closure, as in the present case, does not inform the determination of whether, at the time of closure, the insurer actually had \u201csufficient information\u201d with which to establish the claimant\u2019s impairment and therefore obligate it to close the claim. Whether a claim was properly closed must be based on the body of information actually available at the time of closure, because, pursuant to ORS 656.268(l)(a), the claim may be closed only when \u201cthere is\u201d (as opposed to could have been) sufficient information for the insurer to close that claim. Thus, we reject claimant\u2019s contention that the measurement of whether \u201csufficient information\u201d existed to determine permanent impairment and to close a claim may be based on additional information provided during the reconsideration proceeding, if sufficient information did not exist when the claim was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">As noted, the department has set forth in OAR 436-030-0020(2) what constitutes \u201csufficient information\u201d to close a claim. The board\u2019s finding that the evidence in existence at the time of closure was not sufficient to close the claim is supported by substantial evidence, and we therefore affirm the board\u2019s determination that the claim was prematurely closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\"> OAR 436-030-0020(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cFor purposes of determining the extent of disability, \u2018sufficient information\u2019 requires the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201c(a) An authorized nurse practitioner\u2019s or attending physician\u2019s written statement that clearly indicates there is no permanent impairment, residuals, or limitations attributable to the accepted condition(s), and there is no reasonable expectation, based on evidence in the record, of loss of use or function, changes in the worker\u2019s physical abilities, or permanent impairment attributable to the accepted condition(s).

That is so, the ALJ explained, because Sedgewick had not clearly stated in writing that there was no impairment, residual, or limitation attributable to the shoulder condition, OAR 436-030-0020(2)(a), or had not described \u201cin detail all measurements and findings regarding any permanent impairment, residuals, or limitations attributable to the accepted condition(s) under OAR 436-010-0280 and 436-035.\u201d OAR 436-030-0020(2)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
