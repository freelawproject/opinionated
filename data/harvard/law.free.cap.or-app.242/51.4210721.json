ORS 33.065; ORS 124.005 -124.040. She asserts that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the return of service of the restraining order, in violation of her right of confrontation under the Oregon and federal constitutions. Defendant\u2019s challenge under the Oregon Constitution was not preserved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addressing her challenge under the federal constitution, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">At the contempt trial, the state sought to establish defendant\u2019s knowledge of the restraining order by offering an unsworn return of service,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which a deputy sheriff stated that he had served defendant with the restraining order on June 18, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant objected based on hearsay and denial of her right of confrontation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> arguing that the return of service was testimonial evidence and that its admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>would violate her right to confront the witness against her\u2014 the deputy sheriff \u2014 under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court overruled the objection and admitted the return of service. The court then concluded that defendant had willfully violated the restraining order and entered a judgment imposing punitive sanctions against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">On appeal, defendant renews her argument that admitting the return of service as evidence that she knew of the restraining order was a violation of her Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of out-of-court statements that are testimonial in nature, unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54. The state does not contend that the deputy sheriff was unavailable or that defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him, so the only question is whether the deputy\u2019s unsworn statement contained in the return of service was testimonial. The state argues that it was not testimonial because (1) it was not an affidavit generated in response to a law enforcement or other prosecutorial request, and (2) it falls under a historical hearsay exception for public records, which, the state argues, are nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court described a testimonial statement as one made by an \u201caccuser\u201d that can be characterized as \u201ca solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51 (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 US _ , _ , _ , 129 S Ct 2527, 2531-32, 2538-40, 174 L Ed 2d 314 (2009), the Court applied <em>Crawford </em>to documents, holding that the sworn certificates prepared to show the results of forensic analysis of seized substances in that case were testimonial statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In so holding, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>rejected an argument that all evidence falling within the well-established hearsay exception for business records at common law is admissible absent confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at _ , 129 S Ct at 2538. Business and public records generally do not raise confrontation concerns, the Court reasoned, \u201cnot because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial \u2014 they are not testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _ , 129 S Ct at 2539-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The Court in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>went on to explain that the forensic certificates were made for the purpose of proving a fact at trial: (1) they were sworn affidavits, thus constituting formalized materials that contained \u201cthe precise testimony the analysts would be expected to provide if called at trial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at _ , 129 S Ct at 2532; (2) they were prepared in response to an investigative law enforcement request, <em>id. </em>at _ , 129 S Ct at 2535; and (3) under the relevant Massachusetts statute requiring production of the forensic certificates, the <em>\u201csole purpose\u201d </em>of creating the certificates was to provide <em>prima facie </em>evidence in a criminal proceeding, <em>id. </em>at _ , 129 S Ct at 2532 (emphasis in original). Based on those factors, the Court concluded that the forensic certificates in that case were documents created specifically for the purpose of being used by the prosecution at trial. Therefore, unlike other business and public records created for an administrative purpose, they constituted testimonial statements subject to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Although <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>rejected the argument that the state makes here \u2014 that all documents falling within the historical hearsay exception are admissible without confrontation \u2014 in this case, the return of service is readily distinguishable from the forensic certificates held to be testimonial in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>It was not made under oath and did not include any sworn testimony; thus it was not an affidavit. Nor was it prepared in response to a request made by law enforcement during the course of an investigation. In fact, the violation of the restraining order did not occur until well <em>after </em>the return of service was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Further, unlike in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the statutes that required production of the return of service in this case, ORS 124.020(7)(b) and ORS 124.030(1), demonstrate that the statement contained in the return of service was made for the purpose of \u201cadministration of an entity\u2019s affairs.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 US at _ , 129 S Ct at 2539. Under ORS 124.020(7)(b), the county sheriff or another peace officer \u2014 in this case a deputy sheriff \u2014 has a legal duty to personally serve a restraining order and to make proof of that service.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the person against whom the restraining order issues receives notice of its issuance, ORS 124.030(1), in turn, authorizes entry of the restraining order into the Law Enforcement Data System, which informs law enforcement agencies of the existence of the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In construing proof of service provisions identical to those in ORS 124.020(7)(b) and ORS 124.030(1), we have held that service of a restraining order and making proof of that service constitutes the completion of \u201croutine, nonadver-sarial matters\u201d by a police officer. <em>Frady v. Frady, </em>185 Or App 245, 250, 58 P3d 849 (2002).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, the return of service was issued in accordance with those same routine, nonadversar-ial tasks: serving the restraining order and making proof of that service, and triggering notification to law enforcement agencies that a restraining order has been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Michigan v. </em>Bryant, _ US _ , 131 S Ct 1143, _ L Ed 2d _ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(2011), is instructive. In <em>Bryant, </em>the Court held that a statement made in response to interrogation is subject to confrontation if, after an objective evaluation of the circumstances at the time the statement was made, it is found that the primary purpose of the statement was to create \u201can out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _ , 131 S Ct at 1155.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the Court in <em>Bryant </em>did not specifically address whether the confrontation inquiry for <em>interrogations </em>applies equally to <em>documents, </em>an objective evaluation of the circumstances in this case also leads us to conclude that the proof of service was not testimonial. Under the provisions of ORS 124.020(7)(b) and ORS 124.030(1), the primary purpose of making the statement contained in the proof of service was administrative. The record is devoid of additional circumstances that would suggest any reason for making the statement other than carrying out statutory duties. Thus, application of <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>objective test supports our reasoning under <em>Melendez-Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the return of service is testimonial because it falls within one of the \u201cvarious formulations\u201d of the core class of testimonial statements identified in <em>Crawford, </em>in particular, those statements \u201cmade under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d 541 US at 51-52. <em>Crawford </em>did not rely on that formulation in holding the statement in that case to be testimonial. In fact, <em>Crawford </em>expressly left \u201cfor another day\u201d the task of defining \u201ctestimonial\u201d beyond applying to, at a minimum, \u201cprior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d 541 US at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>In <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>moreover, while referencing the above quoted \u201cobjective witness\u201d formulation, the Court repeatedly emphasized that it was the <em>purpose for the creation </em>of the forensic certificates that ultimately rendered them testimonial. <em>See </em>557 US at _ , 129 S Ct at 2532 <em>(\u201csole purpose </em>of the affidavits was to provide \u2018prima facie evidence\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>id. </em>at _ , 129 S Ct at 2539 (certificates\u2019 sole purpose was to provide evidence against the defendant); <em>id. </em>at _ , 129 S Ct at 2540 (certificates were \u201cprepared specifically for use at petitioner\u2019s trial\u201d). <em>Bryant </em>similarly focused on the objective purpose of the statement at the time it was made, not that statement\u2019s possible availability for use at a later trial. Bryant, _ US at _ , 131 S Ct at 1155 (\u201cwhen a statement is not <em>procured </em>with a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony\u201d it is not testimonial (emphasis added)). Because the Court has not held, nor otherwise indicated, that a document created for an administrative purpose could later be rendered testimonial simply by the possibility that it may be used in a later criminal prosecution, we likewise refrain from doing so in this case. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Acosta, </em>607 F3d 1156, 1163-64 (9th Cir 2010), <em>cert </em>den, _ US _ , 131 S Ct 946 (2011) <em>(\u201cMelendez-Diaz </em>cannot be read to establish that the mere possibility that * * * any business or public record * * * could be used in a later criminal prosecution renders it testimonial under <em>Crawford.\u201d); United States v. Mendez, </em>514 F3d 1035, 1046 (10th Cir), <em>cert den, </em>553 US 1044 (2008) (similar). Our recent decisions are consistent with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">In <em>State v. Bergin, </em>231 Or App 36, 41, 217 P3d 1087 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 280 (2010), we held that unsworn Intoxilyzer certificates are not testimonial, distinguishing them from the forensic certificates in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>by noting that Intoxilyzer certificates are not affidavits, are not used to directly prove an element of a crime, and, most importantly, are not created for a specific prosecutorial purpose but rather are only kept for <em>possible </em>use at trial. In <em>State v. Carter, </em>238 Or App 417, 425, 241 P3d 1205 (2010), we held that an arrest warrant was not testimonial because it was a business record created for the purpose of causing the defendant to appear in court and not for the purpose of proving a fact at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In both <em>Bergin </em>and <em>Carter, </em>as in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the dispositive consideration was whether the documents were <em>created </em>for a prosecutorial purpose, not whether they had some future potential to be used in that manner if the need arose. <em>Cf. State v. Alvarez-Amador, </em>235 Or App 402, 410-11, 232 P3d 989 (2010) (Social Security Administration representative\u2019s certification that particular Social Security numbers did not belong to the defendant was testimonial, because certification was prepared in response to a police officer\u2019s request to furnish evidence against the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">In sum, the return of service was not testimonial, and its admission did not violate defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-6\"> Defendant\u2019s confrontation argument at trial focused only on the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution. We reach the conclusion that defendant\u2019s state constitutional argument was unpreserved pursuant to our \u201cprudential obligation to determine <em>sua sponte </em>whether a contention has been preserved for appellate review.\u201d <em>State v. Tanner, </em>236 Or App 423, 428, 236 P3d 775 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although there is no request for plain error review, we note that a finding of plain error in this case \u2014 which was submitted on the briefs\u2014 would be foreclosed by defendant\u2019s concession, on appeal, that the return of service was properly admitted as a public record under OEC 803(8)(b). <em>See State v. William, </em>199 Or App 191, 197, 110 P3d 1114, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 406 (2005) (holding that admission of Intoxilyzer certificates under OEC 803(8)(b) without proof that the technician who prepared the documents was unavailable to testify did not violate Article I, section 11, \u201cbecause the framers of the Oregon Constitution would have understood public and official records to have constituted an exception to the confrontation rights guarantee\u201d); <em>see also State ex rel Juv.
