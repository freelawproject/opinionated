The record upon appeal now on file in this court consists of a \u201cclerk\u2019s transcript,\u201d containing a certified copy of the judgment-roll,- the notice of appeal, and the notice to the clerk to prepare transcript. There is also a \u201csupplemental clerk\u2019s transcript,\u201d containing certified copies of a bill of particulars, demand for bill of particulars, order appointing referee, report and finding of referee, exceptions to the report of referee and of certain other documents on file in the office of the clerk of the trial court.  The findings of the referee were not included in the \u201cjudgment-roll\u201d as the same was made up by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>clerk of the trial court. They should have been so included (Code Civ. Proc., see. 670), and doubtless may he regarded for the purposes of this appeal as a part of the judgment-roll.  The absence in the record upon appeal of a reporter\u2019s transcript or hill of exceptions is not in and of itself a ground for affirmance of the judgment.  The transcript of a judgment-roll, together with notice of appeal, is a sufficient record upon appeal if the appellant elects to prosecute his appeal upon such a record. If the grounds for appeal appear in the judgment-roll no bill of exceptions or reporter\u2019s transcript is required. (2 Cal. Jur., p. 527.)  Appellants\u2019 opening brief is on file herein and it appears therefrom that they urge various points upon this appeal which cannot be considered in the absence of reporter\u2019s transcript, but they also make the points that the judgment appealed from is not supported by the findings and that the complaint herein does not state a cause of action. These points may be considered and determined upon an inspection of the judgment-roll alone. The motion to affirm must, therefore, be denied, because a consideration and determination of these points at this time would involve in effect a determination of the merits of the appeal, and would effect an unwarranted advancement of this case. <em>(Jenks </em>v. <em>Lurie, </em>195 Cal. 582 [234 Pac. 370]; 2 Cal. Jur., p. 771.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Appellants have filed counter-affidavits in response to the motion, in which they show that they filed within due time in the court below a notice to the clerk to prepare transcript, which was sufficiently broad in its terms to require the preparation of a reporter\u2019s transcript; that they arranged with the reporter for his compensation therefor; that such transcript was duly prepared by the reporter and delivered to counsel for appellants, who examined the same and returned it to the reporter for delivery to the clerk; that the same was duly delivered by the reporter to the clerk for presentation to the judge who tried the case; that for some unexplained reason no time was ever fixed by the trial judge for the settlement of the transcript, but that counsel for appellants believed, and had some reason to believe, that the reporter\u2019s transcript had been settled, certified and filed in this court, and that appellants prepared and filed their opening brief herein, believing in good faith that the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>porter\u2019s transcript was in fact on file in this court. Appellants also filed herein an affidavit of merits, evidently intended as part of an application to this court for relief under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473.  If there is, under the present circumstances, any occasion for application for relief under this section it should be addressed to the trial court. <em>(Curtin </em>v. <em>Ingle, </em>155 Cal. 53, 57 [99 Pac. 480]; <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Paladini, </em>187 Cal. 727 [203 Pac. 760].) The matter of the settlement and certification of a reporter\u2019s transcript for use upon appeal is committed, in the first instance, to the trial judge. There is no proceeding now before us under which we would be entitled, if we were so disposed, to control or direct his action in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The motion to affirm is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
