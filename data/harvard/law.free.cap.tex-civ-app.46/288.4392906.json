On this point all the witnesses were agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The verdict was clearly warranted by the evidence, the accident being due alone to the negligence of appellant in permitting one of its wires to obstruct travel on the street, its servant having just stretched the wire across the street, and being present when the accident occurred. The issue of contributory negligence was raised by the pleadings and submitted in the charge, but we doubt if it was raised by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The charge, however, is criticised for placing the burden of proof on this issue on appellant, but when this paragraph of the charge is read in connection with the rest of the charge, and particularly in connection with the two paragraphs submitting the two phases of contributory negligence pleaded, it is not justly subject to criticism. Indeed, we doubt if appellant was entitled to have that issue submitted to the jury at all and are clear that the charge could not reasonably have misled the jury to the prejudice of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">jSTor did the court err in other paragraphs of the charge, nor in refusing special charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The amount of the verdict is complained of, but we find no evidence of' excess. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Conner, Chief Justice, not sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
