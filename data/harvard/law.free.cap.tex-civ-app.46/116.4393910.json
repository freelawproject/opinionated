The court has the right to suspend the enforcement of a lien in such a receivership proceeding, when under the rules of law -and equity it is best for all parties interested in such proceeding. In this case we do not think an appeal will lie, at least until a final judgment winding up the receivership. This is n companion case to the case of appellant v. Young, this day decided by this Court, where an appeal was taken from a judgment refusing a writ of mandamus to compel the commissioner to execute an order of sale to said property under a judgment foreclosing a lien, but suspended by said court. Said case is here referred to for the facts and our views of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The case is stricken from the docket as the order is interlocutory and not reviewable by this Court until the case is finally disposed of by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Application for writ of error dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
