International &amp; G. N. R. R. Co., 100 Texas, 453.)</p>\n<p id=\"AAN\">Plaintiffs in error\u2019s second assignment complains of the following paragraph of the main charge of the court below: \u201cThe burden of proof is upon the plaintiffs in this case to establish facts entitling them to recover under this charge by a preponderance of the evidence, and unless you believe that they have done so, you will return a verdict for the defendant.\u201d Their contention is that the plaintiffs in this case made a prima facie case entitling them to recover when they proved that the fire was caused by a spark emitted from defendant\u2019s engine, and that in order to rebut such prima facie case it devolved on defendant to prove that its engine was equipped with the best approved spark arresting apparatus' in general use, that such apparatus was in good repair, or that it had exercised ordinary care to keep it in good repair and the engine properly handled, whereas the above instruction had the effect to place the burden upon the plaintiffs upon all the above issues. We do not think the paragraph of the main charge of the court complained of, when construed in connection with other paragraphs thereof, which, in effect, instructed the jury what facts were necessary to be proven by the plaintiffs in error to make a prima facie case in their favor, and what facts were necessary to be proven by the defendant in order to rebut such prima facie case, subject to any of the criticisms urged against it by plaintiffs in error (St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v. Moss, 37 Texas Civ. App., 461; Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Johnson, 67 S. W.
