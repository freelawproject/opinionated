Appellees recovered both in the Justice\u2019s Court and in the County Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The greater number of appellant\u2019s assignments complain of the trial court\u2019s ruling in refusing to sustain his general and special exceptions to appellees\u2019 pleadings. His bill of exceptions, however, fails to disclose just what appellees\u2019 pleadings were, and since they were oral we cannot know that any of the exceptions were well taken. Where the pleadings in Justice Court and on appeal to the County Court are oral, as they may be under the 'statute, it is not contemplated that more than a brief statement of the same shall be noted1 on the docket. This brief statement seems to have been noted, but in no&gt; manner disproves that appellees\u2019 oral pleadings were sufficient as against all of the exceptions urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The cause must be reversed, however, for the refusal of the County Judge to prepare and deliver a written charge covering the law of the case. Article 1316, Texas Civil Statutes, as amended by the Act of 1903, page 55, provides: \u201cAfter the argument of a cause the judge shall in open court, unless the same be expressly waived by the parties to the suit, prepare and deliver a written charge to the jury on the law of the case, subject to the restrictions hereinafter provided.\u201d The changes thus made in the statute evidence an intention upon the part of the Legislature to work a change in the construction theretofore given to that statute, to the effect that it was optional with the judge to give a written charge. The language of the statute appears now to be mandatory in the absence of an express waiver by the parties. Wallace v. Shapard, 15 Texas Ct. Rep., 735. In the present case there was no such waiver, both parties in fact having requested the court to give a written charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">We will not pass on the merits of appellant\u2019s requested charges, since we cannot know in advance that they would be material after the court has prepared and delivered his charge covering the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>For this error of the court the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for another trial</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
