The truth of that plea was established by the positive and uncontroverted testimony of a disinterested lawyer of the State of Missouri. Such being the uncontroverted proof, we think it is settled by Western U. Tel. Co. v. Waller, 96 Texas, 589, that the plaintiff has no case except his right to recover for the charge paid for sending the message. The contract having been made in Missouri, and there being nothing to show that the parties intended otherwise, it seems to be settled by the case cited that the rights of the parties must be determined by the laws of that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The plaintiff has sought to take the case out of that rule by alleging and proving that the defendant sent a relay message from Austin back to Nevada, Missouri, by which it is claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s wife, the sender of the original message, was misled and prevented from sending another message giving a more specific address, etc. The testimony shows that at the time in question the plaintiff was an engineer on the M. K. &amp; T. Railway, daily engaged in running a train between Austin and Granger; that his train left Austin at 11:20 a. m., and returned to Austin at 4:50 p. m. The message from the plaintiff\u2019s wife was sent on February 17, 1906, and was received at the defendant\u2019s office in Austin at 10:1.7 a. m., that day. It contained no other address except Austin, Texas. At that time the city directory gave the plaintiff\u2019s address as No. 307 East 5th Street, and showed that he was an M. K. &amp; T. engineer. The message was placed in the hands of a messenger, who went to 307 East 5th Street, and inquired for the plaintiff, but was told that he did not reside there. The lady who gave that information directed the messenger to her husband, who told the messenger that he did not know the plaintiff, but that he had heard that a man who formerly resided there had left the city. The plaintiff had formerly boarded at that place with a lady who had moved away from it, but at that time the plaintiff was residing at No. 916 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>East 7th Street. The defendant made no further effort to find the plaintiff in Austin, and sent the following relay message to its office at Nevada, Missouri: \u201cTours date Garrett signed Mother undelivered. Party said to be out of city.\u201d That message was sent at 11:45 a. m., on the same day that the other message was received. It was shown by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he left Austin that day on his daily run to Granger at 11:20 a. m., and was, in fact, out of the city at the time the relay message was sent. It was shown by the testimony of his wife that she was aware of the fact that he left Austin every day at about 11:20 a. m., and made daily runs to and from Granger.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">From this we think it is quite clear that plaintiff\u2019s wife was not misled by the relay message. According to her own testimony, she already knew that her husband would leave Austin on that day at 11:20 a. m., and not return until 4:50 p. m., and therefore the relay message which was delivered to her in Nevada, Missouri, stating that her husband was reported to be out of town, indicated nothing more than that he had gone on his run to Granger, which was true; and, as the plaintiff knew that he was expected to go on that run, she was not misled by the message. Hence we hold that the sending of the relay message and its delivery to the plaintiff\u2019s wife, does not take the case out of the rule which requires the laws of the State of Missouri to be applied in determining the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The verdict separates the recovery and allows the plaintiff 72 cents, the cost of the telegram, and $900 for mental anguish, and the judgment follows the verdict. As to the item of 72 cents, the judgment will be affirmed; as to the $900 recovered for mental anguish, the judgment will be reversed and here rendered for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>Affirmed in </em>part, <em>and in part reversed and rendered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
