All debts were settled by a temporary administrator during the pendency of litigation over the probate of the will. The executor received the estate in 1895, and continued to execute the trust until his death, in 1905. The widow, meantime, elected not to take-under the will, and received the share given her by law. Held, that the executor, at his death, was managing the estate, not as executor, but as a trustee, holding the legal title under the will; that the County Court had no jurisdiction to take control, on his death, by appointment of an administrator with the will annexed; and that the District Court alone had power to appoint a new trustee to carry out the trust.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-12\">Appeal from the District Court of McLennan County.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ASC\">Tried below before Hon.

On the same day, pursuant to order, the writ of certiorari, as prayed for, was issued and served. On February 8, plaintiffs- filed and presented to me their original petition in cause No. 14280, being substantially an original bill in equity, complaining of the same matters charged in the petition for certiorari and praying for equitable relief. Both petitions attack the jurisdiction of the County Court over the property involved, and allege the nullity of said proceedings, and pray for the appointment of a receiver. On said 8th day of February, 1 endorsed on said last named petition- an order to the clerk to issue notice to defendant that I would hear the application for a receiver on February 22, 1906, on application of plaintiffs, I fixed bond and caused an order for supersedeas to be issued, which writ, pursuant thereto was issued and served on March 6, 1906. The hearing on the application for receiver was continued from time to time, upon request of all parties, until the 16th day of March, 1906. On said day said matter was taken up in open court, all parties' -appearing and announced ready. By agreement of parties, said two causes were consolidated. The whole of March 16th was consumed in the hearing, and the matter adjourned to the 17th. On the opening of the matter on the 17th, Robert F. Cribble appeared and filed herein a pleading styled The original answer of Robert F. Cribble,\u2019 wherein he sets up his appointment by the County Court as temporary administrator of the estate of Peter McClelland, dec\u2019d1, and adopts the pleadings of Peter McClelland, Jr., herein. It appearing that said appointment had been made during the hearing of this matter on the 16th, it was agreed by all parties that said order appointing Robert F. Cribble, should be considered as superseded and removed to this court for revision and review along with all other proceedings of the County Court in the matter of the estate of Peter McClelland. Thereafter on said 17th of March, I appointed J. K. Rose receiver of the property in controversy. The defendant then and there excepted to this action of the court, gave notice of appeal, and superseded said\" appointment by giving the bond fixed by me for that purpose. Thereafter, by agreement of all parties, Chas. E. Moore was appointed by the court to take charge of the property in controversy pending the appeal from the order appointing a receiver, and said Moore continued to hold possession thereof to the trial of the cause. The trial was had upon an- agreed statement of the facts and only the questions of law were submitted for my determinations. The facts, epitomized as best I can from the agreed statement, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\u201c1st.\u2014Peter McClelland died on the 24th day of September, 1886, in McLennan County, Texas-, leaving no debts and leaving a will and codicil thereto as follows: Tn the name of God, Amen.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u201c T Peter McClelland, Senior, of the County of McLennan and State of Texas, knowing the uncertainty of life and the certainty of death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>and being of sound and disposing memory, do make this my last will and testament:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\">\u201c \u2018Item 1st.\u2014I commit my soul to the God who gave it, trusting in his mercy, and my body to the earth from whence it came.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u201c \u2018Item 2nd.\u2014Should I owe any just debts at my death, I desire that my executors shall pay the same out of any money on hand, and if there should be no money on hand, then out of the income of my estate, as soon as the same can be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u201c \u2018Item 3rd.\u2014I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Joanna M.

Joanna McClelland; said Peter McClelland\u2019s second wife, had m&gt; issue and she and said Peter, Jr., his .only child, survived the said Peter McClelland, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u201c3rd.-\u2014During the pendency of the litigation over the will, Mrs. Joanna McClelland, the widow of the testator, was first appointed temporary administrator; after acting as such for a short time she resigned and was discharged, and John C. West was appointed in her stead. West qualified as temporary administrator and entered upon his duties as such on the 10th day of February, 1891, and continued to act as such administrator until the qualification of said Prather, as hereinafter set out, on October 10, 1895. On that date West filed Ms final account as temporary administrator, which shows that there were no outstanding debts or claims of any character against the estate and a cash balance in the hands of said temporary administrator of thirty-four thousand five hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty cents ($34,566.60) which amount was turned over by the said West to the said W. L. Prather on said date and said temporary administrator was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">\u201c4th.\u2014Pending the litigation over the will Joanna McClelland, the widow, elected not to take under the will, and long prior to said October 10, 1895, by proper and regular proceedings, there was a partition of the community estate of the testator and the said Joanna, and the property of said Joanna was set apart to her. She is now dead, and her heirs have no interest in the property now in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">\u201c5th.\u2014 On the day said will was admitted to probate, Prather qualified as sole independent executor, and thereupon, on the same date, filed an inventory, appraisement and list of claims of said estate, and an order was entered in the County Court approving the inventory and appraisement, and thereafter the Probate Court made no further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>orders in the matter of said estate and Prather managed and controlled the same outside of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">\u201c6th.\u2014When Prather took possession of said estate John C. West, temporary administrator, turned over to him all the property of the estate, including the sum of thirty-four thousand, five hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty cents ($34,566.60) in cash. It was admitted upon the trial and is a fact that at this time there were no debts, suits, claims or demands of any character whatsoever outstanding against said estate, and that said property came into the hands of said Prather absolutely free of debt and discharged of all bequests or legacies excepting only the charge on the same in favor of Peter McClelland, Jr., during his life, with remainder in fee to the heirs of Peter McClelland, Sr., as set out in the will and codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u201c7th.\u2014Pending the litigation over the will, the temporary administrator paid to Peter McClelland, Jr., under proper orders of the court, the sum of One Hundred and Fifty dollars ($150) monthly out of the funds of the estate. Prather, immediately after qualifying and filing an inventory and appraisement, exercised the discretion vested in him by the will, and increased the allowance to Peter McClelland, Jr., to the sum of Four Hundred ($400) dollars per month, which sum he paid to Peter monthly out of the estate, until his, Prather\u2019s death, on July 24, 1905. From the time Prather qualified up to the date of his death, he continued to manage and control said property, collect all rents and income therefrom, malee leases and rental contracts, pay all taxes and insurance, defend suits for or growing out of said property, and pay expenses of the same, including counsel fees, to make repairs and improvements on the property, and in every way to execute the trust reposed upon him by the terms of said will.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u201c8th.\u2014The property at the time of the death of Peter McClelland consisted, and so continues; chiefly of rent bearing real estate situated in the City of Waco&gt;, McLennan County, of the probable value of $250,000, yielding yearly in rentals about the sum of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u201c9th.\u2014Plaintiffs herein are nearest collateral kin to the testator and, excluding Peter McClelland, Jr., are the lawful heirs of Peter, Sr.; and Peter, Jr., the defendant herein, is the only lineal descendant of Peter McClelland, Sr., and the nearest of kin. Peter, Jr., has been married four times, and is now living with his fourth wife, with whom he has been living over ten years. Is now over fifty years of age, and has never had issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u201c10th.\u2014At the time Prather died, there were claims against him arising out of his management of said property, all of which are charged by the parties holding them to have been contracted by him within a year of his death in his management and control of said property, consisting of claims, for improvements; and repairs on the property made by said Prather in the execution of the trust imposed upon him by the terms of said will.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u201c11th.\u2014There has never been any settlement made by the estate of W. L. Prather, since his death, as trustee of the McClelland property; but his executor admits an indebtedness from Prather, as such trustee, to the estate, of $1,800, which she has offered and is willing to pay to anyone authorized to receive the same. Peter, Jr., when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>appointed administrator, declined to tiredeivei the same, claiming a much larger amount, and brought suit for $47,817.88 against Prather\u2019s executrix, which suit is now pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">\u201c12th.\u2014On July 28, 1905, after Prather\u2019s death, Peter McClelland, Jr., defendant herein, applied to the Probate Court of McLennan County for temporary letters of administration on the estate of Peter McClelland, deceased, and on the same day he was appointed temporary administrator: on August 16, 1905, he filed his application to be appointed permanent administrator of the estate of Peter McClelland, deceased, with the will annexed, and thereafter on the 4th day of September, 1905, he filed his final report as temporary administrator and was discharged, and was on the same day appointed administrator with the will annexed and thereafter, in due course, qualified as such, and continued to act as such until the 3rd day of February, 1906, upon which date the plaintiffs herein filed and obtained service upon their original petition for certiorari herein; on March 6, 1906, plaintiffs- filed a supersedeas bond in the amount fixed by the court, and thereupon a writ of supersedeas was issued and served, whereby the jurisdiction assumed by the County Court over the property formerly belonging to Peter McClelland, Sr., and all the proceedings in said court in reference thereto were superseded.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u201c13th.\u2014All the proceedings and orders alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition for a certiorari to have taken place in the County Court of McLennan County, Texas, in the course of the administration of the estate of Peter McClelland, deceased, by young Peter as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed, did take-place and were made as alleged, as will fully appear by the record in this case, to which reference is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u201c14th.\u2014If I have overlooked any fact material to a correct finding of the law of this case in the foregoing findings, I refer to and make a part hereof the agreed statement of facts, filed herein, upon which this case was tried. The facts are agreed upon and the only controversy between the parties is the legal effect of the facts' as agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\"><em>\u201cConclusion of the law. </em>Under the terms -of the will and codicil of Peter McClelland, as above set out, W. L. Prather, the only executor therein named who qualified, was intended by McClelland both as executor and thereafter as trustee, and in law he occupied this dual position, first that of executor, and after the discharge of all his duties as executor, then that of trustee to carry out the terms\u00bb of the trust imposed upon him by the w-ill. At the time the will and codicil were probated, the temporary administrator having discharged all claims against the estate, if there were any, and- there being at that time no necessity for further administration in the County Court, when Prather took charge of the estate and filed an inventory and appraisement thereof, he had discharged all the duties incumbent upon him as executor, and being, in effect, the sole legatee, in trust however, under the will and in possession of the estate, he thereafter ceased to hold the property of the estate as executor and held the same as trustee; in other words, after all the duties incumbent upon him as executor had been discharged, the estate ceased to be the estate of a decedent, in the -technical sense of that word, and became an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>estate in trust, and the executor, being the trustee, thereafter held and administered said estate as trustee. Immediately after taking possession of the property and filing an inventory and appraisement thereof, Prather exercised the discretion given him in the will and increased the monthly allowance to young Peter. This was an exercise of the trust reposed in him personally as trustee. The estate of Peter McClelland had been completely administered, so far as the County Court was concerned; and inasmuch as the property was then in the hands of him whom Peter McClelland had named in his will to carry out the trusts therein created, it was distributed, and in my judgment, Prather ever thereafter held - the property as trustee. I am of the opinion, under the facts of the case, that as soon as Prather had discharged all the duties of executor as required of him by law and the will, which was the filing of an inventory and appraisement under the terms of the will, the County Court lost entire jurisdiction over the property, and never thereafter reacquired such jurisdiction, and it became an estate in trust as completely and perfectly as if some other person had been named as trustee, and Prather, as executor, had turned over the property of the estate to such other person to administer the trust. Prather now being dead, the trust will not be permitted to lapse for want of a trustee, and, in my opinion, the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction to appoint such trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u201cThis is not a collateral attack upon the proceedings of the County Court in appointing young Peter administrator with the will annexed, but the entire matter and all the proceedings had in the County Court affecting this property have been brought to this, court by certiorari, superseding, at least during the pendency of the certiorari proceedings, entirely the jurisdiction of the County Court over said matter, and this court by virtue of its appellate jurisdiction over the County Court under the certiorari proceedings, as well as a court of law and equity, under the original bill filed herein, which have been consolidated, must determine, first, whether or not the County Court had jurisdiction to appoint such administrator, and second, if that court had no- such jurisdiction, to appoint a trustee to administer the trust; and being of the opinion that the County Court had no jurisdiction over the property involved herein, I think the order of the court \u25a0 appointing Peter, Jr., administrator of the estate of Peter McClelland, Sr., as well as all other orders entered therein by the County Court, are void, and that it is my duty to appoint a trustee to take charge of said property and carry out. the trusts created by the will, and I have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u201cThe number of times this will of Peter McClelland has been construed by our higher courts (to which I respectfully refer) renders unnecessary, I think, any further conclusions of law upon my part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">It is not necessary to an affirmance of the judgment that we should expressly approve all that is said by the court in its conclusions of \u2022law, but we agree with the court in the disposition made of the case. There is no controversy about the facts. They are stated by the court substantially in accordance with the agreed statement found-in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The 10th finding of facts states that certain items of indebtedness were incurred by Prather during the time that he, as trustee, was&gt; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>charge of the estate. These items, which are not necessary to be repeated, are fully set out and itemized in the agreed statement found on page 56 of the record'.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">In the cases of McClelland v. McClelland, 37 S. W. Rep., 350 and Woods v. McClelland, 53 S. W. Rep., 381, the will in question was construed by this court; and we substantially held that the trust created by its terms was active and express; and that the instrument created what was understood to be a spendthrift trust. The legal title of the property was vested in Prather, the deceased trustee, subject to the terms and conditions stated in the will; and it is difficult to conceive how an administrator with the will annexed could; in view of our probate laws; administer the estate so as to effectuate the intention of the testator. The duties imposed could only be performed by a trustee who could exercise the same powers that were conferred upon Prather; and he having died, the District Court, in the exercise of its general jurisdiction, had the power to appoint a trustee. Willis v. Alvey &amp; Davidson, 30 Texas Civ. App., 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We find no error in the record and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
