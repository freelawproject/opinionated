The statement in the certificate of acknowledgment that Mary Ruleman in her private examination \u201c acknowledged the execution of the said power of attorney to have been done by her freely, understandingly, without compulsion or restraint from her said husband, and for the purposes therein contained,\u201d is a sufficient substantial compliance with the law without stating therein that \u201c she wished not to retract it.\u201d Carpenter <em>v. </em>Dexter, 8 Wall., 513; Belcher <em>v. </em>Weaver, 46 Tex., 293; also Hughes <em>v. </em>Lane, 11 Ill., 123.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b493-8\">Gould, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Anul\">The power of attorney from Jacob Ruleman and wife, Mary Ruleman, to R. S. Rutherford was authenticated by the following certificate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">\u201cState of Tennessee, ) ss \u201c <em>Shelby County. )</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\u201cI, James Rose, a duly commissioned and sworn notary public in and for said county, hereby certify that on this 25th day of April, 1853, before me came Jacob Ruleman, and Mary Ruleman, his wife, the constituents' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>within named, who acknowledged the execution of the foregoing power of attorney for the purposes therein contained; and the said Mary Ruleman having also appeared before me privately and apart from her said husband, and acknowledged the execution of the said power of attorney to have been done by her freely, understandingly, and without compulsion or constraint from her said husband, and for the purposes therein contained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">\u201c Witness my hand and seal of office at Memphis, aforesaid, the day above written.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">[seal.] \u201cJas. Rose, Notary Public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The admission in evidence of the power of attorney was objected to: 1st. On the ground that a notary public in the state of Tennessee \u201cwas not authorized on the 25th day of April, 1853, to take the acknowledgments of a-married woman. 2d. That the certificate of the notary does not show that Mary Ruleman was examined by him privily and apart from her husband. 3d. That the certificate does not show that the said instrument was explained by the said officer to the said Mary. 4th. That it does not appear from the certificate that the said Mary declared that she did not wish to retract the power of attorney.\u201d The court, overruling thes\u00e9 objections, admitted the power of attorney in evidence, and the agreed case brings before us that ruling as the sole error relied on for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">On the part of appellee it is claimed that if the acknowledgment were, defective originally for want of authority in the notary, that it \u201cwas validated by the act of the legislature of Texas, approved April 27, 1874.\u201d Acts of 1874, p. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">We have not found it necessary in disposing of the case to pass upon this question. Although it has been investigated and argued by counsel on both sides with diligence and ability, we think it more prudent to leave it undecided, as even if this validating act cured any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>want of authority in the notary, we are of opinion that the certificate of acknowledgment is in itself fatally defective. It nowhere appears in the certificate that the instrument was explained to her by the officer, and that thereafter she acknowledged it to be her act, and declared that she wished not to retract it. These are facts which must substantially appear from the certificate of the officer, because embraced both in the enacting clause of the statute and in the form which it prescribes. Pasch. Dig., art. 1003; Belcher <em>v. </em>Weaver, 46 Tex., 294. The certificate says that she \u201c acknowledged the execution of said power of attorney to have been done by her freely, understandingly,\u201d etc., but nowhere speaks in the present tense, showing that the notary explained the instrument to her, and that she thereupon acknowledged it as her act and declared that she wished not to retract .it. It is not enough that a married woman should appear before an officer apart from her husband, and, without having the instrument explained to her, acknowledge that she had executed it freely and understanding its purport. The law required then, as it requires now, that the officer certify in substance that, the instrument being explained to her, she declared her present wishes, by acknowledging it as her act and stating that she wished not to retract it.

S., arts. 4310-4313.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b495-6\">[Opinion delivered March 14, 1882.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Because the court erred in admitting the power of attorney in evidence, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
