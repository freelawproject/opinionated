L. Bartlett, and that the plaintiff claimed through an assignment of that stock in 1866 to her testator by Bartlett, and she alleged, and it was admitted as true, that afterwards, in 1866, her testator presented the assignment to defendant\u2019s board of directors, and that they issued to him, as assignee of Bartlett, a certificate for said five shares, which the plaintiff \u201cnow holds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-11\">It was further alleged and admitted as true, that since then the defendant, by proper action, has determined to issue to each of its stockholders eight shares of new stock in its company for each share previously issued, which entitled plaintiff to forty shares of the new or present capital stock in defendant\u2019s company in lieu of the five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>shares issued to her testator as assignee of Bartlett, if in law she is entitled to recover anything on account of the Bartlett stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">The defendant alleged that Bartlett assigned the same stock to Wm. R. Baker in 1861, of which the plaintiff\u2019s testator had notice. That in 1861 Baker presented the assignment and surrendered the certificate issued to Bartlett to defendant\u2019s officers, and they issued to him as assignee of Bartlett a certificate for said five shares, which he still held, and then averred that plaintiff\u2019s testator was a director in defendant\u2019s company at the time he took the assignment from Bartlett; and that he fraudulently procured said officers to issue the certificate through which the plaintiff claimed, and the same was issued in mistake; wherefore plaintiff was not entitled to forty shares of new stock in place of the five shares of Bartlett stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">It was also proved that the transfer from Bartlett to Baker was among the records of the company; that Van Alstyne was a director in the railroad company from 1860 to 1861, and during that time his place of business was in the general office of the company and he had access to the records of the office; that Baker was secretary of the company in 1866, when the certificate for the Bartlett five shares was issued to Van Alstyne; that the issuance to the latter was an oversight on his (Baker\u2019s) part; and that he did not remember having previously bought the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">For the plaintiff it was admitted that she was executrix of William A. Van Alstyne; that Bartlett assigned his five shares to her testator in 1866; that in that year defendant\u2019s officers issued to him on that assignment, as assignee of Bartlett, a certificate for said five shares, and that William R. Baker was a director and the secretary of defendant at the time, and that said shares were worth, at the trial, the amount at which the court esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>mated them in its judgment, to wit, fifty-two dollars per share of $100 each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8q\">It was proven that plaintiff\u2019s testator was a director in defendant\u2019s company during all of 1866, and was familiar as any one with defendant\u2019s business and papers, having his desk in general office of defendant. That Bartlett never owned but five shares of stock in defendant\u2019s company, and that he assigned them to William E. Baker and delivered him the certificate therefor in 1861; that Baker, in the same year, presented said assignment to defendant\u2019s proper officers, and delivered to them the certificate originally issued to Bartlett, and that the said officers then issued and delivered to him as assignee of Bartlett a certificate for said five shares, which is still outstanding and claimed by him or his assignee; that the certificate which was issued to plaintiff\u2019s testator was issued in mistake, in that he, the officer issuing same, did not remember at the time it was issued that one had been issued previously to him, Baker, and if he had known it or thought of it at the time, the one to Van Alstyne would not have been issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\">It was agreed that forty shares of the stock for which judgment was rendered in this case was in lieu of the five shares originally issued to Bartlett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-6\">It was agreed that the issue in this case only extended to the Bartlett stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-7\">A. S. Eichardson testified: I am now secretary of defendant, and as such have in my possession the books and records of Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway Company. The stock book of said company shows that on the 1st day of April, 1861, a certificate for five shares of the capital stock of defendant was issued to one L. L. Bartlett. (This certificate was then introduced in evidence.) I find among the transfer papers a written transfer from L. L. Bartlett to Wm. A. Van Alstyne, of date 2d March, 1866. (The transfer was then read in evidence.) The stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>books show that on the 27th of March, 1866, defendant issued to W. A. Van Alstyne, by virtue of this transfer, a certificate for said five shares of- stock. (The certificate was then read.).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">Plaintiff also proved that for the West, Mugg, Anderson and Mayes stock, certificates issued as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">Plaintiff also proved that in the year 1874 defendant, by its board of directors, by resolution, authorized an increase of its stock eight-fold, and provided therein for an exchange and substitution of the original shares for the new certificates, on the basis of eight new certificates or shares of its stock for one of its old or original certificates or shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-7\">It was admitted that the new stock, at the time of trial, was worth $52 per share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-8\">A. S. Richardson again testified: As stated before, I am now secretary of defendant. The only stock ever issued to Bartlett was the certificate for five shares, of date April 1, 1861. I find among the records a transfer from L. L. Bartlett to W. R. Baker, of date April, 1861. (The transfer was then read in evidence.) The stock book shows that by virtue of this transfer a certificate for five shares of stock was issued to said Baker. Baker was the recognized owner of the stock until 1877, when he sold the same to Charles Morgan. (The certificate to Baker for said five shares was then read in evidence.) Van Alstyne was a director in defendant\u2019s company from 1856 to the date of his death in 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-9\">W. R. Baker testified: I bought the L. L. Bartlett five shares of stock in April, 1861, and he transferred the same to me by written transfer, which I deposited with the defendant at that time \u2014 that is, in the office of the secretary \u2014together with the original certificate that had been issued to Bartlett. The certificate to Bartlett was then canceled and a new certificate for said five shares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>was issued to me; that from 1860 to 1867 W. A. Van Alstyne was a director in defendant\u2019s company, and during that time his place of business was in the general office of defendant, where the books and papers of the company were on file. That the transfer of Bartlett to Baker was on file in the office of the secretary at the date of the issuance of the stock to Van Alstyne, and that he (Van Alstyne) had access to the records of the office, and there was no one more familiar with the records. That I (the witness) was secretary of defendant in 1866, when the certificate for the Bartlett five shares was issued to Van Alstyne, and I issued the certificate at Van Alstyne\u2019s request, not remembering that I had previously bought the .stock. It was an oversight on my part, and would not have been made if I had remembered that Bartlett had previously transferred the stock. Afterwards I called Van Alstyne\u2019s attention to the fact that I had a prior transfer from Bartlett, and he (Van Alstyne) said: \u201c Well, I reckon you have the better title.\u201d The witness was secretary of the defendant company at time of issue of Bartlett stock to him, and also at the time certificate of said stock was issued to Van Alstyne, and in issuing said stock was acting within the scope of his authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-4\">The cause was submitted to the court without a jury. Judgment for the plaintiff, decreeing that plaintiff recover of the defendant the new stock sued for, to be issued to plaintiff within twenty days from date of judgment, and on failure to do so that plaintiff recover the value of said stock as proven on the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">The defendant assigned the following as grounds of error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff for forty shares of defendant\u2019s capital stock in place of the five shares originally issued to L. L. Bartlett, because the proof shows that Bartlett assigned this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>same stock to W. B. Baker in 1861, who presented the certificate of stock issued to Bartlett with Bartlett\u2019s assignment to him, when the certificate issued to Bartlett was canceled and a new one issued to Baker in 1861, which he has ever since held; and the proof shows further that afterwards, in 1866, Bartlett assigned the same stock again to plaintiff\u2019s testator while he was a director in defendant\u2019s company, familiar with its affairs, and that he procured a certificate to be issued to him for the Bartlett five shares, and that this certificate was issued in mistake of the fact that one had previously issued to Baker, and the one to Van Alstyne would not have issued if the board of directors had remembered at the time that one had previously issued to Baker on an older assignment and surrender of the original certificate.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-5\"><em>Baker &amp; Botts, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-6\"><em>E.

App.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ATr\">The character of this suit is to enforce specific performance of a contract- made under a mistake of fact as to the essential elements and considerations which \u00e9ntered into it. The proper determination of the issues between the parties rests upon the inquiry whether the transaction between Van Alstyne and the proper officers, representing the defendant, which resulted in issuing to him, as the assignee of Bartlett, a certificate of five shares of stock, was in law or equity one which constituted him a <em>bona fide </em>stockholder; one entitled to receive dividends with other stockholders of the corporation; a stockholder entitled to demand and have the benefit of the resolution of the directors of the defendant, entitling each of its stockholders to eight shares of new stock in its company for each share previously issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Van Alstyne, when he applied for and obtained the certificate on which he relies in this suit for five shares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>of stock, does not pretend to acquire or hold the same as the assignee of any certificate for stock hitherto issued to Bartlett;' but whatever rights he pretended to claim under Bartlett were asserted to exist under an <em>assignment of said Bartlett\u2019s stock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFKF\">Bartlett\u2019s certificate of stock had long before the said assignment ceased to exist. It had been delivered to Baker as the assignee thereof, and by Baker surrendered to the defendant, receiving in lieu thereof certificates for the five shares of stock, which transaction was properly evidenced by the books of the corporation, through appropriate entries made thereof. Van Alstyne therefore took no legal title whatever to any interest or right of Bartlett to said five shares .of stock, so far as any transfer from Bartlett to Van Alstyne was concerned, after the transactions which have been recited under his transfer to Baker transpired, culminating in the utter extinction of Bartlett\u2019s certificate, and of all right of Bartlett, legal and equitable, as shown by the surrender of stock referred to, and its replacement by an original and independent certificate issued to Baker instead. It was the same, when Bartlett made his assignment to Van Alstyne, as though he had never been in any wise connected with said five shares of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Clearly, Van Alstyne acquiring no <em>legal </em>title under Bartlett\u2019s assignment to him, his right, or rather the right of his heirs or estate, to enforce the rights claimed in this suit against the defendant must depend upon such equities, as against the defendant, as can be shown to exist under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The rules of law or equity applicable to. this case are not complicated with questions as to the relative rights of Baker and of Van Alstyne under their respective assignments, nor with any question as to what might be the rights of a third person who had purchased from Van Alstyne, without notice as to the facts, <em>bona fide, </em>and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>a valuable consideration. The case which is before us presents the question whether, as between the original parties to the assignment made to Van Alstyne, he is entitled to enforce specifically the contract which entitled him, <em>prima facie, </em>on the face of the certificate which was issued to him, to the benefits pertaining thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"AjD\">No ground of equitable relief, in behalf of the plaintiff, seems to be relied upon by either allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings, nor does the same appear in the statement of facts, nor by the case agreed upon. It is not pretended by the plaintiff that Van Alstyne procured the assignment upon which he relies, under inducements or representations held out or made to him by the defendant or its officers; nor is it alleged that he was ignorant in fact of the status of Bartlett\u2019s right- at the time of his procurement of the assignment from him (Bartlett); nor is there any charge of any concealment or suppression of evidence as to the condition of the Bartlett stock, or the certificate therefor; nor is it alleged that Van Alstyne was ignorant of any of these material facts, or that he made inquiries concerning the same, or that he would have been unable to ascertain the facts by duly making inquiry concerning them. It is not alleged, nor shown by proof, that Van Alstyne was a purchaser of Bartlett\u2019s right to five shares of stock, for a valuable consideration, in good faith and without notice. And on the other hand, Van Alstyne is shown by the evidence to have occupied a position of trust towards the defendant \u2014 being one of the directors of defendant,\u2014 which relation charged him with the duty of advising himself concerning the interest and affairs of the stockholders of said railroad company; and the evidence disclosed the fact that he was expert, and well informed concerning the stock books and stock transactions relating to the defendant. 1 \u2018 When the means of inquiry are equally open to both parties, if a mistake occur without any fraud or falsehood, no relief can be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>on account of the mistake alone.\u201d Daniel <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 1 Story, 172; Warner <em>v. </em>Daniel, 1 Wood &amp; Min., 90; Hill <em>v. </em>Bush, 19 Ark., 522; Jouzin <em>v. </em>Toulmin, 9 Ala., 662. Equity will not favor and aid a party thus situated, in his acts of negligence or carelessness, where he seeks to make either available as the basis whereTby to obtain and assert an interest adverse to that of his <em>cestui qui trust. </em>His relation bound him to care and vigilance in behalf of the defendant and the interest of the stockholders, if he went into the market as a dealer in its securities; and he was bound besides to the utmost good faith towards the corporation whose interest he represented. Van Alstyne is shown to have occupied a position and a relation to the facts, as well as to all the parties concerned, as to preclude him from asserting a right to be protected against a mistake in which he was to profit so largely. <em>\u201c </em>Though a court of equity will relieve against mistake, it will not assist a man whose condition is attributable only to that want of due diligence which may be fairly expected from a reasonable person.\u201d Kerr on Fraud and Mistake, p. 407 and note and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The brief of counsel for appellee disclaims that this is a suit for specific performance; but it certainly seems to be nothing less than an effort by the plaintiff, in effect, to enforce specifically the obligation which, it is alleged, arose and exists under and by virtue of the evidence, which the certificate for stock issued to Van Alstyne, to require the.issuance of additional certificates in the ratio of eight for one to said Van Alstyne, and in default thereof to compensate the plaintiff in damages to the amount of the value of all such evidences of plaintiff\u2019s rights to dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">As the plaintiff\u2019s case is not rested upon equities which might entitle her to a specific performance, the discussion and application of principles of law applicable to such remedy is wholly superfluous. Evidently the rules ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>plicable to relief upon equitable grounds find nothing in the facts of this case suggestive of their application.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b460-8\">[Opinion delivered March 13, 1882.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The mistake of fact which is so clearly admitted by the parties possesses a two-fold force; in equity it constitutes a full answer to the plaintiff\u2019s case in respect to her alternative claim for damages in case specific enforcement of the contract be denied to her by the court; and, as we have endeavored in this opinion to show, the alleged mistake is not connected with any equity which the plaintiff\u2019s testator could assert.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s case is made to depend upon the intrinsic value of a certificate for stock issued under a clear mistake of fact on the solicitation of the plaintiff\u2019s testator, who was a director of the corporation, the stock of which he was endeavoring to acquire; whose interest he was charged by his official duty to protect; and the plaintiff failing to show any fraud used to his disadvantage, or any mistake which he might not have guarded against, and failing to show besides either ignorance in fact, surprise, or that he was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice, we perceive no reason, and acting on principles and maxims of law the most elementary, to hesitate to say that the judgment rendered for the plaintiff below was erroneous, and that the evidence in the case warranted a judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Wherefore we conclude that the proper disposition of this appeal is that the judgment below be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
