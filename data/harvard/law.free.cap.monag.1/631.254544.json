Provided, however, that none of my residuary estate shall be distributed to the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church of the Hnited States, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church of the United States, the Lincoln Hniversity of Chester County, Pennsylvania, and the Presbyterian Board of Belief, these aforesaid exceptions being those named in Items One (1), Two (2), Three (3), and Four (4) of this my will, but that the sums already bequeathed to these respective institutions in Items 1, 2, 3, and 4, are in full of what they shall be entitled to receive out of my estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-10\">The executors were directed to sell, at public or private sale, the real and personal property not specifically devised, or accepted at the appraised value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-11\">By a codicil, testator provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-12\">\u201c Item 26. I give and bequeath to my grand-nephew, Henry W. Kendall, the property where he now lives, in Pinegrove, Pa., on.

J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-14\">\u201cThe only contention arising is to the distribution of the residuum. The question arises upon the distribution of the residu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>ary estate, so far as it relates to the devise and bequest of Emily Hopler. The testator bequeaths $3000 to her and a messuage and tenement and tract of land which he valued at $6000. The contention on the part of the legatees, other than the Hoplers, is that the residuary clause does not include the value of the farm in the distribution of the residuary estate. In other words, it is cpntended that Emily Hopler should stand in said distribution, as a legatee of $3000, and not as a beneficiary of $9000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-4\">\u201c The residuary clause bequeaths the balance, after the payment to his said beneficiaries, in proportion to the amounts respectively given them. By the plain terms of the will, the testator directs that the residuum of his estate be <em>\u2018 </em>distributed to all the parties named therein in pro rata shares,\u2019 except certain excluded ones; that is to say \u2018 in proportion to the amounts they have already been granted under this will, namely, the person to whom I have bequeathed the sum of ten thousand dollars shall receive just double the amount out of my residuary estate that the person shall receive to whom I have bequeathed the sum of five thousand dollars,\u2019 provided, however, that none of his residuary estate should go to his legatees named in Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-5\">\u201cIt would appear that the testator, by excluding certain of his, legatees from participating in the residuary estate, intended not to exclude those not so excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-6\">\u201c What object could the testator have had in placing the valuation of $6000 upon the messuage devised to Emily Hopler, other than to fix the sum upon which should be based her interest in his residuary estate ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-7\">\u201c Counsel, however, contended that one of decedent\u2019s revoked wills, offered and admitted in evidence, disclosed, when taken in connection with his will, that he did not intend that Emily should take part in the distribution of the residuum on account of the house devised to her. And this, for the reason that it contained devises without putting valuations thereon, the residuary clauses being similar in both wills. We do not see anything in this contention. If it became material to ascertain the value of such devises, the court would find a way to ascertain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-8\">\u201cThis case, in our opinion, is ruled in Hoff and Tucker\u2019s Appeal, 28 Pa. 51. The will in that case is in every respect similar to the one under consideration. All the rules which the court applied there are applicable here. Hence the interest of Emily Hopler in the residuum should and will be taken as if she had been bequeathed the sum of $9000.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-9\">In the revoked will, referred to in the above opinion, the residuary clause is identical with that in the last will. In the revoked will, there were also many pecuniary legacies and some specific devises of real estate. The devise and legacy to Emily Hopler were also substantially like those in the last will, excepting that in the latter the legacy is $3000 while in the former it was $1000. In the revoked will, there was a devise to Clara Wheeler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>and Nancy Wright, for life, and afterward to their children, of a house and store property situate in the borough of Lykens, Pennsylvania, upon which the testator placed no valuation. In the first codicil to the revoked will, is the following clause: \u201c It is also my will and I hereby order and direct that all sums of money or other valuable thing whatsoever charged against any and all persons in my account book under the head of \u2018Advancements to persons named in my will\u2019 since the making of my said last will and testament, bearing date the 15th day of July, 18J9, to which this is a codicil, shall be deducted from the amounts given them, respectively, in my said last will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-7\">The following exception, inter alia, was filed to the adjudication:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-8\">\u201c6. The court erred in not finding and adjudging that the testator intended by the residuary clause in his will, to limit the distribution of his residuary estate to the parties named in the will, excepting those expressly excluded, in proportion to the amounts of money which the said parties had already been granted under the will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-9\">The court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the adjudication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-10\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court, 1, in finding and adjudging that the testator intended that Emily Hopler should participate in the distribution of the residuary estate in proportion to the aggregate of the value which the testator placed upon the messuage devised to her and the monied legacy of $3000; 2, in fixing $9000 as the basis of Emily Hopler\u2019s distributive share of the residuary estate; 3, in not making the monied bequest of $3000 to Emily Hopler the sole basis of her distributive share of the residuary estate; 4, in distributing to Emily Hopler the sum of $10,203.29; and, 5, in dismissing appellant\u2019s 6th exception, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b682-11\"><em>Cyrus G. </em>Derr, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIR\">The word \u201c amount,\u201d in item 25, means \u201camount of money.\u201d That is the popular meaning. The subsequent explanatory clauses dissipate any doubt. \u201c Double the amount out of my residuary estate \u201d must signify money, as the residue is converted into money and distributed as. such. The use of the word \u201c bequeath \u201d is to the same effect. If the testator had intended the devisees of real estate to participate in the residuary distribution, he would have placed a value upon all the real estate devised. The evidence of the revoked will, offered in evidence under the authority of Hirst\u2019s Ap., 92 Pa. 491, strengthens this construction. In the revoked will, \u201camounts\u201d mean pecuniary legacies, as the advancements could not be deducted from unvalued real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-12\">In Hoff and Tucker\u2019s Appeal, supra, the residuary estate was directed to be \u201c equally divided as per ratio in the bequests herein made among my heirs and relatives.\u201d The sole question raised was, as to whether the testator\u2019s widow and step-son, who had been named as legatees, were embraced in the words \u201c heirs and relatives.\u201d- The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>court, having first determined that the words \u201c heir and legatees \u201d embraced the widow and step-son, further determined that the non-valuation of the real estate, and the fact of the widow\u2019s house having been devised for life, should not stand in the way of a carrying out of the intent of the testator, and it was, therefore, adjudged that, the value of the real estate should be ascertained by an auditor and that the widow should take the same interest in the residuary legacy that she took in the real estate, viz., a life interest. In determining, however, as to whether such is a proper construction of the residuary clause here, we must take into account all portions of the will which are at variance with that theory.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b683-4\"><em>H. A. Zieber, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOe\">The intent of the testator was plain, and there is no necessity to construe that which needs no construction. Deck\u2019s Ap., 78 Pa. 482; Lieber\u2019s Hermeneutics, 299, note k.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-5\">The word \u201camount\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201camount of money\u201d; it means anything that can be summed up or added together. The word \u201cbequeath\u201d may include both devise and legacy. 1 Jarman on Wills, 146. It is used in item 17 to mean devise. This case is ruled by Hoff and Tucker\u2019s Ap., 28 Pa. 51. The courts will follow such precedents.
