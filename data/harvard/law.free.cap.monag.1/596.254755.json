[Safford <em>v. </em>McCallin et al.]</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b644-8\">The <em>department of a%vards </em>of the city of Pittsburgh awarded a contract for two fire engines to the Manchester Locomotive Works at $5,000 for each engine. There were two other bidders, each of whom offered to supply the engines for $4,575 for each engine. On a bill in equity, by a taxpayer, against the individual members of the department of awards, to restrain the department of awards from entering into a <em>contract </em>on behalf of the city with the Manchester Company, it was alleged that the award was exorbitant, unlawful and fraudulent, and that the specifications called for boilers with copper tubes but the award was made for an engine with a flue boiler, which is not so good. The answer denied the allegations of fraud and averred that the department of awards, after due consideration, had decided that, taking all things into consideration, the bid of the Manchester company was the <em>lowest responsible bid, </em>that the engine offered by them was a better engine than the others, that it would cost less for repairs, that it had been in use in Pittsburgh for many years and was better understood by the firemen, and that it was supplied with the Endicott platform spring, not included in the specifications, which was a most important consideration in the purchase of steam engines. The answer further averred that the flue boilers and tubular boilers were substantially the same and equally good. The court below granted a <em>preliminary injunction </em>on the ground that, while the department of awards acted in good faith, their discretion was limited to the responsible character of the bidder, under the Act of May 24,1887. <em>Held, </em>that the injunction should he dissolved.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b644-9\">Feb. 2, 1889.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8tH\">Appeal, No. 41, Oct.

All such contracts shall be let openly and awarded publicly, in the common council chamber, to the lowest responsible bidder on yea and nay vote, of which record shall be kept, and no contract exceeding fifty dollars in amount shall be binding upon the city of Pittsburgh until the same shall have been reported to and approved by the councils thereof, and, when so approved, the head of the proper departments shall make and execute such contracts in behalf of the city for the departments. All contracts shall be awarded after due public notice, as now provided by law, upon such specifications as shall be approved by the department of awards.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-5\">4 and 5. That J. O. Brown, chief of the department of public safety, advertised for two extra first-size steam fire engines, with certain specifications for the same, giving the advertisement and specifications. 6. That there were three bids: one by the Manchester Locomotive Works for $5,000 for each engine; one by the Clapp <em>&amp; </em>Jones Manufacturing Co. for $4,575 for each engine; and one from the La France Fire Engine Co. for $4,575 for each engine. 7.

That the specifications called for boilers of the best steel with copper tubes, but that the award was made for an engine, the style of which is a flue boiler, and not a tubular boiler, and that the tubular boiler is superior to the flue boiler. 14. That the Clapp <em>&amp; </em>Jones Manufacturing Co. offered to give a guarantee as to the working of their engines. 15 and 16. That the proposals submitted by the department of awards for the testing of the different competing steam hre engines was not made in good faith and was unfair. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">\u2022 The prayers were for preliminary injunction, thereafter to be made final, restraining the defendants from entering into any contract or agreement on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>tbe engines of the Manchester Locomotive Works; and further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">The answer averred, in substance, as follows : 1. That Safford is not the owner of any real estate in the city of Pittsburgh and is not a tax-payer of the city. 2. Admitted the averments in the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th and Yth paragraphs of the bill. 3. Denied the averments in the 8th paragraph, and averred that the contracts for the Manchester engines had been approved by the councils of the city of Pittsburgh. 4.

Denied the averments in the 11th paragraph of the bill and averred that the award was neither exor^ bitant, unlawful nor fraudulent. Y. In answer to the 12th and 13th paragraphs of the bill, averred that the bid of the Manchester Locomotive Works did comply with the specifications and that the flue boilers and tubular boilers were practically one and the same thing, and denied that tubular boilers were superior to flue boilers as used on fire engines. 8. Did not deny the guarantee offered by the Clapp &amp; Jones Manufacturing Co. averred in the 14th paragraph of the bill. 9. Denied the averments in the 15th and 16th paragraph of the bill. 10. Averred that the department of awards, acting in entire good faith, awarded the contract to the Manchester Locomotive Works for the two fire engines and that said award was approved by both branches of the councils of the city of Pittsburgh. That the proposals were duly advertised .and that bids were received for th\u00e9 fire engines as follows: From the Manchester Locomotive Works, June 11,1888; .from the Clapp &amp; Jones Manufacturing Co., June 15, 1888; and from the La France Fire Engine Co., June 16, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-8\">That the La France Co., among other things, proposed, with its bid, that a public test should be made wherein all competing engines should appear and that the department of awards considering this, accepted it, with slight modifications, and that, after this acceptance and a notification to all the companies, both the La France and the Clapp &amp; Jones Manufacturing Co. declined to compete. That the test was a fair and reasonable one and in substantial compliance with the proposal of the La France Engine Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-9\">That the different bids were opened and considered by the department of awards, and, after due consideration thereof, said department concluded that, taking all things into consideration, the bid of the Manchester Locomotive Works was the lowest responsible bid. That, in determining this question, the department of awards considered, among other things, that the Amoskeag engine, manufactured by the Manchester Locomotive Works, had been in use in the city of Pittsburgh since 1861, with most favorable results to the city, and that it was believed to be, and the department of awards believed it to be, a superior engine to that of the La France Co. or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the Clapp &amp; Jones Manufacturing Co. That neither the La France nor the Clapp <em>&amp; </em>Jones engines had ever been used in the city, and that, if the same were purchased or used, it would require the employment of engineers and the training of them for. the handling of such engines, because they were of different construction from the Amoskeag engine, which was in general use in the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-4\">That the Amoskeag engine had what is known as the \u201c Endicott platform spring,\u201d which is a patented article and is so constructed as to protect the machinery of the engine from jars and displacements in running over the rough streets of the city, and that, in the judgment of the department of awards, the Endicott platform spring was a most important consideration in the purchase of steam fire engines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-5\">That the Amoskeag was of the more simple construction and less liable to become out of order and much more likely to bear the strain and service of a steam fire engine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-6\">That for these, among other, reasons, which involved the particulars of the construction of the different engines, they believed that it was better for the city of Pittsburgh to award the contract to the Manchester Locomotive Works than to either of the competing companies, and that, all things considered, the Manchester Locomotive Works\u2019 bid was the lowest responsible bid for the engines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-7\">Affidavits were filed by both parties in support and denial of the allegations of the bill and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-8\">The La France Company\u2019s offer included numerous of their patents of the various parts of the engine. The Clapp <em>&amp; </em>Jones Company\u2019s offer included their patents of the various parts. The Manchester Works offered to furnish the engines \u201cin strict accordance with the plans and specifications \u201d of the department of awards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\">The court below granted a preliminary injunction, -in an opinion reported in 6 Pa. C. C. R. 101, by White, J., on the ground that, while the department of awards acted in good faith, their discretion was limited to the responsible character of the bid or bidder, under the Act of May 23, 1814, \u00a7 6, P. L. 230.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-10\">On Dec. 6, 1888, after argument, the preliminary injunction was continued until the further order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-11\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court, 1, in granting the preliminary injunction, restraining the letting of a contract by the city of Pittsburgh to the Manchester Locomotive Works for two fire engines; '2, in continuing said preliminary injunction and in making the order of Dec. 6, 1888.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b647-12\"><em>D. T. </em>Watson, with him <em>W. C. </em>Moreland, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmqK\">The city of Pittsburgh was not made a party to the bill and any decree affecting it is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-13\">The bid of the Manchester Locomotive Works was the only bid that complied with the specifications.

In the absence of fraud, the board having, in good faith, decided that the Manchester Locomotive Works was the lowest responsible bidder, this is conclusive and the court below had no power to revise it.
