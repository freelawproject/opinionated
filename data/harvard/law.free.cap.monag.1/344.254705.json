James Finan, the above-named plaintiff, resides in the \u2022township of Overton, Bradford county, Pa., and is the owner of \u25a0a certain detached portable steam sawmill. He has no lumber of his own to saw, and said mill never has been set upon plaintiff\u2019s own land. In the latter part of 1885 he\" purchased said mill and set it up and used it in Terry township, Bradford county, Pa., till the \u00a1spring of 1886, when he moved it into Albany township, where it now is. It appears to have been assessed in Terry township for the year 1886 as real estate, a \u201c Steam S. Mill,\u201d and valued at $840. Plaintiff had no knowledge of said assessment prior to its removal into Albany township, and never was called upon for any taxes thereon. The same mill is now assessed in Albany township, Brad-Lord county, Pa., as real estate, \u201c Steam Mill,\u201d and valued at $840.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">\u201c II. On the day of appeals for Albany township aforesaid, plaintiff, with his counsel, James Wood, appeared before the commissioners of Bradford county at their office in Towanda borough, \u2022and objected to the valuation set upon said mill by the assessor, and \u00a1also objected to any assessment whatsoever, upon the ground that \u25a0said mill is not real estate, nor assessable, nor taxable by virtue of \u00a1any law of the state of Pennsylvania. No decision was reached on that day, and plaintiff and his counsel left with the understanding that the case was to have further consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">\u201c III. The fair, assessable value of said mill is $400, as compared with other mills of like nature that have been assessed. For two years past, mills of like character have been assessed and the taxes paid thereon by their owner in said county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-10\">\u201c IY. The said mill consists of a flue boiler and fire-box 16 feet long by about 3 feet in diameter, and smoke-stack 40 feet high, steam engine,' line shaft or spindle, with belt and balance wheels, circular and cut-off and edging saws with frames for each, carriage bed, carriage and bull wheel.

The engine is firmly fastened to a log 11 feet long and about 16 inches square, which is carried with the mill wherever it goes, and is called \u2018 the engine bed.\u2019 This 'bed piece is fastened by wooden keys or wedges to two logs leveled and firmly supported by earth and stones. The engine and its fixtures and machinery, run thereby, are sheltered by a structure substantially as follows r A number of large logs sawed off from <em>1 </em>to 9 feet in length are set-upon end, supported by stones or timbers, and upon them are placed three heavy stringers about 50 feet in length each, and this foundation is braced by planks spiked across the sides and ends. Upon-these stringers rest 14 cross-beams, 24 feet long each, and in them, notches are cut, and the carriage bed and saw frames are dropped in and fastened with wooden keys or wedges ; so that the entire machinery mentioned in paragraph IY. of this bill can be loosened, detached and made ready for removal by removing the keys and wedges aforesaid.
