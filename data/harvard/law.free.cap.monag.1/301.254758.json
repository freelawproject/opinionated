Shirk, Esq.: By.deed dated Aug. 20,' 18Y2, Joseph, Gingrich and Catharine, his wife, granted and conveyed unto William W. Murray, and to his heirs and assigns, several tracts of land, and undivided interests in several other tracts, and also all his and their estate, goods, chattels and effects, and property of every-kind, real, personal and mixed, excepting and reserving unto them goods and chattels, articles and thing's, to the amount of three hundred dollars to be selected by them, in trust, however, and to the intent and purpose that he the said William W. Murray shall, and do, as soon as convenient, sell and dispose of all the lands' of him the said Joseph Gingrich, either at public or private sale, in the' whole or in such lots, parts or parcels as the said trustee may deem to the best interest of his said cestui qiie trusts, and execute and deliver the proper deeds of conveyance to the purchasers thereof in fee simple, and also to sell and dispose of the goods and chattels not' above reserved, and collect and recover all the outstanding claims and debts to him due, and, with the moneys arising therefrom, after deducting his reasonable costs and charges, shall and will pay'the' creditors of the said Joseph Gingrich their respective demands in full, if not, pro rata, according to the amount of their respective demands, without preference- as between individuals; and in the further trust and confidence that the said William W. Murray, shall and do invest the surplus, if any, in such real estate as he may deem proper after consultation with his cestui que [trustent omitted] for their use during their joint lives and the life of the survivor of them. They or the survivor of them to keep the same in proper repair and pay the taxes thereon, and to receive the rents, issues and profits' thereof, provided, however, that the life estate, or income, shall never be sold or disposed of by the recipients nor by process of law-for their or either of their debts hereafter contracted. And at and immediately after the death of the survivor of them) the said property to vest in -their children or their legal representatives in' fee simple as tenants in common.

Provided, also, that in case of sale of any of said property, or investment of any of said surplus as aforesaid, the same shall only be consumated after consultation with and approval of Henry Gingrich and Cyrus Gingrich, brothers of said Joseph Gingrich.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-4\">On the same day, Aug. 20, 1872, Joseph\u2019s brothers, Henry and Cyrus, advanced $16,000, which was used to pay off a judgment against a farm, part of the real estate conveyed by Joseph, upon which an execution had issued. The assignee and trustee sold the farm to Henry Gingrich. The latter resold it at an advance, reimbursed himself and his brother, Cyrus, out of the purchase money and turned the balance over to the trustee. This balance, some $11,000, was invested in various securities but no part of it was ever invested in real estate. Catharine Gingrich died May 21, 1882. The trustee named in the deed died ana successive trustees were appointed, the last being Geo. Hoffman, who filed his account, to which exceptions were taken by David C. Gingrich, the appellant, a son of Joseph Gingrich, the settlor, and the auditor appointed. Joseph Gingrich, the surviving settlor, executed a deed of revocation Oct. 12, 1887, after the appointment of the auditor. The auditor\u2019s authority was extended by the court to enable him to decide if the revocation was valid and how it affected the fund. The auditor held that the deed of Aug. 20, 1872, vested an absolute estate in the children of Joseph' Gingrich and that the deed of revocation was inoperative. Exceptions to this report were filed by the trustee and by Joseph Gingrich.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">. The exceptions were sustained, in the following opinion of the \u25a0court below, by McPherson, J.: \u201e</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">\u201c The principal question for decision is, whether the children of Joseph Gingrich took a vested interest under the deed of trust of Aug. 20, 1872. Their mother\u2019s interest was no doubt a vested one. During her lifetime, the trust was beyond her husband\u2019s power. Ritter\u2019s Ap., 59 Pa. 9. She is dead, however, and her interest did not survive her, so that it is now important to determine whether the language concerning the children gave them also a present interest in 1872, postponing merely the time of enjoyment; or whether it is. testamentary in its character, intended to give them interest and enjoyment at the same time, namely, at the death of the surviving grantor. If their interest vest\u00e9d in 1872, the trust, \u2022although.voluntary, is irrevocable, because it has been executed and a present beneficial interest has been given to third persons. Rick\u2019s Ap., 105 Pa., on page 536; Nagle\u2019s Estate, recently decided in the orphan\u2019s court of this county. If, on tlm other hand, their interest is testamentary, and the trust was only for the convenience of the grantors, it is revocable.

R. 347.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ay2\">\u201c The auditor thought \u25a0 the children\u2019s interest was vested, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>refused to give effect to the deed of revocation, deciding rightly if his construction of the deed of trust be correct. We are obliged to \u25a0come to a different conclusion, however, believing that the deed of trust gives the children no interest until after the death of the surviving grantor. The language of the deed seems to require this construction. There are no words of present conveyance to the children, either direct or indirect; the trust is for the use of the grantors \u00a3 during their joint lives and the life of the survivor of them.\u2019 They, and not the trustee, are. to repair the realty to be bought, pay the taxes upon it and receive its income; if any surplus remained after the contemplated purchase of real estate, it was to be invested and the interest paid regularly to the grantors, and it was only \u00a3 at and immediately after the death of the survivor of them \u2019 that the said property was \u00a3 to vest to their children or their legal representatives in fee simple as tenants in common.\u2019 It may \u25a0even be, that this provision applies only to such real estate as might be bought, and, in that event, it would be necessary to treat the fund as real estate before the children\u2019s interest could attach, since, in fact, no realty was ever purchased; but we lay no weight upon this point, and, for present purposes, treat the provision as applying to realty and personalty alike. Even thus considered, the intention \u2022of grantors seems to us to be clear; the children were to have no interest until after the death of the surviving grantor; only then was it to vest, and the conclusion appears to follow that this provision is in substance testamentary and therefore revocable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\"><em>\u201c </em>In other respects, also, the trust was solely for the grantors\u2019 benefit and convenience ; the evidence does not make out a trust to protect themselves against improvidence or evil habits, and we can see no distinction between the case before us and the decisions in Frederick\u2019s Appeal and Nick\u2019s Appeal. Upon these authorities, we hold this trust to he revocable since the death of Mrs. Gingrich, and, as it has in fact been revoked, the fund must be awarded to Joseph Gingrich.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court in holding, 1, that the children of Joseph and Catharine Gingrich had no vested interest under the deed of trust; 2, that the interest of the children of Joseph and Catharine Gingrich did not vest until after the death of the surviving grantor; 3, that the deed of trust was testamentary in its character and revocable; 4, that the deed of trust was revoked by deed of revocation dated Oct. 12, 1887; \u25a05, that <em>\u201c </em>the trust was solely for the grantor\u2019s benefit and convenience, the evidence does not make out a trust to protect themselves against improvidence or evil habits6, in awarding the trust fund to Joseph Gingrich; 7, in holding that David C.

That the wife, Catharine Gingrich, took a vested interest, under said deed, is clear. It follows that the husband could not have interfered with the trust during the life of the latter. She is dead, however, and the case is entirely different as to the children. Their interest did not vest with the execution and delivery of the deed; it was only intended to vest after the death pf both their parents; or, in the language of the instrument itself: \u201cAnd at and immediately after the death of the survivor of them, the said property to vest in their children or their legal representatives in fee simple as tenants in common.\u201d The deed was testamentary in its character and therefore revocable under the authority of Frederick\u2019s Appeal, 52 Pa. 338; Rick\u2019s Appeal, 105.Id* 528, and that line of cases.
