It was stipulated that the coal company should not be held in damages for miner\u2019s strikes, and the iron company was not to be required to receive coal when their works were out of operation. The offer was accepted. Subsequently the iron company introduced natural gas into their works and almost entirely discontinued the use of coal. <em>Held, </em>that there could be no recovery of damages for failure to take coal, in place of natural gas, for the operations of the works.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b792-6\"><em>Query </em>whether, in such case, the defendant would be allowed to give <em>parol evidence </em>that a prior offer was made, on the same day, requiring the iron company to take sufficient coal to operate Iheir mill, that this was rejected for the reason that they did not intend to bind\u2019 themselves to take any quantity of coal but only what they would need, of which they were to be the judges; that the agreement in suit was then drawn up with the intention of expressing this understanding, and was executed; and that, if it had not been for the modification, it would not have been executed by the iron company.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b792-7\">Oct. 15, 1888.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AoOP\">Error, No. 86, Oct.

It being in evidence that, at the time the contract was made by the parties, coal was the only fuel being used or that was then accessible and suitable to be used in this mill, we instruct you as a matter of law, that this is a proper interpretation and construction of the terms of this contract.\u201d] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b793-9\">The defendants presented these points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b793-10\">\u201c 1. The acceptance by the defendants of the offer made by the plaintiff, to supply the iron company with what coal it would require for the mill for three years from November 1, 1882, at the prices named, did not bind the defendant company to use coal during the said term, exclusive of any other fuel. <em>Ans. </em>Refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b793-11\">\u201c 2. The acceptance by the defendants of the offer made by the plaintiff to supply the iron company with what coal it would require for its mill for three years from November 1, 1882, did not bind the defendant company to take coal in sufficient quantity to \u2022operate its said mill for three years from November 1, 1882, exclusive of any other fuel. <em>Ans. </em>Refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b793-12\">\u201c 3. By the true construction of the writing dated November 8, 1882, the defendant company was not bound to take coal in sufficient quantity to operate its mill, from the plaintiff, but was \u2022only bound to take what coal it saw fit to use in its mill at the prices named. <em>Ans. </em>Refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b793-13\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $1,767.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b793-14\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1-3, the refusal of defendants\u2019 points, quoting them; 4, the portion of the charge above, quoting it; and, 5, 6, the rulings on the evidence, quoting the bills of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b793-15\"><em>J.

Chit. Cont. 79. Suppose it is discovered that iron can be made without coal, must the company still take coal ? They were t\u00f3 be the judge under the contract, of the quantity of coal they would receive for their mill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b793-16\">It was gross error to exclude the testimony of Jonathan Allison.

The effort was to show what Duncan understood the contract to be. It is not claimed that any declarations were made which induced the signing. Spencer <em>v. </em>Colt, 89 Pa. 314, is squarely against the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b794-9\">The evidence was intended to vary the written contract and was properly excluded.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHr\">This case is all wrong, and must be reversed. The following seems to be the contract under which the parties contestant operated:</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">\u201c Canonsburg, Pa., November 8, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">\u201cCanonsburg Iron Co., Limited, Canonsburg, Pa.: We will agree to supply you with what coal you require for your mill for three years from November 1, 1882, at the following prices, delivered at your works; you to build the necessary bridge, make and keep the road in good condition during this contract: Forked coal, $4.10 per 100 bushels; run of mines, $3.30 per 100 bushels ; slack, $1.50 per 100 bushels. Payment to be made, in cash, on or before the fifth of each month\u2019s delivery. This price is based on the three and a half cent mining rate, and, should the same be advanced at any time durihg this contract, the price of coal will be correspondingly advanced ; that is to say, if the mining in the Pittsburg district should advance half a cent, our price to you will then be as follows: Forked coal, $4.85 per hundred bushels; run of mines, $3.95 per hundred bushels; slack, $2.00. We will use our best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>efforts to give you your full requirement daily, but not to be held in damages for miner\u2019s strikes, or causes beyond our control; neither will we require you to receive coal should your works be out of operation at any time. Should coal not prove satisfactory after thirty days\u2019 trial, this contract to be null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">From this it is obvious that no limit was, by the contract, put upon the discretion of the defendants as to the amount of coal they were to use in the mill. It might be much, little, or none at all. What coal was necessary for consumption in their works they must take from the plaintiffs. This is all they were bound to do, and all the plaintiffs were bound to furnish them, and it was of no consequence whether the falling off in that consumption was occasioned by the contraction of their business, or- by the introduction of gas. In either case, less coal was necessary for the defendant\u2019s manufactory, and they were not obliged to pay for what they did not require.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
