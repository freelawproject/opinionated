The narr, as originally filed, alleged a contract <em>\u201c </em>to pay him, the said plaintiff, for such services, certain wages at the rate of two dollars and fifty cents for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>a day of ten hours, and twenty-five cents an hour for every hour of work done o.ver and above said ten hours.\u201d The bill of particulars set out the work in this way: \u201c Feb. 1. To ten hours\u2019 work at Chestnut Hill at 25c., $2.50.\u201d \u201cMarch 1. To ten hours\u2019 work at 25c., $2.50.\u201d And the other entries were similar in form. The pleas were non assumpsit, set-off, and payment with leave.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">At the first trial, before Peirce, J., it appeared that the plaintiff included, in the ten hours, the time it took him to go to and from work. The court charged the jury that the plaintiff would not be required to travel in time outside of his working hours. The verdict and judgment were for the plaintiff. Reversed and new venire ordered. See 121 Pa.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s narr was then, by leave of court, amended by striking out, the words \u201cof ten hours\u201d and \u201cof ten hours each\u201d wherever they occurred, and also the words \u201c over and above said ten hours and inserting, in lieu of the latter, the words \u201c over time counting the same as time and half time.\u201d The bill of particulars was amended to read as follows: \u201c Feb. 1. To one day\u2019s wages, $2.50,\u201d and the like to the end; and closing with this averment: \u201c Said wages being due the plaintiff from defendant upon an agreement made between plaintiff and defendant, wherein defendant agreed to pay plaintiff two dollars and fifty cents a day for tile laying, etc.\u201d The plaintiff claimed also for thirty-five hours of extra night work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-10\">At the second trial, before Allison, P. <em>J., </em>the plaintiff testified that-he was employed by the day at $2.50 per day, that he left home at 5.45 a. m. to go to his work and left work when he could no longer see, as other mechanics did, making probably eight and a half hours or nine hours\u2019 actual work; he admitted testifying on the former trial that he was to receive $2.50 for a day of ten hours, at the rate of twenty-five cents an hour, but said that that was a mistake, that that was the way the time was to be turned in, the defendant keeping his books in that way. Returns were made once a month, and wages were paid monthly. Plaintiff kept a memorandum book, in which he entered ten hours for each day; but he testified that he made the entries in this way at the defendant\u2019s request. The defendant testified that the plaintiff was employed by the month, to work ten hours a day, at twenty-five cents an hour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-11\">The defendant submitted, inter alia, the following points, which were refused:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-12\">\u201c 3.

Impossibility of performance would probably relieve from a contract, but the question \u25a0of impossibility or impracticability and, in general, the terms of the \u2022contract, should have been left to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-13\"><em>J.

The ten-hour feature was introduced into the pleadings, as originally filed, throiigh the misapprehension of counsel, who mistook the monthly returns for plaintiff\u2019s book account. Those returns were made for \u2022the defendant\u2019s accommodation and by his direction, to show the number of hours to be charged to the particular job. As it is \u2022admitted that payment was to be made at the rate of twenty-five \u2022cents an hour, that is really a qualification of any part of the contract requiring ten hours\u2019 work.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AnB\">Feb. 18, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-14\">Williams, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJud\">The terms of the contract, under which the work claimed for in this case was done, were in dispute. The plaintiff in the court below alleged the hiring to be by the day \u00a1and denied that the length of the day was provided for. He testified \u25a0as follows: \u201c No hours were mentioned. I was to work by the day. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>We worked as long as we could see.\u201d The defendant, on the other-hand, testified that the hiring1 was by the month and that each day\u2019s work was to consist of ten hours\u2019 labor. The questions for the jury, therefore, were, first, what was the contract between the parties?' and, second, for what amount is the plaintiff entitled to recover-under its provisions ? The court was asked to say to the jury, by defendant\u2019s third point, that if they should find the hiring was-by the day of ten hours each, the plaintiff could not recover for parts of days where his failure to work was not due to any interference or neglect of the defendant. This the court refused and, instead, laid down the following binding instruction : \u201c Now, though,, according to the contract as stated by the defendant, ten hours was to constitute a day\u2019s work, yet it provided that he was to be paid twenty-five cents an hour. That is a qualification of that part of the-contract calling for ten hours a day and entitles the plaintiff to recover for the time actually made.\u201d The court, by this instruction, disposed of the first question of fact and left nothing for the jury but the computation of the amount due upon the contract thus-found for them. This was error. Nor is it easy to see why the-third point should not have been affirmed. , If the defendant contracted to work ten hours each day, and, without any sufficient reason, disregarded his agreement, working only eight or six, or-whatever other number of hours he pleased, without regard to his contract obligation, he was in no position to sue upon a contract which he had steadily disregarded. An averment of substantial performance, or of readiness and an offer to perform, are necessary on the part of one who sues upon a contract. The terms of the hiring, under the evidence in this case, were for the jury, and, if found to be as assumed in the third point, the defendant was entitled, to the instruction prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Judgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">H.
