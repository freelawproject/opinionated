McOlintock against the Bellevue Cemetery Co., of Allegheny Co., James Andrews; Thompson Bell and others, at April T. 1878, No. 546. Sterrbtt, J., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-7\">Further facts appear in Bell\u2019s Appeal, 115 Pa. 88, and Andrews\u2019s Appeal, above, page 126.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-8\">The case was referred to H. S. Floyd, Esq., as master, who reported that there was due by Thompson Bell $4000 for balance of unpaid subscriptions to stock, and that the corporation was insolvent from its organization. The master\u2019s report on this subject was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-9\">\u201c It was contended by Mr. Purviance, attorney for Heath &amp; Speer, defendants and creditors in said case, that the amount found as due by Thompson Bell on his capital stock is incorrect, and should be $7,000 instead of $4,000, for the reason that the entry of credit of May 23, 1876, \u2018 Bond account, $3,000,\u2019 in the stock ledger of said company, the same being offered in evidence, was not a proper credit and should not be allowed as such. This account, as it appears from the exhibit, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-15\">\u201cstock ledger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-16\">\u201c SHOWING ACCOUNT OP THOMPSON BELL.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-17\">\u201c1873.

The master, after having found that the Bellevue Cemetery Co. was never solvent, but was insolvent from its organization, should have disallowed the credit claimed by the estate of Thompson Bell by way of payment or set-off under date of May 23, 1876, specified as \u2018 bond account \u2019 of $3,000, and, disallowing the same, should have charged the estate of Thompson Bell with a balance of stock subscription of $7,000 instead of $1,000, and in not so disallowing said claim credit of $3,000, and charging the estate of Thompson Bell with a balance of $7,000 instead of $1,000, the master has erred.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-8\">The court below overruled the exceptions and entered a decree against Bell for $1,000 with interest from Nov. 1, 1875. On October 22, 1887, after final decree was entered, the complainant moved to amend the bill so as to charge Thompson Bell with $7000. The -court refused to allow the amendment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-9\">McCullough, the Receiver of the Cemetery Company, took this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-10\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1-2, the action of the court in overruling complainant\u2019s exceptions, quoting them; 3, the decree against Bell for $1,000 with interest, quoting it, instead of $7,000, with interest; and, 1, the refusal of the court to permit the amendment of the bill, quoting the motion and the order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b749-11\"><em>C. C. Dickey </em>and <em>W. S. Purviance </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An6z\">The master erred in allowing Bell credit for the $3,000 : 1. Because it was not a credit for cash but for a bond, and the stock subscription called for cash. 2. Because the entry was indefinite and vague as to date, and the burden of explaining it was on the party claiming the benefit of it. 3. The corporation being insolvent, Bell could not pay his debt to the corporation by the corporation\u2019s debt to him. Lane\u2019s Ap.,105 Pa. 49; Hays <em>v. </em>Lycoming Fire Ins. Co., 98 Pa. 184; Same <em>v. </em>Same, 99 Pa. 621.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-12\">The amendment should have been allowed. In Darlington\u2019s Ap., 86 Pa. 523, this court held that when a bill in equity is incomplete, but has substance by which to amend, amendment will be allowed in the supreme court, if necessary.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AY8o\">Jan. 7, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b749-13\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"AYDg\">This appeal is from the same decree as Andrew\u2019s Appeal, just recorded. [Reported above, page 126.] The first and second assignments allege that the master erred in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>charging Thompson Bell with the sum of $7,000 as the balance of his subscription unpaid, instead of with the sum of $4,000. The third assignment alleges error in the decree of the court based upon this finding of the master. We have nothing before us which would justify us in reversing the master upon this point. The supplemental bill by which Bell was made a party defendant charged him with owing $4,000 on his subscription. The books of the Company credit him with $3,000 on \u201cbond account,\u201d and if the fact be that the corporation was insolvent from the first, yet it was doing business, and there is nothing to show that Bell or the board of directors knew of the insolvency. It may be that Bell should be charged with the whole of the $4,000, but it has not been made clear. The motion to amend the bi\u00fc after final decree was properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
