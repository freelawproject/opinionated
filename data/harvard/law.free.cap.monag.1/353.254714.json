L. 199, which provides \u2018that the taxes laid upon manufacturing corporations, by and under the revenue laws of the commonwealth, be and the same are hereby abolished as to such corporations, and the laws, under which such taxes are laid and collected, be and the same are hereby repealed, so far, and so far only, as they apply to and affect manufacturing corporations.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-17\">\u201c This Act is entitled, \u2018A further supplement to an Act to provide revenue by taxation.\u2019 This title, we think, fairly embraces the subject matter of the 20th section. In an Act \u2018 to provide revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>by taxation,\u2019 new subjects of taxation may be enumerated, the taxes may lie increased or diminished or entirely abolished upon property already subject to taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">\u201c \u2018 The revenue laws of the commonwealth,\u2019 referred to in this section, are those which provide revenue for the commonwealth, as distingrushed from those which provide revenue for county, borough, school and township purposes. This, we think, is the plain meaning of the Act, and it does not, therefore, offend against the 2d section of article ix of the constitution by attempting to exempt the property of these corporations from all taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">\u201cBy the Act of April 15, 1834, Purd. 1583, \u2018manufactories of all descriptions\u2019 are subject to taxation as real estate.

Mix </em>and <em>Henry </em>Strecter, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqrL\">The Act of June 7, 1879, imposed a tax on the dividends and stock of manufacturing companies. By the Act of April 15,1834, P. L. 509, \u00a7 4, \u201creal estate, viz.: all houses, lands . . . mills and manufactories of all descriptions,\u201d were directed to be assessed for county taxes. By the Act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320, \u00a7 2, boroughs have the power to \u201clevy and collect annually for borough purposes any tax not exceeding one-half cent on the dollar on . . . all property . . . made taxable . . . for county rates and levies.\u201d By the Act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 623, \u00a7 29, all subjects or things made taxable for state and county purposes are taxable for school purposes. And by the Act June 4, 1879, P. L. 78, \u00a7 14, poor taxes ai\u2019e directed to \u201c be levied . . . and shall be collected in the same manner as the county taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-11\">The Act of 1885 cannot be construed to abolish and repeal only the revenue laws which levy and collect a state tax, because the language used therein is too broad and comprehensive. It could not refer to the Act of June 7, 1879, alone, as the plural number is used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-12\">If it had been intended to exempt manufacturing companies from taxation for state purposes only, the same, or similar phraseology would have been used as was used in the Act of May 22,1883, P. L. 38, exempting building associations from taxation for state purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-13\">The intention of the legislature in repealing the taxes cannot be misunderstood, in view of the well known fact that so many manufacturing corporations of this state were seeking locations elsewhere, on account of the local authorities claiming the right to tax their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>necessary and indispensable works and improvements as real estate, and the shares of capital stock in the hands of the individual owners, in addition to the taxes for state purposes on the capital stock when <em>the </em>plant had been obtained by the issue of the capital stock paid for by the money of the stockholders, which is in fact the identical \u25a0capital stock represented by the stock certificates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-4\">Based upon the assumption that they are now wholly exempt from taxation, a bill is at present pending in the legislature, which, if it becomes a law, will impose taxes upon them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">The Act of 1885 was construed and pronounced constitutional '\u25a0by the supreme court in Fox\u2019s Ap., 112 Pa. 337; Van Nort\u2019s Ap., 121 Pa. 118; Sanderson\u2019s Ap., 17 W. N. C. 456; Loughlin\u2019s Ap., 19 W. N. C. 517; MacKellar, Smiths <em>&amp; </em>Jordan Co. <em>v. </em>Com., 10 Cent. R. 45; and cases on the State Tax on Corporate Loans, Com. <em>v. </em>Del. Division Canal Co., 23 W. N. C. 216.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">In Fox\u2019s Ap., supra, \u00a7 20 of the Act was sharply criticized by Mr. Justice Paxson, while in MacKellar <em>v. </em>Com., supra, the section was expressly upheld.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-7\">The Act and \u00a7 20 thereof has been construed and declared constitutional in the lower courts by Judge McPherson in Com. <em>v. </em>Atlantic Refining Co., 2 Pa. C. C. R. 62; Com. <em>v. </em>Quaker City Dye Works Co., 5 Pa. C. C. R. 94; Com. <em>v. </em>Mahoning Rolling Mill Co., 5 Pa. C. C. R. 95.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-8\">While it is admitted the cases cited do not decide the question raised here, the section being constitutional, and the repealing clause embracing all prior laws which are \u201c inconsistent \u201d with or \u201c substantially re-enacted\u201d by the Act, as was held in Loughlin\u2019s Appeal, supra, is decisive of the position and claim of the appellant here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-9\">Previous to the Act of 1885, all shares of stock in corporate \u25a0companies were subject to taxation for all state and county purposes whatsoever, by \u00a7 32 of the Act of April 29, 1844, P. L. 497; and, in Whitesell <em>v. </em>Northampton Co., 49 Pa. 526, it was held the shares are taxable to the owners personally; but \u00a7 1 of the Act of 1885, repeals \u00a7 32 of the Act of 1844, and jxrovides that mortgages and moneyed capital shall be taxed for state purposes at the rate of three mills on the dollar of the value thereof, annually; \u201cProvided, that the same shall, after the passage of this Act, be exempt from Ml taxation except for state purposes.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-10\"><em>J. </em>McPherson, with him <em>E.

Carbon Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Carbon Co., 39 Pa. 251; Lackawanna Iron <em>&amp; </em>Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Luzerne Co., 42 Pa. 424; Northampton Co. <em>v. </em>Glendon Iron Co., C. P., 1 Lehigh Valley L. R. 81.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-11\">Section 20 of the Act of 1885 is not germane to the title, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>article in, \u00a7 3, of the constitution. The title must embrace the subject of the Act, and also express it so clearly as to give notice of the legislative purpose concerning it. Dorsey\u2019s Ap., 72 Pa. 195; Union Passenger Railway Co.\u2019s Ap., 81* Pa. 91; Beckert <em>v. </em>City of Allegheny, 85 Pa. 196; Road in Borough of Phoenixville, 109 Pa. 44; Rogers <em>v. </em>Manufacturers\u2019 Imp. Co., 109 Pa. 109; Ruth\u2019s Ap., 10 W. N. C. 500; Hatfield <em>v. </em>Com., 120 Pa. 395.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">If a title to exempt from taxation does not authorize legislation imposing taxation, as was decided in Sewickley Borough <em>v. </em>Sholes, 118 Pa. 165, the converse must be true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">Section 20 of the Act of June 30, 1885, is in conflict with article ix, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, of the constitution. The legislature cannot exempt the real estate of some manufacturing corporations from taxation and leave that of others subject thereto. It can only exempt from taxation such property as the constitution authorizes it to exempt. Pox\u2019s Ap., 112 Pa. 355.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">Section 20 of the Act of 1885 is also an offender against clauses 23 and 27 of \u00a7 7 of article iii of the constitution; forbidding the passage of local legislation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">In the cases cited by appellant, the constitutionality of section 20 is not referred to; except in Pox\u2019s Appeal, where the decision of this point is expressly reserved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-9\">Courts treat an Act as constitutional until its constitutionality is called in question. County of Erie <em>v. </em>Comrs. of Erie, 113 Pa. 368; Sewickley Borough <em>v. </em>Sholes, 118 Pa. 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-10\">But, treating \u00a7 20 of the Act of June 30, 1885, as constitutional, what is the scope of it ? Legislation in this state for many years past has been in the line of a settled policy to provide revenue for state purposes by taxation in various forms upon corporations. The various \u2022 Acts passed in pursuance of this policy were revised, amended and consolidated by the Act of May 1, 1868, P. L. 108. This, in turn, was supplied by the Act of June 7 1879, P. L. 112, entitled, \u201cAn Act to provide revenue by taxation.\u201d This Act is purely a .state revenue Act. A supplement to it was passed June 10, 1881, P. L. 99. The Act of 1885 was a further supplement. The 2d proviso to \u00a7 20 of this supplement is as follows : Provided, This Act shall go into effect immediately, reserving and excepting unto the commonwealth the right to collect any taxes accrued under the laws repealed by this Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-11\">The 2d proviso of the section clearly shows that the \u201c taxes abolished\u201d are such as accrue to the commonwealth; and, 2d, that the \u201c laws repealed \u201d are the laws under which taxes accrue to the commonwealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-12\">The taxes claimed in this case are not \u201ctaxes laid upon\u201d a manufacturing corporation, as such, but they are taxes assessed upon real estate, as such, in the manner and for the purposes authorized by law. See Sanderson <em>v. </em>Comrs., 1 Pa. C. C. R. 342.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AR57\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>March 25, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b406-3\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"A76\">We affirm this decree upon the opinion of the learned judge of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Decree affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Note. \u2014 In Lackawanna Co. <em>v. </em>First Nat. Bank of Scranton, 94 Pa. 221, the Act of March 31,1870, which provides, in \u00a7 4, that, in case any bank or savings institution shall elect to collect and pay annually a tax of one per centum upon the par value of all the shares of said bank or savings institution, the said shares, capital and profits shall be exempt from all other taxation under the laws of this commonwealth, was held not to be a law exempting property from taxation within article ix, | 2, of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">This case also holds, in a per curiam opinion, that \u201c the banking house was a part of the capital of the institution represented by its shares of stock, and a tax upon the par value of the shares wms a tax upon it,\u201d and the bank building was held not liable to taxation for county purposes. This case, decided in 1880, seems necessarily to overrule Farmers\u2019 and Drovers\u2019 Nat. Bank <em>v. </em>Greene Co., 1 Ches. Co. 129, decided in 1874. In the latter case, the building was purchased with the profits or earnings of the bank, but this does not seem to be a distinguishing feature. It is said, in the overruled case, per curiam: \u201cThe meaning of the word \u2018 shares, capital and profits \u2019 is made plain by the general course of the state legislature as to taxes upon the shares, capital stock and dividends of corporations. The word capital does not, in the sense of its use in the Act of March 31,1870, refer to real estate \u00e1s a portion of the capital of the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In the case of N. Y. &amp; Erie R. R. <em>v. </em>Sabin, 26 Pa. 242, the railroad was a foreign corporation authorized to extend their road into Pennsylvaniia and, by the Act of March 26,1846, P. L. 179, additional privileges were conferred upon them, in consideration of which they were required to pay into the state treasury the sum of $10,000 annually and it was provided \u201c that the stock of said company to an amount equal to the cost of the construction of that part of their road situate in Pennsylvania shall be subject to taxation by this commonwealth in the same manner at the same rate as other similar property is or may be subject.\u201d \u201c It was held that it was the intention of the legislature, as manifest in these provisions, that whatever property of this corporation was included in the cost of construction and thus formed part of its capital stock should be subject to no other taxes than those specified in the Act.\u201d Per Sharswood, J., in East Penna. B. B. Co.\u2019s Case, 1 Walker, 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In the East Pa. R. R. Co.\u2019s Case, 1 Walker, 428, it was held that the office buildings, in the city of Beading, situated on a lot two and a half squares from the terminus of the railroad and which was purchased by the company, were taxable as real estate. So also were the following buildings erected upon a tract of 20 acres adjoining the main tract and acquired by right of eminent domain and charged in cost of construction: the machine shops in which the locomotive engines of the road are repaired, the blacksmith shop in \u25a0which the smithwork of the road is done, the carpenter shop in which the passenger and freight cars used on the road are built and repaired, and the paint shop in which new and repaired cars used on the road are painted, \u201c as they are not necessary parts of the railroad, but merely useful in order to enable them to conduct their operations more profitably and conveniently than if these matters were attended to by persons not in their regular employment.\u201d Per Sharswood, J., 1868. But the oil and waste house where oil and waste are stored, round house, turn tables, coal docks in which coal for locomotives is stored, water station and cattle yard, situated on this tract of 20 acres were held exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">In Northumberland Co. <em>v. </em>Phila. &amp; Erie R. R., 8 Cent. R. 531, 20 W. N. C. 381, a repair shop for repairing the freight cars and engines, used upon its road, an oil house and paint shop, an engine aud boiler house, a sujiply room for frogs, switches and other materials used upon its road, a master mechanic\u2019s office, and car inspector\u2019s office, situated on a lot of some 44 acres of land adjacent to the line of the railroad, were held to be exempt from taxation as real estate. In this case, however, the case stated agreed that these buildings were indispensably necessary to the operation of the railroad, which may distinguish it from the East Pa. R. R. Co.\u2019s Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>On the subject of duplicate taxation, Judge Cooley, in his work on Taxation, after reviewing the cases where the legislature has undoubted power to impose double taxation, says, on page 225: \u201c There is a sense, however, in which duplicate taxation may be understood \u2014 and which we think is the proper sense \u2014 which would render it wholly inadmissible under any constitution requiring equality and uniformity in taxation. By duplicate taxation in this sense is understood the requirement that one person or any one subject of taxation shall directly contribute twice to the same burden, while other subjects of taxation belonging to the same class are required to contribute but once. We do not see, for instance, how a tax on a merchant\u2019s stock distinctively by value could be supported, when, by the same authority and for the same purpose, the same stock was taxed by value as a part of his whole property. This is a very different thing from one tax upon property and another upon the business, though the latter may indirectly reach the property : here is no circumlocution, no question of ultimate effects; but a tax levied twice on the same subject, only under different names. The same may be said of a tax on the property of a corporation and also on the capital which is invested in the property; if the latter is taxed as property, this also is duplicate taxation, and as much unequal as would be the taxation of a farmer\u2019s stock by value when on the same basis it is taxed as a part of his general property. When, for instance, the money paid in as capital of a manufacturing corporation has been invested in buildings and machinery, these are what then represent the capital, and to tax the capital as valuable property distinct from that which then represents it would be to tax a mere shadow; it would be to make the shadow stand for the substance in order that it might be taxed, when the substance itself is taxed directly under its own proper designation. We do not speak here of a taxation of the property and also of the franchise, those being two things, as will be seen further on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In the case reported above, the tax as imposed upon the capital stock is for state purposes, while that imposed upon the real estate is for local purposes. These facts seem to take the case out of the rule stated by Judge Cooley above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
