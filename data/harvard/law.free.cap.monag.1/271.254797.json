T. 1888, to C. P. Chester \u25a0Co. to review a judgment of nonsuit in an action of trespass on the case, by Mary Kennedy against the Pa. R. R. Co., for the death of her husband, at Aug. Term, 1886, No. 77. Clark and Green, \u2022JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-11\">This action was brought to recover damages for the death of Harry Kennedy, the husband of the plaintiff, who was killed near Atglen, Chester county, June 22, 1885, by a dirt-train of the \u25a0defendant Railroad Co. The deceased was a trackman in the \u25a0employ of the defendant Company, and, on the day of his death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>was engaged, with two other workmen, in repairing the Company\u2019s track. While working, they were struck by a dirt-train, to which their backs were turned, and all three were instantly killed. The train consisted of seven low cars, making but little noise, and it was running with the engine reversed. The same train had been employed for 15 months prior to the date of the accident, in carrying dirt over the same section of road, making six trips daily, and constantly running reversed, with the cars pushed by the engine. At the time of the accident, a heavy freight-train was passing upon another track, making considerable noise. In the section on which the dirt-train ran was an abrupt curve through an unusually deep cut, which prevented the engineer from seeing those working on the track until too late to avoid striking them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\">Upon the trial, before Waddell, J., one of the witnesses, who lived upon a farm adjoining the railroad and saw the accident, having described how it took place, and also testified as to the practice of running the dirt-trains in this way, was asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\">\u201c Q. State, if you observed, whether that was a safe or dangerous method of running a train with the cars pushed in front of the engine, at the point at North Bend, immediately in front of the farm of your father, where you had occasion to observe it, during the fall, winter and spring preceding the accident; and, if dangerous, describe in what way it was dangerous, according to your observation ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">Counsel also offered to ask, in connection with this question, whether it was dangerous to the men employed as track hands at that particular point. Objected to, objection sustained and exception. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-9\">Another witness, who had ridden on the dirt-train, and was familiar with the curve and the manner of running the train, was then asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\">\u201c Q. At this point where the accident happened, would yon say, from your observation, that it was a more dangerous point, with the cars running ahead of the engine rather than with the engine in front?\u201d Objected to, objection sustained \u00e1nd exception. [2] '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony the court granted a nonsuit, and subsequently discharged a rule to take it off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-12\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court, 1, 2, in excluding the offers of testimony, quoting them; 3, in granting the nonsuit; and, 4, in discharging\u2019 the rule to take it off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-13\"><em>Alfred P.

If we concede that it was dangerous to run a train of gravel cars by pushing them with the locomotive, at the place in question, it was a danger well known to the deceased. He had been in the employ of the company for some time, and was working at the spot when the accident occurred. He had seen several trains daily passing and repassing in this manner. When he entered upon his employment, he took the risk of that employment. The danger of being run down by one of these gravel trains, whilst at his work, was constantly before him, and there is no room for an allegation that he did not know it. No elaboration could make this any clearer, and authorities, upon a principle of law so well settled, are not needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">Judgment affirmed. J. C.
