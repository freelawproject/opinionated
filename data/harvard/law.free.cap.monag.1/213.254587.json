In an action for damages for breach of an implied covenant for peaceable, undisturbed and legal possession, the <em>declaration </em>assigned, as a breach, that the defendant refused and still refuses to grant and deliver such possession. The plaintiff proved his lease, and testified as to his efforts to get possession. It seemed that the premises were in the possession of one Tully, a prior tenant, at the expiration of whose term the lessor issued a writ of habere facias possessionem and the sheriff returned that hehad delivered the premises to the defendant. The plaintiff admitted in his testimony that the defendant gave him duplicate keys when he and the defendant were alone in the house, and then, under objection that the evidence was inadmissible because the narr did not aver an eviction and that the plaintiff was concluded by the sheriff\u2019s return and his own evidence, offered <em>evidence </em>to prove that he had been prevented from obtaining or keeping possession by Tully, who held the original keys; also the acts of Tully in entering while he was in the house; the goods of Tully which had remained in the house; declarations by defendant of his failure to give possession to plaintiff; evidence of a verbal lease given by defendant to Tully for the period covered by plaintiff\u2019s lease; and the damages occasioned him, including the expenses of moving to and from the demised premises, the rent he had to pay for another house, and his loss in trade. <em>Held, </em>not to be error.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b261-6\">Counsel stated to the court that a witness had been subpoenaed, and an attachment placed in the hands of the sheriff on the morning of the trial, that the witness was not at his place of business, and that it was reported that he had left the county, and then offered <em>notes of testimony </em>of the witness, taken by the court stenographer upon a former trial of the case, under the Act of May 3,1887, <em>l </em>9, providing for the admission of notes of testimony if a witness \u201cafterward die, or be out of the jurisdiction, so that he cannot be effectively served with a subpoena, or if he cannot be found.\u201d <em>Seld, </em>to be inadmissible.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b261-7\">March 2, 1888.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2C\">Error, No. 199, July T. 1887, to C.

The rent w\u00e1s to be $400, and this was paid by the plaintiff in advance. At the time the lease was executed, the property was in the possession of one Tully, under a lease expiring April 1, 1885. Tully claimed that, under a verbal agreement with the defendant, he had a right to remain in possession for another year. He accordingly refused to surrender the premises. On April 2, the defendant entered an amicable action in ejectment upon Tully\u2019s lease, took judgment and obtained a writ of habere facias possessionem. Hnder this writ the sheriff entered upon the premises, removed some or all of Tully\u2019s goods and, when he and the plaintiff were alone in the house, delivered duplicate keys to the plaintiff and shortly afterward departed, leavihg the plaintiff in the house. A crowd had gathered outside, in sympathy \u2022with Tully, and his goods were soon moved back into the house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Tully, who still had the original keys, took possession and maintained it for another year.

We offer. Mr. Walker as a witness to read his testimony taken on the former trial of this case.\u201d Newton Walker, the stenographer, was then sworn: he testified that he took the notes\u2019 of the former trial, that the said notes were in his hands, and that he was ready to read them. .Objected to by plaintiff, objection sustained, and exception. [18.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">The court charged, inter alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\">[\u201cIt seems that Jacobs, the plaintiff, never entered into possession of the premises that were let to him. It has been testified to, and not contradicted, that Thomas Tully, the man who was in possession before April, 1885, continued in the possession of the premises aft\u00e9r the first day of April, and, I believe, for the whole succeeding year up to Apri\u00ed 1, 1886.\u201d] \u25a0 [20.] . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-10\">[\u201c On the second day of April, ... a writ of possession was issued to the sheriff, the sheriff went upon the premises that day, the second day of April; Tully asserted his right to remain upon the premises for another year, and Brennan and Jacobs were claiming that he had no such right, and Jacobs was trying to get into the house and Brennan was trying to put him in. [21.] . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEB\">[\u201cPerhaps most of the time that this'trial has taken has been consumed in showing what was done in attempting to deliver possession to Jacobs, or whether- possession was actually delivered to him. Under the law, that is not very material. The contract of leasing between Jacobs and Brennan, provided that Brennan let to Jacobs the premises for one year from the first of April, 1885. By virtue of that covenant Jacobs had a right to the possession of these premises for that period \u2014 for his term. The owner of the property, the landlord, during that period had no lights there. [22.] . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-12\">[\u201c The court instructs you that, under the lease which these parties made, it was not incumbent upon Brennan to remove anyone, Tully or anybody else, who happened to be on those premises without any right <em>there; </em>and if, after Jacobs was in possession, anybody who had no right there turned him out, then the consequences of that would not fall upon Brennan. But, if some one who had a right to hold these premises after the first day of April, 1885, under a contract from Brennan, was resisting Jacobs and keeping him out, or turned out Jacobs after he was in, then there was a right of action accruing to this plaintiff against this defendant, and then the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>can recover. It is asserted by tbe plaintiff, Jacobs, here, and evidence has been introduced to prove it, that Thomas Tully, the man who was in before the first of April, 1855, but whose written lease expired then, had a right to the premises for the full year. The plaintiff asserts that Tully and Brennan had an agreement which was prior to the written lease of March 11, 1885, to Jacobs, by virtue of which agreement Tully had a right to hold those premises, and that, in consequence of that contract, or in pursuance of it, he did hold the premises, either refusing to go out, or, after he was turned out in whole or in part, coming back again and remaining there and holding it, keeping out or evicting Jacobs. If that is true, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover. [23]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">[\u201cA lease may be oral, by word of mouth, just as well as by writing, providing the term is not for more than three years, and the landlord has no right to the premises during that term for which he has leased them; and if before the eleventh day of March, 1885, Brennan made a binding contract with Tully that Tully should have the property for another year from the first day of April, and that contract remained in force on the first day of April, then Tully had a right to remain there ; and, if that was so, then when Brennan attempted to give somebody else a lease for the same term, he was attempting to give what was no longer his, and, in that event, he attempted to give a lease to Jacobs when he had no right to the premises himself; and, in that event, Jacobs, having paid the rent in advance, is entitled to recover it back with interest and any damages which were the natural consequences of that breach of contract on the part of Brennan.] [24]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">[\u201c I think I have by this time made it clear to you that, the main question to be inquired into is, whether Thomas Tully, on the second day of April, 1885, at the time Jacobs attempted to take possession of the property, or took possession of the property, had the right to the possession of the premises in question. [25.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">[\u201cHe had no right by reason of his written lease for three months, because that expired on the first day of April, 1885. If he had a right there at all, it must have been by reason of the contract which is set up, the oral contract between Brennan and Tully, as contained in their conversation at the stable. Is that contract proved?] [25.] ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\">\u201c The plaintiff asserts, and Tully testifies, that some time before the first day of April, 1885, Tully, through some other person, made a tender of four hundred dollars to Brennan, and that Brennan refused to take the money. ... [If it was made after the first day of April, then it did not avail Tully anything; then Tully Lad no rights there, no matter what the original contract was; but, if it was made before the first day of April, then the tender met the condition of the contract just as well as if Brennan had taken Tully\u2019s money, because the willingness of Tully and the fact of his offer to pay the four hundred dollars were just as effective as if the money had been actually paid. There is testimony of other witnesses, which evidence the plaintiff has introduced, from which it is asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>that you can find that this was a bargain binding upon Tully and Brennan.] [26] . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-4\">[\u201c On the part of the defendant, witnesses have been called from whose testimony it is claimed that you can find that Tully had no rights there after the first of April; that the contract between him and Brennan, or the proposal to lease, if you chose to-call it so, was \u201c off.\u201d \u00d3n this point Byran Denin and Patrick Brennan testify, and they say, I believe, substantially the same thing; that is, that on the fourteenth day of February, 1885, Tully told them that they should tell Brennan that Tully could not raise-the four hundred dollars, but that Brennan should take the rent in monthly installments. These witnesses testify that they told Brennan so, and that Brennan did not agree to the proposal to take the rent in monthly installments. Jonas Delong says that, on the 21th day of February, 1885, Tully said that he must leave the -house, that, he had disgraced the family; and that Tully said that Brennan should not be disgraced with him, that he would -leave the house and not make him any trouble. Do these witnesses testify to the truth? Do you believe that this .is- so ? Do you believe that Tully said so ? Do you believe that the contract was that Tully was to have until the first day of April to raise the four hundred dollars, or was he to have only till some earlier time ? [27] . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">[\u201c If, at the time that Jacobs was to have possession, somebody else had a right to the premises \u2014 to the possession of them \u2014 by contract under Brennan, then Brennan\u2019s attempt to lease to Jacobs would amount to nothing, then Brennan was in the wrong; then Jacobs is entitled to recover back the rent he paid and such proper-damages as will compensate him for the injury naturally resulting from his breach of contract.] [28]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">[\u201c It may throw some light upon this question, or it may be another light in which you m\u00e1y view it, if you were to suppose that this was the second day of April, 1885, and that there was a contention between Tully and Jacobs as to who was entitled for the following year to this hotel property; or you may imagine that there is a contest before us as if on the second day of April, 1885, between Brennan and Tully as to their rights \u2014 as to whether Tully had a right to the premises for another year. Gentlemen, if you were sitting on the 2d day of April, 1885, with this evidence before you, would you find that before the eleventh day of March, when this written lease was made, Brennan had bound himself by agreement with Tully to give Tully these premises? Would you so find?' Wonld you find that the possession, under this evidence, belonged to Tully? If you find that to-day, that Tully had right under Brennan to the possession of these premises after the first day of April for another year, then the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict then Jacobs was kept out by somebody who had a right there; and whether that person, to wit, Tully, refused to leave, was not actually turned out, or actually was turned out and came back again and remained in, he had a right there, and Jacobs had no right there-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>because Brennan had no right to lease the house the second time for the same term as the first; and, in that case, the plaintiff is entitled to recover; because, while the law declares that the tenant, under a lease like this, must take possession for himself, he is only compelled to assert his possession against a wrong-doer, against one who intrudes or trespasses upon the premises; and, when he finds the possession kept from him by some one who has a right there, no matter how he gets in, then it may be said that he took nothing by his contract, and then it must be said that the landlord attempted to give him what he no longer had.\u201d] [29]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">The plaintiff presented, inter alia, the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">\u201c3. \u2014 If the jury believe that, by any act of the defendant, plaintiff was prevented from obtaining or holding quiet and peaceable possession and enjoyment of the premises leased by him from defendant, during the term for which he had so leased, then plaintiff is \u00e9ntitled to recover in this case. <em>Ans. </em>\u2014 Affirmed. But the only act of defendant that can be found is the making of a prior lease to Tully for the same term. Whether there was such prior letting is referred to the jury.\u201d [30]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-8\">\u201c4. \u2014 If the jury believe that, on or about February 3, 1885, defendant rented to Thomas Tully the Hudson River House for the term of one year, from April 1, 1885, and said Tully had complied with his part of said agreement, then Thomas Tully was lawfully in possession of said Hudson River House on April 2, 1885, and defendant had no right to eject him therefrom. <em>Ans. </em>\u2014 Affirmed. Provided the contract of lease to Tully had- not been rescinded by notice to Brennan that he (Tully) could not pay the money according to the terms on which he was to have the premises for another year.\u201d [31]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-9\">\u201c 5. \u2014 If the jury believe that the defendant had, prior to the making of the lease in this case, agreed with Thomas Tully that if he would pay him four hundred dollars before April 1, 1885, he should retain possession of the Hudson River House for one year from April 1, 1885, and Thomas Tully had fulfilled his part of said agreement, then, in making the lease in this case with plaintiff on March 11, 1885, for the occupancy of th\u00e9 same premises, defendant was guilty of a fraud upon plaintiff. <em>Ans. </em>\u2014 Affirmed. Unless Tully rescinded the contract by notifying Brennan that he could not or would not pay the four hundred dollars rent in advance. If he (Tully) gave such notice, then he had no right there after April 1, 1885, and defendant was guilty of no wrong in making the lease with the plaintiff.\u201d [32]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-10\">\u201c 6. \u2014 If the jury believe that defendant was guilty of a fraud, whereby plaintiff was deprived of the use and occupancy of the premises rented, plaintiff is entitled to recover, not only the money paid and interest and expenses, but damages arising from the loss of the bargain, or the money he might have derived from the completion of the contract. <em>Ans. </em>\u2014 Affirmed. If Brennan made the second lease while a former lease was outstanding, the first tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>having done nothing to deprive himself of his right, then the leasing to the second tenant was a fraud upon the latter.\u201d [33]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\">The defendant presented the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-7\">\u201c 1. \u2014 If the jury believe that on the second day of April, 1885, the Sheriff of Montour County, by due process of law, evicted Thomas Tully, the occupant of the Hudson River House, and turned the possession of the same over to Brennan, the defendant, in the presence of Henry Jacobs, the plaintiff; and that James L. Brennan, the defendant, immediately and forthwith transferred the possession so given to him by the Sheriff to Henry Jacobs, the plaintiff, Brennan, the defendant, has complied with the covenants of his lease, and the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d <em>Ans. </em>\u2014 \u201cNegatived.

He alleged, and undertook to prove, among other things, that, on March 11th, 1885, in consideration of $400 rent then paid in advance, Brennan executed and delivered to him a lease of the premises therein described, for one year from April 1st then next ensuing: that, before said lease was executed, Brennan had, verbally, leased the same premises for same term to Thomas Tully who was then in possession, under a written lease from Brennan, for three months, commencing January 1st, 1885: that, by virtue of said verbal lease, Tully claimed and rightfully held possession of the demised premises after the expiration of his written lease, and plaintiff below was thus unable to obtain or hold quiet or peaceable possession of the same, according to the terms of his lease, and thereby sustained the damages for which this suit was brought. These and other collateral questions of fact, arising out of the evidence, were fairly submitted to the jury, with full and substantially correct instructions, some of which are complained of in the 22d to 33d specifications inclusive. Referring to the verbal lease to Tully, the learned Judge, in that portion of his charge recited in the 25th specification, rightly said: \u201c The main question to be inquired into is whether Tully, on the 2d of April, 1885, at the time Jacobs attempted to take, or took, possession of the property, had a right to the possession of the premises. He had no right by reason of his written lease for three months, because that expired on the 1st day of April, 1885. If he had a right there at all, it must have been by reason of the contract which is set up, the oral contract between Brennan and himself, as contained in their conversation at the stable. Is that contract proved ?\u201d etc. That, and other questions of fact, bearing on the case, having been fairly submitted to the jury, were impliedly answered in favor of plaintiff below. Such is the necessary legal inference from the verdict, considered in connection with the clear and explicit instructions of the learned Judge who presided at the trial. It cannot be presumed that the jury, in arriving at their verdict, disregarded any of those instructions. On the contrary, the presumption is that they found all the facts of which their verdict is predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The admission of evidence for plaintiff, and rejection of testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>mony offered by defendant below, are the subjects of complaint in a large proportion of the specifications. \"Without noticing either of them specially, it is sufficient to say there is no substantial error in any of the rulings of the court on either subject. The evidence admitted was both competent and relevant under the pleadings, and the testimony that was excluded was either irrelevant or incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The lease sued on contains an implied covenant for quiet,, peaceable and undisturbed possession of the demised premises, as against the lessor himself, and those claiming under him by paramount title. If the lessee is kept out of possession by one having superior title to that of the lessor himself, or if the latter, either before or after executing a lease, does any positive act by which the lessee is kept out of possession, the covenant is broken. Thus in Trull <em>v. </em>Granger, 8 N. Y. 115, where a lease was executed by which possession was to be given at a time certain and the landlord subsequently leased the premises for five years to a third person, who, on the arrival of the time at which the first lease was to commence, refused to give up the premises, and the landlord refused to give possession thereof, it was held that the lessee need not bring ejectment, but could at once sue the landlord for damages. 2 Sharswood\u2019s Leading Cases, etc., 58, 61. As is said in 2d Platt on Leases, 288, the object of such covenants is to protect the lessee against defective title; and they necessarily import that the lessee shall enter and enjoy the premises without the permission of any one. If, therefore, a party make a lease, to commence in praesenti, of premises which belong to another, that other being either a stranger or a person holding under a subsisting demise by the same lessor, an action of covenant lies at once for the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In this case, the controlling fact, established by the verdict, is that, when Brennan executed the lease in suit and received from Jacobs a year\u2019s rent in advance, he had already, by verbal contract, leased the same premises for same term to Tully, who was then in possession of the premises, and, by virtue of that contract, had a right to hold them as against both Jacobs and .Brennan. There is nothing to show that the verbal lease to Tully was annulled or surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">On the facts established by the verdict, plaintiff had a clear case for recovery of the rent he had paid in advance, and such additional damages as was shown by the evidence. Substantial justice has-been done and the judgment should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Judgment affirmed. H. J. L.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
