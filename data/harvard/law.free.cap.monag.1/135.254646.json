In an action for <em>libel </em>against the publishers, the defendant presented a point that if the jury believed from the <em>evidence </em>that the defendant had been confined in an inebriate asylum, had obtained his release and about midnight went to his house in a state of rage, and, immediately before or after his wife and children left the house, had a revolver in his hand, and pointed th^ same at his wife\u2019s brother and threatened to shoot him, although he may not have fired any shot, the plaintiff could not recover.
