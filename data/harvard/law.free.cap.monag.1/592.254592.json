Levick and William H. Gardner, trading as Eichard Levick\u2019s Son <em>&amp; </em>Co., against John Bensing, at Aug. T. 1885, No. 272. Sterrett and Mitchell, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-11\">The evidence was to the following effect, at the trial before McPherson, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-12\">On Jan. 6, 1877, P. F. McCauley executed a deed granting the property in suit to Philip Fisher, his uncle. Fisher died on May 14, 1882, and his executors, on March 3, 1883, sold and conveyed the premises to John Bensing, who thereupon took possession. On February 25, 1884, the plaintiffs obtained a judgment against P. F. McCauley, and levied upon the premises as the property of McCauley. They were subsequently sold by the sheriff to the plaintiffs and a sheriff\u2019s deed made therefor. The plaintiffs claimed that the deed to Fisher, although absolute on its face, was really a mortgage. McCauley was called for the plaintiffs and testified that he did not receive a dollar as consideration for the deed. \u201c Q. Why, then, if you didn\u2019t receive any money for this deed, did you execute it? A. Well, Mr. Fisher called at my store. I had asked him a day or two before for some endorsement on paper. When he came in the store in the morning he said if I would give him a deed for the property as collateral, the same as a mortgage, why, he would continue on endorsing for me. Q. Was it with that understanding and under that agreement that you executed this deed? A. Yes, sir; he said he would hold that; I think he used the words <em>\u2018 </em>in trust \u2019 for me as collateral; that was the transaction between us. Q. Then, as I understand, it wasn\u2019t to be considered as an absolute conveyance ? A. No, sir; never that way. I always held it and paid the taxes and paid no rents to him; it was always taxed in my name; I made the improvements that were made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-13\">A. S. Ulrich, an attorney who acted for Fisher at the time the deed was executed, testified that he instructed the notary, who took the acknowledgment, to tell Mrs. McCauley that the deed was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>to secure past, present and future indebtedness; that McCauley owed him, Fisher, money, and it was to secure this money that the deed was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">Mrs. McCauley testified that the notary told her that \u201cMr. Fisher just wanted to have security.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-5\">There was incidentally some evidence that McCauley had brought a bill in equity against the executors of Philip Fisher, but the record was not offered in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-6\">The court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"An0X\">\u201c The effort here is to prove a deed, absolute on its face, to be a mortgage. Without passing upon the competency of Philip McCauley and his wife, \u2014 we assume them, for the present, to be competent,\u2014 [it is enough to say that the evidence, in the judgment of the court, falls very far short of the requirements wisely established by the supreme court] before such a result can be accomplished. [It is only necessary to state, that no amount is specified for which the deed was to stand as security; no time of repayment is mentioned, neither is there a particle of evidence in the case to show that any amount has ever been repaid.] [We therefore instruct you to find a verdict in favor of the defendant.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-8\">Yerdict and judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-9\">The opinion of the court discharging a rule for a new trial, is here given, as it contains a fuller discussion of the case :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-10\">\u201c There are two questions in this case which we do not think it necessary to consider, the competency of Philip McCauley and his wife as witnesses, and whether, as between themselves and Philip Fisher, the deed of Jan. 6, 1877, was a mortgage. We assume the competency of the witnesses, and also the existence of a parol defeasance, of some kind, sufficient, as between the parties, to turn the deed into a mortgage. There are still two objections, however, in the plaintiffs\u2019 road, either of which is fatal to their case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-11\">\u201cThe first is, that the defendant appears to be a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. The plaintiffs offered, indeed, to show notice, but they did not do so. No evidence of actual notice was given, and we see none of that constructive notice which arises from possession by the mortgagor. No witness speaks of McCauley as living in the house, and the evidence about -his payment of taxes for 1881 and 1882, and about Fisher\u2019s declarations, bears upon ownership and not upon possession. Unless his actual possession at the time of Bensing\u2019s purchase is to be presumed \u2014 and we do not feel inclined to presume it, when the fact could have been proved by several witnesses, among whom was McCauley himself \u2014 nothing was shown to affect Bensing with notice of the parol defeasance, and therefore the prima facies of his own deed must prevail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-12\">\u201c The second objection is this. Assuming that Bensing had notice, the action would then be an equitable ejectment brought by the sheriff\u2019s vendee of the mortgagor against the vendee with notice from the mortgagee. The general rule in such case is, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>plaintiff must prove that the mortgage has in some way been paid, or that a tender of the sum dne has been made before suit, following his tender by paying the money into court for the defendant\u2019s benefit. Gore <em>v. </em>Kinney, 10 Watts, 139; Bell <em>v. </em>Clark, 111 Pa. 94; McGrew <em>v. </em>Foster, 113 Pa. 646. binder some circumstances, a conditional verdict may be framed (Mellon <em>v. </em>Lemon, 111 Pa. 56), finding what is still due to a mortgagee in possession and thus enabling the mortgagor to obtain the premises without unnecessary delay. In the case before us, however, there was no allegation of payment or of tender, and such scanty testimony about the whole transaction that a conditional verdict would have been little better than a guess. As already stated, it did not appear who had been in possession up to the date of the deed to Bensing, and the testimony equally fails -to show the rental value of the property, the sum for which the mortgage was given, the sum which was actually advanced upon its \u25a0security, and the time and terms of payment. We could not leave all this to the jury to be found without proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">\u201cIt was urged, however, that the deed and parol defeasance were together an unrecorded mortgage, and were therefore discharged by the sheriff\u2019s sale under the plaintiff\u2019s judgment against McCauley. In our opinion, the question does not arise. What happened was this: The plaintiffs bought McCauley\u2019s equity of redemption, and now stand in his shoes to enforce that right. If he were plaintiff against Fisher, he could not recover without proof of payment, or of tender before suit, followed by payment into court, or of such facts as would support and guide a conditional verdict. We do not see where the plaintiffs, who are subsequent judgment creditors of McCauley and simply hold his equitable right, get the power to enforce his equity to have back the land, without at the same time making the proof which he would have been bound to make.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-8\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1-3,v the portions of the charge included within brackets, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-9\"><em>Warren G. </em>Griffith, with him <em>Thomas H.

Their evidence established a contemporaneous agreement; and the other facts and circumstances, all clearly inconsistent with the theory that the parties regarded it as an absolute sale to Philip Fisher, were amply sufficient to establish the parol defeasance.

Todd <em>v. </em>Campbell, 32 Pa. 253.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-9\">It was the duty of the court to weigh the facts proven and \u25a0determine whether they were sufficient to submit to the jury. Nicols <em>v. </em>McDonald, 101 Pa. 519; Burger <em>v. </em>Dankel, 100 Pa. 119; Todd <em>v. </em>Campbell, 32 Pa. 250; DeFrance <em>v. </em>DeFrance, 34 Pa. 385; Moore <em>v. </em>Small, 19 Pa. 461; Plumer <em>v. </em>Guthrie, 76 Pa. 441; Baird <em>v. </em>Oakeley, 68 Pa. 92; Guernsey <em>v. </em>Guernsey, 39 Pa. 86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-10\">The fact that Bensing is an innocent purchaser of this property without notice of this alleged parol defeasance is conclusive of this controversy. The true rule of lis pendens would seem to be that a purchaser is effected by the decision upon any claim to the property purchased if there be a litigation pending in which that question is decided.

This was notice to plaintiffs in error of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>title and equities.
