The defendant cannot ask each, customer whether he is a sojourner, traveler, or stranger, because he cannot discriminate between his customers. Com. <em>v. </em>Bosch, C. P. Schuylkill Co., 15 <em>W. </em>N. C. 316.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-11\"><em>Wm. Yost, </em>with him <em>Jno. Rebman, </em>for Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahy\">The sale of ice cream, as this was sold, was not a necessity within the meaning of the Act. The necessity contemplated by the Act is the necessity of the man doing the act, not of the person purchasing. Sparhawk <em>v. </em>Union P. R. R., 54 Pa. 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-12\">The Act was intended to enforce an observance of Sunday, instead of obliterating it. Johnston <em>v. </em>Com., 22 Pa. 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-13\">If ice cream comes within the definition of \u201c necessaries of life,\u201d still he is guilty, because the Act restricts the delivery of such until after five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and this was sold and delivered about 1p.m.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-14\">The Act permits the dressing of victuals in bake houses, but the policy of the law shows that the exceptions mentioned in the Act are to be strictly construed, and that the dressing of victuals in bake houses must be held to apply simply to what was necessarily done in bake houses, viz., the baking of bread, etc. The Act does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>not contemplate a sale or selling of victuals in bake houses, but only extends to the act of dressing, for that was all that was necessary in that particular instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">The old Act of 29 Car. n, ch. Y, introduced by Penn and then in force in Pennsylvania, permitted dressing and selling of meat, etc. In our Act the selling is omitted, which is significant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">Judge Woodward, in Omit <em>v. </em>Com., 21 Pa. 432, says the word <em>\u201c </em>meat \u201d in that old Act is the exact equivalent of victuals in the Act of 1Y94. See, also, Splane <em>v. </em>Com., 35 Pitts. L. J. 102; s. c. in supreme court, 35 Pitts. L. J. 256 ; s. o. 11 Cent. R. 168; Com. <em>v. </em>Nesbit, 34 Pa. 409.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">The case of Com. <em>v. </em>Bosch, 15 W. N. C. 316, is not an authority in point. 1, The defendant in that case was a licensed innkeeper, and, 2, he sold the ice cream in Ms inn or tavern. If that case had been taken to the supreme court it would have been reversed. See Friedeborn <em>v. </em>Com., 113 Pa. 244; Splane <em>v. </em>Com., 11 Cent. R. 168.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A62\">Jan. 7, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b139-8\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"AFn\">The record in this case being sufficient to sustain the conviction, we cannot reverse the proceedings of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The judgment is affirmed.
