He then further directed: \u201cAlso I do direct after the death of my wife, the property both real and personal shall and must he sold, and all my just debts paid, and the remainder of the money to he equally shared amongst my children.\u201d <em>Seld </em>that the widow took a <em>life estate, </em>and that it was her duty to keep down <em>i/nterest on incumbrances; </em>and, that the executor was liable to be surcharged for such interest paid by him and charged in the account, and also for the corpus -of the estate consumed by the widow, although the <em>money </em>was <em>received by the </em>widow when she was a <em>co-executor, </em>the account being filed after her death.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b595-11\">An <em>executor </em>claimed a <em>booh account </em>against his testator\u2019s estate.

O. Montgomery Co., dismissing exceptions by Albert Geiger, surviving executor of Samuel Geiger, deceased, to the report of an auditor on exceptions to the executor\u2019s account, at Oct. T. 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-14\">The following facts were found by the auditor, N. H. Larzelere, Esq.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-15\">Samuel Geiger died on May 13, 1854, leaving a will in which he disposed of his estate as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u201c I <em>give, </em>devise and bequeath unto my' beloved wife, Sarah Geiger, her heirs and assigns forever, all my property, real, personal and mixed, of what nature and kind soever and wheresoever the same shall be at the time of my death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-4\">\u201cAlso, I direct that if the executors see proper to sell any of the property, either real or personal, to pay debts, they may do so. Also, I do direct, after the death of my wife, the property, both real and personal, shall and must be sold, and all my just debts paid, and the remainder of the money to be equally shared amongst my children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">Sarah Geiger, the widow, and Albert Geiger, testator\u2019s son, were appointed executors. The executors took out letters, but no inventory was filed. In 1887, upon a citation issued from the orphans\u2019 court, Albert Geiger filed an account as surviving executor, showing a balance of $223.94 in his hands. Wilhelmina Zuber, one of the heirs, filed exceptions to the account, embracing items subsequently discussed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\">Testator, at his death, possessed some personal property, most of which was immediately sold. Out of the proceeds, Sarah Geiger paid the funeral expenses. After Sarah\u2019s death in 1887, Albert sold the balance, amounting to $38.53 and charged himself therewith in his account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\">Testator also owned a farm of fifty-nine acres and other land. In 1859, Sarah Geiger, claiming the land as her own, sold a portion of it, and, after paying a judgment out of the proceeds, appropriated the balance, amounting to $660, to her own use. The receipt in the deed was signed by both Sarah and Albert.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-8\">In 1868, the executors and all the heirs, excepting Wilhelmina Zuber, joined in a deed, conveying the fifty-nine acres to Michael E. Geiger, who, on the same day, reconveyed it to Albert Geiger. The consideration paid by Albert for the farm was $2,000. With a portion of this amount, he paid a judgment on the farm held by . one Eegely, amounting, with interest, to $552.27. He paid $944 to Sarah or to third parties by her direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-9\">At the audit, Albert claimed a credit for $179.69, being a debt alleged to have been due from the testator to himself. In support of this claim, he produced an old book, on the back page of which there was an account against his father running from 1847 to 1853. On this claim, the auditor found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-10\">\u201cAlbert is the only witness to this account and it is very apparent that it is not a book of original entries. The auditor concludes that the entries were all made at one time, and from some other book or memoranda. Another convincing proof of this is, that, while this account begins in 1847, on the outside of the book is written as follows: \u2018 The property of A. Geiger, January 4th, 1851.\u2019 There is no proof when this was written, but, taken with the fact, very apparent on the face of the page containing the charges, leads the auditor to find as a fact that this is not a book of original entries. . . . The claim cannot be allowed. First, because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>not established by competent or sufficient proof, and, second, because it has long since been barred by the statute of limitations. It falls within the principles decided in Y orles\u2019s Ap., 110 Pa. 69, and never became seated upon the trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">At the audit, Wilhelmina Zuber claimed to surcharge the accountant with a profit made by sale of the land bought by accountant in 1868. On this subject, the auditor found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">\u201cIt is also further found that, June 15, 1868, when Albert bought the farm it was badly out of repair. The widow had had the use of it since 1854, and had put no repairs upon it. It had been rented out and the soil got thin. The barn was tumbling down and the fences were poor. Albert sold this farm, without the small tract, to Louis Leavengood in 1876 for $3500, expressed in the deed, but Albert said he was obliged to rebate $500. Between 1868 and 1876, however, Albert had greatly improved the farm, had practically built a new barn, repaired the fences and improved the soil. The auditor, therefore, finds as a fact that the farm was easily worth the difference in the two prices between 1868 and 1876. The fact that all the heirs who were sui juris joined in making this sale at $2,000, moves me to find that that figure was all that it was fairly worth when conveyed to Albert.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\">On the subject of accountant\u2019s claims for commissions and counsel fees, the auditor found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-8\">\u201cThe accountant\u2019s claim for $120 commissions cannot be allowed. Commissions of trustees are not a question of percentages, but of compensation for labor and responsibility. Montgomery\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 230. Where neither the one has been performed nor the other incurred, there is nothing to be compensated. McCauseland\u2019s Appeal, 38 Pa. 470; Robinson\u2019s Estate, 5 Phila. 99. In this estate, the accountant has earned no compensation. Although in no respect guilty of any fraud, he has never performed in an ordinary manner the duties devolved by law upon him. If he was insolvent now, the heirs of Samuel Geiger would lose every cent of this money. He is compelled by citation to file his account, and files such a one as has caused a long, tedious and expensive audit to ascertain that which it was his legal duty to have kept clear and simple. To reward an executor in such a case would be a premium upon looseness and carelessness in the performance and discharge of sacred duties and against the policy of the law. A trustee at least is bound to use ordinary care and prudence in the charge he undertakes. This subject is clearly illustrated in the following cases : Steger\u2019s Estate, 3 W. N. C. 368; Sharped Estate, 2 Phila. 280; Sauter\u2019s Estate, 6 W. N. C. 95.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-9\">\u201cNeither can the claim for $100 counsel fees for services to accountant be allowed. These were services on his own account in defense of his conduct throughout the administration of this estate. He must therefore pay for them out of his individual pocket. This disposes of all the numerous questions raised in this estate which it is material to decide.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Tbe auditor found that, under the will of the testator, Sarah Geiger took a life estate only and not a fee. He therefore surcharged accountant with the amounts paid to Sarah Geiger and retained by her for her own use. He also refused to allow accountant credit for arrears of interest paid on the Fegely judgment, on the ground that it was the duty of the life tenant to keep down arrears.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-6\">The auditor restated the account, finding a balance due by the accountant to the estate of $2,203.39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-7\">The accountant filed exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, alleging that the auditor erred, 1, in deciding that, by the will, Sarah Geiger took only a life estate [1] ; 3, in deciding that the latter part was contradictory to the former part of the will [2] ; 20, in deciding that the latter clause in the will is not repugnant to the first, it being only a direction for settlement of the estate, declaring what must be done in case she was dead before the general and primary intent was consummated [3] ; 21, in resorting to technical rules of construction before applying the general rules for the construction of wills [4] ; 4, in not allowing Albert Geiger credit for the amount of interest he paid on the Fegely judgment [5] ; 7, in not allowing the book account due Albert by his father, the sum of $179.69 [6] ; 9, in not allowing amounts paid to widow in 1867, 1870, and in 1872, in all $290.72 [7] ; 12, in not allowing compensation to Albert Geiger for long, tedious and irksome services, bona fide performed for 34 years to the estate, where now there is a serious contest over a will which never had been judicially construed, and in an estate which was his debtor a long time [8]; 14, in surcharging the accountant with $660, not one cent of which he ever had in hand [9] ; 16, in not saying Mary Ann Engle, Michael E. Geiger and Catharine Engel were estopped as distributees in any event from anything out of the main farm [10]; 19, in not holding that the finding that Albert Geiger was negligent is unjust, as he did everything he could to preserve the estate [11] ; 15, in raising a large fund for distribution, and distributing to heirs who were not entitled to distribution out of an estate really debtor to the accountant for more than he ever got [13].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-8\">The court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-9\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1-11 and 13, the action of the court in dismissing accountant\u2019s exceptions, quoting them; and, 12, in deciding that he was not entitled to counsel fees before the auditor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b598-10\"><em>A.

The sale was made by the joint executors, the deed executed only by the widow but the receipt shows that the money went into the hands of the joint executors. The appellant was not a competent witness, in the face of his written receipt, to show that he did not receive the purchase money. Heydrick\u2019s Ap., 109 Pa. 610.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0GO\">Feb. 18, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b600-12\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"ARxg\">The first assignment raises the question whether, under the will of Samuel Geiger, his widow, Sarah Geiger, took a fee or only a life estate. This is the important question in the case, though one entirely free from difficulty. The first clause in the will is as absolute a devise to the widow as could well be made, and the provision in the second clause, authorizing the executors to sell the real estate for the payment of debts does not in any degree curtail the previous devise. It merely authorizes the executors to do what the law authorizes them to do. Then follows the provision: \u201cAlso, I do direct, after the death of my wife, the property, both real and personal, shall and must be sold, and all my just debts paid, and the remainder of my money to be equally shared amongst my children.\u201d That this cuts the fee down to an estate for life is too plain for argument. Being the later clause in the will, it must prevail. With this point established, we find no error in the ruling of the orphans\u2019 court upon the account of Albert Geiger, the surviving executor of Samuel Geiger. It was, perhaps, his misfortune that he yielded too readily to the demands of the widow, who was also his mother and co-executor. She appears to have been an imperious woman and thought she owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the estate in fee. But those who assume trusts must conform to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The executor charged himself with the sum of $2,000, the purchase money of certain real estate sold to Michael E. Geiger, but which was in reality a sale to the accountant. This property, after several years, was re-sold by the accountant at a considerable advance. The court below did not surcharge him with this difference, in view of the fact that the increase of price was due to the improvements which he had put upon the property, and that in the matter of the sale he had acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The book account of $179.69, which the accountant claimed against his father\u2019s estate, was properly disallowed for very satisfactory reasons given by the auditor. He was the only witness to prove it; his book was manifestly not a book of original entries, and the claim itself was ancient, running back to 1847.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The duty of the life-tenant to keep down interest on encumbrances is so well settled that authorities upon this point need not be cited. Hence the credits claimed for this purpose were properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">As to the refusal of the court to allow commissions, it is sufficient to say that compensation is given only to the faithful steward. This accountant may not have intended any wrong; his derelictions may have been the result of ignorance, but we cannot excuse him on that account, and place him on the same plane with those who perform their duties intelligently. He appears to have used the moneys of the estate as his own; kept no separate bank account; did not produce vouchers for many of his items of credit, and, as the learned auditor finds, \u201cfiles such an account as has caused a long, tedious and expensive audit to ascertain that which it was his legal duty to have kept clear and simple.\u201d Whether such consequences are produced by knavery or stupidity, the results are the same to the parties whose money is thus wasted.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">We find no error in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant. \u00ab</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
