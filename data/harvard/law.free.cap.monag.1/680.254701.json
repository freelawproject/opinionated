At the time the deed was executed, the validity of this dower was in question. Subsequently, the supreme court decided that it was not a charge upon the land. The heir of William Traut afterward brought this suit making-use of the name of the executors of the grantor in the deed, as legal plaintiffs. The defendants offered evidence to the effect that the grantor in the deed said that his daughter need not pay the principal of the dower, upon the death of the widow, if she would contest it. The court refused to charge that, under all the evidence, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. The court, in the general charge, said that the defence asked the jury to infer that when the grantor put the charge in the deed he meant the same thing as was set forth in the will and, as the charge in the will was no lien, the charge in the deed amounted to nothing; the jury, from that evidence, would have a right to infer that and find that fact; and, if, from the evidence, they so found, the defendants would be entitled to a verdict. <em>Held, </em>not to be error.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b728-6\">_ Per Curiam : The plaintiffs are attempting to recover upon a <em>misfalcen recital in a deed </em>to which they are neither parties nor privies, and for which they have never paid any consideration. The dower recited in the deed was not created by that instrument; it was merely supposed to exist and its recital was perhaps a mere blunder of the conveyancer.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b728-7\"><em>Query, </em>whether, where a conveyance is made to a married woman, and the grantor dies, in a suit against the wife upon a covenant in 1he deed, the <em>evidence of </em>the <em>husband </em>is competent <em>for </em>the <em>wife </em>under the Act of May 23,1887, providing that when any <em>party to </em>a thing or <em>contract in action </em>is <em>dead </em>no surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract, or any other person whose interest shall be adverse to the right of such deceased, shall be a competent witness to any matter occurring before the death of said party.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b728-8\">March 7, 1889.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3y\">Error, No. 67, Jan.

Third, that you cannot give in evidence the intention of any person from the declaration of their intention; it must be an inference by the jury from what took place at the time the deed was made or the instrument was executed.

[4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-9\">The court charged as follows, by Ermentkout, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-10\">\u201c On Oct. 6, 1881, Charles Levan made a deed to Melvina Bickel, his daughter, for certain real estate, situate in Maidencreek township. The consideration expressed in the deed is the sum of $5,675, less a dower of $1,200; and in the body of the deed appears the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-11\">\u201c \u2018And subject, nevertheless, to the payment of a dower of one thousand and two hundred dollars, the interest thereof to be paid annually to the widow of William Traut, deceased, during her \u2022natural life, and, after her decease, the principal to the heirs and legal representatives of the said deceased.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-12\">\u201c The plaintiffs come into court, and, by virtue of this clause, \u2022ask a verdict at your hands. They claim that they are the heirs and legal representatives of William Traut, deceased, and they use the names of the executors of Charles Levan, and the record reads, \u2018 The Executors of Charles Levan, for the use of Esther Schmehl \u25a0and of David Schmehl, administrator of Maria Traut, deceased.\u2019 They base their right to recover in this case upon this clause, alleging that, by the terms of this deed, the real estate conveyed to Melvina Bickel was made subject to paying this sum of $1,200, in manner and form as stated in this clause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-13\">\u201c In order to prove that they are the parties mentioned in this deed, they place in evidence the will of William Traut, and they call Franklin Maehemer and William T. Schmehl as witnesses to show their relationship to the parties who are mentioned in this deed, and they say that, being those parties, they are entitled to the whole of this money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-14\">\u201c It would appear, from the will of William Traut, that he was the owner of land in Maidencreek township; that, having made his will, lie died, and, in that will, made a bequest of his property to one David Traut, the son. David Traut becoming embarrassed, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to James H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Schmeck, and James H. Schmeck, as the assignee of David Trant, \u00abold to Charles Levan, and Charles Levan thereupon executed this deed which has been placed in evidence before you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b731-4\">\u201c If this case rested solely upon the deed offered in evidence, there might be probably no serious question as to the right of the plaintiff to recover in this case; but there is evidence in this case to which your attention must be given, and it is alleged, on the part of the defendants, that, by the will of William Traut, there was a legacy or devise made, and that, at one period of time, there was a claim raised that, by virtue of the clause in that will, a charge had been created upon this real estate, for the benefit of the widow of William Traut, and the parties who appear here as plaintiffs. In the deed from David Traut to Schmeck, the assignee, and in the deed from Schmeck, the assignee, to Charles Levan, there is no mention whatever of any charge. It appears that, when Charles Levan bought of the assignee, and the' deed was about to be executed, he said to the attorney or scrivener who had the matter of the execution of the deed in charge, that they should leave out the reference to the $1,200, [that he would pay the widow the interest as long as she lived, and after that he would try the question once, he \u2018 would see about it and try it once whether there was anything due or not.\u2019] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b731-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The question to which the court will direct your attention is: First, the nature and character of the devise in the will of William Traut. For, under the instructions of the court, that is not a question for your determination. The supreme court have judicially passed upon that question, and they have said that, under that will, no lien was placed upon this land; that the land was not made subject to this charge, and that, therefore, Charles Levan bought the property at the assignee\u2019s sale perfectly free from any charge that was supposed to have been created in the will of William Trant; and that, therefore, in point of law, and in fact, when he received the deed from the assignee, there was not a particle of obligation on his side to pay to the plaintiffs one cent of money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b731-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Therefore, when Charles Levan came to convey that property to anybody, if he had made the ordinary conveyance, he would have conveyed it free of any charge. But there .appears in this deed to Melvina Bickel, the language which I have read to you from the \u2022deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b731-7\">[\u201c The first inquiry which the jury will make is, to what did this clause in this deed have reference ? The word dower is used, the widow of William Traut, deceased, is referred to, and the first inquiry to which the jury will direct itself is, to what did this matter refer? Did Charles Levan intend to subject this property to the \u2022charge mentioned in this deed, regardless of the fact that, as a legal point, the will of William Traut had not subjected the property to .anything of the kind. We have already adverted to the testimony introduced by the defendants as to the declaration of Charles Levan that he would pay the interest as long as the widow lived, and after that he would try it and see about it and try it once.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>\u201c Therefore the question is whether Charles Levan, when he came to have this deed written, did intend to make this property subject to this charge whether the law made it so or not?] [1] What are the facts bearing upon that question?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-6\">\u201cIt appears from the evidence, first, of Wellington S. Levan, that there was a family arrangement under which his father deeded some of his property to each of his children, as part of their inheritance, and [he testifies before you that this deed to Melvina, his-sister, was delivered to her in pursuance of that family arrangement] ; [6] that he, Charles Levan, said half a dozen times, or more, that that amount, that dower, need never be paid, provided his sister or his brother in law would stand a suit on it, or go to court; that they were cot well pleased with what had been given them; that the appraisement or valuation of this property was too high, but that he added that the dower need never be paid if they would test it, and that this he said as an answer to their complaints.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-7\">\u201c Judge Buskirk went upon the stand and testified that Charles Levan came to him and told him that he should put in a dower of twelve hundred dollars; that he wanted the old lady, Mrs. Traut, to have the interest on that during her life; that she was in needy circumstances, and, after her death, if the Bickels chose to contest it, they need never pay the principal; and that it was in consequence of these directions that he inserted the clause, \u00a3 and \u2019 \u2014 and this is his language \u2014 \u00a3 and it seems I took the usual form.\u2019 He was-asked, upon cross-examination, whether the words used by Mr. Levan were not <em>\u2018 </em>he said that I should put the charge in the deed, and if Bickel chose to fight about it, he did not suppose he would have to-pay itand he said that that may have been the substance. It is very nearly like to what he had said before. Further on, in his testimony, he also says that Mr. Levan stated that he had a copy of the will of William Traut; that he had taken legal advice and he was satisfied it was not a charge upon the real estate; that he wanted his daughter to pay the interest for life, but after the widow\u2019s death she need not pay the principal if she did not want to, if they chose-to fight about it or test it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-8\">\u201cWilliam Bickel, when he is placed upon the stand, says that he-received the deed from Charles Levan, who told him that Mrs. Bickel need not pay the twelve hundred dollars if she chose to-fight it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-9\">\u201c The plaintiff also gave in evidence the will of William Traut and a notice which was read at the assignee\u2019s sale, and he offered that to prove that Charles Levan knew of the will and that he had reference to the will when he executed the deed. The notice which was read at the assignee\u2019s sale in the presence of Charles Levan is-as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-10\">\u201c 6. Notice is hereby given that the real estate about to be sold by James Schmeck, assignee of David Traut, was devised to-the said David Traut by his father, William Traut, subject to a testamentary charge of seventy-two dollars per year, payable to Maria,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>widow of said William Traut, deceased; and also subject to the payment of twelve hundred dollars to Esther, wife of Jacob F. Schmehl, after the decease of the said Maria; and that the said charge of seventy-two dollars per year for the past three years is now due and owing to Maria Traut, widow of William Traut, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b733-4\">(Signed). Esther Schmehl.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b733-5\">\u201c In the plaintiff\u2019s narr in this case there is a clause referring to this dower of $1,200, and also making reference to the will of William Traut, and that, by the will of William Traut, Esther Schmehl is made the sole legatee of this $1,200. From the offer of these facts, for the purpose of showing that Charles Levan had reference to the will when he executed this deed, and the testimony of Bickel, Levan and Buskirk, the jury would have a right to infer and to find that this clause, which is mentioned in the deed, refers to the same subject matter mentioned in the will, and that it was intended, from the conversations of all the parties, as a reference to that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b733-6\">\u201c [At the time this deed was executed, the question whether, under the will of William Traut, the land was charged with the $1,200 was not yet decided. It was an open question, and the defense ask the jury to infer from this testimony that when Charles Levan put that clause in the deed he simply put it in as a statement of the ordinary charge which was supposed to exist upon this land by virtue of the will; and they ask you to infer from that testimony that he meant by this clause in the deed precisely the same thing as was set forth in the will; and that if the alleged charge in the will amounted to no lien \u2014 there being no money paid for the charge in the deed \u2014 the charge in the deed also amounted to nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b733-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The jury from that evidence would have a right to infer that, and find that fact; and if, from that evidence, they do find that they are one and the same thing, the law having declared that the charge on the land is no lien, the defendant would be entitled to a verdict.\u201d] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b733-8\">The plaintiffs presented the following point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b733-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Under all the testimony in the case, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, for the use of Esther Schmehl, twelve hundred dollars, with interest from April 6, 1883, and the sum of seventy-two dollars, with interest from April 6, 1883, for the use of David T.

It was decided by the court below, upon the petition of the use plaintiff, that the dower mentioned in the deed from Mr. Levan to his daughter, Mrs. Bickel, was a mere recital and not a charge upon the land conveyed.. This decision of the court below was affirmed upon appeal to this court in an unreported case. Mrs. Schmehl then brought this suit, joining with her the administrator of the widow Traut as use plaintiff, making use of the names of the executors of Charles Levan, deceased, as the legal plaintiffs. They are attempting to recover upon a mistaken recital in a deed to which they are neither parties nor privies, and for which they have never paid any consideration. The dower recited in the deed was not created by that instrument; it was merely supposed to exist and its recital was perhaps a mere blunder of the conveyancer. In any event, the plaintiffs show no title to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">The decision of the supreme court, referred to in the above opinion, is. reported as Schmehl\u2019s Ap., 7 Cent. 504.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
