Suit was brought before a justice of the peace to recover back the difference between the amounts advanced and the proceeds of sale. On appeal from the judgment of the justice, the defendant offered to prove the amount and quality of the lumber shipped, for the purpose of showing a claim of set-off. This offer was refused because the affidavit of defense filed showed that the amount claimed as a <em>set-off </em>was <em>-in excess of the justice\u2019s jurisdiction. </em>Held, that this evidence should have been admitted, not to establish a set-off, but to destroy plaintiff\u2019s cause of action; and the j udgment was reversed with a new venire.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b750-13\">Oct. 10, 1888.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AER\">Error No. 182, Oct. 7, 1888, to C. P. Lawrence Co., to review a judgment on a verdict in an action of assumpsit on an appeal from a judgment of an alderman, by Tucker David against P. A. Mills, at Sept. T. 1885, No. 13.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-14\">The evidence was to tbe following effect at the trial, before Hazer, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-15\">- David, through information received by one Hoyt, offered to purchase some sycamore lumber at a specified price, and the offer was accepted by Mills. David made some advances on his contract to help Mills to get out the lumber. When the lumber reached David, he claimed it did not come up to the grade agreed upon, and sold the same, giving Mills credit for the net proceeds. This suit was for the difference between the amounts advanced, freight charges, etc., and the net proceeds of the lumber sold. The defendant claimed that the lumber delivered was worth more than the advances and charges made by the plaintiff. The justice gave judgment for the plaintiff for $300 and costs. The transcript of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the justice showed \u201c defendant claims a set-off of $515, and a right to recover the difference.\u201d An affidavit of defense was filed, but was subsequently lost, so that its allegations do not appear except by the statements made by counsel and the court in the offers of evidence helow. The pleas were \u201c non-assumpsit, set-off, etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel first offered the deposition of Tucker David and Gabriel Hoyt. Objected to by the defense \u2014 to the reading of the depositions; that there is no counter affidavit denying the allegations in our affidavit of defense.

Having paid to the defendant some money, and having paid also some cartage and other charges, he brought the present action before a magistrate and sought to recover a sum of money wjhich he claimed was due from the defendant upon a statement of account made by himself. In this statement, he does not credit the defendant with the price of the lumber which he had received from the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>according to tbeir written contract, but with certain sums of money which he indicates as proceeds of sales \u2014 these amounts being considerably less than the contract-price of the lumber, are not sufficient, in the aggregate, to liquidate the amount charged by the plaintiff against the defendant for remittances of cash and charges paid, and in this manner an apparent balance of $215.49 is due by the defendant, although he was the seller of the lumber. The plaintiff\u2019s statement of the account does not indicate the quantity of lumber received by the plaintiff from the defendant, but simply credits defendant with certain sums \u201c per acct. sales.\u201d Of course, if the plaintiff did not account for all the lumber received, or did not account for all the lumber received, or did not account for the correct prices, the account would not be correctly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Whether the defendant owes the plaintiff anything or not, therefore, depends entirely upon the correctness of the account stated by the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s statement was given in evidence, and certain letters passing between the parties which contained the contract under which the lumber was sold by the defendant to the plaintiff. Then the defendant offered to prove what quantity of lumber he had sold to the plaintiff, but his offer was rejected, because it would show that, instead of the defendant owing the plaintiff the amount claimed, the plaintiff would owe the defendant an amount exceeding the jurisdiction of a justice. The offer was treated as an offer to prove a set-off, but this was an entire misconception of the true character of the evidence proposed. It was the fault of the defendant\u2019s counsel to present the offer in that way, but that circumstance does not alter the legal substance and character of the offer. It was certainly competent for the defendant to prove the real true character of the transaction, and if the actual facts of the case defeated the plaintiff\u2019s claim by disproving his cause of action, the proof was undoubtedly competent. We are clearly of opinion that the rejected offer should have been received, not to establish a set off, but to reduce or destroy the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and therefore the judgment must be reversed. We sustain the third and fourth assignments of error, and dismiss the first and second-.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Judgment reversed and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
