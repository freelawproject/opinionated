The court overruled the motion, the jury found a verdict of guilty as to the man, not guilty as to the woman, and the court imposed a <em>sentence </em>of $500, costs of prosecution and <em>imprisonment in </em>the Allegheny county <em>worhhouse. </em>A writ of error was taken, assigning for error the action of the court, 1, in not quashing the indictment, and, 2, in imposing imprisonment in the workhouse. -Judgment affirmed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b206-9\">Pbr Curiam. \u2014 The criminal procedure Act of March 31,1860, gives <em>jurisdiction </em>to the court <em>of quarter sessions </em>in all eases of crimes not exclusively triable in the oyer and terminer.

The Act of Assembly approved May 13, 1887, \u00a7 1, under the provisions of which the defendants are charged, in the first count, to wit: keeping and maintaining, etc., a house, room, etc., where vinous, spirituous liquors, etc., were sold, merely declares the same to be unlawful and does not provide a penalty or mode of trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">2. The acts charged in the second count are not declared to be unlawful, nor is the offense described in said Act of Assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-7\">3. The indictment should be quashed because of joining of Eugene Quinney and his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-8\">The court overruled the motion, and the jury rendered a verdict finding Eugene Quinney, guilty, and Mary Quinney, not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-9\">The court sentenced Eugene Quinney, to pay a fine of $500 and the costs of prosecution, and undergo an imprisonment in the Allegheny county workhouse for ten months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-10\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court, 1, in not quashing the indictment; and, 2, in imposing imprisonment in the Allegheny county workhouse.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-11\"><em>W. A. </em>Brennan, with him <em>J. K. P. Duff, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJq\">The first count should have been quashed. It is not contrary to the common law to keep and maintain a place where liquors are sold, as provided in the Act of May 13, 1887; and there is no penalty provided in the Act, as a punishment for keeping and maintaining a house, room, place, inn or tavern where liquors, etc., are sold without a license.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-12\">The second count of the indictment is laid under \u00a7 15 of the Act, and presents the anomaly of being strong where the first count is weak, and weak where the first count is strong. The Act nowhere declares it to be unlawful to sell or give liquors, etc., without a license. It simply provides a prmishment for an offense not described or prohibited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-13\">The Act does not provide a mode of trial, nor does it vest jurisdiction in the court of quarter sessions to try offenders against its provisions. The defendant must be tried by a court of quarter sessions, acting and speaking according to law. Mills <em>v. </em>Com., 13 Pa. 630.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-14\">It is repugnant to the spirit of the law, and especially of the criminal law, to have the same act punished in one place differently from another, \u2014 in Allegheny county, imprisonment in the workhouse, throughout the state, confinement in the county jail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-15\">Sentence must conform to the statute.

D. </em>Porter, District Attorney, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3M\">The punishment to which the plaintiff in error was sentenced is within the limits fixed by \u00a7 15 of the Act, in the language of which the plaintiff in error was charged in the second count of the indictment; if, therefore, the court of quarter sessions had jurisdiction of the offense for which this section provides a punishment, the judgment must stand. Those sections of the Act, which precede the 15th, provide that it shall be unlawful to keep or maintain a house, room, etc., where liquors are sold, without having first obtained a license, and regulate the manner in which licenses shall be issued. The 15th section provides a punishment for violation of the prohibitions of the Act, viz: Any person hereafter convicted of selling liquor without a license shall be sentenced to pay a fine and undergo an imprisonment, etc. This means that the person selling without a license shall be legally convicted and sentenced by a properly constituted tribunal. The criminal procedure Act of March 31, 1860, F. L. 438, \u00a7 32, confers jurisdiction upon the courts of quarter sessions within the respective counties, in all cases where an Act imposes fines and punishments and does not expressly provide and enact that any other court shall have jurisdiction. Further, the Act of May 13th, 1887, in providing the punishment for selling liquor without a license, did not create a new offense; it simply changed the punishment of what was then a misdemeanor, of which the court of quarter sessions had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-7\">Under the Act of Feb. 1, 1866, P. L. 8, local to Allegheny county, the court may sentence to either the jail or workhouse, at its discretion.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Apl\">Jan. 7, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b208-8\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"AySu\">The argument that the court of quarter sessions was without jurisdiction, in the case in hand, is without foundation, for the criminal procedure Act of March 31, 1860, gives full jurisdiction to this court in all cases of crimes and misdemeanors not exclusively triable in the oyer and terminer.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Nor is there more merit in the exception relating to the commitment of the defendant to the workhouse, for such commitment is warranted by tbe Act of February 1, 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Judgment affirmed. A. B. W.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">On. sufficiency of indictment, see Genkinger <em>v. </em>Com., 32 Pa. 99.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
