Trunkey \u25a0and Sterrett, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">The action was brought on a guardian\u2019s bond, originally against \u2022all of the obligors, but the record was amended by striking out all but the above named. The plea was non est factum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-9\">At the trial, before Patterson, J., the plaintiff offered in evidence the records of the orphans\u2019 court showing the account of the former guardian and a decree of the court directing the former .guardian to pay over by the present guardian.

A witness testified that there was only one person of the name of H. W. Villee in Lancaster.

I desire to ask this witness whether he is familiar with the hand-writing of H. W. Yillee, and whether in his opinion the name signed to this bond is in his hand-writing, and whether he is familiar with his hand-writing, and has frequently seen him write his signature ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">Objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel generally, and especially on the ground that the rules of court require notice to be given that they intend to prove a forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">Objection sustained; offer disallowed and exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-8\">The rule of court above referred to is not printed in the paper books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-9\">The court charged as follows: \u201c There is nothing before the jury but this bond, and the calculation is so and so. You will find first for the amount of the penalty, and afterward assess the damages, whatever you find due on the former guardian\u2019s account; and we have looked at it, and find it is $395.82.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-10\">Yerdict and judgment for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-11\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court, 1, \u201c in admitting the bond in evidence on mere proof of its being filed among records of office of orphans\u2019 court, without proof of the signature of IT.

Yillee whose name appears in the bond, there being a variance between party named and the signature, party in bond being H. W. Wille and the alleged signature that of H. W.

C. </em>Reinoehl, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEg\">Under the plea of non est factum, the plaintiff was bound to prove the execution of the bond.

Schuylkill Co. <em>v. </em>Copley, 67 Pa. 389.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-15\">The claim of plaintiff below that by rule of court notice is required when forgery is intended to be proved by defendant, does not apply to executors, as the rule of court will show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-16\">The court seems to have been governed by the opinion that the bond in question was an office bond, which has sometimes been admitted to be an exception to the law requiring proof of execution. See 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7 573. But if this exception were well established, which it is not, it would not apply to this case. The identity of the pai\u2019ty was not established.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-17\"><em>B.

Rice <em>v. </em>Constein, 89 Pa. 477; Numbers <em>v. </em>Shelley, 78 Pa. 426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-4\">There is a strong presumption in favor of a record, after lapse of considerable time, even if irregularly kept. McFate\u2019s Ap., 14 W. N. C. 543 ; Shaw <em>v. </em>Boyd, 12 Pa. 215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">A record cannot be contradicted, and must be tried by itself when in existence. Adams <em>v. </em>Betz, 1 Watts, 425.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">Parol evidence is inadmissible to contradict a record.

Morris <em>v. </em>Gilbraith, 8 Watts, 166.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-8\">In the case in hand, as there was a decree of the orphans\u2019 court directing Danner, the guardian, to pay over the money to his successor, Gemperline;, the only defence could be payment. Com. <em>v. </em>Gracey, 96 Pa. 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-9\">It is not necessary that names of obligors should be recited in the body of the bond.
