E. Co., referred to as stating the reasons for the decision in the above case: :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-16\">\u201cIt is argued that the sum of $16,450.13 received for transportation by continuous carriage between points both of which are in Pennsylvania, cannot be taxed, because, during the transit, the goods and passengers were carried out of the state and in again.; This, it was urged, makes the whole carriage inter-state commerce, and we were referred to several cases in support of -the argument. None of them goes that length. In Coe <em>v. </em>Errol, 116 U. S. 517, the court remarks, in discussing another question, that New Hampshire could not tax logs which were started in Maine destined for another point in the same state, were floated down the Androscoggin river into New Hampshire, and were there temporarily detained. Treating this as a decision, however \u2014 and we do not deny its correctness \u2014 it is not in point. If the court had decided that Maine could not tax the logs because they had passed through New Hampshire, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>would be like the one before us. Lord <em>v. </em>S. S. Co., 102 U. S. 541, simply holds that a steamship plying upon the Pacific Ocean between two ports of California was engaged in commerce with foreign nations so as to be subject to the regulating power of Congress ; the reason being, that she was navigating the high seas, on the common highway of nations, where the United States was responsible for her conduct and owed her protection. The question of California\u2019s power to tax the steamship\u2019s receipts was in no way involved or considered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">[\u201c In principle, the case before us does not seem to be within the mischief which the commercial clause of the federal constitution was intended to prevent. In reality and substance, the commerce here is purely internal, whatever the mere form of it may be;] [2] the freight and passengers start from a point in Pennsylvania, destined for another point in Pennsylvania, and are carried to their-destination by continuous transit. Does this become inter-state commerce merely because the railroad curves for a few miles into another state, and then curves back into Pennsylvania? If it does, we reach the somewhat surprising conclusion that the state of New York cannot tax the defendant\u2019s receipts for transportation between the cities of New York and Buffalo, simply because the cars are hauled over a few miles of rails within the state of Pennsylvania; and also that merely to cross the Delaware river and then cross -back a mile or two beyond would make any railroad corporation of Pennsylvania or New Jersey an inter-state carrier as to all traffic which passes over the two bridges. S.o, too, the receipts of a steamboat plying between two ports in the state of Ohio along the Ohio river would be free from taxation by that state if the channel carried her for a few moments only into the state of Kentucky. We do not believe this to be the law, and accordingly hold that the defendant is taxable upon the item of $16,450.13 above named, as being receipts from internal commerce only.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">A.t No. 576, Jan. T. 1888, the court filed an opinion identical with that at No. 114, Sept. T. 1887, except as to amounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">The evidence showed that the defendant transported freight and passengers on their cars from Mauch Chunk, Pa., to Phillips-burg, N. J., thence on the Bel. &amp; Del. R. R. Co. to Trenton, N. J.\u00bf and thence over the Pa. R. R. to Philadelphia. It was from this transportation that the item recited in the opinion was derived; The same cars are used for transportation to points in other states.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">The defendant filed exceptions, in each case, alleging that the court erred, 1, in taxing receipts upon transportation carried out of the state and in again, in course of transit; 2, in deciding as enclosed in brackets in above extract from opinion, indicated by exponent, quoting it; 3, in not deciding that the transportation carried out of the state and in again, in course of transit, was inter-state transportation, and that the taxation of the receipts for such transportation was in violation of that clause of the constitution' of the United States which declares that Congress shall have power <em>\u201c </em>to regulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes and, 4, in directing judgment to be entered in favor of the Commonwealth, as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">The Commonwealth filed exceptions alleging that the court erred, 1, in the conclusion of the law endorsed in brackets, indicated by exponent, quoting it; 2, in not entering judgment for the full amount of her claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\"><em>The assignments of </em>error, on the part of the Railroad Co., specified in each case, 1-4, the action of the court in overruling the above exceptions, reciting them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\"><em>The assignments of </em>error, on the part of the Commonwealth, in each case, specified 1-2, the action of the court in overruling her exceptions, reciting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-9\"><em>M.
