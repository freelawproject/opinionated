The driver was acting as conductor and driver and was inside collecting fares. The conductor, after warning the hoys off several times, came out, and, while tbe car was in motion, pushed the boy, who was driving, away from the brake and off the car, whereupon the plaintiff\u2019s son, in attempting to get off, fell under the wheels and was killed. The court charged that if an ordinarily competent and careful driver would have stopped the car, it was negligence in the driver not to stop, and the plaintiff could recover. <em>Held, </em>not to he error.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b601-14\">The <em>case </em>of Biddle <em>v. </em>R.

J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-7\">The son of the plaintiffs, aged twelve years, was, on Sept. 16, 1883, with two other boys named Gerhart, of about the same age, on Lancaster Avenue, near Fairmount Park, where the defendant\u2019s cars run. A one-horse car, in charge of a driver only, and belonging to the defendant, was standing at the terminus. The driver was either in the car or in the neighborhood. A boy named Salnack was holding the reins. He started the car and called to the Ger-hart boys to get on. Gerhart testified that Biddle asked if he could get on and Salnack said: \u201c I don\u2019t own the car, Clarence. I can\u2019t let you on.\u201d Plaintiff in error, in his paper book, says young Biddle asked the second time and Salnack said: <em>\u201c Well, </em>yes; get on, get on.\u201d But this does not appear in the printed testimony. Biddle got on and Salnack started the car. Biddle was then on the front step of the car. The driver came out and said \u201c Look out! you will break your legs,\u201d and then went inside again. He came out again, when the car was near George\u2019s Hill, and said: \u201cYou boys had better get off,\u201d and again went inside. He came out again, when the car was near Fifty-second Street, and said: \u201cYou boys get off now.\u201d He went into the car again and, shortly after, came out and said: \u201cYou boys get off of here.\u201d Salnack then said: \u201cWait, Clarence, I will stop the car,\u201d which he tried to do, when the driver pushed Salnack away from the brake, so that he fell into the street, and Biddle, who was standing on the lower step, in trying to get off, fell under the car, was run over and killed. The driver made an effort to put on the brake but failed to do so in time. This evidence was corroborated by that of others who saw the accident. The driver testified that the car was going slowly and that he did not push Salnack away but tried to reach the brake. The driver further testified that there was no Slawson box on the car; that he would put the lines around the brake and let the horse go alone while he collected fares ; and he thought it was as well to let Salnack drive as to let the horse go alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-10\">The defendant presented, inter alia, the following points, which were refused:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-11\">\u201c2.

If the deceased, Clarence Biddle, was on the defendant\u2019s \u2022car as a trespasser, was ordered by the conductor or driver to get off \"the car, was not touched by the driver, was not thrown off the car, if the front step is one foot and a fraction of an inch from the track, \u2022and if the car was going at a slow' rate of speed, if, under these circumstances, the boy was frightened by the manner in which the \u25a0order was given, the plaintiffs cannot recover, and the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-5\">\u201c 5. If Clarence Biddle and other boys were trespassers, it was \u2022the duty of the conductor or driver to order them off, and if he did not touch them or throw them off but he only ordered them off, while the car was moving slowly, there is nothing in the warning or ordering them off that renders the company liable, and the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-6\">\u201c 6.

If there was, then the driver is negligent. Would an ordinarily competent and careful driver have stopped the car upon that occasion 5 If he would, then it was negligence in the driver not to have stopped the car upon such an occasion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-9\">v erdict for plaintiffs for $2500, and judgment thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-10\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1, the portion of the charge given above, quoting it; and, 2-6, the refusal of defendant\u2019s points, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-11\"><em>Samuel Gustine </em>Thompson, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlB\">The boy was an intruder and not a passenger and as such the defendant could only be liable for gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

See 112 Pa. 551. We then held that it was error in the court below to enter a compulsory non-suit. It now comes up with a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">, Clarence Biddle, the lad who unfortunately lost his life by this accident, was upon the defendant company\u2019s car by the sufferance of the conductor. The car was what is popularly known as a \u201c bobtail \u201d car, i. e. a car with a Slawson box, and a driver who also acts as conductor. At the time of the injury, the car was being driven by a boy. The latter invited one at least of the party of boys, of whom the deceased was one, to get on the car. Young Biddle got on about the same time, and the conductor subsequently shoved one of the boys off the car, and compelled the others to get off whilst the car was in motion. If a company permits a boy to drive its car, and such driver invites or encourages other boys to get on, it is well to understand that, if the conductor subsequently puts them off, he should stop his ear for that purpose. It was undoubtedly his duty to put them off, using a reasonable amount of force, if necessary; but to put them off by force, or compel them to jump off, while the car was in motion, was quite a different matter. This case differs essentially in its facts from Cawley <em>v. </em>The Railroad Company, 93 Pa. 498, and the other cases cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Judgment affirmed..
