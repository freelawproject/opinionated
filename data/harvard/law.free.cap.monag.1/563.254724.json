J., of the 22d judicial district, specially presiding:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">Some time prior to 1875, Douglass Davidson and Nathaniel Davidson compromised an ejectment suit by selling the land in dispute to one Barber, who gave a judgment to Nathaniel for a part of the purchase money and a judgment note to Douglass for $1,500 for the remainder. Judgment was entered on the latter in 1875 and subsequently a rule was taken to open the judgment, etc., and another rule was taken to show cause why it should not be marked to the use of J. Leroy Corbin. The docket entries show \u201c rule discharged.\u201d The judgment was subsequently opened, on rule, and, in 1880, Sally Davidson, the administratrix and widow of Douglass, compromised the suit, receiving $300 on account of widow\u2019s exemption and $300 on account of dower. This settlement was set forth in the record of the suit, and the judgment marked satisfied. On May 6, 1885, a rule was granted to show cause why satisfaction of the judgment should not be stricken off and the same marked to the use of Ball, executor of Nathaniel Davidson, deceased, or an issue be awarded to try any disputed facts that may appear upon the return of said rule. Nov. 4, 1886, the'rule was discharged. In 1876, Nathaniel began a suit against Corbin and the jury found a special verdict that, at the time of the conveyance to Barber, the $1,500 was to be appropriated to the support of Nathaniel. In 1887, the executor of Nathaniel began this suit against the administratrix of Douglass, to recover the amount of the judgment for $1,500' paid to her in 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">The plaintiff testified that he first learned of the payment to the defendant in 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">An offer was made by plaintiff to prove that Douglass Davidson came to the house of D. B. Cooper to try to make an arrangement with him to take care of his brother, and that he was to build or buy a house and convey it to them if they would take care of him, and that he then said he had the $1,500 judgment of Barber in his hands for the proceeds of the farm that he had agreed to apply for Nathaniel\u2019s support, and that he wanted to do it in this way \u2014 for the purpose of showing his admission that the proceeds of the judgment belonged to Nathaniel Davidson at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-8\">Mr. DeWitt: They have already read that from the records and I don\u2019t think we shall dispute it. The records show that Douglass Davidson held it for the support of Nathaniel Davidson. We shall not introduce any evidence upon that subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">The Court : If I understand the effect of this admission it is not that Nathaniel Davidson was to have the benefit of this entire judgment, hut that this' judgment was to he used for his support while he was living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-11\">Mr. DeWitt: The plaintiff has read from the record the finding of the jury, and that is conclusive, and we shall not dispute it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-12\">William Harris, a witness for plaintiff, testified as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-13\">Mr. DeWitt: Q. They said that they wanted to get a house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>and lot, and that they had $1,500 for Nathaniel\u2019s support, did they not? A. Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">Mr. Overton: Q. One of the expressions was that he had $1,500 belonging to Nathaniel Davidson; state just what he said. A. He wanted to buy a house and lot for Benjamin Cooper and wife to take care of Nathaniel Davidson as long as he lived, and that he had $1,500 to pay for it with. That is just as near as I can tell it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">Mr. DeWitt: We shall introduce no evidence to contradict this, so that you may quit whenever you think you have got it strong enough. It is admitted that Mrs. Cooper would testify that Douglass Davidson told her that he had $1,500 for Nathaniel Davidson\u2019s support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\">The court charged as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">\u201c This is a claim against Sally Davidson, as administratrix of Douglass Davidson, deceased. The plaintiff seeks to recover of Mrs. Davidson, as the administratrix of the estate of Douglass Davidson, and not of her personally, an amount of money which is alleged to have been held in trust for the support of Nathaniel Davidson. There is no plea of no assets, in this case, and we have no knowledge of any funds that have come into the hands of Mrs. Davidson, or whether she has received funds, or not. [So far as this case goes at all, Mrs. Davidson received $600 out of a certain judgment, $300 which she was entitled to take as widow, and $300 which was awarded to her as a part of her one-third interest under the intestate law. This money she was entitled to receive. It was a part of the judgment of Douglass Davidson against James Barber, and there is no evidence in this case to show that that judgment was charged, in any special way, with this trust.] [1] The record shows that, in another case, between other parties, that matter was investigated, and that it was held that the judgment was charged with the trust. [That is not evidence against Mrs. Davidson, as administratrix, and there is no evidence', here, that she is charged with a trust. There is evidence, however, that Douglass Davidson held some money in trust, to be used for the support of Nathaniel Davidson. In what form it was, whether the fund actually was to go to Nathaniel Davidson, or whether it was merely to be used, so much as was necessary, for his support, would be a very difficult matter to determine, under the evidence in this case.] [2] Years have passed, and the evidence in the case is of loose conversations, imperfectly remembered. The witnesses say that they cannot remember the exact language. [More than six' years have passed since the right to recover this money accrued, the statute of limitations is pleaded, and we think properly. For this reason, we think we must instruct you that the plaintiff cannot recover in this action, even if there were no other reason.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-9\">\u201c <em>We </em>do not think that the plaintiff is estopped by the record in the case refusing to mark this judgment to the use of Mr. Ball, for the reason that that was a proceeding against Sally Davidson, herself, and this is a proceeding against the estate of Douglass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Davidson, and they are different parties. But we do think that when they come in to sue Mrs. Davidson, after this long period of time is elapsed, they should be held to the same rule that other persons are held to. An amended declaration has been filed, here, alleging that she voluntarily received this money, but there is no evidence whatever to sustain that charge, and there is no evidence whatever to show that she received any money whatever, except the $600 which the court awarded her. [We therefore direct you that your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d] [4.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-4\">Yerdict and judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1-4, the portions of the charge within brackets, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-6\"><em>D</em>\u2019A.

If fraud is shown, then the statute of limitations runs, not from the time the fraud was committed, but from the time it was discovered. This was not until the fore part of the winter of 1884.

The statute of limitations had been pleaded, and was. a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. More than six years had elapsed between the time when the cause of action accrued and the bringing of the suit. There was nothing to toll the statute. There was an attempt to set up a trust, but it failed. The testimony was vague, both as to the existence of a trust and the nature of it. No chancellor would decree a trust upon such evidence. This view renders a discussion of the other points unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
