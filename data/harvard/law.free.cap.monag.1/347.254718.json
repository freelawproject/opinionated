Sterrett and Mitchell, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">The case stated was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">\u201c Lizzie F. Frank, the above plaintifE, has entered into articles of agreement in writing with Catharine S. Frank, the defendant, bearing date July 28, 1888, for the sale and conveyance of a tract of land mentioned and described in said articles, which, together with the last will and testament of Henry M. Frank, deceased, bearing date Feb. 7, 1879, is made a part of this case stated:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\">\u201c The said plaintifE, who is the only child and heir at law of the said testator, has passed her majority and is still unmarried; the defendant is the widow of the testator; all the debts of the decedent, except those subject to which this property has been sold, have been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-9\">\u201c If the court be of opinion that, under the facts stated, the plaintifE, who is the Lizzie F. Frank mentioned in the aforesaid last will and testament, can make and convey such'title to the property as the aforesaid agreement calls for, then judgment to be \u2022entered for the plaintiff for the sum of two hundred dollars; if not, then judgment to be entered for the defendant, the costs to follow the judgment, and either party reserving the right to sue out a writ of error.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-10\">The agreement provided that \u201cthe interest sold and hereby agreed to be conveyed to the party of the second part and her heirs and assigns, is, with what she now has in said property under the last will and testament aforesaid, a fee simple estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-11\">The material portions of the will are stated in the following \u25a0opinion of the court below, by McPherson, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-12\">\u201c The question here is, whether, under the will of her father, Lizzie F. Frank has how an estate tail in the farm which she has agreed to sell to Catharine Frank. If she has, \u00a7 1 of the Act of 1855, P. L. 368, turns it into a fee simple and makes it freely alienable ; if she has not, she cannot now convey the fee, even if in the future her estate may possibly be thus enlarged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-13\">\u201c It is necessary first to construe the will, and, in doing, so, we must consider the whole instrument, Hopkins <em>v. </em>Glunt, 111 Pa. 290, and give effect to all its parts, if this is reasonably possible. Finney\u2019s Ap., 113 Pa. 18. The rule in Shelly\u2019s Case, which the plaintifE invokes, is not a rule of construction, not a means of ascertaining \u25a0the intention of the testator. It presupposes that intention to be already ascertained. Kleppner <em>v. </em>Laverty, 70 Pa. 73. Turning, then, to the will, we find its relevant provisions to be as follows: The testator first gives to his daughter Lizzie \u2018 during her natural life-time all my real estate wheresoever situate,\u2019 subject to certain reservations, not now important. In the next item, he gives the \u25a0same real estate to his wife Catharine during her natural life-time <em>\u2018 </em>should my daughter Lizzie die before my said wife Catharine and without issue of her body, or should she leave issue of her body and the said issue also die before my said wife.\u2019 Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>provided for this contingency, he goes on to provide for another, as will more clearly appear by a slight transposition of his language: \u2018 Should my daughter Lizzie, however, [survive my said wife and] leave issue of her body, I give and bequeath my said real estate hereinbefore bequeathed unto said issue of my daughter Lizzie.\u2019 Then, in another item, he returns to the contingency of his wife surviving Lizzie and provides : \u2018 In case my said wife Catharine should survive my daughter Lizzie or the issue of her body, if any, and my estate descend unto my said wife, as provided for in a former item,\u2019 his whole estate shall be sold and the proceeds go in specified proportions to his own sister and the sisters of his wife. Arranged in an orderly manner, the above quoted provisions dispose of the testator\u2019s real estate as follows: 1st, to Lizzie for fife; 2d, if she has no issue and dies before Catharine, or if she has issue who also die before Catharine, then to Catharine for life, after whose death it shall be converted into money and the proceeds thereof divided among specific legatees; and, 3d, if Lizzie survives Catharine and dies, leaving issue of her body, then to said issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-4\">\u201c In other words, the testator evidently did not mean to give Lizzie more than a life estate so long as Catharine lived. The latter was herself to have a life estate in case Lizzie and her issue died first, and this provision might have been defeated if he had given Lizzie an estate tail, for this would at once become a fee which she might convey during Catharine\u2019s life. If she did convey, and then died without issue while Catharine survived, Catharine\u2019s life estate could not take effect and a distinct provision of the will would be thus defeated. In that event, also, the bequest of the proceeds could not be carried out, and thus a second distinct provision of the will would be made of no effect. But the whole will is enforced, if its meaning is held to be, that Lizzie\u2019s estate at present is only for life, although it may perhaps be enlarged into a fee if she survives her mother. Whether the will contemplates a definite, or an indefinite, failure of Lizzie\u2019s issue we need not now decide. The question may never arise and can only become important if Lizzie or her issue survive Catharine. The death o'f the latter is the point of time when, if at all, Lizzie\u2019s estate for life will become an estate tail; at present, as Lizzie and Catharine are both alive, the former has only the life estate which vested at her father\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">\u201c In our opinion, the true construction of the will does not, at least for the present, call for the application of the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case; for that rule does not operate where the manifest intention of the testator is to give the first taker only an estate for life. Miller <em>v. </em>Lynn, 7 Pa. 443; Gernet <em>v. </em>Lynn, 31 Pa. 94; Snyder\u2019s Ap., 95 Pa. 179 et seq. We therefore decide that the plaintiff cannot now convey a fee simple in the land, and direct judgment to be entered for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">The only transposition of the language of the will, in the above opinion, is the insertion of the language in brackets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>The assignment of error </em>specified, the action of the court in directing judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-6\"><em>Josiah </em>Funek, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0M\">Under the will, the plaintiff in error has an estate tail in the property, subject to the reservations in favor of her mother. Braden et al. <em>v. </em>Cannon, 1 Grant, 60; 1 Washburn on Real Property, *72, pl. 24, 4th ed.; 2 Jarman on Wills, 137, 5th Am. ed.; Allanson <em>v. </em>Clitherow, 1 Ves. Sr. 24.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-7\">If \"the estate tail, for which we are contending, arises by implication, it would not be destroyed by any of the provisions contained in the will. They all relate to an intermediate failure of issue, which would be entirely compatible therewith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">The word \u201c or \u201d in the last clause of the will bearing upon this question, must be construed to mean \u201c and.\u201d If this is not so, then the widow of the testator might survive the daughter, but not her issue, when the latter would be entirely disinherited. This clearly was not the intention of the testator, and courts will always endeavor to carry that into effect. Doebler\u2019s Ap., 64 Pa. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">That testator gave his daughter in the first instance only an estate for life, will not prevent her from taking the fee under the statute, if he limited the estate to the issue of her body indefinitely. Doebler\u2019s Ap., supra; Haldeman <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-10\">There is nothing in this will to indicate that the testator intended a definite failure of issue. The word \u201c issue \u201d means heirs of the body. Carroll <em>v. </em>Burns, 108 Pa. 387; Angle et al. <em>v. </em>Brosius, 43 Pa. 189; Stone and Wall <em>v. </em>McMullen, 10 W. N. C. 541. A limitation over to \u201c survivor \u201d does not indicate a definite failure of issue. Braden et al. <em>v. </em>Cannon et al., 1 Grant, 61; Kleppner <em>v. </em>Laverty, 70 Pa. 70. Neither does \u201c dying unmarried.\u201d Matlack <em>v. </em>Roberts, 54 Pa. 150. But at common law, the established interpretation of words of limitation on failure of issue whether the terms be \u201cif he die without issue,\u201d \u201cif he die without leaving issue,\u201d \u201cif he have no issue,\u201d or \u201c if he dies before he has any issue,\u201d in the absence of all words making a different intent apparent, is, that they import a general indefinite failure of issue, and not a failure at the first taker\u2019s death. Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 9 Watts, 447; Lawrence <em>v. </em>Lawrence, 105 Pa. 335; Gast <em>v. </em>Baer, 62 Pa. 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-11\">The case stated does not assume that the daughter can convey a fee to her mother, for the mother has an interest in the property of which she cannot be divested. The claim is, that the mother and the daughter together are the owners of the property \u2014 the latter, subject to the former\u2019s interest, has an estate tail, which the Act of Assembly of April 27, 1855, turns into a fee. And that when the mother acquires the daughter\u2019s interest, she has a good fee simple title. That is all the plaintiff in error agreed to convey.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-12\"><em>J. M.
