T. 1888, from O. P. No. 2, Allegheny; Co., to review a decree awarding a preliminary injunction on a bill in equity, at Oct. T. 1888, No. 431. Sterbett, J., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-8\">Bill in equity by the borough of Sewickley and fifteen taxpayers and householders thereof, against the Ohio Valley Gas Co., to restrain the defendant from enforcing an increased charge for gas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-9\">The bill, in substance, averred: 1. The plaintiff, the borough of Sewickley, is a corporation organized under the Act of April 3, 1851, and the other plaintiffs are citizens, householders and consumers of natural gas furnished by defendant. 2. The defendant is a corporation organized under the Act of May 29, 1885. 3. The defendant has availed itself of its rights and privileges under the Act of May 29, 1885, and connected its pipes with the houses and buildings of its consumers. The transportation and supply of natural gas is, by the Act aforesaid, declared to be a public use, and it is the duty of the defendant to furnish consumers natural gas at a fair and reasonable price, and also at a uniform price to all consumers. 4. In November, 1885, defendant made application to the council of plaintiff borough for an ordinance granting to it the right to lay pipes in the streets. Defendant offered to supply natural gas upon terms and conditions as advantageous as any other parties or company would do, and an ordinance was passed acceptable to the offers made by defendant. The ordinance was accepted by defendant and its bond was given for $25,000 faithfully to comply with the same. 5. The ordinance and powers above mentioned constitute a contract and agreement between the borough of Sewickley and the defendant granting to the defendant the exclusive right to open and lay pipes in the streets of said borough from April 1, 1886, to April 1, 1887, and securing to the plaintiffs, resident within its corporate limits, a guarantee that its \u201c rates and charges for the supply of natural gas to consumers shall, at no time and in no event, exceed an average of 20 per cent, less than the cost of coal in any given year.\u201d 6. The defendant has laid its pipes through the streets of the borough; and, on or about Oct. 1, 1886, entered into contracts with plaintiffs, and others, to take gas from defendant at rates which were fair and reasonable, but which were fully up to, if not higher than, the rates and charges provided for in the ordinance, and such as would enable the defendant to realize large profits. 7. Plaintiffs, relying on said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>contract, have fitted np their houses and stores with fixtures and appliances for the use of natural gas, and such fixtures are useless for any other purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-4\">10. The rates and charges fixed by defendant company have continued for the past two years, but, within the past thirty days, notices have been sent out claiming the right to terminate subsisting contracts between it and consumers, and requiring them to make new contracts if they desire to continue the use of natural gas. Consumers have been notified of an increase from October 1, 1888, in the rates and charges for natural gas, of from 50 to 100 per cent. Said rates and charges will be greatly in excess of the rates provided in said ordinance and contracts aforesaid, and in excess of the price of coal. Defendant has threatened to turn off the gas from October 1, 1888, from the houses of the plaintiffs, and the houses of other consumers, unless new contracts are entered into.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">11. Turning off the gas will work great and irreparable injury to plaintiffs and other consumers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">. 12. The rates and charges demanded are in direct violation of the regulations of said ordinance, and of the contract in reference thereto, and are unreasonable, unjust and excessive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">13. Defendant company is supplying, or intends to supply, other consumers with gas at the old rates and charges, unjustly discriminating in its prices against plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">14. There are many other citizens and residents in said borough having similar complaints, who are not named because unknown to your orators, and too numerous to be named, but the bill is filed in their behalf, as well as that of plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-9\">The prayers were : 1. \u00c1 preliminary injunction restraining defendant from turning off the gas upon payment or tender of old rates, and that said preliminary injunction be afterward made perpetual. 2. That the court fix a fair rate, and enjoin defendant from, charging any higher rate, and also from turning off the gas or molesting consumers as long as the rates and charges so fixed shall be paid. 3. General relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-11\">Section 6 of the ordinance referred to in the bill is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-12\"><em>\u201c </em>The rates and charges for the supply of said natural gas to consumers shall at no time and in no event exceed an average of twenty (20) per cent, less than the cost of coal in any given year, and, after due notice and proper investigation, should council decide that said rates and charges were in excess of said average, this ordinance, and all rights and privileges herein conveyed, can, from that fact, be declared null and void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-13\">Section 7 provided that defendant should furnish gas free to the police and fire departments and to the public buildings of the borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-14\">On December 30, 1885, defendant filed an acceptance of the ordinance, agreeing to accept the grant of the rights of way and the exclusive right to supply gas; also binding itself to perform the services as required by \u00a7 7 and agreeing to begin operations on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>test-well in tlie vicinity of the borough. The acceptance did nothin express terms refer to \u00a7 6 of the ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">The company filed a bond conditioned to perform all the legal provisions of the ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">Numerous affidavits were filed by plaintiffs and defendant in support or denial of the averments of the bill. The defendant\u2019s affidavits averred that the exhaustion of the gas fields had been very rapid and that this necessitated the laying of larger pipes and an-extension to new gas fields, which greatly increased the cost of furnishing gas to consumers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\">The court below granted the injunction, in an opinion by White, J., with a concurring opinion by Magee, J., both reported in 6 Pa. C. O. E. 99.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-9\">The following decree was entered :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">\u201cAnd now, viz.: October llth, 1888, this cause came on to be heard, on motion for preliminary injunction, and bill and affidavits filed at this term, and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-11\">\u201cThat, upon the plaintiffs\u2019 filing bonds as hereinafter directed, the defendant, the Ohio Valley Gas Co., its officers, agents and employees, and each of them, be and hereby are enjoined and restrained from shutting off the gas supplied through and by defendant\u2019s pipes and mains, from plaintiffs\u2019 houses and fires in the borough of Sewiekley, or .from interfering with, or disturbing in anyway, the said supply of natural gas to plaintiffs, so long as plaintiffs shall pay or tender payment to the said defendant of the same rates and charges, and in the same installments, as heretofore paid for said supply of gas, until further order of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-12\">\u201c That the plaintiffs severally give bond to said defendant company, with sureties, satisfactory to defendant company or approved by court, in a sum equal to the amount of one year\u2019s gas bill of each several plaintiff, conditioned to pay whatever increased price, if any,, over the rates existing between the several plaintiffs and the defendant prior to October 1st, 1888, as may be finally determined, with the right in defendant company, if an increase is finally allowed, and the arrears of increase be not paid within thirty days, to shut off the gas and proceed on the bonds for the arrears.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-13\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, the action of the court, 1, in entering the decree, as above, quoting it; 2, 8, in the opinion and concurring opinion ; 4, in granting the preliminary injunction ; and, 5, in not refusing to grant the preliminary injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-14\"><em>P. C. </em>Knox, with him <em>J. H. </em>Reed, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ1\">The defendant never accepted \u00a7 6 of the ordinance and never contracted to furnish gas for all time \u00e1t 20 per cent, less than the cost of coal. Where; terms of a contract are proposed and not accepted as proposed, but. in a qualified form, and the parties proceed to execute the contract,, they do so upon the basis of the acceptance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-15\">There was an adequate remedy at law, and equity wall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>entertain jurisdiction.

The kind of coal is not mentioned; and the manner of its consumption is not designated. Such a contract will not be enforced. South Waverley Borough\u2019s Ap., 20 W. N. C. 213; Brown\u2019s Ap., 62 Pa. 17; Mammoth Vein Consolidated Coal Co.\u2019s Ap., 54 Pa. 183; Hilliard on Inj.\u00a7\u00a72-23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">The alleged contract is illegal. This case is an attempt upon the part of the borough, assuming that we have accepted \u00a7 6 of the ordinance, to force the gas company to concede, not to the borough, but to certain individuals, privileges and rights which the borough had no legal authority to exact or the company to accede to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\">The question of the power of the court to establish reasonable rates is not involved in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-7\">The question of reasonableness depends on many contingencies, among others, the copiousness of the supply, the distance carried, the size, cost and character of the conduits, the cost of labor, the price of all materials entering into the plant, the possible duration of the supply from particular fields, the distance to, and cost of reaching other fields, the number of consumers, the manner of consumption, whether wasteful or economical; in short, a thousand considerations, constantly changing. Courts of equity will not enter into such matters. Pullman Palace Car Co. <em>v. </em>Texas Pacific R. R. Co., 11 Fed. R. 625; Marble Co. <em>v. </em>Ripley, 10 Wall. 358; Pomeroy Spec.
