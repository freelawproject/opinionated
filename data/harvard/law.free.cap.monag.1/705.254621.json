[Barry <em>v. </em>Pottsville Borough Town Council et al.]</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b753-10\">The Act of June 25,1885, providing for the <em>election of tax collectors </em>in boroughs and townships by the qualified electors, operates as an <em>impli&lt; A repeal or the prior local latos </em>of April 4,1831, and April 11,1859, authorizing the election of a tax collector for the borough of Pottsville by the town council, notwithstanding the Act of 1885 contains a proviso that the Act shall not apply to any taxes, the collection of which is regulated by a local law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b753-11\">A court of equity will issue an <em>injunction, </em>at the suit of the collector elected by the qualified electors, <em>to restrain the collection of </em>the <em>taxes </em>by the collector elected by the town council, in such case.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AGs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Feb. 17, 1888.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHBk\">Appeal No. 325, Jan. T. 1887, from a decree of O. P. Schuylkill Co., enjoining the borough council from delivering the duplicate of taxes to the tax collector elected by said council, and enjoining the tax collector from collecting the taxes, at Nov. T. 1886, No. 1. Trunkey and Sterrett, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-4\">The opinion of the court below was as follows, by Creen, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-5\">\u201cWilliam Barry was duly elected collector of taxes in the borough of Pottsville, at the last spring election, in pursuance of the provisions of the Act of Assembly passed June 25, 1885. This Act makes the collectorship of taxes an elective office, and is a radical change of the system in force before the Act was passed. In pursuance of its provisions, he took the required oath and filed his bond on March 4, 1886, which was approved by the court on April 5 following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-6\">\u201cIn April, 1886, John Ebert was chosen collector of borough taxes by the town council of the borough, and he subsequently filed his bond, which was approved by the court, reserving any question as to his right to act as collector.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff brings this bill in equity, alleging that the town council of the borough are about to put the duplicate for the collection of the borough taxes in the hands of John Ebert; that this is contrary to law, and that he, the complainant, having been duly elected, and having complied with all the requirements of the law, is the only proper person to collect the said taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-8\">\u201cThe defendant has filed a general demurrer to the bill, and contends that the present bill cannot be sustained ; that, by virtue of his election by the borough council, and the filing and approval of his bond, he has assumed the duties of his office and has become the de facto collector, and that therefore his right to the office can only be inquired into and determined in a quo warranto, which is'the proper and only proceeding to try such a question. Quite a number of authorities have been cited in support of this position, and there is no doubt of the correctness of the general principles contended for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-9\">\u201cBut the defendant\u2019s contention proves entirely too much; followed to its legitimate conclusion, it becomes fatal to his case. If it is true that Ebert is to be regarded as in office, and only to be ousted by a proceeding in quo warranto, how is Barry\u2019s position to be regarded ? Having been elected and complied with the requirements of the law, is he not to be considered as having assumed the duties of the office, and as being the party in possession ? Having first qualified, he has got the prior possession from which he can only be ousted by a quo warranto, and the subsequent claimant, interfering with the prior occupant, in the duties of his office, becomes a mere intruder. <em>Prior in tempore potior in jure. </em>As against an intruder, it would be the duty of the court to protect the occupant in his office until his right to hold the office was determined in a proper proceeding. It is therefore evident that if defendant\u2019s position was correct, it would be fatal to his case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>he would be compelled to resort to a writ of quo warranto to try Barry\u2019s right to the office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-5\">\u201c But we do not regard this as a contest between Barry and Ebert as to who was elected tax collector. Barry was elected by the people, Ebert was chosen by the borough council. Here there is no dispute. The question turns upon the right of the borough council to elect a tax collector. If the law giving this right to the councils has been repealed, then it is evident there is no such office as collector of the borough tax to be elected by the councils of the borough. A party chosen in this way is no more the collector of the borough tax than if he were chosen by the county commissioners, or the borough council of Orwigsburg, or any other unauthorized body.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-6\">\u201c The true question in this case, then, is, does the general Act, passed June 25, 1885, entitled \u2018An Act regulating the collection of taxes in the several boroughs and townships of this commonwealth,\u2019 repeal that provision of the borough charter which authorizes the councils to appoint the collector of taxes? It certainly does, unless the authority is still preserved under the saving clause in the last section, which declares that \u2018this Act shall not apply to any taxes, the collection of which is regulated by a local law.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-7\">\u201c The Act of April 4, 1831, P. L. 439, etc., which is an Act to amend the borough Act of incorporation, in \u00a7 7, gives councils authority \u2018 to appoint street commissioners, treasurer and collector, annually, and such other officers as may be necessary, from time to time.\u2019 By a supplement passed April 11, 1859, the councils were authorized to appoint a collector for one, or two, or more, wards, or one collector for the whole borough, as they might deem for the best interest. It is contended that these are such local laws, regulating the collection of taxes, as brings the case within the exception to the general law of 1885. But there seems to be a clear distinction recognized_in the Act of 1831, between the authority to appoint a collector and the provision regulating the collection of the tax. Section 8 of the same Act provides that, \u2018 all taxes, rates and levies, assessed, rated and levied by the councils shall be recovered in the same manner as the county rates and levies in the county of Schuylkill are or may hereafter be by law recoverable.\u2019 That is, the collection of the taxes is made conformable to the general laws of the commonwealth, and is regulated by them. There are districts in the state where the method of collection is regulated by local law, and is different from the method prescribed by the general law. In some districts, taxes may be paid directly to the county or district treasurer, the taxpayer receiving an abatement of a fixed percentage, according as he pays promptly, and compelled to pay a \u00f1xed percentage for neglect so to pay. In some other districts, other systems are legalized, and the saving clause in the general Act of 1885 was simply intended to except those cases where the method of collection was regulated by a local law. If this be not the true construction of the Act, then it would be safe to say that any borough in the commonwealth, not incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>under the general borough law of 1851, would come within the exception of the Act; for we may be well assured that every special Act incorporating a borough gives authority to assess taxes and appoint collectors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-4\">\u201cAgain, if the defendant\u2019s construction of the Act be correct, its operation in Schuylkill county would be exceedingly limited. By the Act of Feb. 1Y, 1859, P. L. 51, every collector of road, borough or school taxes within the county is required to file his bond with warrant of attorney in the office of the clerk of the general quarter sessions. This is a local law, and affects the parties who are to collect the tax. Therefore, with equal reason, may it be claimed to be a local law, regulating the collection of the taxes, and therefore exempt from the operation of the general Act of 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-5\">\u201cBut we do not think that the Act of 1885 ought to be construed in a narrow or illiberal spirit. It was enacted for the benefit of the taxpayer, and for the greater security of the public moneys, collected by taxation. By its provisions, the citizen, who pays his tax within sixty days after public notice is given, becomes entitled to a reduction of five per cent.; and, if he neglects to pay for six months, then five per cent, is added. Under the old system, the taxpayer, however prompt, is entitled to no reduction, and the result often was that the payment of tax was generally put off to the very last moment, often to the very great detriment of the public interest. For the reasons already given, we are all of the opinion that the Act of 1885, did repeal all prior Acts, so as to take away the authority of the borough councils to elect a tax collector; and that William Barry was duly elected to that position; and therefore entitled to the duplicate for the collection of. the taxes. Section 8, of the Act of 1885, provides that the several county, borough, etc., authorities shall, on or before Aug. 1st, of each year, issue their respective duplicates of taxes assessed to the collector of taxes of their respective townships and boroughs. It would be illegal for them to issue the duplicate to one who is not such collector, and an injunction would undoubtedly lie. \u2018A municipal corporation will be enjoined from doing an act in violation of a statute.\u2019 Cummings <em>v. </em>Sheble, 1 Phila. 492; Lang <em>v. </em>Dickinson, 31 Leg. Int. 36.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-6\">\u201cAnd now, Sept. 27,1886, it is ordered, after hearing, that the preliminary injunction heretofore issued be continued until further order of this court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-7\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court, 1, in deciding that the Act of April, 1885, repealed all other Acts so as to take away the authority of the borough council to elect a tax collector; 2, in not dissolving the preliminary injunction; 3, in making the above decree, quoting it; and, 4, in not sustaining the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b756-8\"><em>W.

Gum</em>ming, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnVl\">The Act of 1831, \u00a7 8, at most establishes only the method of recovering the taxes, but does not negative the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>right of the borough to appoint the collector; for, if such was the intention of the Legislature it would not specially provide in the next preceding section of the same Act for the election of a collector of taxes. Besides, in the absence of the provision of the next preceding section, the first section of the Act of April 11, 1859, P. L. 450, would be a repeal pro tanto of \u00a7 8 of the Act of April 4, 1831.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b757-5\">If the manner of appointing or electing a collector, or more than one, the manner of discharging such collector, the manner of compensating him, and the manner of securing the faithful discharge of his duties, are not provisions regulating the collection of taxes, why does the Act of June 25, 1885, which, by its very title, purports to be <em>\u201c </em>an Act regulating the collection of taxes, etc.,\u201d provide for all these same things ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b757-6\">Malloy <em>v. </em>Reinhard, 19 W.
