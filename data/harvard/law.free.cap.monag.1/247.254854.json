He further averred that he relied on notice from all persons furnishing materials in the construction of his house as required by the Act of June 17, 1887, and that no notice was given under the Act.

A subsequent general Act fully covering the cases provided for by a former one, repeals it by implication. Com. <em>v. </em>Adams, 37 Leg. Int. 405; Mechanics B. &amp; L. Ass\u2019n <em>v. </em>Minnich, 1 Kulp, 513; Rambo <em>v. </em>County Commissioners, 1 Ches. Co. R. 414. Repugnancy between the provisions of the new law and the old, so positive as to be irreconcilable, repeals a statute by implication. Barber\u2019s Case, 86 Pa. 392; Com. <em>v. </em>Erie Railway Co., 98 Pa. 127; Siefried <em>v. </em>Com., 101 Pa. 200.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-8\"><em>S.

They did the tin work on the building. The word \u201c such \u201d should be inserted after \u201c no \u201d and before \u201c material man \u201d in \u00a7 2 of the Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">The Act is unconstitutional, being obnoxious to art. in, \u00a7 3, of the constitution. Borough of Sewickley <em>v. </em>Sholes, 118 Pa. 165. The Act is also bad under art. in, \u00a7 6, of the constitution.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AbX\">Nov. 5, 1888.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b296-10\">Williams, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AaR\">The affidavit of defense set up no answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim on the merits. It rested wholly on the failure of the material man to give the notice of his intention to rely upon his lien as a security for his bill, which is provided for in the 2d section of the Act of 1887. We have held that Act to be unconstitutional, and, therefore, of no effect whatever, in the case of the Titusville Iron Works <em>v. </em>The Keystone Oil Co., decided at the present term. [Reported in 122 Pa. 627.] It is unnecessary to repeat the reasons there given. Whether Bower <em>&amp; </em>Co. were within the provisions of the 2d section or not is a question of no consequence, for the Act falls as a whole. No part of it is in force, and our mechanic\u2019s lien laws stand precisely as though it had never been passed. The court below was right, therefore, in holding the affidavit to be insufficient, and in entering judgment non obstante, and the judgment is now affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Cf. Barrett\u2019s Appeal, 116 Pa. 486, for construction of art. hi, <em>\\ </em>6, of the constitution. See, also, the next case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
