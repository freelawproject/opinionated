In an action by the executors of the renouncing executor to recover his share of the commissions, the defendants offered <em>parol evidence </em>to prove that the decedent was to perform services and assist the executors, and that he had died before the services were rendered and the commissions earned; also, that it was distinctly agreed and understood that plaintiff\u2019s testator should be entitled to share in the commissions on moneys which were actually collected by him and' no more. <em>Held, </em>that the offers were properly refused.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b188-10\">Pee Curiam. \u2014 It was not alleged that there was either <em>fraud, accident or mistake </em>in the execution of the agreement in regard to the commissions.'

Morris Waln, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYhU\">The action could only be maintained by all the executors jointly and not severally. By the Act of May 4, 1852, the name of plaintiff may be added at any stage of the proceedings. The court should have stricken off the name of Howard F. Conrow as defendant. If he was indebted to his testator, that debt was assets in his hands. Berry <em>v. </em>Usher, 11 Ves. 87; 13 Ves. 262; Schnell <em>v. </em>Schroder, 1 Bailey Eq., S. C. 384; Carey <em>v. </em>Groodinge, 3 Bro. C. C. 110; Ingle <em>v. </em>Richards, 28 Beav. 366; Wood v. Tallman, 1 Cox N.J. 157; McCandless\u2019s Est., 61 Pa. 9. The orphans\u2019 court was the proper place to surcharge Howard F. Conrow for his debt. Such a debt is assets in his hands, and is a matter of accounting merely, in reference to which the executor must account before the forum from whence he derived his authority to act, and should not be subjected to suits by his co-executors in a. different forum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-9\">The written contract was not an entire contract. Parol evidence-is admissible of a verbal contract made at the time of the written contract, on the faith of which the written contract was signed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Bank <em>v. </em>Jones, 10 W. N. C. 436; Driesbach <em>v. </em>Bridge Co., 81* Pa. 177; White <em>v. </em>Dixon, 35 Leg. Intel. 114; Burk <em>v. </em>Kerr, 12 W. N. C. 191; Keough <em>v. </em>Leslie, 92 Pa. 424; Whitney <em>v. </em>Shippen, 89 Pa. 22; Hoopes <em>v. </em>Beale, 90 Pa. 82; Barclay <em>v. </em>Wainwright, 86 Pa. 191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-4\">The written contract is incomplete and ambiguous, and was executed only on the faith of the distinct and express parol contract by which it was expressly agreed what share of the commissions the said George E. B. Conrow was to receive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-5\">There was no promise in the written agreement to pay any certain sum of money. The agreement was to share in the executors\u2019 commissions. Until they are earned and allowed, the executors would be entitled to nothing. Here one of the four executors died before any assets were collected. His legal representatives are not entitled to commissions earned after his death. An executor\u2019s share of the commissions is the share to which he would be entitled to receive at the time of his death.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-6\"><em>Charles L. Lockwood, </em>for defendants in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYt\">cited the quotation, given in the opinion of the supreme court, from 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl., 16 Am. Ed., p. 23; also Williams on Executors, foot page 957; Packer <em>v. </em>Wilson, 15 Wend. 343; Gordon <em>v. </em>Goodwin, 2 Nott. &amp; McCord, 70. Also Saunders, 291, i. note to <em>Cabell </em>v. Vaughan; and Williams on Executors, foot page 957.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-7\">The reason for the rule laid down in Chitty and Saunders probably is that non-joinder can work no harm to the defendant, as a judgment for or against him would protect him from further demand. Whereas, the omission of a joint promisee would leave the defendant liable to another action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-8\">One executor can give a valid release, Devling <em>v. </em>Little, 26 Pa. 502; surrender a lease, Reber <em>v. </em>Gilson, 1 Pa. 54; submit to arbitration so as to bind the estate, Grace <em>v. </em>Sutton, 5 Watts, 540; appear to a sci. fa. and confess judgment, Gees <em>v. </em>Shannon, 2 Watts, 71; or satisfy a mortgage, Stuyvesant <em>v. </em>Hall, 2 Barb. Ch. 151.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-9\">The motion made by defendants below to add Howard Con-row\u2019s name as plaintiff and strike it out as defendant, was properly denied. It was made as one motion, and must be considered as a whole, and it cannot be regarded as an application by a co-executor to be allowed to join in a suit by his fellow-executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-10\">In the absence of a proper plea, spreading the fact upon the record, the court will not infer from the production of letters testamentary naming Howard as executor, that he remained an executor until 1883, when the light of action accrued, or until 1887, when this action was commenced. Non constat Howard was removed or discharged before the right of action accrued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-11\">At common law, the appointment of a debtor as executor released and extinguished the debt, which in equity was regarded as assets in his hands. The reason given for this doctrine is that because the remedy is gone, an executor not being able to sue himself, therefore the debt must be considered as extinguished. Williams on Exrs., foot p. 1310 ; Addison on Cont. 1302.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The reason for the rule, and therefore the rule itself, are not applicable to this case. Here, without an executor suing himself, there can be no recovery in compliance with the forms of law, the only irregularity, if any, being waived by the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">In Pennsylvania, the debt is not extinguished. Act of February 24, 1834, \u00a7 6, 1 Purd. 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">Defendants\u2019 offers were clearly incompetent and were properly rejected. Plaintiffs\u2019 testator was not to perform services in consideration of a share of commissions.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACi\">Jan. 28, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-8\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"AGg\">It is said in Chitty on Pleading, Vol. 1 of the tenth American edition, at page *20, that \u201cIf only one of several executors or administrators brings an action, either of debt or assumpsit, or in tort, it is settled that the defendant can only take advantage of the non-joinder of the co-executor or administrator by pleading in abatement, after oyer of the probate or letters of administration, that the other executor or administrator therein mentioned is alive and not joined in the action.\u201d If the defendant pleads the general issue he is too late. 1 Saunders, 291. The reason of the rule may be found in the fact that the non-joinder can do the defendant no harm, as a verdict for or against him is a full protection. A receipt or release by one executor discharges the debt. Devling <em>v. </em>Little, 26 Pa. 502. This is an answer to the first assignment of error. No application in reference to the non-joinder of Howard Oonrow, executor, as one of the plaintiffs, was made until the general issue had been pleaded. It came too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Nor do we see any error in rejecting the evidence referred to in the fifth assignment. It was not alleged that there was either fraud, accident or mistake in the execution of the agreement in regard to the commissions. Aside from this, the offer did not propose to show that the evidence had any reference to what took place at the time the paper was executed; nor was any time whatever designated when the alleged modification of the original agreement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">As there was nothing in the case to contradict the documentary evidence, it was not error to instruct the jury to find for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Judgment affirmed.
