When he overtook him, a struggle ensued, and the officer was dragged or fell over an unguarded precipice, upon defendants\u2019 lot, and was killed. The precipice was caused by the grading of a street by the city some years before the accident, and was within the officer\u2019s beat. It was in a thickly settled neighborhood. The court below entered a <em>compulsory nonsuit. Held, not </em>to be error..</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b302-10\">Oct. 24, 1888.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmK\">Error, No. 104, Oct. T. 1888, to O. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., to review judgment of compulsory nonsuit in an action on the ease, by Elizabeth Woods against E. J. and S. H.. Lloyd, for damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband, by the-alleged negligence of defendants, at Jan. T. 1887, No. 119.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-11\">At the trial, the evidence was to the following effect: On the-night of Sept. 4, 1886, an affray occurred-at the corner of Fifth. Avenue and Chestnut Street, in Pittsburgh. During its continuance, a pofice officer came up and arrested one of the participants. The prisoner escaped and George Woods, also an officer, started in pursuit. The fugitive, with a companion, ran up Linden Street and made the ascent to a plateau on which defendants\u2019 lot is situated. Woods followed closely after them. He overtook them near a stable, standing near the edge of a precipice, 38 feet high, overlooking-Locust Sti\u2019eet. Some of the testimony indicated that Woods was-pursuing the fugitive closely and, in the heat of the pursuit, followed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>him over the cliff, and some of it that he actually had seized him, and, in the struggle by the fugitive to get away, both fell together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-4\">The plateau is bounded by Linden, Boyd, Locust and Chestnut streets. Defendants own the lot on the corner of Locust and Boyd streets, fronting 80 feet on Boyd and 180 on Locust. The highest elevation above the streets is at this corner, and the accident occurred on the Locust street front, 120 feet from Boyd street, the precipice there being, as stated, 38 feet high. There are no fences or guards whatever surrounding this lot. Linden street, which runs parallel with Locust and about 190 feet from it, ascends from Chestnut by a grade of about ten feet to the hundred until it reaches the cliff overlooking Boyd street. It is there continued by a well worn road (not, however, a public road) winding to the left (toward Locust street), passing close to the-spot from which \"Woods and Henning fell, and completing the circuit by returning to Linden street at a point about half way from Boyd to Chestnut. A worn foot-path leads off from this road where it turns back to Linden street, down to Locust, striking the latter at a point some 300 feet above the spot where the accident occurred. There is a stairway leading from the corner of Forbes and Boyd streets to Linden street, striking it at the point where the worn roadway leads off from it. The neighborhood is thickly settled. Linden street has a number of houses on it; many teams pass over the roadway, and a great number of foot passengers go up the stairway and across the plateau past the place of the accident and descend to Locust street by the pathway before described. This wagon road and footpath have existed for a number of years. The precipice in question resulted from the grading of Locust street by the city, which was done a number of years since. The plateau was in Woods\u2019s beat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\"><em>The assignment of error </em>specified the action of the court in entering a compulsory non suit, and in refusing a motion to take it off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-7\"><em>S.
