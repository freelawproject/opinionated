The conveyance was not for a substantial money consideration, but as a gift in consideration of natural love and affection, and the nominal sum of twenty dollars. The words are: \u2018 For the natural affection which I boar my two sons, as well as for and in consideration of the sum of twenty dollars to me in hand paid by my two aforesaid sons, at or before the sealing of these presents, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, have this day granted, bargained, assigned, transferred and set over, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, assign, transfer and set over unto the said two sons, their executors, administrators or assigns, all my estate, both real and personal, which I have or may have, in or about the Borough of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Tarentum, including lot No. 164, whicli was purchased from John Bell in said borough, with all my personal effects, with all interest due or to become due on the same, together with all improvements which are or may be made on or about the aforesaid premises, and all my right, title, interest and property, claim or demand whatsoever, of, in and to the aforesaid property and effects, and to have and to hold the aforesaid property and effects to themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">\u201c There is no covenant of warranty or for future conveyance. The deed is simply a transfer of the grantor\u2019s interest in all his real and personal estate in and about the borough of Tarentum. The expression \u2018 which I have or may have \u2019 does not cover or include property which he might thereafter acquire. It properly refers to any doubtful or uncertain interest in the property then transferred, or which he might thereafter acquire in the same property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">\u201cA man cannot convey property which he does not own or have any interest in at the time. He may, for a valid consideration, covenant to convey certain property in which he has an expectancy, and be held liable on the covenant. In this case there is no such covenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7\">\u201c The principles and authorities on this subject are so fully discussed in the opinion of the supreme court in Bayler <em>v. </em>Com., 40 Pa. 37, that it is only necessary to refer to that case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-8\">[\u201cAnd now, Oct. 20th, 1888, this case came on to be heard on the case stated, and therefore, upon consideration thereof, it is ordered and adjudged that judgment be entered on the case stated for the plaintiff against the defendant for fifteen hundred and fifty dollars, with interest thereon from Oct. 15th, 18S8, and costs of suit.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-9\"><em>The assignment of error </em>specified the action of the court in entering judgment as above, quoting the decree as in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-10\"><em>Charles </em>Uhlinger, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A20\">A mere possibility can be granted by release, devise or estoppel, and is directly assignable in equity and therefore at law in Pennsylvania.
