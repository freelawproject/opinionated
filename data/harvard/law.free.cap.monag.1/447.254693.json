[Bard\u2019s Estate.]</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"0\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b495-13\">A testator by his will created a <em>trust for accumulation </em>as follows: \u201c I give to my executors, in trust for the use of my daughter and her issue, the sum of $4000, the interest of which at five per cent, shall be annually added to the principal so long as her present husband shall live, unless her death should sooner occur, but in case she become a widow, then my executors shall annually, on the first of April, pay the interest of the preceding year to her, and, at her death, if she leaves issue or the descendants of such, the principal sum, with the accumulated interest, shall be paid to such issue or descendants.\u201d At the time of testator\u2019s death in 1865, the daughter was 29 years old. On a rule on the testator\u2019s administrator, in 1888, to pay over the money to the daughter, the court below held that she was entitled to the principal and accumulated interest absolutely, under the Act of April 18,1853, regulating trusts for accumulation. <em>Held, </em>not to be error.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b495-14\">May 17, 1888.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGnk\">Appeal, No. 59 July T. 1888, from a decree of the O.

Brubaker presented a petition to the orphans\u2019 court, the averments and prayers of which are set forth in the following opinion of the court, by Patterson, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">\u201c The court is of opinion that this proceeding should have come before the court by a bill in equity. An answer to such bill (as it seems the proceeding is not antagonized but admittedly introduced to test the law involved) would have rendered more certain the facts of the case and thus strengthen the. authority of the application of the law submitted. [The petition averred that] Michael Bard, late of Lancaster county, died in the year 1865, having first made his will in writing, which was duly probated, and by which he appointed his wife, Martha, C. S. Hoffman and E. G. Groff his executors ; that said executors all renounced or have been discharged and letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. of said testator have been duly granted to Boland H. Brubaker; that the will of said Michael Bard contained, inter alia, the following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">\"'7th. I give to my executors in trust for the use of my daughter Annie, and her issue, the sum of four thousand dollars, the interest of which at five per cent, shall be annually added to the principal so long as her present husband shall live, unless her death should sooner occur, but in case she become a widow, then my executors shall annually, on the first of April, pay the interest of the preceding year to her, and at her death, if she leaves issue or the descendants of such, the principal sum with the accumulated .interest shall be paid to such issue or descendants.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">\u201c That the said sum of $4,000 came into the hands of the said Boland H. Brubaker, administrator as aforesaid, and the interest thereon has accumulated in his hands until the said bequest, with its accumulated interest, now amounts to the sum of $9,271.62. That she is advised and believes that the said bequest and trust for accumulation is void, and that all the increase on. the said bequest of $4,000.00 belongs to her absolutely, and she is further advised and believes the bequest of the said sum of $4,000.00 for the use of herself and issue created an absolute estate in her, in the said sum of $4,000.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-8\"><em>\u201c </em>She therefore prays the court to order and decree that the said administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. as aforesaid shall pay over to her the said sum of $9,271.62, being the said bequest of $4,000.00 with its accumulations as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-9\">\u201c The foregoing facts are not questioned or disputed. Besides it is admitted that Annie E. Brubaker, the cestui que trust, was born May 22d, 1836, and the testator Michael Bard died in 1865, which would show her to have been some eight years over her minority at the happening of that event, and that more than twenty-one years have elapsed since the said testator\u2019s death, and the Act of April 18, 1853, regulating trusts for accumulation, makes it clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>that this trust accumulation can only be supported or extended to minors. \"Washington\u2019s Est., 75 Pa. 102. There are no limitations over in the bequest to Annie E. Brubaker that are inconsistent with a fee simple, as it seems to us, if it was a devise, nor the absolute title, when a bequest of personal property, as in the present case. The will of Michael Bard gives to Annie E. Brubaker, his daughter, the petitioner, an absolute title to the four thousand dollars and the accumulations, as stated in the petition. We are of the opinion that this disposition of the case before us will be found to be sustained by a long list of authorities, among which are the following: Williams and Wife <em>v. </em>Leech et al., 28 Pa. 89; Potts\u2019s Ap., 30 Pa. 168; Smith\u2019s Ap., 23 Pa. 9; Ralston <em>v. </em>Waln et al., 44 Pa. 279; Kay <em>v. </em>Scates, 37 Pa. 31.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">[\u201cAnd now, this 26th day of April, 1888, it is ordered and decreed that Roland H. Brubaker, administrator d. b, n. c. t. a., file his account in the proper court of the alleged trust property in his hands; and shall pay over to Annie E. Brubaker, the petitioner, the said sum of $9,271.62, being the said bequest of four thousand dollars, with its accumulations. And it is further ordered that the costs in this case be paid out of the fund in the hands of said Roland H. Brubaker as trustee.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-7\"><em>The assignment of error </em>specified the decree of the court, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-8\"><em>Eugene G.
