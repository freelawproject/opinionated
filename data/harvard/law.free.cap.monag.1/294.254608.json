[Coleman, to use, <em>v. </em>Ruple.]</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b342-5\">On an <em>application to open a judgment </em>entered on-a penal <em>bond for </em>the <em>purchase money </em>of real estate, it appeared that the title to the land was originally in one Mylert, who, in 1862, granted to a steam railroad company, a right of way over the land in question. The deed for the right of way was recorded, and a plot of the land showing the right of way was also recorded. The railroad took possession and built a single track which was visible at the time of the conveyance from the plaintiff to the defendant. At the date of the indenture, a street railway company was in possession of the right of way. The deed from the plaintiff to the defendant contained a <em>reservation of </em>any <em>right of way </em>which might have been acquired by the street railway. The court below refused to open the judgment, on the ground that the defendant had at least <em>constructive notice </em>of the right of way. <em>Held, </em>not to be error.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b342-6\">Feb. 27, 1889.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADk\">Appeal, No. 213, July T. 1888, from a decree of C. P. Lackawanna Co., discharging a rule to open a judgment, wherein James <em>W. </em>Coleman, to the use of Jane De Witt, executri of Ezra De Witt, deceased, was plaintiff and Selden J. Euple was defendant, at Nov. T. 1887, No. 88.' Williams and McCollum, JJ., absent..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-7\">The facts are stated in the following opinion, by Hand, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-8\">u There are no equities in this case which call for the interference of the court, or, upon the testimony shown, require that we should open this judgment. In fact, if there were any legal equities by way of defense, the amount is so small as to come within the maxim de minimis non curat. The facts shown in the case, beyond a doubt, settle any such defense as defendant sets up. On August 10, 1885, Coleman conveyed to Euple the lots in question, and took back a purchase-money mortgage which was assigned to the plaintiff,. De Witt. A right of way existed in favor of and, under all the evidence, presumably, in possession of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. over one corner of the lot. Euple claims a failure of title as to this right of way or an encumbrance, and seeks to deduct a pro rata part of the purchase-money, which would be a little over $10, but which he claims to show should be $400 or $500. The consideration of the two lots was $525, and the encumbrance did not exceed 90 feet out of 4,320 square feet. The title confessedly was originally in Amos N. Meylert. On February 12, 1862, Meylert granted to the Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. the right of way in question for its railroad track not exceeding 66 feet in width. The deed for right of way was duly recorded November 26, 1863. Meylert laid out his land and included these lots on a plot. This plot was recorded on January 6, 1871, and showed this right of way thereon and the interference with the land.involved in this controversy. The deed from Coleman to Euple reserved any right of way which may have been acquired by the .People\u2019s Street Eailway Co. over these lots. The Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. had taken possession of this right of way and built their single track thereon prior to recording the Meylert plot. At the time of purchase, the track of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. was visible, and the* Street Eailway Co. was in visible possession of the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>encumbrance. From the evidence, the possession of the Street Nailway Co. was temporary and, presumably, under, or by permission of, the Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. Under all the facts of the case, we think the conclusions of law are: that Nuple had at least constructive notice of this right of way; that the reservation in his own deed and possession of the Street Nail way Co. put him on inquiry, not simply how long the Street Nailway Co. was to occupy, but by what title. The presumption is, such inquiry would have given actual notice of what the record and conveyances in the line of title showed, that the Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. was in actual ownership and possession of the right of way. Under the circumstances, the equities are against the defendant. We remark, further, that the measure of damage is only the pro rata part of the purchase-money paid in the deed. This, as we have remarked, is very small. The rule in this case is discharged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-4\"><em>The assignment of error </em>specified the action of the court in discharging the rule and in not opening'the judgment and allowing the defendant to make his defense thereto. \u25a0 \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-5\"><em>John F.
