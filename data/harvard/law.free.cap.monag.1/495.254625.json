T. 1889, to C. P. Lackawanna Co., to review a judgment on a verdict for plaintiff on a sheriff\u2019s interpleader, wherein Ellen O\u2019Donnell was plaintiff and T. B. Treusdell &amp; Co. were defendants, to determine the ownership of personal property levied upon as the property of plaintiff\u2019s husband, at March T. 1888, No. 301. Williams and McCollum, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-13\">The facts appear by the following charge of the court, by Hand, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-14\">\u201c The evidence in this case is that the plaintiff owned household furniture in her own right; that her husband was sold out by the sheriff, and that then she undertook to go into business on her own responsibility; that she filed her petition for her separate earnings which was allowed by the court; that at that time the only property she had was some household furniture; that she went to Mr. Winton and borrowed $100 and gave him her own note for the same, being a judgment note with waiver of inquisition and the exemption law; that with this money, and $50 which she borrowed from a relative, and $25 or $30 she borrowed from another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>relative, she purchased goods and opened a store and carried on business, and paid her bills out of the store. That is the evidence in this case. Now, the only point is whether she borrowed this money upon the credit of her estate, that is, upon the credit of her household furniture. If she did, she is entitled to the property she acquired by reason of that credit. If she did not, then she is not entitled to it, and the verdict should then be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-4\">[\u201c There is no positive evidence in this case that she borrowed this money upon the credit of her estate;, all the evidence is, that she had this estate, and that she gave this judgment note with the waiver in it to Mr. Winton when he loaned her the hundred dollars on her own name. We leave it for you to infer whether she borrowed it on her estate or not, under all the evidence in the case.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\"><em>\u201c </em>If you find from the evidence that you are warranted in concluding she did borrow it upon the credit of her estate, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff. If you find she has not clearly proven she borrowed it upon that credit, then your verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1, the portion of the charge in brackets, quoting it; 2, the action of the court in allowing the jury to infer facts necessary to be proven by plaintiff: I. What did the household furniture consist of? II. Value of the same? III. That the money was borrowed upon the credit of her separate estate. IV. That the household furniture was of such value, as to be security in proportion to the credit given; and, 3, in not directing the jury to find in favor of defendants, as there was no evidence that she borrowed the money upon the credit of her separate estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-8\"><em>J. M. C. Ranck, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY1b\">Goods purchased by a married woman on her own credit, are not her separate property. Robinson <em>v. </em>Wallace, 39 Pa. 133; Leinbach <em>v. </em>Templin, 105 Pa. 526; Blum <em>v. </em>Ross, 116 Pa. 163.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-9\">Her credit is nothing in the eyes of the law; when she does contract, the law esteems her the agent of her husband. Hallowell <em>v. </em>Horton, 35 Pa. 375 ; Leinbach <em>v. </em>Templin, supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-10\">A married woman must have a separate estate to protect her purchase upon credit, an estate available, and proportionate to the credit it supports. The purchase must, in fact, be made, not upon her credit, but upon the credit of her separate estate, upon her ability to pay out of her own funds. Gault <em>v. </em>Saffin, 44 Pa. 307; Leinbach <em>v. </em>Templin, supra; Lochman <em>v. </em>Brobst, 102 Pa. 486. And she must affirmatively establish that fact. Blum <em>v. </em>Ross, 116 Pa. 168; Seeds <em>v. </em>Rahler, 76 Pa. 862.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-11\"><em>O'Brien &amp; </em>Kelley, not heard, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax1\">Where a feme covert owns property of value sufficient to serve as the foundation of a credit, direct proof that the credit was based upon it may not be necessary, for the jury may infer that fact from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>circumstances surrounding the transaction. Spering <em>v. </em>Laughlin, 113 Pa. 209; Blum <em>v. </em>Ross, 116 Pa. 163.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AIIa\">Feb. 26, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b545-5\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"AJb\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">When this ease, and the case of Buch <em>v. </em>Long, supra, page 458, were heard in the supreme court, the case of Orr <em>v. </em>Bornstein, 23 W. N. C. 356, had just been decided, establishing the law as stated in the syllabus to the above case. This case cannot be relied upon, therefore, as a precedent for the point decided in the court below. The supreme court would not reverse, although the instruction might have been erroneous as applied to a married woman who had not taken the benefit of the Act of 1872.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
