In an action for damages for <em>negligence </em>on the part of the railroad company, the plaintiff testified that the reason he got off on the track side was because the step on the other side overhung a ditch. He further testified that there was such a curve in the railroad track that, in alighting, he could not see around the engine of the train from which he was alighting; that he looked up and down the track, saw nothing, heard nothing, and started to cross, when he was struck. Plaintiff\u2019s son testified that the curve in the track was so great that one, standing on the track, could not see up the track further than 200 or 400 feet. He also testified that the plaintiff stopped and looked before starting to cross. There was evidence that no signal was given by the approaching train. Witnesses, produced by the plaintiff, gave evidence of <em>contributory negligence </em>by testifying that the plaintiff stepped down immediately in front of the approaching train. The court entered a compulsory non-suit.' <em>Held, </em>not to-be error. *</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b170-11\">Per Curiam. \u2014 Had the plaintiff used his eyes, he could not have failed to see the approaching train, and at a sufficient distance to have avoided the accident. . . .

P. No. 2, Phila. Co., to review a judgment of compulsory non-suit in an action on the case for personal injuries, at Aug. T. 1-885, No. 133.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-13\">The evidence was to the following effect: On July 13, 1881, the plaintiff was a passenger, in the smoking car, on defendant\u2019s railroad, going into Camden. His destination was \u201c.Kaighn\u2019s Avenue Crossing,\u201d in the city of Camden, which was a regular stopping-place for discharging and receiving passengers, but at that time there was no station house or platform there. There are two tracks at .this point on defendant\u2019s railroad. The plaintiff, between six and seven o\u2019clock in the evening, it being still broad daylight, alighted from the front end of the car, on the left-hand or track side, and, while crossing the second track, was struck by another train moving rapidly out of the city. There was a space of some four feet between the tracks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-15\">The plaintiff testified, inter alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-16\">\u201c The curve was so great that when I got down onto the bottom step of the car that I got off and looked up the. road and could see nothing but the engine ahead of us. I stood on tlie step and .looked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Tip the road, and then looked down the road, and stepped off. . . . I stepped down and was walking leisurely away from the train. ^ I saw no danger and saw nothing coming. Q. Did you hear' any whistle or bell, or any noise of any approaching train ? A. No, sir I did not hear anything. Q. When you left the train was it standing still or in motion ? A. It was standing still. Q. And you heard no other train? A. No, sir. We got down, or I got down, and walked off leisurely ahead and I got into the middle of the track. It appeared to me as if the train come up out of the ground, it came that quick on me. I hadn\u2019t time to either go back or go forward. There I was. I was struck and badly hurt \u2014 thrown across the road \u2022 \u2014 and have been suffering ever since. That is all I can say about it. . . . Q. State whether or not there was any reason why you could not get off on the right-hand side of the train. A. Yes, sir. Q. What was it ? A. Simply because on the right-hand side of the train the grade of the road was so much higher than it was in the centre. It was a better place to get off on the left. It was a leveler surface and an easier place to get down than it was on the right. Q. Do you know whether or not the car was on a level when you got off? A. Yes, sir; it was on the level. Q. And the bank was-on the right-hand side ? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s son testified, inter alia, as follows: \u201c Q. Can you state whether or not there is a bend in the road at that place? A. Yes, sir; there was a bend \u2014 well, you couldn\u2019t see anything two hundred feet, I was going to say, away from it \u2014 except trees. Q. Which way does the curve bend ? A. It bends westward. . . . Q. From Kaighn\u2019s Avenue how rapid was this curve ? A. You couldn\u2019t see a, train on the track four hundred feet, unless you would come out nine feet westward of the down track. . . . I saw my father look up toward Camden, and thence toward Haddonfield; that is, in the direction of Haddonfield, because he was in advance of me. Q. Then what occurred? A. He was struck. I didn\u2019t see him struck, but I know that he was struck. Q. Were you struck? A. Yes, sir. . . . After I stepped down, in looking up I looked around Another thing \u2014 what hindered the view, the car we were in was in the rear of the train, I am almost positive. Of course I couldn\u2019t see anything but the railroad track and gravel. That was all I could see \u2014or coal dirt. Q. Your own train obscured the view until the car gets there? A. Yes, sir ; the one that I came up in.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-9\">Several witnesses testified that no signal was given by the approaching train.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-10\">A witness testified, inter alia, as follows: \u201c Just as the train came to a standstill, to a stop, two men passed out of the car. This man (referring to plaintiff) was in the lead; he went down the steps with his head down, and, just about the time that he landed, I saw this train coming. \u2022 At one and the same time he was thrown in the air, and the other man was knocked somewhere I couldn\u2019t tell where. That was all I saw of it. The other train moved on and blocked my seeing anything-further.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Another witness testified, inter alia: \u201c When they got off, I stepped up to look out of the door, and I saw Mr. Morgan just crossing the track. There was no engine or anything at the present time, as I seen, but I turned around to speak to one of the '.other men that was getting off, and when he got off he hallooed \u2018 Goodbye \u2019 to me, and I turned and looked and saw a train cpming. I hallooed to Mr. Morgan, \u2018For God\u2019s sake, look out; you will get struck.\u2019 Before Mr. Morgan could step either one way or the other the train was on him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-4\">Another witness testified, inter alia: \u201c I was sitting on this side of the car, the left-hand side, right close to the window, as I gen-, \u00abrally did sit. I saw the train coming just as he was in the act of stepping off the step. I saw the train coming out. I could see it from- where I was sitting, that is, I could see diagonally through the window the end of the train coming. Just at that moment, as it \u2022didn\u2019t take but a moment, he was struck and went into the air all in a second.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-5\">Another of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified, inter alia: \u201c Q. Did you see the accident \u2014 did you see them struck? A. Y% sir; I saw it. Q. State what you saw. A. We got off the train at the avenue. 1 got off the rear end. Q. And crossed over the\u2019 track ? A. .Yes, sir. Q. When did you first see the locomotive? A. When I stepped off the step I got down and got in the middle of the track, and 1 happened to' turn my head and look, and I gave a halloo and jumped, and with that I saw Morgan going up. Morgan went up, and it flung him on the other side of the avenue. Q. Did you. have to jump; was there any occasion for your jumping? A. Yes, sir; I liad- to. If I did not it would have hit me. I had to get off, there as quick as I could.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-6\">At the' conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the court below entered a compulsory non-suit, and, on motion, subsequently made, refused to take it off.

The undisputed evidence in the case shows that the plaintiff below was a passenger on the railroad of the defendant company. His destination was Kaighn\u2019s Avenue Crossing in the city of Camden. The said Crossing was a stopping place to discharge and receive passengers, but without either a station or platform. The train stopped there, on the occasion referred to, and the plaintiff, instead of getting off on the side where passengers usually alight, stepped off on the other, or track, side of the road, and was injured by a passing train. Had he used his eyes, he could not have failed to see the approaching train, and at a sufficient distance to have avoided the accident. We have repeatedly said that a man who deliberately or negligently steps in front of an approaching train has no cause of action in case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of injury. As was said in the case of Carroll <em>v. </em>Pa. R. R. Co., 12 W. N. C. 348: \u201c It is in vain for a man to say that he looked and listened, if, in despite of what his eyes and ears must have told him, he walked directly in front of a moving locomotive.\u201d To the same point is the recent case of R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Bell, 22 lb. 370. The reason given by the plaintiff for getting off on the wrong side has little force. He said : \u201c It was a better place to get off on the left. It was a leveler surface and an easier place to get down than it was on the right.\u201d Yet there was neither allegation nor proof that it was unsafe to get off on the right, where passengers usually alighted, and if, to avoid it, the plaintiff voluntarily got off at a known place of danger, he has no one to blame but himself for this unfortunate accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Judgment affirmed.
