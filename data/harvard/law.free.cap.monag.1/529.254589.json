The deed from Francis Tyler and wife to Francis A. Tyler, of Aug. 22, 1849, did not create an estate tail in Francis A.

The deed from Francis A. Tyler and wife to James H. Webb, May 13, 1856, with the deed from said James H. Webb, back to said Francis A. Tyler, May 23, 1856, neither divested the children of Francis A.

In so far as the title of the plaintiff is acquired through their mother, Cynthia L. Tyler, by the deeds of Charles C. Tyler, April 18, 1883, and Cynthia L. Tyler, May 9, 1887, they are not estopped from asserting it by reason of their mother having joined her husband in executing the deed to William E. Moore for the same lands in April, 1857.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-12\">\u201c Just here is the principal contention in the case. It is well that the facts should be carefully noted. The wife joins with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>husband in a deed, not for her separate estate, but to convey lands, whose title was claimed by the husband, the title being so recited in the deed. The deed purports to contain ho warranty on her part, the warranty being expressly by the husband. Is she so concluded that she cannot assert, against such grantor, a title subsequently acquired by her ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018 </em>It is not to be doubted that a vendor who undertakes to sell a full title for a valuable consideration, when he has less than a fee-simple, but afterward acquires the fee, holds it in trust for his vendee.\u2019 Clark <em>v. </em>Martin, 49 Pa. 303; McWilliams <em>v. </em>Nisly, 2 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 507; Chew <em>v. </em>Barnet, 11 S. &amp; R. 391; Brown <em>v. </em>McCormick, 6 Watts, 60; Collins\u2019s Ap., 107 Pa. 603.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-7\">\u201c Nor need we question the correctness of the ruling in Bailey <em>v. </em>Allegheny National Bank, 104 Pa. 425, that where a married woman executes a mortgage upon property as land, which, at the time, was technically personalty but which, by her election with others, might become, and in fact did become, land, the mortgage may be held good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-8\">\u201c It was said in Davison\u2019s Ap., 95 Pa. 39V, that the interest of a married woman in real estate cannot be divested, except in the mode pointed out by our statute, and that she cannot be estopped by acts or declarations which, in case of a feme sole, would operate as an estoppel. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-9\">\u201cBecker <em>v. </em>Werner, 98 Pa. 555, referred to by counsel for both plaintiff and defendant, was decided upon the ground that the wife\u2019s joinder in the mortgage was merely the.result of ignorance or carelessness of the scrivener, and the case sheds but little light upon the present inquiry. The question has never arisen in Pennsylvania, so far as we have been able to discover. That the wife is not estopped by her husband\u2019s covenant would not be questioned. Williams <em>v. </em>Baker, 71 Pa. 476.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-10\">\u201c In Ohio it was ruled that covenants of warranty of a feme covert in her deed of real estate will operate as, an estoppel to her asserting any subsequently acquired title to the land. Hill <em>v. </em>West, 8 Ohio, 222; s. c. 31 Am. Dec. 442. The covenants in this case were contained in the conveyance or mortgage of the wife\u2019s lands, and Colcord <em>v. </em>Swan, 7 Mass. 291, and Fowler <em>v. </em>Shearer, 7 Mass. 21, were referred to as precedents for the ruling. But a careful examination of these cases will show that the precise point was not raised in them, and, in a later case in Massachusetts, the remarks found in' them upon the subject are spoken of as mere dicta, and doubt is expressed whether they would be followed if the actual question should arise. Wight <em>v. </em>Shaw, 5 Cush. 66. In a still later case in Massachusetts, it was said that, by the common law of Massachusetts, the warranty deed of a married woman, though executed in such form as to convey her title, did not operate against her by way of covenant or estoppel. But the general statutes having made every married woman capable of bargaining, selling and conveying her separate real and personal property, entering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>into any contracts in reference to the same, and suing and being sued in all matters relating thereto, in the same manner as if. she were sole, it was ruled that she was concluded by her own personal covenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-4\">\u201c In New York, it was ruled that a feme covert, having joined with her husband in a deed of land, with covenant of warranty, is not thereby estopped from setting up a subsequently acquired title. Jackson <em>v. </em>Vanderheyden, 17 Johns. 167; s. c. 8 Am. Dec. 378; Martin <em>v. </em>Dwelly, 6 Wend. 9; s. c. 21 Am. Dec. 245; Teal <em>v. </em>Woodworth, 3 Paige Ch. 470.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">\u201c In Alabama, the same ruling was made in Gonzales <em>v. </em>Hukil, 49 Ala. 260; s. c. 20 Am. R. 282.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">\u201c In New Jersey, in Hopper <em>v. </em>Demarest, 1 Zab. 541, speaking of the deed of a married woman, the court said : \u00a3 She is bound by no covenant in the deed; she is not estopped by an express warranty; as to her, it is void. She is estopped by no averment or recital in the deed.\u2019 See, also, Wilson <em>v. </em>King, 8 C. E. Green, 155.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The reason for holding this doctrine of estoppel against the grantor and in favor of the grantee is variously stated, but, however stated, its foundation is in the fact that the assertion of a subsequently acquired title by the grantor would be a violation of good faith and of some covenant, agreement or undertaking, expressly or impliedly entered into between him and his grantee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">\" But what is the undertaking or covenant of a married woman which is implied from her joinder with her husband in the conveyance of his lands ? The primary purpose is to extinguish her right of dower, but she does not assert the existence of such a right. By such joinder, she would undoubtedly convey any other right, title or interest which she might, at the time, possess in the lands, but she asserts by it the possession of no such interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-10\"><em>\u201c </em>Giving to her act the full effect of a quit claim deed, what more can be asserted for it <em>% </em>Upon what possible theory shall she be considered as having asserted, represented or covenanted with the grantee, by implication, that she possesses, and, by her deed, transfers to him, any estate in the lands ? On the very face of the deed, the title is recited as being in the husband and not in her. We are unable to discover any sufficient ground for holding that she may not subsequently acquire, and legally maintain and transmit, a title to the lands described in such a deed, as against the grantee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-11\">\u201c4. It is not urged that, by reason of the conveyance from Charles C. Tyler to his mother, the estate thereby conveyed may be presumed to have been paid for by and vested in her husband, Francis A. Tyler, and therefore enured to the benefit of the defendants as holding under his deed and warranty title. Such a position might present a complication of questions arising out of the uncertainty of the interest of Charles C. Tyler, at the time of his conveyance to his mother, the fact that such interest must remain indefinite until the father\u2019s death, and the inquiry whether the father could then acquire the interest of one of his children and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>exercise his power of appointment so as to take for himself almost the entire 150 acres of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">\u201c But it seems clear that the money consideration in the deed from Charles C. Tyler to his mother is so insignificant, in comparison with the interest which is conveyed, that we should treat the consideration merely as nominal, and the conveyance as intended as a gift by the son to his mother, or else as designed simply to further some family arrangement, so v.esting no title in the father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\"><em>\u201c </em>5. Whether, by virtue of the conveyance from Charles C. Tyler to his mother and from her to the plaintiffs, together with the will of Francis A. Tyler, as executing the power of appointment conferred upon him by the deed from Francis Tyler, or whether such execution of the power of appointment be a nullity, the plaintiffs are tenants in common in fee-simple in the lands in controversy, and are entitled to the possession thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-7\">\u201c 6. Judgment is awarded in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants for the land described in the precipe and writ in this case.\u201d \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-8\">S.

Harris was a tenant in possession under Moore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-9\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1-3, the portions of the opinion within brackets, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-10\"><em>H. F. Maynard, </em>with him <em>E. Overton </em>and <em>J. F. Sanderson, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGqs\">While this court held, in Tyler <em>v. </em>Moore, 42 Pa. 374, that F. A. Tyler took but a life estate, yet, under later decisions, we think the reverse of this doctrine should prevail. In connection with the vesting of the title, the testator says, the title is to <em>\u201c </em>descend to, etc.\u201d The word \u201c descend \u201d has a fixed and legal meaning, and means that the remaindermen take by descent, and not by purchase. Haldeman <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29; Yarnall\u2019s Ap., 70 Pa. 335, 342.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-11\">It is admitted that, in attempting to convey her own title, a married woman will be estopped, although she subsequently acquire an independent and better title. The reason of this is, she is in privity with the title she attempts to convey. Now we think that, under this rule, when a married woman joins with her husband in conveying a title derived from A., she cannot subsequently acquire title from A., and recover the same land upon the same title first conveyed by her to her grantee. How can it successfully be claimed that Mrs. Tyler was not a party or privy to this title ? The title of Charles in his mother comes from Francis Tyler. All parties and privies in titles are estopped by such conveyance. If so, this judgment must be reversed. 2 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cases, 830, 8th ed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-12\">All the cases cited by the court below are cases where the wife has acquired an independent title, other than the one which she attempted to convey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-13\">A married woman may be bound by her covenants in respect to the same land and the same title. Dean <em>v. </em>Shelly, 57 Pa. 426; Chambers <em>v. </em>Spicer, 41 Pa. 404; Clark <em>v. </em>Martin, 49 Pa. 299.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Among the authorities of other states in which it is held that a married woman is estopped by her deed, we find: 35 Ohio, 119; 8 Ohio, 222; 56 Ala. 471; 53 Ala. 499; 56 Ind. 1-19; 7 Mass. 14-19.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-6\"><em>D'A. </em>Overton, with him <em>B.

Their contracts are nullities, and, in this respect, equity follows the law.

Chambers <em>v. </em>Spencer, 5 Watts, 406; Dean <em>v. </em>Shelly, 57 Pa. 426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">If it be said, in Pennsylvania, grantors are estopped from claiming title even when the conveyance contains no covenant of warranty, we answer if she is not bound by any express covenant, a fortiori, she would not be by any implied one. To work an estoppel by deed, parties must be sui juris, competent to make it effectual as a contract. Bank of America <em>v. </em>Banks, 101 U. S. 240. Even positive acts of encouragement which might operate to estop one sui juris will not affect one under legal disability; and a wife can do, or forbear to do, no act to affect her property unless settled to her separate use. Keen <em>v. </em>Coleman, 39 Pa. 299; Klein <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 91 Pa. 140.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\">Nor can one sui juris be estopped by matter in pais, if both parties had equal means of knowing the truth. The element of fraud is essential to such an estoppel, and, in the case at bar, the title was as well known to Moore as to Francis A. Tyler and Cynthia, his wife, the record of the deed being notice to all the world. Hill <em>v. </em>Epley, 31 Pa. 331; Sinclair <em>v. </em>Jackson, 8 Cowen, 586.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALj\">\u201c By the statutes of many of the states, at the present time, the wife may convey her lands without the consent of her husband; but, whether with or without her husband joining with her, in no instance can her deed operate as an estoppel to her subsequently acquired interest in the same land, nor will she be bound by her covenant of warranty.\u201d Tyler on Coverture and Infancy, p. 318.
