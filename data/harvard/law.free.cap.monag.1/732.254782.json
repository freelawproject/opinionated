The court below held that the opinion as assessor was insufficient, as being more of a comparative than actual value, and that fixing a value by what the witness would give or take was incompetent unless based upon a knowledge of the value, but admitted the witness, under all the evidence. On writ of error to review a verdict for plaintiff, the admission of the witness was assigned for error, quoting the evidence as to competency but not as to value. <em>Held, </em>that the judgment should be affirmed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b780-5\">Another <em>witness </em>was held competent who did not live in the borough, or own property there, but who testified that he knew the value of the property from sales that had been made in the vicinity of the property within the last year.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b780-6\">The <em>statute of limitations </em>begins to run only from, the date of the actual grading of the land by a borough, and not from the date <em>of </em>the resolution of the borough council authorizing the change of grade.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b780-7\">Feb. 12, 1889.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-IR\">Error, No. 138, Jan.

Green and Clark, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b780-8\">Proceedings were begun in this case March 14, 1887. The plea, on appeal from the assessment by the jury, was not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b780-9\">The evidence was to the following effect, on the trial before Clayton, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b780-10\">On Nov. 17, 1874, the borough of North Chester adopted a plan of streets, grades, etc. This plan changed the grade in front of the property of plaintiff. The actual physical change was made some time in 1880 or 1881, the exact time not being established by the testimony. In 1884 the borough again changed ithe grade, lowering it some two feet more at one end, running down to nothing at the other end.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b780-11\">N athan Sharpless, a witness for plaintiff, was asked: \u201c Q.

In your opinion what damages did Mr. Eckfeldt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>sustain by reason of the cutting down of Providence Avenue ? The Court: I don\u2019t think he can answer that question. He may state in his judgment what is the difference in value of the property since the cutting and as affected by it and the value before as unaffected by it. He may state that. Mr. Hannum: And another objection is I don\u2019t think the witness has shown himself to be properly qualified.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b781-4\">Cross-examined as to competency: \u201c Q. Do you know anything about the selling values of lands in North Chester borough? A. Yes, sir; I think so. Q. In this vicinity ? Did you ever buy any ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Of your own knowledge, in this vicinity? A. Yes, sir; in the vicinity of North Chester. Q. I mean in the vicinity of this property. A. I have never bought any adjoining this property, but 1 have bought the property where I live. Q. How long ago was that? A. About 10 years ago. Q. How near to Mr. Eckfeldt\u2019s property is it ? A. It is about 5 squares from it. Q. North of it, is it? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you ever buy any other property in North Chester anywhere? A. No, sir. Q. Did you ever sell any? A.

Yes, sir, I did. Q. You were not the owner? A. No, but I was the employee of the estate. Q. Did you get a commission? A. No; I didn\u2019t work for a commission, I worked for a salary. Q. How far is that from this property? A. About the same distance. The Court: Do you know what properties are selling for along Providence Avenue, Mr. Sharpless, by the foot? A. I have not known any that have been sold within the last few years. The Court: Is there a regular price per foot there ? A. I don\u2019t know that there is. The Court: It sells by the acre or lot? A. There have some been sold there by the acre, I suppose; I don\u2019t know; Robert Hannum\u2019s property, I think, sold by the acre. The Court: Do you think, from your knowledge, however obtained, that you are able to say what Mr. Eckfeldt\u2019s property was worth before this change of grade in a fair market ? A. Well, I suppose I have formed an opinion as assessor. Q. And only as assessor ? A. That is all. The Court: That is more of a comparative than an actual value? A. Yes; comparing it with other properties. The Court: I don\u2019t think he is up to the mark quite. Mr. Lindsay: Were you upon this property of Mr. Eckfeldt\u2019s before the cut was made? A. Yes, sir. Q. Were you familiar with it ? A. I had frequently been on the property. Q. Were you upon it immediately after the cut was made? A. Yes, sir; we are obliged to go through there to go up and down the street. Q. You were obliged to go through his land? A. Yes, sir; on foot we were obliged to go through his land. The Court: The question is whether he can give the value. Are you able to fix a market value upon Mi\u2019. Eckfeldt\u2019s property immediately before the cutting was commenced? A. I think so, sir. The Court: And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>then fix a value upon it immediately afterward, and tell tbe difference in the two values ? A. Why, I should suppose so; I suppose I could form a value; what I would be willing to give or take. The court: Unless you know the value, that is not evidence; you may be willing to give more than it was worth or you may give less. Mr. Lindsay: This gentleman has been an agent to sell real \u2022estate and he has been assessor and is familiar with all the lands in the borough. Did not you have charge of the whole John M. \u2022Sharpless estate ? The Court: How much was there of it ? A. I think there were fifty-nine acres, altogether, in different plots, The \u25a0Court: Well, I think, perhaps, we had better let him testify. Mr. Hannum: You did not have charge of the whole John M. Sharp-less estate for sale? A. Yes, sir, I did. Q. All of it? A. Yes, sir; I am at liberty to sell all the parts at any time, if we can get \u2022our price for them.\u201d Exception. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b782-4\">C. W. Perkins, a witness for the plaintiff, was asked : \u201cYou \u2022are a son-in-law of Mr. Eckfeldt\u2019s? A. Yes, sir. Q. Are you acquainted with this property? A. I am, yes, sir. Q. Will you please to state whether you are able in the house to.see persons passing along the street, and if so with what facility? A. Well, it would have to be a very tall person to see the top of his head when passing along the pavement; a person of my height you could not \u00a1see at all from the house. Q. In walking along the sidewalk is the lawn visible? A. No, sir; because the lawn is high above the pavement. Q. What was the condition of the property before the \u2022change of grade in that respect? A. Well, you could see everything that passed or repassed along the road. Q. Could you see \u2022everything that passed and repassed both in the lawn and from the lawn onto the road ? The Court: How far does the house extend back from the road ? A. Well, I don\u2019t know the exact distance in feet. The Court: Well, as near as you can tell. A. I suppose nearly the length of this court room. The Court: The lawn was planted full of trees? A. Yes, and shrubbery and flowers, etc. The Court: And you would have to look through the shrubbery and trees, and flowers, to see on the road? A. Well, you see, the limbs were all trimmed up and you could see right through them. Q. What effect did the trees have upon the wind and dust from the street? A. Well, sir, it would protect the house to a'great extent. Q. It would protect the house from the dust from the road ? Now you say that looking from the windows of the house, persons were plainly visible in the street? A. Yes, sir, for eight or ten feet the trees were trimmed up. The Court: I suppose that lowering the grade did not increase the dust ? A. Yes, but the trees will be lost, and the new road will facilitate travel upon it. Q.

You never bought or sold or owned any property? A. I own property in Chester and South Chester, but not in the horough of North Chester. The Court: I hardly think he is competent. Mr. Lindsay: Do you think you are able to form a judgment as to the value of this property of Mr. Eckfeldt\u2019s before and \u2022after this change of grade ? A. Well, looking at it in that view of my not having bought or sold any\u2014 The Court: Suppose that this property had to be sold and you wanted somebody to tell you what it was worth and you would be bound by his judgment, could you tell whether it was the true value ? A. I don\u2019t think I should ask anybody what that property is worth, if it were to be sold; I think I would know what it is worth myself. The Court: What would you base your judgment on? A. Well, I would form my judgment from sales that have been made in and around that vicinity within the last year. The Court: You think, then, you are competent to tell what it is worth ? A. Well, I think I know about what property is worth along that avenue to a greater or less extent. The Court: What properties beside that are you familiar with ? A. Why, the property that is owned by a company that is directly opposite to this property. The Court: Suppose they were bound to sell it at your \u25a0estimate, would you be competent to place a value upon it?' A. That along the street I think I should know the value of. The Court: Let him testify. Mr. Harvey: Is your judgment based entirely upon what you know of sales in that vicinity? A. Well, sir, I of course judge of the value by what properties bring in and \u25a0around this property. I judge of course from those sold around \u2022and above this place. The Court: Do you live on the premises ? A. No, sir; I live in the city of Chester, on Broad Street. Mr. Harvey: It has been held in railroad cases not to be competent. The Court: I think I will j&gt;ermit him to testify and give you an \u2022exception.\u201d Exception noted.

One of his own witnesses says that it was seven or eight years ago; Mr. Eckfeldt himself is not certain when it was. The minutes of the borough show that in 1880 he \u2022appeared before them, and that the work was all done and completed about December, 1881. If you find that Mr. Eckfeldt lowered his pavement, to comport with the grade of 1874, more than six years previous to March last, I charge you, as a matter of law, he cannot \u25a0recover for anything more than the two-foot grade at one end and running down to nothing at the other, for the statute of limitation, which allows six years in which to bring the action, has barred his \u2022claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b783-7\">The plaintiff presented, inter alia, this point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b783-8\">\u201c 1.

Sharpless had been an assessor and obtained his opinion as to values by comparison and not from actual sales or purchases. This clearly is not enough.. Perkins was not a resident of the borough wherein plaintiff\u2019s land lay, and had no knowledge based upon inquiry or sales and purchases. Neither of these witnesses came up to the standard as established by the cases of R. R. <em>v. </em>Robinson, 95 Pa. 426; R.
