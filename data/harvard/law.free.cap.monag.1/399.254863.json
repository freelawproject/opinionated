T. 1889, to O. P. Wayne Co., to review an order making absolute a rule on defendants to show cause why a rule of reference in a sheriff\u2019s interpleader should not be stricken off, at March T. 1888, No. 4. Williams and McCollum, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-10\">The following facts appeared from the record: On Dee. 23, 1887, a feigned issue was directed on a sheriff\u2019s interpleader to determine the ownership of certain goods levied upon. Dec. 28, narr filed. May 28, 1888, rule of reference entered. June 2,1888, arbitrators chosen, the plaintiff not appearing and the prothonotary acting for him, as required by the Act. June 4,1888, on motion of plaintiff\u2019s attorney. A rule was granted on defendants to show cause why the rule of reference entered in the case, and the arbitrators chosen under the same, should not be stricken off, at cost of defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-11\">The rule was made absolute in the following opinion by Seely, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-12\"><em>\u201c </em>The single question presented is, whether an issue directed under \u00a7 9 of the Act of April 10, 1848, sheriff\u2019s interpleader, is subject to the provisions of the compulsory arbitration Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-13\"><em>\u201c </em>The proceeding is wholly for the benefit of the sheriff. Bain <em>v. </em>Funk, 61 Pa. 187; Lazelere <em>v. </em>Haubert, 109 Pa. 518; Maurer <em>v. </em>Sheafer, 116 Pa. 343.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u201c So far as tbe issue is concerned, it is immaterial -whether or not the claimant files a bond and receives possession of the goods. If he does file such a bond and receive the goods, his possession does not withdraw the goods from the custody of the law, nor relieve them from the effect of the levy. Bain <em>v. </em>Lyle, 68 Pa. 63. If no such bond is filed, the goods remain in the hands of the sheriff. The issue remains the same and proceeds to its determination in the same manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">\u201cIt is an issue directed for the trial of a question of fact, whether the claimant is the owner of the goods levied upon or any portion of them. This fact ascertained does not constitute a complete basis for the entry of judgment, but presents to the court a basis for direction to the sheriff with reference to further [action] upon his writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">\u201c The Act of Assembly prescribes that the costs of all such proceedings shall be in the discretion of the court. The order directing the issue expressly reserves \u00a3 the question of costs and all further questions \u2019 until after the trial of the issue. The order of the court contemplates that the issue shall be submitted to a jury, and, to secure its prompt determination, directs \u00a3that it be placed at the head of the list for the first jury term thereafter.\u2019 If a rule-of reference may be taken out by either party, in such a case, the order of the court placing the issue at the head of the list for the next jury term may, of course, be annulled by either party, and, as the purpose of the proceeding is to relieve the sheriff, it would seem clear that the parties should not possess such power. But, aside from this, the whole proceeding is so clearly outside of the scope and spirit of the arbitration Act that we think it does not come within its operation. See Taggart <em>v. </em>Fox, 1 Grant, 192.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">\u201cWe do not perceive how an issue granted by the court, for the determination of a question of fact simply, can be subject to the arbitration Act. See Hoffman <em>v. </em>Walborn, 1 Pearson, 18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">\u201c What shall be done with the award when rendered ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\">\u201cThe 39th section of the Act of June 16, 1836, expressly excepts from the operation of the Act <em>\u2018 </em>issues directed to any court to ascertain a -fact or facts.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-11\">\u201cWe think it is immaterial whether the words of the excepting section apply to the case or not. No exception was necessary. While the term \u00a3 civil suit or action \u2019 in the 8th section of the Act of June 16, 1836, is very \u00a3 broad and general,\u2019 as was said in Taggart <em>v. </em>Fox, supra, we think it does not cover all possible issues; an issue directed by a chancellor, for the information of his conscience, for instance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-12\">\u201c Whether we say, as was said in Taggart <em>v. </em>Fox, that the issue in the present case is excluded from the operation of the Act of June 16, 1836, because it is not within the spirit; or say that this issue is not a \u00a3 civil suit or action \u2019 within the meaning of those words as used in the Act of 1836, we are clear in our opinion that the rule of reference cann\u00f3t be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-13\">\u201cNow, July 5th, 1888, the rule is made absolute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court in striking off the rule of reference entered by the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-4\"><em>H. </em>Wilson, with him <em>D. M. Van Auken </em>and <em>O. L. Rowland, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arg\">The case is not an \u201c issue directed to any court to ascertain a fact or facts,\u201d within the contemplation \u00a7 39 of the Act of 1836. This contemplates an issue directed by one court to another, as an issue devisavit vel non, directed by the orphans\u2019 court to the common pleas, or an issue to determine the validity of a judgment confessed by an executor, and contested by heirs, on an attempt to sell land for its payment. Dean\u2019s Ap., 8Y Pa. 2Y. The sheriff\u2019s interpleader was unknown when the Arbitration Act was passed. It is not an issue directed to a court, but an issue framed in the same court in which the whole proceeding lies, and directed to a jury. It is, in effect, a substitute for an action of trespass, restoring to the plaintiff his goods instead of giving him damages for their unlawful seizure. It is a \u201ccivil suit or action\u201d within the scope and meaning of the Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">If this action may be arbitrated, the error of the court below should be corrected at the earliest moment in order to remit the defendants to their rights under the Arbitration Act. If they must wait until after a jury trial, before the question can be reviewed in this court, the right to be heard before a tribunal of arbitration is practically gone.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-6\"><em>C. W. Bull, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alab\">The writ of error in this case should be quashed. The making absolute a rule to strike off a rule of reference and the arbitrators chosen under the rule is an interlocutory judgment, and a writ of error does not lie. Erie Bank <em>v. </em>Brawley, 8 Watts, 530; Straub <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 382; Ranck <em>v. </em>Whitaker, 4 W. N. C. 69; O\u2019Hara <em>v. </em>Pa. R. R., 2 Grant, 241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">There should be final judgment before a writ of error will lie. Chadwick <em>v. </em>Ober, 70 Pa. 264; O\u2019Hara <em>v. </em>Pa. R. R., supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-8\">A writ of error does not lie till after final decree or judgment on a feigned issue. Reed\u2019s Ap., 71 Pa. 378; Bain <em>&amp; </em>Kern <em>v. </em>Funk, 61 Pa. 185; McFarland <em>v. </em>Clark, 4 W. N. C. 250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-9\">If the issue is arbitrated, and an award rendered, which remains unappealed from, what becomes of the questions reserved by the court in directing the issue? What information would the court have upon which to dispose of them ? What advantage can be gained to either party by the arbitration? The award cannot become a lien or any further security be obtained than already had by virtue of writs theretofore issued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-10\">Counsel for defendant in error, in addition to the above, repeated the reasons given in the opinion of the court below.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEf\">Feb. 27, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b449-11\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"Avtx\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Note. \u2014 If the judgment in the above case should have been \u201c writ quashed \u201d in place of \u201c decree affirmed,\u201d the statement of the syllabus, as above, would not be correct. The case was disposed of on argument.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
