T. 1888, to Q. S. Butler Co., to review, 1, an order dismissing a petition to open a decree previously made for the erection of an independent school district, and, 2, the decree erecting the school district, at March S. 1885, No. 5.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-11\">These two cases were argued together. On May 14, 1885, L. B. Cummins and more than twenty other taxable inhabitants of Mercer township and Harrisville borough, Butler co., petitioned the court of quarter sessions to erect an independent school district. Commissioners were appointed and an order to view issued. On June 3, 1885, the commissioners filed their report, finding that the district prayed for was necessary. On June 6, the report was confirmed and, on September 21, a decree was made establishing the district, as prayed for. On Jan. 29, 1887, twenty and more citizens of Mercer township petitioned the court to open the decree and re-examine the matter upon its merits. A rule to show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be allowed was granted, and an answer filed. On May 7, 1887, exceptions to the original proceedings and decree were filed, alleging errors as in assignments of error 1-5, and a rule granted to show cause why they should not be set aside. On July 9, 1887, the court, Hazen, P. J., discharged both rules, for the reason that the petition did not allege that the township was cut up into single school districts, nor that a wealthier district was carved out from a poorer portion of the township to the prejudice of the rights and interests of the balance, the only grounds for opening a decree allowed by the Act of May 20, 1857, but merely stated that the petitioners were \u201caffected injuriously \u201d by the decree, without saying in what manner; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>also, for the reason, that, the term at which the decree was entered having expired, the court had no further power either to open or amend it. See 6 Pa. O. C. E.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">On June 4,1888, Henry J. Brown and more than twenty other citizens of Mercer township filed a petition under the Act of May 20, 1857, again praying that the original decree should be opened, and the petitioners given an opportunity to be heard in the premises, and that, after a hearing and re-examination on the merits, the decree he reformed or amended as the evidence might justly require. The court, McMichael, J., dismissed this petition also, upon the grounds that the Act is retrospective and does not apply to cases where the school district was created after the Act Avas passed, and \u2022 also that the court had no power to open the decree after the expiration of the term.
