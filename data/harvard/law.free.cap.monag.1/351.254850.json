McCollum and Mitchell, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">The lease, more particularly described in the affidavit of \u25a0defendant below, named the lessor as \u201cJames G. Davis, for Patter,son Mills, of the city of Chester,\u201d and contained an agreement for entering, in any competent court, an amicable action and judgment in ejectment, etc. The lease was signed by Davis, individually, without naming his agency, and was sealed.

The said paper was not read to him, nor did he read it himself; having confidence in Mr. Davis, he did not anticipate deception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-13\">\u201c From the said 15th day of October till within a few days, the \u00a1.said Davis has, from week to week, been receiving the said rent, . and no complaint has been made that there was any rent in arrear nor has this deponent had any notice to quit the premises till about .the commencement of these proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u201c Upon the 16th of April, instant, your deponent called upon, the said Davis and offered to pay him all rent in arrear, if any-remained due, which he declined to receive, or give him a receipt in full; that on the 18th day of April, instant, this deponent strove-to obtain a copy of the paper or agreement which he had signed,, but was persistently denied an audience with the said Davis and less, than forty-eight hours thereafter the action was entered in the said, court, and judgment taken without a statement or affidavit of claim, and a writ of habere facias possessionem was issued to eject him and his family from the possession of premises which he verily believes himself entitled to retain till the 15th day of October, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\">\u201cAnd this deponent further says that there is no condition in the lease; but at most a mere covenant, and that the proceedings, are irregular in other respects.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-7\">On April 25, 1887, a rule was granted to show cause why the-judgment should not be stricken off, and on, May 2,1887, the court,, without filing an opinion, made the rule absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-8\"><em>The assignment of error </em>specified the action of the court in making absolute the rule granted to the defendant, and striking off' the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-9\"><em>W.

Reynolds, 8 Watts, 424.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-10\">The remedy of the defendant seeking relief from an alleged, invalid or erroneous judgment is by motion to open it and to be let into a defense upon the merits. Clark v. Douglass, 62 Pa. 408. In Kocher v. Rice, 2 Luz. L. R. 24, it wras held that, as a general rule, a judgment will not be opened on the defendant\u2019s unsupported affidavit, contradicted by plaintiff under oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-11\">The waiver of errors prevents the defendant from taking-advantage of technical objections.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-12\"><em>P. B. Carter </em>and <em>V. G. Robinson, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4r\">The lease showed a power to confess judgment to James G. Davis, for Patterson Mills but not to R. Patterson <em>&amp; </em>Co. When the record shows upon its face an irregular judgment, it is the duty of' the court to strike it off. Knox v. Flack, 22 Pa. 337; Hutchinson v. Ledlie, 36 Pa. 112; Gordon v. Bartley, 4 W. N. C. 37; Earley\u2019s.

There was no authority in the lease to confess a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Had the.confession of judgment followed the lease there would have been no room for objection upon this ground. The judgment was-properly stricken off, however, for the further reason that there was - nothing upon the record to show that the defendant had broken any of the covenants in the lease, and the law will not presume that he * has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">Judgment affirmed.
