The court found the facts and conclusions of law as follows, in an opinion by McPherson, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\">\u201c 1. In November, 1879, the auditor general and state treasurer settled an account with the county of Luzerne for tax on personal property for the year 1879, which showed a balance due the county of $26,596.33. In April, 1881, a like account was settled for 1880, showing a balance due the county of $24,746.65. In December, 1881, a like account was settled for 1881, showing a balance due the county of $22,896.97. In May, 1883, a like account was settled for 1882, showing a balance due the county of $32,263.14. These accounts are connected, the balance from one year being carried forward to the next. No appeal was taken from any of these settlements and they have never been opened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-9\">\u201c 2. In April, 1884, a settlement for the year 1883 was made, and the plaintiff was charged therein with $11,263.59 which was transferred to the credit of Lackawanna county without the plaintiff\u2019s consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-10\">\u201c The present appeal is taken from this transfer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-11\">\u201c Conclusions of law :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-12\">\u201cWe have been referred to no statute or decision which authorizes the auditor general and state treasurer to take the action complained of. [The preceding settlements of 1879-82, unopened and unappealed from, were conclusive upon both the county and the state, and, since it appeared therefrom that, at the end of the tax year of 1882, the plaintiff was entitled to a credit of $32,263.14, this credit was supported by the final decree of a competent tribunal. It was a valuable interest, and, while the decree stood untouched, could not be taken away or diminished by the accounting officers, without the county\u2019s consent.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-13\">\u201c In our opinion, there is no other question in the ease. [The auditor general and state treasurer form a tribunal having jurisdiction to settle the accounts for tax on personal property between the counties and the state. Having this jurisdiction, and having also exercised it, their conclusions are final if no appeal be taken. This is a well-known rule, and the result of applying it is that nothing-before us is open to attack except the account for 1883. As to that, no item is appealed from save the attempted transfer of credit, and the precise point before us seems to be the bare question of power. Prima facie, such a transfer of property from one person to another is without authority, and since the commonwealth is unable to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>port it by statute or decision we think the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment as hereafter stated.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-4\">\u201c The commonwealth thinks, however, that other questions are involved, and we will find the further facts needed to present them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-5\">\u201c 3. For the years 1875, 1876 and 1877 the Board of Revenue Commissioners increased the sum of the returns of personal property made to it for state taxation by the county of Luzerne. The right of appeal from such action of the board had not yet been given, and the county paid the taxes due upon the increase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-6\">\u201c 4. For the year 1878 the board made a similar increase, and from this the county appealed to this court as provided by the Act of 1878, P. L. 126. In October, 1878, a final decree was entered, declaring the increase to have been made illegally, inequitably and without proper and sufficient information, and certifying to the auditor general and state treasurer that the amount of the illegal increase was the annual sum of $13,587.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">\u201c 5. Afterward the board decided that the increase made by it for 1875, 1876 and 1877 had been illegal and directed the auditor general and state treasurer to credit the county with the excess of tax paid for these years. Accordingly, in November, 1879, and April, 1882, these officers made credit settlements with the county of $30,682.48 and $14,608.23 respectively. These credit settlements are also embraced in the annual settlements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">\u201c 6. In 1883 Lackawanna county, which was set off from Luzerne in 1878, petitioned the board to revise the credits thus allowed and to award to her a proportionate share thereof. Luzerne county protested, but in January, 1884, the board decided that Lackawanna county was entitled to a share, and passed this resolution :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\"><em>\u201c\u2018Resolved, </em>That said credit settlements be divided between the counties of Luzerne and Lackawanna so that Luzerne county shall retain the three-fourths of the same and <em>the </em>remaining one-fourth be given to the county of Lackawanna, as that is the proportion which its taxation, as compared with that of Luzerne, entitles it to receive.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-10\"><em>\u201c1. </em>In pursuance of this resolution, and acting under its authority, the auditor general and state treasurer made the transfer complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-11\">\u201cWe repeat, that, in our judgment, these facts are not now relevant, because, either in whole or in part, they lie behind the annual settlements of paragraphs 1 and 2 and cannot be reached while those settlements are untouched. But if they are proper to be considered, we have only to say briefly that the Board of Revenue Commissioners had no authority to interfere with the credit settle- ' ments of the plaintiff. The powers of the board are statutory and it is nowhere clothed with the right to take credit from one county and give it to another. Therefore, the resolution quoted was upon a subject beyond its jurisdiction and could convey no authority. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>this matter, the board had no authority to give. If the transfer is based upon this resolution, it has no foundation and must fall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-5\">[\u201cThe plaintiff is entitled to have restored the credit of $11,263.59 transferred to the credit of Lackawanna county, and we direct a judgment to this effect to be entered if exceptions are not filed according to law.\u201d] [9.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-6\">The Commonwealth filed exceptions, 1, 2 and 9, to the conclusions of law stated in the portions of the opinion included within brackets, and also the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-7\"><em>\u201c 3. </em>The court erred in not finding, as matter of fact, that on Nov. 6,1879, the Board of Revenue Commissioners directed a credit settlement to be made by the auditor general and state treasurer, in favor of Luzerne county, for $30,682.48, and also on April 11,1880, another credit settlement of $14,668.23; that these two sums were accordingly credited and were the amounts which were ascertained by the said board to have been paid in excess of what Luzerne county otherwise would have paid in the years 1875,1876 and 1877, but for the action of the Board of Revenue Commissioners, in those three years, in revising and increasing the valuation and assessment of the county of Luzerne.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-8\">\u201c 4.

The court erred in not holding, as matter of law, that, inasmuch as Luzerne county had failed to show title to be credited with the said two sums of $30,682.48 and $14,608.23, and that inasmuch as the debit to Luzerne county of $11,263.59 was entered against the said unauthorized and unlawful credit, thereby diminishing the amount thereof to that extent; that Luzerne county had failed to show any legal injury done to or suffered by her, in consequence of the said credit, and that therefore judgment should go in favor of the Commonwealth upon the appeal of the said county of Luzerne.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\"><em>\u201c </em>11. The court erred in not entering judgment for the Commonwealth, and against the county of Luzerne, upon the matters specified in the appeal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">The court dismissed the exceptions in the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\">\u201cWe have carefully considered the very able and elaborate argument of the Commonwealth in support of her exceptions, but are still of opinion that the principal questions stated therein cannot be raised on this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-8\">\u201c The appeal, we repeat, is simply from the settlement of 1883, and does not bring up for scrutiny and decision the settlements of earlier years. The settlement for 1883 shows that the county of Luzerne had a credit with the Commonwealth, arising from past transactions, of $32,263.13. This is expressly stated to be a balance brought over, and the manner in which it was reached is not, as we think, a matter we can now consider. It is also stated to be a balance arising from the dealings of the county with the Commonwealth in respect to the tax on personal property, and this is a subject within the authority and jurisdiction of the accounting departments. If, in these dealings, they have mistakenly exceeded their authority, the mistake does not appear on the settlement before us, and is only to be found, if at all, by going behind it and examining not only other settlements unopened and unappealed from, but also the action of another body, namely, the Board of Revenue Commissioners. In this proceeding, we cannot go so far afield. To do so would be contrary to the unbroken practice of this court and, in our opinion, to the settled rules of procedure in all courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">\u201c Some effect must be given to the official action of the accounting departments, and it matters little whether that action be called judicial or administrative or ministerial. At all events, these departments form a tribunal of some sort, to which has been given the power of settling certain accounts with the counties, and when they exercise the power of settlement upon one of the accounts within their jurisdiction, the result of their action cannot be collaterally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>attacked. \"We believe the following authorities support this statement : Spangler <em>v. </em>Com., 8 Watts, 57; Com. <em>v. </em>Reitzel, 9 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 109; Hutchinson <em>v. </em>Com., 6 Pa. 124; Porter <em>v. </em>School Directors, 18 Pa. 144; Com. <em>v. </em>Freedley\u2019s Ex., 21 Pa. 33; Northampton Co. <em>v. </em>Yohe, 24 Pa. 305; Fitler <em>v. </em>Com., 31 Pa. 406; Blackmore <em>v. </em>Allegheny Co., 51 Pa. 160; Phila. <em>v. </em>Com., 52 Pa. 451; Burns <em>v. </em>Clarion Co., 62 Pa. 422; Glatfelter v.

Now, one of the accounts within their jurisdiction is that of each county with the Commonwealth in respect to the tax on personal property. Exercising their undoubted power upon this subject, we find, as a result, that, at the beginning of the tax year of 1883, the county of Luzerne is declared to have a balance to its credit of $32,263.13. How this balance was reached the settlement does not show, but the presumption is in favor of its correctness and legality. If it be attacked, it is seen at once that the presumption can only be overthrown by also attacking several preceding settlements, all unopened and unappealed from, as well as the action of another distinct tribunal, in no way a party to this proceeding. This seems to us so irregular, and so certain to produce serious confusion and conflict of authority, that we think it necessary to hold firmly to the rule supported by the cases above cited, and to refuse to examine a settlement not appealed from upon a subject within the jurisdiction of the accounting departments. Otherwise, no settlement would be final. In any year the accounts of earlier years could be gone into, and the authority of the departments would be little more than that of clerks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">\u201c Possibly, the Commonwealth has placed herself in a position where she may be obliged to allow the same credit twice. We intimate no opinion on that subject, but if she has so placed herself, the situation is due to her own effort, well-meant, but none the less mistaken, to adjust a dispute which did not concern herself, but only the counties of Luzerne and Lackawanna. As we have heretofore said, the Board of Revenue Commissioners had no authority to interfere with the credit settlement of Luzerne county, and therefore could give none to the auditor general and state treasurer. The transfer made by the latter has no foundation in statute or decision, and being brought before us by appeal must be declared erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">. \u201c The exceptions are overruled and judgment is directed to be entered in accordance with the opinion previously, filed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-8\">Judgment was accordingly entered and the Commonwealth took this writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-9\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court, 1 \u2014 11, in dismissing the exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-10\"><em>John F. </em>Sanderson, Deputy Attorney General and <em>W.

Cooley on Taxation, ed. of 1876, page 176, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-9\">When Lackawanna was created a county, nothing could be claimed or recovered but that given it by the Act, and it was beyond the constitutional power of the Legislature to have done what has been attempted by the auditor general and state treasurer in this case. The Legislature having no power to interfere with vested rights, to give the property of- A to B is clearly beyond legislative authority.
