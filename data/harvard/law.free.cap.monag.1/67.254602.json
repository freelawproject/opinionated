The defendant produced a written contract whereby the claimant agreed to do the work for \u00a7525, \u201c and, should more than the ordinary superintendence usually given by the carpenter be required, the contractor to receive an additional allowance of \u00a725, cash, to be paid as the work progresses.\u201d The defendant testified that he had paid more than the contract price, on account of delay and in order to get his house completed without employing another carpenter. The claimant, in rebuttal, testified that the sum mentioned in the contract was not intended to be binding, but was fixed at the defendant\u2019s request so that he could show the contract to his wife and satisfy her for not giving the work to her brother-in-law. The contract was signed Feb. 19, 1883. The plaintiff testified, and the defendant admitted, that, by Aug. 18, seven payments had been made aggregating \u00a7575, and that fifteen further payments were made, from time to time, until March 1,1884, two days before the work was finished, and that the defendant was present as the work progressed. The defendant contradicted the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the contract, and no other witness was offered in corroboration. <em>Held, </em>that the <em>parol evidence </em>was insufficient <em>to vary </em>the <em>written contract, </em>and that there wer\u00e9 no <em>corroborating circumstances </em>equivalent to a second witness.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b115-10\">A <em>question, </em>asked of the plaintiff, whether or not the defendant, in the progress of the work, ever said anything to the plaintiff with reference to the alleged contract, was properly excluded.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b115-11\">May 16, 1888.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgI\">Error, No. 180, Jan. T. 1888, to C. P. Lancaster Oo., to review a judgment on a verdict for the plaintiff in sci. fa. sur mechanic\u2019s lien, at May T. 1886, No. 7. Trunkey, J., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-12\">The lien filed was for an alleged balance for carpenter work done upon defendant\u2019s houses within six months. Pleas, nil debit, payment with leave, and set-off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>On the trial, before Patterson, J., plaintiff gave evidence to prove that the value of the work, begun Jan. 8, 1883, and finished March 3, 1884, was $1,084; that defendant was present during the progress of the work, and had paid $806 on account of the same, leaving a balance due of $218, for which the lien was filed. The plaintiff testified, and the defendant admitted that the first payment was made March 1, 1883; that, on Aug. 18, seven payments had been made, aggregating $515; and that fifteen further payments were made, from time to time, the last being on March 1, 1884 \u2014 $18. Plaintiff testified that when he made this last payment, defendant said \u201c that was all he had at the time,\u201d and then handed over a check for that amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\">On cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that he had signed a contract, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-7\">\u201cI, George Yeisley, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, hereby agree to do the carpenter work for two houses on lot No. 414 North Queen Street, Lancaster, Pa., for Henry Bundel, for $525.00. Those houses to be as per plans marked number 1 and 2. And to be finished as per detailed drawings; no inside or outside shutters or blinds to front window frames ; Llenry Bundel to pay for all dressing and sawing and working of moulding with the exception of mouldings for front door frames. Should anything be taken from or added to the jfians marked Number 1 and Number 2, a proportionate advance or reduction to be made; should more than the ordinary superintendence usually given by the carpenter be required, then the contractor to receive an additional allowance of $25.00 cash, to be paid as the work progresses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-8\">[Signed] \u201cHenry Bundel,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AvR\">\u201cGeorge Yeisley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-9\">\u201c Lancaster, Pa., February 19th, 1883.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-10\">The defendant offered the above contract in evidence; and, in answer to a question as to why he paid plaintiff $806, said : \u201c Simply because I found that I could not do anything else; I saw that the work was going on slow; I found that he was progressing with it so slowly, I was compelled to help him finish it, pay him, or let somebody else finish it, and- I thought it would be cheaper to let him do it.\u201d He also contradicted plaintiff\u2019s testimony throughout.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-11\">On cross-examination, the defendant was asked the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-12\">Q. Was Mr. Boring, a builder and contractor, also here in Lancaster at that time ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-13\">Q. Was Mr. Boring married to your wife\u2019s sister?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-14\">Each question objected to, disallowed and exceptions. [3, 4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-15\">Plaintiff, in rebuttal, testified as follows : \u201c He spoke to me the day before about the agreement, and the next morning he fetched it up. I had no time to make a calculation, so as to see what the work would be worth, and he came up and fetched the paper that he holds, and showed it to me, and I read it; I took it and threw it on the draught board in front of me, and I told him I wouldn\u2019t do the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>for that amount, for the reason that I couldn\u2019t do it, and no person else could do it. When I refused to sign it, he says tome: \u2018We will just put down the amount, so I can show them at home that you are to do all the work; then they will not bother me about Boring doing it any more.\u2019 He says further: \u2018 If you were not here, Boring should not do any of it.\u2019 Now, 1 put that down, word for word, and I can swear positively that was the very words he spoke to me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqAS\">Plaintiff was then aslmd the following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-4\">Q. State whether or not Mr. Bundel, in the progress of the construction of the building, ever said anything to you with reference to this alleged contract? Objected to, disallowed and exception. [5-]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">The plaintiff, on re-direct examination, and one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, were asked the following: Q. What proportion of the work was done in your shop, in lieu of the ordinary mill work? Objected to, disallowed and exception. [8, 9.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">The defendant presented, inter alia, the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-9\">\u201c 3. The mere fact of an over-payment in itself is not a corroboration sufficient to set aside a written contract.\u201d <em>Ans. </em>\u201cWe say this is not sufficient; we give the other side the benefit of that law; if there was nothing said, but merely a payment over \u2014 and you have heard the reason for that, that the work was very slowly progressing and was nearly done, and he paid him simply because he didn\u2019t want to employ any other hands to do it.\u201d [2.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-10\">\u201c 4. In this case there has been no sufficient corroboration of plaintiff\u2019s testimony to impeach the written articles of agreement, and the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.\u201d <em>Ans. </em>\u201cWe answer that in the affirmative. In the judgment of the court, there has been no sufficient testimony to impeach the written contract, and, therefore, that should be your verdict.\u201d [1.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-11\">The court charged,'inter alia, as follows: \u201cIt is ruled that one witness and other competent evidence, equivalent to another witness, may go to the jury and may change the contract. Do you remember any testimony other than that of Mr. Yeisley, the plaintiff, himself, any testimony of any other witness saying a word about this written contract, or the terms ? The court cannot recollect any. Can you, gentlemen ? If not, then the written contract is the agreement between these parties, and must bind them both. And we say further, when a written instrument is sought to be changed in its terms or conditions, it must be shown that the terms and conditions insisted on must be shown to have been spoken of at the time, or about the time of the execution of the agreement, the time it was signed. And when this agreement was signed, both parties testified there was no person present but themselves.\u201d [6.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-12\">Yerdict for the defendant and judgment thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-13\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1, 2, the answers to the points, quoting them; 3-5, the refusal of the questions above, quoting them; 6, the portion of the charge given, quoting it; <em>1, </em>the refusal of the court to allow the case to go to the jury on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>evidence; 8 and 9, the refusal of the questions above, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-5\"><em>Benjamin F.

The contract, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>spoke for itself, and it was admitted by tbe plaintiff, and fully proved, that the defendant had paid the full amount required by the contract and a considerable sum in addition. The plaintiff undertook to show that there was a parol agreement different from the written one, but he gave no testimony on this subject except his own, and that was positively and emphatically contradicted by the defendant. We have so often held that a written contract cannot be changed when the testimony is in this condition that it is entirely unnecessary to cite the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Nor do we find any circumstances in the case corroborating the plaintiff\u2019s evidence in this regard. The fact that the defendant paid more than the contract called for proves nothing. He might well do so in order to get his house completed. That is the explanation he gives of it, and it quite meets and accounts for the fact itself. The plaintiff does not testify that these payments in excess were made in pursuance of any demand by him that he was entitled to them under any parol contract. The defendant says he could not get his house finished without paying these additional sums, and that he might as well pay them to the plaintiff as to any other carpenter. The fact that the defendant saw and knew that the work was going on, and made no objection, proves nothing whatever in corroboration of the theory that there was a parol contract different from the written one. He had a right, under the written contract, to a full performance, and therefore a full performance by the plaintiff proved nothing more than that, he was complying with the written contract. Of course, the testimony of the plaintiff as to the reason given by defendant for limiting the amount to $525, so he could show the paper to his wife, and satisfy her for not giving the contract to her brother-in-law, is all denied by the defendant, and goes for nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">There is nothing else offered in the testimony or in the argument to defeat the written agreement, and, of course, that contract must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">These views cover the first, second, sixth and seventh assignments. There is no merit in the others. Whether Mr. Boring was married to the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s sister, and whether he was in Lancaster at a certain time, were matters totally irrelevant. The question overruled in the fifth assignment was entirely too general, and did not relate to the time the contract was executed or before. As to the eighth and ninth assignments, it was of no consequence where the plaintiff\u2019s work was done. He was paid all that the contract required, and a considerable amount besides. As we have held, he was bound by the contract; he could recover nothing more, no matter where the work was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Judgment affirmed. W. M. S., Jr.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
