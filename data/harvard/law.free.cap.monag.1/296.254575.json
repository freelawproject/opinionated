Ros\u00e9berry, Esq.: Isaac Bernh\u00e9isel died in October, 1885. Letters of administration were granted to his son Joshua. At t'he audit of the .administrator\u2019s account; certain of the heirs of the-decedent claimed \u00a1that the sum of $500, part of the'purchase money- of-real \u00e9state \u25a0\u2018sold by the decedent to Joshua, \u2022 was an advancement. On \u00a1this iclaim.the auditor-found-the facts as follows -: \u201cIt appears-from \u00a1the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u25a0testimony that the decedent sold two tracts of land to his son Joshua, \u25a0for the consideration of $4,000. A survey of the tracts was made by Daniel L. Boyer, on the 30th of March, 1869, who was instructed ;to prepare a deed and two bonds, one-for $2,000, payable in annual installments of $200, and another for $2,000. Of this last bond, ;$500 was not to be paid by Joshua, and the contention is whether it 'was-given to Joshua as an advancement, or asan absolute gift. The \u2018only persons present at the tim\u00e9 of the transaction, besides the deceased and Joshua and his family, were -D. L. Boyer and Joshua '\u25a0Staller, who were examined as witnesses.' Boyer testified that the \u2022father said to him, Joshua shall pay $4,000 for the farm, $200 every -year for ten years, and then the'other you make in a bond for $2,000 ; \u25a0$500 of this he shall have for an inheritance, then each of the others 'will, have $500, and they' will be equal. Joshua Staller testified that the old man said he-had sold the land to Joshua for $4,000, blit he was only to pay $3,500. The other $500 he would make him a \"present of \u2014 he need\" never pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">\u201c O. J.

If the issue was granted, the jury would inevitably come, to the same-conclusion. Besides, in the event of an issue being directed, the estate would remain unsettled for a length of time to the prejudice of creditors and distributees, whereas, if the auditor refuses a distribution, and. submits the evidence to the court, as he proposes to-do, no harm or inconvenience will be suffered by the party aggrieved, as the orphans\u2019 court, in the exercise of their discretionary powers, may direct the issue, and, if the auditor\u2019s finding is not sustained, the distribution can be modified or changed without referring the report back to the auditor, and thus greatly facilitate the settlement of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">\u201cAn advancement is an irrevocable gift by a parent, in his lifetime, to his child, on account of such child\u2019s share in his parent\u2019s-estate. High\u2019s Appeal, 21 Pa. 283. Our Acts of Assembly do not define an advancement, and we are therefore compelled to resort to the decisions of the courts to determine whether a sum of money, received by a child from a parent, or expended for his benefit, is a gift, or an advancement, or whether it is intended to create legal indebtedness. Miller\u2019s Appeal, 40 Pa. 57.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">\u201cAdvancement is a question of intention. That intent must be proved to have existed at the time of the transaction, and by the contemporary acts and declarations of the parties. If there be evidence of acts done or declarations made at the time of the transactions, tending to prove that the money was intended as an advancement by the father, his subsequent acts and declarations, in recognition of the original act and intention, are entitled to weight. Merkel\u2019sAppeal, 89 Pa. 340.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">\u201c The evidence shows that, after the survey was partially completed, the party went to the house of Joshua Bernheisel for dinner. D. L. Boyer testified that he then asked the old man what was his' price for the farm, and the conditions. He replied that Joshua is to pay $4,000 for the two tracts, and he, Boyer, should make a deed for $4,000, and the bonds for $2,000, payable in ten annual installments, and the other, for $2,000. Of this last bond, Joshua would have $500 for inheritance, then, each of .his children would have $500, and they would all be equal. Joshua Staller testified that the old man said he had sold the land to Joshua for $4,000, but he need only, pay $3,500. The other $500 he would make him a present of ; he need never pay it. Joshua Bernheisel was -present. The witnesses differ in respect to the declarations of the old man about the $500. Assuming both to be credible witnesses, Boyer\u2019s testimony is entitled to much greater weight than that of Staller. He was the most capable of knowing the fact, because the old man\u2019s remarks were directed to him in answer to his inquiry, and the instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>were given to him to prepare the papers, thus giving him a better opportunity of knowing and recollecting all that was said. It is true, as stated by Staller, that Joshua was never to pay the $500, but he evidently misunderstood the expressions of the old man as to the $500 being a present. His testimony is in direct conflict with all the other testimony arid circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-6\">\u201c When there is no evidence of what occurred at the time of the alleged transaction, the attendant circumstances are to be conr sidered in determining whether it is a loan, gift or an advancement. Among the circumstances, the most important are, the amount as compared with the parent\u2019s estate, the number of his children and the purpose of his advancements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-7\">\u201cIt is always a presumption that a parent means to treat his children equally. Weaver\u2019s Appeal, 63 Pa. 309.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-8\">\u201c It is held in Dutch\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. 401, that a conveyance of land by a father to a child, directly, or by payment of the purchase money and having the deed made to the child, is prima facie an advancement. This presumption is greatly strengthened when the value of the land bears any considerable proportion to the father\u2019s-whole estate. The mairi purpose of our statute, relative to advancements, is to cause equality among children, and equality in that which \u2022 may remain at the death of the intestate. See also Storey\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 89. In the latter case, the value of the land conveyed was nearly one-third of the distributive share, to which the distributee was eventually entitled. The proportion was significant enough to-intensify the presumption that it was an advancement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-9\">\u201c So in this case, the $500 deducted from the purchase money of the land is fully equal to one-third of his share of the estate. O. J. Aregood, a son-in-law, testified that he made the entries in the decedent\u2019s book, at the repeated request of the decedent. That he said: \u2018You shall write Joshua\u2019s $500 and Elizabeth\u2019s $200 in the book.\u2019 \u2018 That the $500 was deducted from the price of the land he sold to-Joshua.\u2019 That, after the entry was made, he .read it to the old man, who said it was all right, he would keep them equal, although the-phraseology of the writer is not fitting. There can be no doubt that it implies an advancement. The entries-were made about 1877 or 1878. A similar entry was also made April 25th, 1877, of an advancement to Sarah of $290. The entry against Joshua, although. not made in his presence, was a recQgnition of the original act, and! a declaration of the decedent to treat the $500 as an advancement,, within the ruling in Merkel\u2019s Appeal. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-11\">\u201c Things shown once to have existed, are presumed to continue in the same state, until the contrary is. established. Where the parent has made an advancement, the presumption is that he continued to intend it at his death, intestate,- to be divided equally. The burden is on those resisting the advancement to show a change\" of intention of the parent. Neither time nor limitation affects an advancement. They should be brought into the account. Oiler <em>v. </em>Bonebrake, 65 Pa. 838; Hughes\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. 179.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-12\">\u201c The auditor, therefore, finds as a fact that $500 of the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>money of the farm sold to Joshua was an advancement, and as a conclusion of law should be deducted from his distributive portion of the estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-6\">The auditor reported $4,025.43 as a balance in the hands of the administrator for distribution among heirs, after deducting costs of audit, etc. To this he added the advancements to the three heirs. Dividing this by four, he ascertained the share due to each to be $1,253.43. From-each heir\u2019s share was then deducted the respective advancement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-7\">The following exceptions were filed to the auditor\u2019s report: The auditor erred, 1, \u201c in fixing basis of distribution on distribution; \u201d 2, in deciding the $500 an advancement and charging the same \u00a1against Joshua; 3, in refusing an issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-8\">The court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-9\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1-3, the action of the court in dismissing the exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-10\">The case was submitted on paper books.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-11\">W. <em>F. </em>Shepherd, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXA\">An advancement is an irrevocable gift, by a parent to a child, of the whole or part of what it is supposed the child will be entitled to- on the death of the parent intestate.
