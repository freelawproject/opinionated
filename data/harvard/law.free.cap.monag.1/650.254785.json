The company, in consideration of the premises, covenanted that, upon the prompt and full payment of the monthly hire, as above, for blank consecutive months, the blank not being filled out, to make a bill of sale for the machine. It was further stipulated that nothing therein contained should be deemed or construed to give any title or property whatever in the machine, except the full and entire payment of all the monthly payments as aforesaid, or until a bill of sale should have been executed and delivered. <em>Held </em>that the agreement constituted <em>a bailment and not a </em>sale.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b698-5\">In an action of trover and conversion against a purchaser, for value without notice, from the lessee: <em>Held </em>that the court properly refused a request to charge that if the jury believe that the sewing machine was leased for a certain sum and the machine was left in the possession of the lessee several months after the expiration of the term, the <em>presumption </em>is <em>that </em>all the <em>installments were paid, </em>as far as third parties and innocent purchasers for value are concerned.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b698-6\">March 12, 1889.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfC\">Error, No. 108, July T. 1888, to C.

P. Troxell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-16\">Troxell, who was agent for the company when the agreement was signed, testified that he leased the machine to Mr. Bartholomew, and when the last payment was made the rent was in arrears. The defendant claimed that all the payments had been made to the agent Troxell, and that he had failed to report them to the company. D. B. Wagner, an agent of the plaintiff, was asked this question, on cross-examination: \u201c Q. Have Mr. Troxell\u2019s accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>always been found correct ?\u201d Objected to as irrelevant. \u201c Offered for the purpose of discrediting Mr. Troxell\u2019s testimony.\u201d By the court: \u201cThe objection is sustained and exception.\u201d [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-6\">The court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-7\">\u201c This is an action by the Singer Sewing Machine Company against A. L. Cope to recover damages for the conversion of a sewing machine. It is not disputed that this machine belonged originally to the plaintiff. The defendant alleges, however, that he became the owner of the machine by purchase from Cyrus Bartholomew, or from Mrs. Bartholomew. Whether or not that purchase amounted to anything depends upon whether Cyrus Bartholomew, or his wife, had any title to the machine which they could convey to the purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The title which is set up as existing in Cyrus Bartholomew, or Mrs. Bartholomew \u2014 it is a little doubtful which is the party claiming ownership to the machine \u2014 is a title derived through an agreement which has been offered in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-9\">[\u201c The contention between the parties is as to whether this agreement is a bill of sale or simply a lease or bailment. I say to you that it is simply a lease of the property to Mrs. Bartholomew, or to Cyrus Bartholomew \u2014 whichever it may be \u2014 -and that it conferred no title upon either Cyrus Bartholomew or Mrs. Bartholomew except upon a full compliance with the terms of the agreement. Those terms are that she should pay a rental of three dollars per month, until the price agreed upon for the sewing machine\u2014 which was forty-five dollars \u2014 should be paid.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-10\">[\u201cTherefore, the first question which I submit to you is whether or not Mrs. Bartholomew, or Mr. Bartholomew, did pay the full amount of forty-five dollars. This is hardly pretended on the part of the defendant. The evidence is that she did not. But I submit the question to you under the evidence.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-11\">[\u201c If she did not pay the whole forty-five dollars, she had no title to the property, and she could not convey a valid title to Mr. Cope.] [5] If you find that the full purchase money was not paid, your next inquiry will be as to whether a demand was made upon the defendant to surrender the sewing machine to the plaintiff. If you find that a demand was made upon him and that he refused to surrender the sewing machine upon such demand, then, in law, that amounted to a conversion and he would be liable in damages to the plaintiff for the value of the machine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-12\">\u201c What that value is you will determine from the evidence in the case. There is nothing more in the case upon which I need to instruct you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-13\">The defendant presented the following points, which were refused:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-14\">\u201c1. The agreement between the plaintiffs and Cyrus Bartholomew, is an agreement for the conditional sale of the sewing machine therein mentioned and not an agreement to let, and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>\u201c </em>2. If the jury believe that the sewing machine was leased to Bartholomew for a certain term, and the machine was left in his possession several months after the expiration of said term, the presumption, as to third parties and innocent purchasers for value, was that all the installments were paid, and that the machine was the property of Bartholomew, he having the possession thereof.\u201d [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-4\"><em>\u201c </em>3. The contract being partly in writing and partly verbal, it is for the jury to say under all the evidence whether the parties meant a sale of the machine or a bailment.\u201d [I]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-5\">Yerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-6\">The opinion of the court on a motion for a new trial, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Notwithstanding the light furnished by the elaborate brief of the learned and able counsel for the defendant, we are unable to distinguish the present case in principle from Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein, 79 Pa. 488; Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp, 51 Pa. 26; Wertz <em>v. </em>Collender Co., 8 Cent. R. 409, and other cases of the same class. It is true that, in the two cases last mentioned, the agreement contained an express stipulation for a return of the property at the end of the bailment, a stipulation that is wanting in the agreement now before the court. But in Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein, supra, there was no such stipulation, and it was expressly ruled that the intention of the parties to the agreement was to be gathered from all its provisions, and that if it thus appeared that the contract was one of bailment and not of sale, the absence of a stipulation by the bailee to surrender the property was immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-8\">\u201c In Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein mention is made of the fact, as strongly supporting the theory of a bailment, that, by the terms of the contract, the property in controversy in that case was to \u2018 belong to and be managed by Enlow,\u2019 the grantor. Upon that subject, the present agreement is equally explicit. After providing for a bill of sale <em>\u2018 </em>upon the prompt and full payment of the monthly hire\u2019 the agreement contains the following clause: \u2018 It is hereby mutually understood and agreed that nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to give to the said \u2019 lessee <em>\u2018 </em>any title or property whatever in said machine, except upon the full and entire payment of all the monthly payments, nor until such bill of sale shall have been executed and delivered.\u2019 When we add to this the fact that the word \u2018 lease \u2019 is conspicuously printed in large capitals at the head of the agreement, that the granting words are \u00a3 let and demise,\u2019 that the word sale, or any equivalent of it, is not once used, or even hinted at, except in the connection above mentioned, there would seem to be no doubt that the contract was one of bailment. And this is all we deem it necessary to say in response to the defendant\u2019s fourth reason for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-10\"><em>\u201c </em>The fifth reason is that\u00a3 the court erred in refusing to affirm the defendant\u2019s second point which was as follows: If the jury believe that the sewing machine was leased to Bartholomew for a certain term, and the machine was left in his possession several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>months after the expiration of said term, the presumption as to third parties and innocent purchasers for value, was that all the installments were paid, and that the machine was the property of Bartholomew, he having the possession thereof.\u2019 No authorities have been cited in support of this somewhat novel proposition, and the assertion may be ventured that none can be found. Assuming, \u25a0as the proposition does, that the contract was one of bailment, and \"the defendant being a stranger to that contract, the plaintiff owed him no duty. lie claims title through Bartholomew, and has .acquired hy purchase whatever rights Bartholomew had, but no more. The stream cannot rise higher than its source. If the plaintiff is not estopped as against Bartholomew, by its kindly indulgence in not demanding payment of the rent, surely - the \u25a0defendant cannot claim an estoppel. This is too plain for argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-6\">\u201cThe remaining reasons may be considered together. They relate to the imperfect execution of the agreement, to the blanks left unfilled, and the uncertainty of the agreement in general. It is manifest that these reasons are all based upon a misconception of \"the plaintiff\u2019s position, and of the point in controversy. The plaintiff is not suing upon the agreement, nor is the agreement necessary to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. The undisputed evidence is that the machine in contention belonged originally to the plaintiff. The action is trover. The machine is found in the possession of the \u25a0defendant, who has refused to deliver it up, after proper notice. These facts constitute the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and they are undisputed. The defendant\u2019s only answer to the case thus made out is the lease, which is his muniment of title. If this lease is to be \u25a0criticized, the criticism would come with better effect from the other side.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-7\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, 1, 3, 7, the answers to \u25a0defendants\u2019 points, quoting them; 8, the rulings on the evidence, \u25a0quoting the bill of exception; 2, 4, 5, the portions of the charge included within brackets, quoting them; and, 6, the action of the \u25a0court in not submitting to the jury the question as to how many \u201c consecutive payments \u201d should be made before a bill of sale was to be executed, there being no price of the machine mentioned and the blajik not having been filled up in the agreement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b702-8\"><em>Robt.

It was an agreement to sell on the condition that the price was paid. Possession was delivered under this agreement. If the installments were paid there was no legal or moral obligation to return the machine, but the lessee could demand a bill of sale; and he having possession, the title vested in him without the bill of sale.

In Forest <em>v. </em>Nelson, and Brunswick <em>v. </em>Hoover, the agreement expressly recited the contract as a sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b703-12\">Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein, 79 Pa. 488, was referred to in Brunswick <em>v. </em>Hoover, supra, in connection with the case of Sharp <em>v. </em>Rowe. The contract in Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein was held to be one of bailment. There the distinction was also sought to be made that there was no stipulation for the surrender of the property by the lessee at the termination of the term of bailment, as in the case of Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp. The supreme court refer to it, but that circumstance furnished no ground to destroy the character of the agreement as a contract of bailment. This disposes of Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b703-13\">In Wheeler &amp; Wilson <em>v. </em>Heil, the contract was construed one of bailment, not on account of the provision in the lease for a return of the machine, but for other reasons, as the opinion of the court in that case will show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>In Edwards\u2019s Ap., 105 Pa. 103, Gordon, J., says : \u201cNeither is a stipulation for the return of the property on the expiration of the time during which the bailment is operative, necessary, for, if it be not returned, the bailor may resort to his legal remedies and thus enforce the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-6\">In all the cases which are construed as bailment, the periodical rental and the prompt payment of them for a certain period constituted the consideration for the final bill of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-7\">In our case, however, there is an express stipulation for the return of the machine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-8\">Irwin <em>v. </em>Contner has no application to the case in hand, when Cope, the defendant, claims under Bartholomew, and consequently there is a legal privity between them.
