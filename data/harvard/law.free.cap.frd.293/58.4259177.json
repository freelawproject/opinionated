LAPLANTE, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">The parties have filed a number of motions to exclude evidence from the upcoming trial of this action, which arises out of a house fire that allegedly started in a home theater system manufactured by defendant Samsung Electronics America, Inc., and sold by defendant Best Buy Co., Inc. By way of subrogation, plaintiff MMG Insurance Co., which insured the house and its contents, seeks to recover against the defendants for the property damage that its policyholders, Mark and Helen Berthiaume, suffered in the fire, bringing state-law claims of negligence, strict products liability, and breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1) (diversity). The underlying facts of this case are set forth in detail in this court\u2019s prior order denying the defendants\u2019 motions to preclude two of MMG\u2019s designated expert witnesses from testifying at trial, and related motion for summary judgment. <em>MMG Ins. Co. v. Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc., </em>2013 DNH 061, 2013 WL 1637139.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The defendants have now moved to exclude evidence of burn testing that one of those expert witnesses, Steven Thomas, claims to have performed in <em>reaching his </em>conclusion that the Samsung home theater unit was the cause of the fire. MMG, for its part, moved to exclude a video of burn testing performed by the defendants\u2019 expert witness, Lawrence Sacco, then amended that motion to request re-opening Sacco\u2019s deposition instead. For the reasons fully explained below, the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude evidence of Thomas\u2019s burn testing is granted, while MMG\u2019s motion to re-open Sacco\u2019s deposition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Thomas failed to mention any burn testing in his expert report, and, even if that omission were harmless in light of his reference to the testing in his deposition testimony, that testimony fails to show that Thomas performed the testing according to reliable principles and methods. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702. Sacco\u2019s expert report, in contrast, disclosed the existence of a video of the burn testing that he conducted. While the video was mistakenly omitted from the version of the report provided to MMG prior to Sacco\u2019s deposition, that mistake was corrected when the video was produced at the deposition itself, and the defendants\u2019 failure to provide MMG with a copy of the video until two weeks before trial does not justify re-opening Sacco\u2019s deposition, as MMG now seeks to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">As further explained below, the court also grants the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude from trial any reference to other fires allegedly caused by similar Samsung products. The only \u201cevidence\u201d of these fires is in the form of comments purportedly posted by consumers on third-party Internet sites. These reports are inadmissible hearsay, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802, and fail to provide a good-faith basis for cross-examining the defendants\u2019 expert (who developed his opinion without relying on the reports or the incidents they reference). Furthermore, exposing the jury to the substance of the otherwise inadmissible, and inherently unreliable, reports through such cross-examination would unfairly prejudice the defendants. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Finally, MMG\u2019s motion to prevent the defendants from using the deposition testimony of a fire investigator, Robert Long, who examined the scene on MMG\u2019s behalf, is denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained fully below, MMG has admitted that Long is unavailable to appear at trial, which is sufficient, in and of itself, to permit the use of his deposition. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">I. Burn testing evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">A. Thomas\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">MMG disclosed Thomas, a forensic engineer, as an expert witness, and provided the defendants with a report from him. The report states his conclusion that \u201cthe subject fire was caused as a result of a component failure/overheating of the power supply\u201d in the Samsung home theater unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>At Thomas\u2019s subsequent deposition, he identified the DVD tray in the unit as \u201ca competent first material ignited\u201d in the fire. He denied knowing \u201cspecifically what type of material\u201d comprised the tray, but testified that he had \u201cattempted to burn that plastic\u201d on an exemplar of the unit, and that \u201cit lit and maintained a fire.\u201d Thomas further testified at his deposition that he knows another component of the unit, a printed circuit board \u201cwill maintain combustion when exposed to ignition,\u201d because he \u201cburned a portion of it\u201d with a flame generated from \u201ca propane flame source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">While Thomas\u2019s report states that an exemplar \u201cwas purchased and subjected to some basic testing,\u201d the testing described in the report was limited to determining the voltage and temperature of the unit\u2019s power supply in different modes of operation. The report makes no reference to Thomas\u2019s attempts, related at his deposition, to set fire to various components of the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The defendants have now moved to preclude Thomas from testifying at trial as to his claimed \u201cburn testing\u201d of the DVD tray. Under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party intending to offer the testimony of an expert must provide a written report containing, among other things, \u201ca complete statement of all the opinions the witness will express at trial and the basis and reasons for them.\u201d As just discussed, Thomas\u2019s report does not disclose that he attempted, and succeeded in, setting fire to the DVD tray and circuit board from an exemplar of the Samsung home entertainment system, even though, as his deposition testimony revealed, that \u201cbum testing\u201d was among the \u201cbas[es] and reasons\u201d for his opinion that a \u201cfailure/overheating of the power supply\u201d within the system started the fire at issue. So Thomas\u2019s report did not comply with Rule 26(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">When a party \u201cfails to provide information ... as required by Rule 26(a),\u201d a party is \u201cnot permitted to use that ... information ... at a trial unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1). MMG suggests that the omission of the \u201cburn testing\u201d from Thomas\u2019s report was \u201charmless\u201d because Thomas mentioned the \u201cburn testing\u201d at his deposition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, however, \u201cRule 26(a)(2) does not allow parties to cure deficient expert reports by supplementing them with later deposition testimony,\u201d or the function of expert reports would be \u201ccompletely undermined.\u201d <em>Ciomber v. Coop. Plus, Inc., </em>527 F.3d 635, 642 (7th Cir.2008); <em>see also Walter Int\u2019l Prods., Inc. v. Salinas, </em>650 F.3d 1402, 1413 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cThe reason for requiring that an expert report be provided before a deposition is taken is so that the opposing party can use the report to examine the expert at the deposition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">While there are undoubtedly instances when an expert\u2019s deposition testimony renders a deficiency in his report \u201charmless\u201d under Rule 37(c)(1), <em>see, e.g., Smith v. Tenet Healthsys. SL, Inc., </em>436 F.3d 879, 889 (8th Cir.2006), this is not one of them because, even at his deposition, Thomas did not describe the burn testing in any detail. As to the circuit board, Thomas said simply that he burned a portion of it \"with a flame generated from a \u201cpropane flame source,\u201d without identifying the temperature or \u201camount of heat.\u201d Thomas offered even less as to the burn testing of the DVD tray, only that \u201cit lit and maintained a fire\u201d when he tried to burn it\u2014 and that he \u201csaw no need\u201d to make any record of this process because \u201cI\u2019m the person that did the analysis ... and I wrote my opinions based upon my understanding of the way this thing works.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">As to the burn testing, then, Thomas\u2019s deposition testimony did not relay the \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>p\u00edete statement of all opinions ... and the basis and reason for them\u201d that should have been included in his expert report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(i). Crucially, he did not disclose any details of the testing (such as the temperature of the flame, or the duration of its exposure to the components) that could serve to explain how the testing supports his opinion that the fire started when the power supply in the Samsung unit caused its DVD tray to ignite. To the contrary, Thomas acknowledged that the heat and temperature generated by the propane source he used in his testing would differ from those he believes were generated by the power supply within the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">So Thomas\u2019s deposition testimony did not cure his report\u2019s failure to disclose the burn testing as one of the bases of his opinion as to the cause of the fire. Because MMG failed to disclose the burn testing as required by Rule 26(a)(2)(B), and because that failure was not substantially justified or harmless, \u201cthe baseline rule\u201d that this court applies as \u201cthe required sanction in the ordinary case is mandatory preclusion.\u201d <em>Harriman v. Hancock County, </em>627 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir.2010) (quotation marks and bracketing omitted). In deciding whether to impose that remedy, the court of appeals has endorsed considering \u201can array of factors,\u201d including \u201cthe sanctioned party\u2019s justification of the late disclosure; the opponent-party\u2019s ability to overcome its adverse effects (i.e., harmlessness); the history of the litigation; the late disclosure\u2019s impact on the district court\u2019s docket; and the sanctioned party\u2019s need for the precluded evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Esposito v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., </em>590 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Here, weighing these factors does not suggest that this court should eschew the \u201cbaseline rule\u201d and impose any remedy other than precluding the challenged testimony. As already noted, MMG has not offered any justification for omitting the burn testing from Thomas\u2019s expert report, <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>and the omission was not harmless, because, at a minimum, it prevented the defendants from effectively questioning Thomas about the testing at his deposition, <em>see, e.g., Walter Int\u2019l Prods., </em>650 F.3d at 1413. The harm to the defendants is compounded by the fact that, as Thomas acknowledged at his deposition, he made no notes or other contemporaneous record of the testing, leaving the defendants at the mercy of his memory should they attempt to re-open his deposition for that purpose. Resorting to that measure at this late date, moreover, would almost certainly necessitate a continuance of the trial, adversely affecting this court\u2019s docket. Finally, although preventing Thomas from referring to his burn testing might make his opinion as to the cause of the fire less compelling, it will not \u201cobviously or automatically result in dismissal\u201d of MMG\u2019s case, so its need for the evidence does not weigh strongly against preclusion either. <em>See Harriman, </em>627 F.3d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">After due consideration of the applicable factors, this court finds that preventing Thomas from referring to the burn testing at trial is the appropriate remedy for his omission of that testing from his expert report. <em>See Nelson v. Freightliner LLC, </em>No. 01-266, 2003 WL 25781423, at <em>*2 </em>(M.D.Fla. Apr. 23, 2003) (rejecting a belated attempt to augment an expert\u2019s disclosed opinion with evidence of testing that was omitted from her report, and excluding that evidence from trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The court also rules that MMG cannot introduce evidence of Thomas\u2019s burn testing for another, independent reason: MMG has failed to show that the testing conforms to \u201creliable principles and methods.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702(c). As already discussed, Thomas does not know the temperature or \u201cthe amount of heat\u201d produced by the \u201cpropane flame source\u201d that he used to ignite the components of the exemplar Samsung unit\u2014only that the flame would <em>not </em>create the same \u201camount of heat\u201d or temperature as the power source he has identified as igniting the other components of the unit. Nor, again, did Thomas maintain any notes or contemporaneous records of this testing that could potentially show the soundness of his methodology. To the contrary, the record of the testing consists solely of his deposition testimony, which shows only that the DVD tray and the circuit board \u201clit and maintained a fire\u201d after Thomas held them to a flame of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>unspecified intensity for an unspecified duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">As the party seeking to have Thomas testify that the burn testing supports his conclusion as to the cause of the fire, MMG bears the burden of showing that the testimony satisfies Rule 702. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786,125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Because, as just discussed, MMG has failed to carry that burden, Thomas cannot testify to the burn testing at trial, even if his failure to disclose that testing in his report is overlooked. The defendants\u2019 motion to exclude that testimony from trial is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">B. Sacco\u2019s burn testing</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The defendants\u2019 expert witness, Sacco, also conducted burn testing on an exemplar of the home entertainment unit as part of his work in this matter. Unlike Thomas, though, Sacco disclosed the testing in his expert report, where he stated that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay5\">tested the self-extinguishing characteristic of the power supply circuit board of one of the exemplars. A known, controlled and predictable source of heat energy and flame, commonly known as the [Underwriters Laboratories] burn pill, was ignited. The heat energy and flame temperature were subjected to [sic] the circuit board. The circuit board self-extinguished and did not propagate the flame across the board. The video of this testing is part of this report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The video, however, was not in fact included in the version of Sacco\u2019s report that the defendants produced to MMG in September 2012. Counsel for MMG did not bring this to the defendants\u2019 attention until Sacco\u2019s deposition, in January 2013. Then, Sacco stated that, while he thought he had included a copy of the video with the version of the report he had produced, he had also brought the video to the deposition with him. Counsel for MMG did not ask to view the video during the deposition (even though a DVD player was also present), nor did he ask to suspend the deposition because he had yet to receive a copy of the video. Counsel for MMG merely asked the defendants to provide a copy of the video, and they agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The defendants did not provide a copy of the video to MMG until May 24, 2013.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But, after initially asking for a copy of the video at Sacco\u2019s deposition in January 2013, MMG had not renewed this request until the final pretrial conference on May 21, 2013\u2014even though the defendants listed the \u201cVideo of burn testing performed by Lawrence Sacco\u201d as one of their trial exhibits on their final pretrial statement, filed on May 3, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">On May 30, 2013 (barely a week before trial is scheduled to commence, and more than seven months after the close of discovery), MMG filed a motion asking that the defendants \u201cproduce Sacco for a discovery deposition prior to trial\u201d on the grounds that the defendants\u2019 \u201cdelay in producing Sacco\u2019s recorded testing prejudices [MMG] because it has been deprived of the opportunity to question [Sacco] about the testing.\u201d This assertion is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">Because MMG has already taken Sacco\u2019s deposition, it may not re-open the deposition without leave of court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(a)(2)(A)(ii). The court \u201cmust grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(2),\u201d <em>id., </em>which authorizes limits on discovery if it is \u201cunreasonably cumulative or duplicative,\u201d if \u201cthe party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action,\u201d or if \u201cthe burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2)(C)(i)-(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">These factors all counsel against re-opening Sacco\u2019s deposition. Because, as already noted, the bum testing was described in detail in Sacco\u2019s report, which was produced several months in advance of his deposition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>MMG had ample opportunity to question him about the testing then, so allowing a second deposition for that purpose would be unreasonably duplicative. Furthermore, there is little or no likely benefit to it that could even potentially outweigh the significant burden that the defendants would face in producing their expert witness for a deposition during the final week before trial, when, presumably, defendants\u2019 counsel are busy preparing to try the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">These conclusions readily follow from two facts. First, MMG\u2019s counsel has now seen the video of the testing (which is three minutes long), yet MMG does not identify anything in it that comes as a surprise in light of Sacco\u2019s description of the testing in his expert report.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Second, MMG learned of the existence of the video in September 2012, yet its only effort to secure a copy of it between then and the eve of trial was a single request at Sacco\u2019s deposition in January 2013 (where, it bears repeating, the video was physically present and available for viewing). Indeed, despite not having received a copy of the video, MMG did not properly object to the defendants\u2019 intention, announced in their final pretrial statement, to use it as an exhibit at trial. <em>See </em>L.R. 16.2(d) (requiring objections to exhibits to be filed no more than 14 days after service of the final pretrial statement). This lengthy period of indifference toward the video, beginning at Sacco\u2019s deposition itself, belies MMG\u2019s assertion that the video is in fact so important that it justifies re-opening Sacco\u2019s deposition the week before trial. <em>Cf. Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>14 F.3d 684, 692 (1st Cir.1994) (upholding the use of a deposition at trial, despite the fact that the deposition ended upon plaintiffs attempt to suspend it because certain documents had yet to be produced, when plaintiff did not seek to resume the deposition, or any other related relief, until trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">MMG argues that it was the defendants who bore \u201cthe initial burden of producing a copy of the video as part of their expert disclosure.\u201d It is true that Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(iii) requires an expert report to contain \u201cany exhibits that will be used to summarize or support\u201d the expert\u2019s opinions. There is no indication, however, that the omission of a copy of the video from Sacco\u2019s report was anything but inadvertent. In any event, Sacco brought the video to the deposition with him, which gave MMG\u2019s counsel a chance to review it during a recess (though he chose not to avail himself of that opportunity) and rendered Sacco\u2019s failure to include a copy of the video with his report harmless under Rule 37(c)(1). <em>See Bartlett v. Mut. Pharm. Co., </em>742 F.Supp.2d 182, 189-90 (D.N.H.2010) (refusing to prevent an expert witness from testifying at trial despite his failure to disclose his prior testimony in his expert report, because a transcript of the testimony was produced at his deposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">While it would have been better for the defendants to honor their agreement to produce a copy of the video in a more timely fashion, their delay in doing so does not entitle MMG to re-open Sacco\u2019s deposition or, for that matter, any other relief. MMG\u2019s motion to re-open Sacco\u2019s deposition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">II. Reports of other fires involving similar products</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The defendants seek to prevent MMG from making any reference at trial to other fires allegedly caused by similar Samsung products. The defendants argue that the only evidence of these other fires is in the form of postings on third-party Internet sites, which are inadmissible hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801, 802. The defendants further argue that, the hearsay problem aside, these postings are not relevant, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Evid. 401, because they do not show that the fires they described \u201coccurred under circumstances substantially similar to those at issue in the ease at bar,\u201d <em>Moulton v. Rival Co., </em>116 F.3d 22, 26-27 (1st Cir.1997) (quotation marks omitted), or, at a minimum, that the postings\u2019 prejudicial effect substantially outweighs any probative value, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">In response, MMG argues that it does not seek to introduce the postings for the truth of the matter they assert, i.e., that similar Samsung products caused fires, but \u201cto impeach the defendants\u2019 witnesses,\u201d particularly Sacco. MMG points out that Sacco relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>on \u201cthe data from Samsung indicating that there are no other reports of fire involving\u201d the company\u2019s product in reaching his conclusion that it did not cause the fire at issue here. Thus, MMG explains, \u201c[e]videnee that other DVD player fires may have existed, but that Sacco failed to look into them, challenges his credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Rules 703 and 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence govern the use, at trial, of otherwise inadmissible information that an expert witness has relied upon\u2014or ignored\u2014in reaching his opinions. Rule 703 allows an expert witness to base his or her opinion on inadmissible facts or data, and allows their disclosure to the jury \u201cif their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\u201d Rule 705 allows an expert witness to \u201cstate an opinion\u2014and give the reasons for it\u2014without first testifying to the underlying facts or data,\u201d adding that the expert \u201cmay be required to disclose those facts or data on cross-examination.\u201d Under this rule, of course, the cross-examiner is \u201cunder no compulsion to bring out any facts or data except those unfavorable to the opinion.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 705 advisory committee\u2019s note (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Thus, as one court has colorfully explained, \u201cRule 703 creates a shield by which a party may enjoy the benefit of inadmissible evidence by wrapping it in an expert\u2019s opinion,\u201d while \u201cRule 705 is the cross-examiner\u2019s sword, and, within very broad limits, he may wield it as he likes.\u201d <em>United States v. A &amp; S Council Oil Co., </em>947 F.2d 1128, 1135 (4th Cir.1991). But these limits, while broad, are limits just the same. So, though a cross-examiner may employ inadmissible information \u201cas a way of suggesting limits to the information that the expert relied on,\u201d the cross-examiner\u2019s \u201cquestions must themselves reflect facts, or at least creditable information that justify [sic] the questions.\u201d 3 Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 7:24 (3d ed. 2007); <em>see also In re Air Disaster at Lockerbie, Scotland, </em>37 F.3d 804, 825 (2d Cir.1994) (upholding court\u2019s refusal to allow cross-examination of experts as to alternative theories \u201cabsent a good-faith basis to believe those theories had evidentiary support\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Accordingly, following the final pre-trial conference in this matter, the court ordered MMG to \u201cfile a brief submission showing its good-faith basis for cross-examining the defendants\u2019 expert witness as to his knowledge of other particular fires allegedly caused by the defendants\u2019 product.\u201d Order of May 22, 2013. The filing that MMG made in response consists of five different postings submitted to third-party consumer websites (e.g., amazon.com, pricegrabber.com, AVForums.com), purportedly by consumers who have used Samsung home theater systems. As an initial matter, none of these systems had the same model number as the system at issue in this case. While MMG states that Sacco\u2019s opinion \u201cis predicated on the assertion that the home theater system at issue in this case,\u201d model number HT-Q45, \u201cuses the same power supply devices as the HT-Q40,\u201d the significance of this statement is unclear, because none of the postings refers to a home theater system with model number HT-Q40 either. All of them, in fact, refer to other model numbers (HT-C6500, HT-X70, HT-X200, HT-TX75, and, in one case, the SWA3000, which is not even a home theater system, but an amplifier). By and large, the postings also fail to identify the circumstances of the alleged fire in any detail (two say simply that the unit \u201ccaught fire,\u201d while others offer cursory descriptions of \u201cflames\u201d or \u201csmoke\u201d). Furthermore, only one of the postings identifies its author by a full name; the others were submitted under simply a first initial and last name, pseudonymously (\u201cSECTOR SE7EN\u201d), or anonymously.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Based on these shortcomings, the court rules that the web postings complaining of fires with other Samsung products do not constitute \u201ccreditable information\u201d that could justify cross-examining Sacco as to his \u201cfailure] to look into\u201d them in developing his opinion that the Samsung home theater unit did not cause the fire in this case. Indeed, it requires little elaboration to explain why effectively anonymous complaints posted to third-party websites are not \u201ccreditable.\u201d It is also significant that Thomas, MMG\u2019s expert witness, did not rely on these kinds of materials in reaching his conclusion that the Samsung home theater did cause the fire at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Even assuming, <em>dubitcmte, </em>that these on-line postings gave MMG a good-faith basis for cross-examining Sacco as to his failure to look into them, \u201cthe court may exercise its discretion under Fed.R.Evid. 403\u201d to restrict cross-examination of an expert with inadmissible information \u201cif the danger is too large that the jury will misuse it in damaging ways.\u201d 3 Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7:24; <em>see also A &amp; S, </em>947 F.2d at 1135. Here, that danger is substantial, and warrants exclusion of any reference to the reports in light of their low probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">As just noted, there is no reason to believe that, in deciding whether a particular product started a fire, any responsible investigator would rely on a handful of anonymous on-line complaints about other products made by the same manufacturer, so the postings have little if any probative value as to the reliability of Sacco\u2019s conclusion. On the other hand, the potential prejudicial effect of these postings is great, due to the risk that the jury (despite an instruction to consider them only as to the reliability of Sacco\u2019s opinions, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 105) may improperly consider them as substantive evidence that similar Samsung products caused fires and, in turn, that the Samsung HT-Q45 caused the fire at issue here. This prejudice is worsened by the defendants\u2019 inability to rebut that inference, because the postings, again, are effectively anonymous and describe incidents that occurred several years ago, making it more or less impossible for the defendants to investigate them and develop facts in rebuttal. (While the author of one of the postings claims to have brought her complaint to Samsung, MMG has not proffered any evidence that Samsung was previously made aware of any of these incidents.) Because the prejudicial effect of the postings substantially outweighs any probative value, they are inadmissible under Rule 403. The defendants\u2019 motion to prevent MMG from referring to the postings at trial is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">III. Long\u2019s deposition</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Finally, MMG moves to prevent the defendants from using Long\u2019s deposition transcript at trial. As noted at the outset, MMG retained Long to investigate the fire scene, which he did by visiting the scene with his colleague, Gary Simard, several days after the fire. In early January 2013, the defendants took the deposition of Long, whom MMG had identified as an expert witness. The defendants later moved to strike this designation, arguing that Long had failed to provide an expert report and that, in any event, whatever opinion testimony he could give would be cumulative to Simard\u2019s. In response, MMG filed a \u201cpartial objection,\u201d agreeing that \u201cLong will not offer expert opinion testimony at trial,\u201d but maintaining that he could testify as fact witness \u201cabout his observations at the fire scene, including, but not limited to the collection and retention of evidence.\u201d This is an issue in the case because the defendants have accused Long and Simard of \u201cmishandling\u201d evidence at the scene, incorporating this charge into a spoliation defense they intend to pursue at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Consistent with its response to the defendants\u2019 motion to strike Long\u2019s expert designation, MMG listed Long as a witness on its final pretrial statement, filed on May 3, 2013. MMG\u2019s final pretrial statement also claimed \u201cthe right to read into evidence the deposition testimony of any witness who has been deposed in this litigation,\u201d and announced that \u201c[sjome witnesses may testify via videotaped trial deposition,\u201d including Long.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">In fact, the parties agreed to take a videotaped deposition of Long on May 23, 2013, for use at trial. On May 20, 2018, however, MMG notified the defendants by email that the deposition was cancelled. Counsel for the defendants spoke to counsel for MMG the next day, May 21, 2013, announcing the defendants\u2019 intention to use portions of Long\u2019s January 2013 deposition at trial. Counsel for MMG stated its objection to that procedure. The parties reiterated these positions at the final pretrial conference with the court later that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">During that discussion, counsel for MMG renewed his offer to produce Long for a videotaped deposition prior to trial, but counsel for the defendants declined, saying he intended to use portions of Long\u2019s January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>2013 deposition at trial instead. Counsel for MMG objected to this approach because, while its counsel was present at that deposition, he had not asked any questions of Long. Counsel for MMG also stated, however, that Long would be away on vacation during the trial, which, following discussions at the final pretrial conference, was scheduled for the week of June 10, 2013. The court stated its preliminary view that this made Long \u201cunavailable\u201d as a trial witness, entitling the defendants to use his deposition at trial under Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court also stated that if MMG wanted another chance to question Long, it should notice his videotaped deposition to take place before trial, and counsel for the defendants could decide whether or not to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Rather than doing that, MMG filed a motion to prevent the defendants from using Long\u2019s January 2013 deposition at trial. Despite MMG\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement at the final pretrial conference that Long would be away on vacation during the trial, the motion asserts that \u201cLong is not unavailable.\u201d This is so, the motion explains, because MMG \u201coffered to produce Long for a trial deposition, which the defendants refused.\u201d While that is an accurate account of the exchange at the final pretrial conference, it elides the fact that it was MMG\u2014rather than the defendants\u2014who, the day before the final pretrial conference, cancelled Long\u2019s videotaped deposition, which, until then, was scheduled to take place, by prior agreement, on May 23, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In any event, as the court noted at the final pretrial conference, one party\u2019s right to use a deposition at an upcoming trial does not depend on the other side\u2019s willingness to make the witness \u201cavailable\u201d for further deposition prior to trial. The use of a deposition at trial is governed by Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 32(a)(1) provides that \u201c[a]t a hearing or trial, all or part of a deposition may be used against a party\u201d on a number of specified conditions: (A) that \u201cthe party was present or represented at the taking of the deposition,\u201d (B) that \u201cit is used to the extent that the deposition would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence if the deponent were present and testifying,\u201d and (C) \u201cthe use is allowed by Rule 32(a)(2) through (8).\u201d Under one of those provisions, \u201c[a] party may use for any purpose the deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, if the court finds ... that the witness is more than 100 miles from the place of hearing or trial or is outside the United States, unless it appears that the witness\u2019s absence was procured by the party offering the deposition.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 32(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The court takes MMG\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement at the final pretrial conference that Long will be away on vacation during the trial as an admission that he will be more than 100 miles away from this courthouse and, indeed, MMG has not disputed this, in its motion or otherwise. Instead, MMG argues that \u201c[ijmplicit in Rule 32 is that a party seeking to read the deposition of an \u2018unavailable\u2019 witness must exercise reasonable diligence to secure the witness\u2019s appearance at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">The court of appeals, however, has squarely rejected this reading of Rule 32(a)(4)(B), i.e., \u201cthat a witness, though at the stated distance from the place of trial, is not unavailable if, with reasonable efforts, he might be persuaded to attend.\u201d <em>Daigle, </em>14 F.3d at 691.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As <em>Daigle </em>explains, \u201cthe language of the rule does not permit a court to read this sort of qualification into it. Distance is the decisive criterion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, as just discussed, this criterion has been satisfied by MMG\u2019s admission that Long will be away on vacation during the trial, so the defendants are entitled to use his deposition at trial under Rule 32(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">MMG also objects to the defendants\u2019 use of Long\u2019s deposition at trial because their pretrial statement did not list him as a witness, or his deposition as one that would be read into evidence. But <em>MMG </em>listed Long (who, after all, is an expert it retained) as a witness in its pretrial statement, which also identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>him as a witness whose \u201cvideotaped trial deposition\u201d would be used at trial. Though the defendants had agreed to this procedure, MMG backed out of the agreement the day before the final pretrial conference, when it notified the defendants that Long\u2019s videotaped deposition was cancelled. In response, the defendants notified MMG the very next day that they intended to use Long\u2019s January 2013 deposition at trial. The fact that they did not announce this intention earlier is completely understandable, if not inevitable, because, until just the day before that, the defendants thought they would be able to use Long\u2019s videotaped deposition at trial. This court cannot permit MMG to decide unilaterally to cancel that deposition the day before the final pretrial conference, then to claim surprise at MMG\u2019s announcement, the very next day, of its intention to use Long\u2019s January 2013 deposition at trial instead (particularly when MMG could have eliminated any resulting disadvantage by proceeding with the videotaped deposition of Long after all, but elected not to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In short, any prejudice to MMG in the use of Long\u2019s January 2013 deposition at trial is of MMG\u2019s own creation. MMG\u2019s motion to prevent the defendants from using that deposition at trial is denied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On or before 5 p.m. on June 5, 2013, the defendants shall serve MMG with their designations of the portions of Long\u2019s testimony they intend to use at trial. On or before midnight on June 6, 2013, MMG shall serve the defendants with its objections to those designations, if any, as well as any counter-designations. The defendants shall be prepared to state their objections to the counter-designations, if any, on June 7, 2013, following jury selection. The court anticipates ruling that day on any objections to Long\u2019s deposition testimony, so that the parties may prepare their opening statements accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendants\u2019 motion to strike Long\u2019s expert designation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is GRANTED by assent, the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude any reference to Internet postings about alleged fires in other Samsung products<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is GRANTED, the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude evidence of Thomas\u2019s alleged burn testing<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is GRANTED, the defendants\u2019 motion for a jury instruction on spoliation<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is DENIED without prejudice to renewal at the appropriate point at trial, MMG\u2019s motion to prevent the use of Long\u2019s January 2013 deposition at trial<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is DENIED, and the defendants\u2019 motion to amend their final pretrial statement<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">. The defendants also moved to exclude any expert testimony by Long. This motion is granted by assent, since MMG has since disclaimed any intention to present any expert testimony\u2014or, indeed, any testimony at all\u2014from Long at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\">. MMG does not suggest that the omission of the burn testing from Thomas\u2019s report was \"substantially justified,\" and the court can discern no basis for such an argument in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">. During an off-the-record discussion at the final pretrial conference, MMG suggested that the defendants were to blame for the limited nature of the information on the burn testing that Thomas conveyed at his deposition, because they failed to thoroughly examine him on that point. This court has previously rejected a like attempt at \u201ceffectively shififing] the responsibility to ensure adequate expert reports from the party seeking to call those experts to its adversary.\u201d <em>Adams v. J. Meyers Builders, Inc., </em>671 F.Supp.2d 262, 271 (D.N.H.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\">. Although, on that day, the defendants provided MMG with a disc containing video flies, counsel for MMG was unable to open or view them, despite repeated attempts, until May 29, 2013. The day before that, on May 28, 2012, MMG filed a motion to prevent the defendants from introducing the video at trial, arguing that it \u201cwas never produced.\u201d The court considers this request withdrawn in light of MMG's subsequently filed \"amended motion regarding\u201d the video, which asks solely to re-open Sacco\u2019s deposition but, in any event, MMG would not be entitled to the exclusion of the video at trial either, for the reasons discussed <em>infra </em>this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">. In fact, the defendants have filed a motion in limine seeking a jury instruction on spoliation. As discussed at the final pretrial conference, this motion is denied without prejudice to the defendants' ability to request such an instruction at the appropriate time during trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">. To support its reading of the rule, MMG relies solely on cases from outside of this circuit. It is instructive (though, in light of <em>Daigle, </em>not necessary) to note that these cases do not consider the language of Rule 32(a)(4)(B), but that contained in a different subsection, Rule 32(a)(4)(D), which provides that a witness is \"unavailable\u201d if \u201cthe party offering the deposition could not procure the witness's attendance by subpoena.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">. In light of this ruling, the defendants\u2019 motion to amend their final pretrial statement to reference Long\u2019s deposition is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\">.
