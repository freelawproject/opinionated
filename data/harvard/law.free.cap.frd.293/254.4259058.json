McAULIFFE, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">The plaintiffs and intervenor claim that the State of New Hampshire unnecessarily institutionalizes people with serious mental illnesses, in violation of the integration mandates of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2), and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. The named plaintiffs seek certification of an appropriate class, doc. no. 73, and class-based relief. The United States, as intervenor, supports the motion for class certification. Defendants object, however, arguing that the requirements for certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2) are not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b300-19\">Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>provides that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12131(2). A \u201cpublic entity\u201d includes State and local governments, and \u201cany department, agency, special purpose district or other instrumentality of a State ... or local government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12131(1)(A) &amp; (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The needless segregation of persons with disabilities\u2014in institutions\u2014is a form of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d prohibited by the ADA. <em>Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, </em>527 U.S. 581, 587, 588, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999) (relying, in part, on Congress\u2019s finding \u201c[i]n the opening provisions of the ADA,\u201d that \u201cdiscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in ... institutionalization\u201d). To comply with the ADA\u2019s \u201cintegration mandate\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>the requirement that persons with disabilities be \u201cintegrated\u201d in general society to the extent reasonably feasible), states must \u201cprovide community-based treatment for persons with mental disabilities\u201d when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">(1) the State\u2019s treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">(2) the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">(3) \u201cthe placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 607,119 S.Ct. 2176.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The Attorney General\u2019s implementing regulations also contain an integration mandate, which requires public entities to administer programs \u201cin the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regulations, likewise, prohibit public entities from \u201cutilizing] criteria or methods of administration ... that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination,\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(3), including needless segregation. <em>See Day v. District of Columbia, </em>894 F.Supp.2d 1, 22 (D.D.C.2012) (To state a claim under the ADA, it is \u201csufficient to allege ... that the [government] has utilized criteria or methods of administration that have caused plaintiffs to be confined unnecessarily in nursing facilities.\u201d) (internal punctuation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">Although a public entity must make \u201creasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures\u201d to avoid unnecessarily segregating persons with disabilities, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7), that obligation is not absolute. The regulations \u201callow[ ] States to resist modifications\u201d to their policies, practices, and procedures that \u201centail a fundamental alteration\u201d of their services and programs. <em>Olmstead, </em>527 U.S. at 603, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (internal punctuation omitted) (citing 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">The Rehabilitation Act (\u201cRA\u201d) and its regulations similarly prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.51(a); require that services be provided in the most integrated setting, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 41.51(d); and make it a violation of the Act to use methods of administration that subject individuals to discrimination, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.51(b)(3), 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 84.4(b)(4). <em>See Bryson v. Stephen, </em>2006 WL 2805238, at *3 (D.N.H. Sept. 29, 2006) (\u201cThe Rehabilitation Act contains ... similar provision[s]\u201d to the ADA).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">The Nursing Home Reform Act (\u201cNHRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(e)(7)(D)(ii), also addresses the unnecessary segregation of people with mental disabilities. The NHRA mandates a screening process \u201ccalled a Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review (PASARR).\u201d Voss <em>v. Rolland, </em>592 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir.2010) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(e)(7)(B)(ii)). Under the PASARR provisions, applicants to Medicaid-certified nursing facilities must be evaluated to determine whether they have a mental illness and whether they meet level-of-eare criteria. Those that pass this initial screening are evaluated to determine the most appropriate setting for their needs, which may include a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>community setting. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.128, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The named plaintiffs in this putative class action are people with serious mental illnesses who are institutionalized in one of the State\u2019s institutional treatment facilities, New Hampshire Hospital (\u201cNHH\u201d) or the Glen-cliff Home (\u201cGlencliff\u201d), or who are alleged to be at serious risk of institutionalization in those facilities. Seeking to represent a class of similarly situated persons, the named plaintiffs allege that the defendants\u2014the Governor of New Hampshire, officials of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, and the Administrator of the New Hampshire Bureau of Behavioral Health (collectively, the \u201cState\u201d)\u2014are violating the integration mandates of the ADA and the RA, in that they rely excessively on the provision of institutional care to treat mental illness, rather than appropriate community-based care programs, and, relatedly, have failed \u201cto develop an adequate array\u201d of community-based services. Complt., doc. no. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, Pl. Br., doe. no. 73-1, at 4. Plaintiffs also allege that the State is violating the NHRA by failing \u201cto develop and implement an [adequate] PASARR program\u201d for Glen-cliff residents and applicants. Complt., doc. no. 1, at \u00b6 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">With regard to their integration mandate claims, plaintiffs assert two legal theories. They say that the State\u2019s pattern and practice of under-funding community services and its over-reliance on institutional treatment has created a systemic deficiency in the array of available community services, which, in turn, has 1) contributed to the unnecessary institutionalization of people with serious mental illnesses; and 2) contributed to the placement of people with serious mental illnesses at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201cat risk\u201d theory is based on the Attorney General\u2019s technical guidance interpreting its integration mandate regulation. <em>See </em>U.S. Dept. Of Justice, <em>Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II of the American with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C., http://www.ada.gov. olmstead/'g&amp;a-olmstead.htm </em>(last updated June 22, 2011). As counsel for the United States explained at oral argument: \u2018We clearly state [in our technical assistance guide] that the ADA and <em>Olmstead </em>do[ ] extend to people who are at serious risk of institutionalization, and you don\u2019t have to wait until you suffer the harms of being institutionalized before being able to state a claim.\u201d Hrg. Tr., doc. no. 89, at 119. The appellate courts for the Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits agree. <em>See Pashby v. Delia, </em>709 F.3d 307, 321-22 (4th Cir.2013); <em>M.R. v. Dreyfus, </em>663 F.3d 1100, 1116-17 (9th Cir. 2011) , <em>amended by </em>697 F.3d 706 (9th Cir. 2012) ; <em>Fisher v. Okla. Health Care Auth., </em>335 F.3d 1175, 1181 (10th Cir.2003). The court accepts the theory as viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief requiring the State to develop and provide an adequate array of identified community-based treatment services: mobile crisis services, Assertive Community Treatment (\u201cACT\u201d), supported housing, and supported employment. They do not seek individually-tailored injunctions regarding appropriate treatment for each class member.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The court denied, without prejudice, plaintiffs\u2019 first motion for class certification and allowed limited discovery on the certification issue. <em>See </em>6/11/12 Minute Order. That preliminary discovery period is now concluded. In support of their renewed motion for certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive class, plaintiffs have provided a body of evidence they say fully supports their request, because it shows that the State\u2019s pattern or practices relating to the funding and provision of community-based services has had the effect of creating a system-wide deficiency in community services that adversely affects a large class of persons with serious mental illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Plaintiffs point first to the State\u2019s own reports, in which the State has itself repeatedly identified a widespread, and problematic, deficiency in community services. In 2004, DHHS convened a task force of experts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>comprised of mental health professionals, administrators, and stakeholders to study the causes of, and to suggest remedies for, the significant \u201cimbalances in the mental health system of New Hampshire that cause many consumers to receive care at NHH rather than community alternatives.\u201d Complt., doc. no. 1, at \u00b6 53. The task force concluded that \u201cmany people are admitted to and remain at NHH because of a lack of ... alternatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It found a problematic decline in crisis and other community mental health services, and it pointed out that there had been \u201cvirtually no investment or development\u201d in community residential services. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In 2007, a legislative commission made similar findings and warned of \u201cshrinking community resources.\u201d It emphasized the need for the State to expand services such as ACT, supported employment, and supportive housing. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b655. In 2008, with the support of DHHS, another panel of mental health professionals was convened to assess New Hampshire\u2019s mental health services system and to make recommendations for meeting the critical needs of people with serious mental illnesses. In its report, entitled \u201cAddressing the Critical Mental Health Needs of NH\u2019s Citizens, A Strategy for Restoration,\u201d the panel found that \u201cmany individuals are admitted to New Hampshire Hospital because they have not been able to access sufficient [community] services in a timely manner (a \u2018front door\u2019 problem) and remain there, unable to be discharged, because of a lack of viable community-based alternatives (a \u2018back door\u2019 problem).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 56. The report called for, among other things, additional crisis services, supportive housing, and ACT teams. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Plaintiffs also rely on evidence of statistical patterns of repeated hospitalizations at NHH and lengthy institutionalization at Glencliff suggesting a systemic deficiency in available community-based services that forces people to seek treatment in institutions and to remain institutionalized unnecessarily. In addition, they point to the findings of the United States. In its review of the State\u2019s mental health system, the U.S. Dept. of Justice found that the State\u2019s failure to provide services to individuals with serious mental illness in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs \u201chas led to the needless and prolonged institutionalization of individuals with disabilities,\u201d and that the \u201csystemic failures in the State\u2019s system place qualified individuals with disabilities at risk of unnecessary institutionalization now and going forward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 70, (quoting United States\u2019 Investigation of the New Hampshire Mental Health System (April 7, 2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 experts echo that finding. In their \u201cSystem Review,\u201d the experts found the same systemic deficiencies in community services that the State previously identified. Pl. Br., doe. no. 73-1, at 12-14. In a separate \u201cClient Review,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 experts also concluded that there exists a large class of persons with mental illnesses who are affected by the deficiency in available community-based services. For that study, the \u201cNHH and Glencliff experts reviewed approximately two years of facility and community mental health records, conducted in-person meetings and observations with review participants, and interviewed guardians and mental health providers.\u201d PL Br., doc. no. 73-1, at 9. The experts concluded that 80-96% of review participants would have avoided institutionalization, would have spent less time hospitalized, or could be discharged, and would likely choose to live in the community, if they were fully informed of and had access to community-based treatment services. One of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, Dr. Sally Rogers, opined that these conclusions can be reliably generalized to the broader population of persons institutionalized in the named facilities. Rogers Aff., doe. no. 73-18, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14. Glencliff is a 120-bed facility, and NHH experienced over 1800 adult admissions in 2010. Extending those conclusions to the larger populations would yield a class size pertinent to the ADA and RA claims numbering in the hundreds.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The State argues that the experts\u2019 client review should be excluded from consideration under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), because the review\u2019s design was not methodologically sound and its implementation was not reliable. In support of its argument, the State submitted an affidavit from its expert, Dr. Leonard Flynn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Dr. Flynn has experience in conducting research studies and is Professor Emeritus at Framingham State University, where he has \u201ctaught courses at the graduate and undergraduate level through the Psychology and Math Departments since 1970,\u201d including Statistics, Research Methods, and Experimental Psychology. Flynn Aff., doc. no. 77-17. Dr. Flynn avers that the client review suffers from several errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Although the State advanced its <em>Daubert </em>argument in its brief in opposition, it did not seek a <em>Daubert </em>hearing or press the issue at oral argument. Development of the issue, therefore, has been minimal. Nevertheless, the argument is unsupportable in light of the averments of plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. E. Sally Rogers, Research Associate Professor and Director of Research for the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation at Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Boston University. <em>See </em>Rogers Aff., doe. no. 73-18; Rogers Supp. Aff., doc. no. 82-2. Dr. Rogers cogently, directly, and persuasively rebuts Dr. Flynn\u2019s challenges to the client review. <em>See </em>Rogers Supp. Aff., doc. no. 82-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Beyond its challenge to the client review, the State submitted evidence regarding the needs and preferences of persons institutionalized at Gleneliff and NHH. The State\u2019s experts\u2014NHH\u2019s Associate Medical Director and Gleneliff s Administrator\u2014conducted reviews of patient histories and health records, concluding that a large percentage of patients were properly admitted to these institutions and continue to need institutional care \u201cno matter what community-based services are available,\u201d and that they prefer such treatment. Def. Br., doe. no. 77, at 20-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">This case presents as a familiar <em>Olmstead </em>integration putative class action. The named plaintiffs \u201cchallenge[] a system-wide policy or practice that [allegedly] affects\u201d a class of persons with disabilities, and they seek class treatment of the claims despite differences in class member disabilities, needs, and treatment preferences. <em>Armstrong v. Davis, </em>275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir.2001). Relying on a developed body of case law permitting class certification in eases similar to this one, and on intimations in <em>Olmstead </em>itself that class certification is generally appropriate in integration mandate cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plaintiffs argue that class certification is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The State opposes class certification primarily on grounds that individual differences in disabilities and treatment preferences exist between and among putative class members, and similar differences exist between and among putative class members and the named plaintiffs. The crux of the State\u2019s objection is that, while courts in many <em>Olmstead </em>integration cases have granted class certification, the Supreme Court\u2019s relatively recent decision in <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011), has dramatically changed the class action landscape, such that the individualized nature of each putative class member\u2019s particular circumstances necessarily undermines plaintiffs\u2019 ability to meet Rule 23(a)\u2019s commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation prerequisites, as well as Rule 23(b)(2)\u2019s requirements. <em>See </em>Def. Surreply, doc. no. 88, at 2. The State also argues that class certification should be denied outright, because the involvement of the intervenor-plaintiff, the United States, makes class-based litigation unnecessary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">I. <em>The Involvement of the United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">Under the \u201creasonably clear\u201d language of Rule 23(b)(2), \u201cwhether the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>should be maintained as a class action depends on the <em>appropriateness </em>of injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\u201d <em>Dionne v. Bouley, </em>757 F.2d 1344, 1356 (1st Cir.1985) (emphasis in original). One factor a court may consider in determining the appropriateness of class certification is the fact that \u201cthe same relief can be obtained without certifying a class \u2014 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The State notes that the United States is seeking the same relief as are plaintiffs. So, it asserts, the court should exercise its discretion to deny class certification as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The court in <em>Bouley, </em>however, recognized that \u201c[tjhere may ... be situations where a class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) will arguably be unnecessary, but where other considerations may render a denial of certification improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It offered, as one of several examples, a situation in which \u201cclass certification does not impose any significant burden on the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is the case here. As the United States points out, full discovery will be at the \u201csame scale and the Parties will be moving toward trial at the same rate, whether or not the Plaintiff class is certified.\u201d Intervenor Br., doc. no. 84, at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">And, there is another reason why the United States\u2019 participation does not render class certification inappropriate. Although the interests of the plaintiff class and the United States overlap significantly, those interests are not coextensive\u2014and the differences can reasonably be expected to affect both litigation and settlement strategies. As the United States says, it is \u201c[ejharged with developing a national enforcement program,\u201d and it seeks consistency in its approach across all of its cases, without compromising its decision-making \u201cto meet the specific needs of class members in a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Representative plaintiffs, on the other hand, are duty-bound to advocate for the best interests of the particular defined class, regardless of how decisions or outcomes in this litigation might influence governmental policy positions, or other cases in litigation, across the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">For these reasons, class certification is not rendered \u201cinappropriate\u201d by virtue of the involvement of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">II. <em>Legal Standards for Class Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The party seeking certification must establish \u201cthe elements necessary for class certification: the four requirements of 23(a) and one of the several requirements of Rule 23(b).\u201d <em>In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., </em>218 F.R.D. 337, 341 (D.Mass.2003) (citing <em>Smilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., </em>323 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2003)). Whether the movant has carried that burden is a question the district court must resolve through a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d of Rule 23\u2019s requirements. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>General Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982)). That analysis \u201cmay \u2018entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claim.\u2019\u201d <em>Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Ret. Plans and Trust Funds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 1194, 185 L.Ed.2d 308 (2013) (quoting <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551). But the overlap must necessarily be limited, for \u201cRule 23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201c[m]erits questions may be considered to the extent\u2014but only to the extent\u2014that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1195. In short, \u201c[b]y sifting the abundant evidence through the sieve of the legal claims, [a] court [will] satisffy] the requirement to perform a \u2018rigorous analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glazer v. Whirlpool Corp., </em>722 F.3d 838, 852 (6th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">In addition to the explicit requirements of Rule 23, courts generally recognize the \u201cimplicit requirement\u201d that the class definition must be sufficiently definite to allow the court, parties, and putative class members to ascertain class membership. <em>Shanley v. Cadle, </em>277 F.R.D. 63, 67-68 (D.Mass. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">III. <em>Class Definition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">The level of precision, or \u201cdefiniteness\u201d required, varies depending on the type of class sought to be certified under part (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of Rule 23. <em>See </em>Newberg on Class Actions, \u00a7 3:7 (5th ed. June 2013). A high level of precision in defining class membership is necessary, for example, in (b)(3) classes, because all class members must be identified in order to notify each of his or her opt-out rights, and, later, to distribute monetary relief. <em>See Yaffe v. Powers, </em>454 F.2d 1362, 1366 (1st Cir.1972). In contrast, where certification of a (b)(2) injunctive class is sought, \u201cactual membership of the class need not ... be precisely delimited\u201d because \u201cnotice to the members ... is not required.\u201d <em>Id. See also Shook v. El Paso Cty., </em>386 F.3d 963, 972 (10th Cir.2004) (relying on <em>Yaffe, </em>and finding proposed class definition sufficiently definite, explaining that \u201cRule 23(b)(2) [is] well suited for cases where the composition of a class is not easily ascertainable\u201d due to the \u201cshifting\u201d nature of the population); <em>McCuin v. Sec. of Health and Human Svcs., </em>817 F.2d 161, 167 (1st Cir.1987) (\u201c[W]here only declaratory and injunctive relief is sought for a class, plaintiffs are not required to identify the class members once the existence of the class has been demonstrated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The named plaintiffs in this ease seek certification of a (b)(2) injunctive class. They propose the following class definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">All persons with serious mental illness who are unnecessarily institutionalized in New Hampshire Hospital or Glencliff or are at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization in these facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Hrg. Tr., doc. no. 89, at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Plaintiffs originally proposed a definition that mirrored, and was as broad as, class definitions that have been routinely approved in previous ADA integration cases. That proposed class definition did not include the words \u201cunnecessarily\u201d and \u201cunnecessary\u201d before the words \u201cinstitutionalized\u201d and \u201cinstitutionalization,\u201d respectively. Plaintiffs added those words at oral argument, however, in response to the court\u2019s inquiries. Although <em>Yaffe </em>does not require that the proposed definition of the (b)(2) class in this case \u201cprecisely delimit[]\u201d class membership, the modification is a decided improvement because it narrows the class to include only those who are allegedly harmed or affected by the State\u2019s conduct. In short, the proposed class definition, as modified, accurately articulates \u201cthe general demarcations\u201d of the class of individuals who are being harmed by the alleged deficiencies in the State\u2019s provision of community services. <em>Floyd v. City of New York, </em>283 F.R.D. 153, 172 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201c[G]eneral class descriptions based on the harm allegedly suffered by plaintiffs are acceptable in class actions seeking only declaratory and injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2).\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, nothing in <em>Crosby v. Social Sec. Admin., </em>796 F.2d 576 (1st Cir.1986), and <em>Carrier v. Am. Bankers Life Assur. Co. of Florida, </em>2008 WL 312657, at *4 (D.N.H. Feb. 1, 2008) (DiClerico, J.) prohibits defining this (b)(2) class by reference to the harm allegedly suffered, that is, by general reference to the harm associated with (the merits of) each class member\u2019s claim. <em>See generally </em>Newberg on Class Actions, Sec. 3:6 (describing a \u201cfail-safe\u201d class\u2014 which some courts prohibit under some circumstances\u2014as one that \u201crequire[s] a court to decide the merits of prospective individual class members\u2019 claims to determine class membership.\u201d). In both <em>Crosby </em>and <em>Carrier, </em>unlike here, notification to every class member would have been required, thus the class members had to be readily ascertainable, <em>ie., </em>ascertainable without \u201cindividualized fact-finding and litigation.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>796 F.2d at 580 (plaintiffs sought certification of a (b)(2) class, but requested an injunction ordering the defendant to notify all class members of their rights under federal law; \u2018Without an identifiable class of disability claimants, we cannot grant class-wide relief in this case either in the form of granting notices or compiling status reports.\u201d); <em>Carrier, </em>2008 WL 312657, at <em>*2 </em>(plaintiffs sought to certify a (b)(3) class, which requires notice). In the absence of any need to notify each class member, or distribute monetary relief, the proposed class here is appropriately defined in part by reference to the harms allegedly suffered by its members as a result of the violations asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Plaintiffs also proposed in their reply brief (but did not formally include in their proposed class definition) additional definitional language in response to the State\u2019s objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>that the phrase \u201cat serious risk\u201d is impermissibly \u201ccontingent on a particular state of mind,\u201d and that this \u201cimprecision [is] ... compounded by the failure to include any sort of temporal limitation\u201d on who is \u201cat serious risk.\u201d Def. Br., doc. no. 77, at 8-9. The proposed language reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">At risk of institutionalization means persons who, within a two year period: (1) had multiple hospitalizations; (2) used crisis or emergency room services for psychiatric reasons; (3) had criminal justice involvement as a result of their mental illness; or (4) were unable to access needed community services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Although it does not define who is at \u201cserious\u201d risk, the proffered language provides some objective and relevant limiting criteria, and serves to narrow the class as well by imposing a reasonable temporal limitation. The proposed limiting language, therefore, adequately addresses the State\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">For these reasons, the court finds that the proposed class, as modified at oral argument and as supplemented by plaintiffs\u2019 proffered language defining those \u201cat risk,\u201d is sufficiently definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">IV. <em>Rule 23(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Rule 23(a) sets forth four \u201crequirements applicable to all class actions\u201d: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 613, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997); Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">A. <em>Numerosity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Under Rule 23(a)(1), the class must be \u201cso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1). The numerosity requirement \u201chas two components, the number of class members and the practicability of joining them in a single case.\u201d <em>Rolland v. Cellucci, </em>1999 WL 34815562, at *3 (D.Mass. Feb. 2,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">1. <em>Number of Class Members</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">The exact number of class members need not be established, \u201cparticularly where ... only declaratory and injunctive relief is sought.\u201d <em>Rolland, </em>1999 WL 34815562, at *3. In deciding whether plaintiffs have met the numerosity requirement, the court \u201cmay draw a reasonable inference as to the size of the class given the facts before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, which includes the State\u2019s own reports, the findings of the United States, and the opinions of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, establishes that the proposed ADA and RA class is comprised of hundreds of persons. With regard to the PASARR claim, however, the number of class members has not been even roughly established. Assuming that there are, as alleged, deficiencies in the State\u2019s PASARR screening protocol at Glencliff, the proffered evidence does not support an adequate inference that the number of persons negatively affected by the asserted deficiencies is sufficiently large to warrant class treatment. Class certification, therefore, is denied as to the PASARR claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-17\">2. <em>Impracticability of Joinder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-18\">The requirement that joinder of the ADA and RA class be impracticable is easily met. The size of the class, the asserted disabilities of proposed class members, and geographic diversity, make it \u201chighly unlikely that separate actions would follow if class treatment were denied.\u201d <em>Armstead v. Pingree, </em>629 F.Supp. 273, 279 (M.D.Fla.1986). <em>See also Rolland, </em>1999 WL 34815562, at *3 (finding joinder impracticable in light of \u201cthe inability of nursing home residents with mental retardation and developmental disabilities to initiate actions on their own behalf\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-19\">In sum, the evidence plainly demonstrates that the size of the proposed ADA and RA class \u201cis so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-20\">B. <em>Commonality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-21\">Rule 23(a)(2) requires that there be \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2). Although a court need find only a \u201csingle common question,\u201d <em>WalMart, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2556 (quotation and alterations omitted), a certain rigor, as prescribed by the Supreme Court in <em>Wal-Mart, </em>must attend the commonality inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The plaintiffs in <em>Wal-Mart </em>were current and former female employees who brought Title VII employment discrimination claims against the defendant company. <em>Id. </em>at 2547. They alleged that Wal-Mart operated under a general policy of gender discrimination relating to pay and promotion decisions, specifically, that the company had a policy of leaving such decisions to the discretion of local managers within a corporate culture suffused with gender-biased stereotypical thinking. <em>Id. </em>at 2548. The district court certified a class under Rule 23(b)(2), and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the company argued that certification was improperly granted. It contended, among other things, that there was no commonality among class members because plaintiffs had not shown that the company operated under a general policy of discrimination that affected all class members. The Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u201cCommonality,\u201d the Court stated, \u201crequires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have \u2018suffered the same injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2551 (quoting <em>General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 157, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982)). This requirement cannot be met, however, simply by showing that the class members \u201chave all suffered a violation of the same provision of law,\u201d since such a showing would \u201cgive[] no cause to believe that all [class members\u2019] claims can productively be litigated at once.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2551. Rather, \u201cclaims must depend upon a common contention\u201d that is \u201ccapable of classwide resolution\u2014which means that the determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhat matters to class certification,\u201d the Court emphasized, \u201cis not the raising of common questions\u2014even in droves\u2014but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common <em>answers </em>apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2551 (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 97, 132 (2009)) (emphasis in original). Notably, \u201cdissimilarities within the proposed class ... have the potential to impede the generation of common answers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2551 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Applying those principles to the case before it, the Court held that the named plaintiffs were required to provide \u201csignificant proof\u2019 that the defendant \u201coperate[d] under a general policy of discrimination\u201d that \u201ctoueh[ed] and concerned] all members of the class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2552, 2557 &amp; n. 10 (quotations omitted). The Court found that plaintiffs did not carry their burden. Although they alleged that the defendant had a companywide policy of allowing local managers to exercise discretion in hiring and promotion decisions, plaintiffs failed to \u201cidentify] a common mode of exercising discretion that pervade[d] the entire company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2555. Their primary evidence of a common mode or practice was testimony from a sociological expert that gender \u201cstereotypes play[ed] a meaningful role\u201d in local managers\u2019 exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 2553. But, the Court noted, the expert could not say \u201cwhether .05 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions\u201d were affected by stereotyped thinking. <em>Id. </em>at 2554. The Court also rejected as insignificant the affidavits of 120 female employees detailing their experiences of sex discrimination. Those employees, the Court noted, comprised only a very small percentage of the class (\u201cabout 1 for every 12,500 class members\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 2556. Plaintiffs\u2019 regression analysis, which showed a gender disparity in promotions, likewise, did not provide the required significant proof. The analysis failed to link local decisions with the disparity shown. <em>Id. </em>at 2555. At bottom, plaintiffs did not \u201cprovide ... convincing proof of a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2556-57. The Court held, therefore, that the district court erred in certifying the class. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Under <em>Wal-Mart\u2019s </em>clarification of the commonality requirement, therefore, plaintiffs seeking class certification must, among other things, (1) avoid framing common questions so generally that they encompass myriad, distinct claims; (2) provide significant proof that \u201cthere exists a common policy or practice ... that is the alleged source of the harm to [the] class members,\u201d <em>M.D. v. Perry, </em>294 F.R.D. 7, 28-29, 2013 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>4537955, at *14 (S.D.Tex. August 27, 2013); (3) identify common questions of fact or law that can be \u201canswered either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 for the entire class,\u201d that is, identify central questions whose answers \u201c \u201cwill not vary by individual class members,\u2019 \u201d <em>Raposo v. Garelick Farms, LLC, </em>2013 WL 3733461, at *3 (D.Mass. July 11, 2013) (quoting <em>Donovan v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., </em>2012 WL 957633, at *21 (D.Mass. Mar. 21, 2012)); and (4) show that \u201cdissimilarities in the proposed class\u201d do not \u201cimpede the generation of common answers.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551. Plaintiffs here have done all of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Substantial evidence suggests that the State\u2019s policies and practices have created a systemic deficiency in the availability of community-based mental health services, and that that deficiency is the source of the harm alleged by all class members. The State\u2019s own reports, for example, demonstrate that there is a dearth of available community-based services within New Hampshire\u2019s mental health system. They further show that this systemic condition \u201cis a result of the way the State manages the system and is something that the State ... can control.\u201d <em>M.D., </em>294 F.R.D. at 48 (finding that the States\u2019 policies and practices brought about the challenged systemic conditions). In addition, the evidence suggests a causal connection between that systemic condition and the harm experienced by <em>all </em>class members: a serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization, which includes a serious risk of continued unnecessary institutionalization. As noted above, the State\u2019s own reports show a \u201cfront door\u201d and a \u201cback door\u201d problem, both of which the reports attribute to the systemic deficiency. Likewise, plaintiffs\u2019 experts corroborate the reports\u2019 findings, concluding that there is a high rate of unnecessary placement into institutions and unnecessary continued institutionalization, both resulting from the short supply of community-based services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The plaintiffs have also shown that common questions susceptible to common answers are present. For instance, whether there is a systemic deficiency in the availability of community-based services, and whether that deficiency follows from the State\u2019s policies and practices, are questions central to plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case. These questions -will, necessarily, be answered similarly for every class member. And, whether the systemic conditions, if shown to exist, expose all class members to a serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization, including continued unnecessary institutionalization, is a central and common contention whose resolution will defeat or advance the claims of all class members, whether institutionalized or not. In short, these common questions can be \u201canswered either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 for the entire class,\u201d and the answers \u201cwill not vary by individual class members.\u201d <em>Donovan, </em>2012 WL 957633, at *21.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The State argues that plaintiffs have, at most, shown the impact of myriad, distinct State funding and provision practices that relate to several types of community-based services. The State posits, in other words, that its alleged practice of failing to provide an adequate array of community services is really a collection of separate, discrete practices relating to \u201cnumerous different types of community-based treatments,\u201d broadly articulated by plaintiffs as a single \u201csystemic failure[].\u201d Def. Br., doc. no. 77, at 46-47. Therefore, it says, the class members have nothing in common except for the fact that they each alleged a violation of the integration mandate\u2014something <em>Wal-Mart </em>does not allow. <em>See </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">The State points to the recent decision in <em>DL v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>713 F.3d 120 (D.C.Cir.2013), in which the appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>found that plaintiffs had not met Wal-Mart\u2019s commonality test. <em>Id. </em>at 127-28. But <em>DL </em>was decidedly different, and is distinguishable from this ease. In <em>DL, </em>plaintiffs alleged numerous violations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 et seq. <em>DL, </em>713 F.3d at 122. Specifically, they challenged the defendants\u2019 practices with respect to four distinct steps in the IDEA\u2019S \u201cChild Find\u201d process. <em>Id. </em>The appellate court held that plaintiffs had not shown the existence of a common question because, contrary to Wal-Mart!s teaching, they articulated a common question at the highest level of generality\u2014that is, whether \u201cthe District has violated the IDEA as to each class member\u201d\u2014in order to sweep within the question\u2019s scope the defendants\u2019 \u201cmultiple, disparate failures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Unlike the disparate practices and deficiencies challenged in <em>DL, </em>the State practices plaintiffs challenge here all pertain to a discrete set of community-based services\u2014services the State itself has persuasively identified as critical to solving the crisis in New Hampshire\u2019s mental health system. Although it may be a matter of degree, and perhaps discretion, as to where the line should be drawn, the court is persuaded that common questions\u2014such as, whether there is a systemic deficiency in a core set of community-based mental health services and whether this deficiency has placed class members at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization or continued unnecessary institutionalization\u2014are at a low enough level of generality (or high enough level of specificity) to pass muster under <em>Wal-Mart. </em>In other words, the common questions here are not amorphous or \u201csuperficial.\u201d <em>Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Public Sch., </em>668 F.3d 481, 497 (7th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Moreover, and not unimportantly, in disability cases both pre- and post <em>-Wal-Mart, </em>the commonality requirement has been held to be met where, as here, plaintiffs challenge more than a single service deficiency and seek more than one service enhancement or improvement as part of the remedy. <em>See e.g., Gray v. Golden Gate Nat\u2019l Recreational Area, </em>279 F.R.D. 501, 511-19 (N.D.Cal.2011) (holding, post <em>-Wal-Mart, </em>that commonality was satisfied where defendant\u2019s general policies and practices failed to address \u201caccess barriers,\u201d despite the fact that different types of access barriers were at issue, the types and levels of class members\u2019 disabilities differed, and different types of accommodation would be required); <em>Lane v. Kitzhaber, </em>283 F.R.D. 587 (D.Or.2012) (post-Wal-Mart); <em>Rolland v. Cellucci, </em>1999 WL 34815562 (D.Mass. Feb. 2, 1999) (pre-Wal-<em>Mart).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The State also argues that dissimilarities in class member needs and preferences for community-based services, and dissimilarities in their current preferences and future needs as between institutional care and community-based services, make class certification improper. \u201cThere is no commonality,\u201d it says, \u201cwhen each class member needs or wants a different mix of community supports,\u201d or when some class members prefer acute psychiatric or nursing care over care in the community and, therefore, \u201cwant to remain in their current [institutional] setting.\u201d Def. Br., doc. no. 77, at 5; Def. Surreply, doc. no. 88 at l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">1. <em>Needs and Preferences for Different Community-Based Services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The State posits that the limited funding \u201cpie\u201d will necessarily pit class members needing and wanting a particular community service, or mix of services, against other members needing and wanting some other community service or mix of services. The intra-class conflict that the State posits is premised on its assertion that \u201cthe class as a whole cannot seek maximum dollars for each [community] service, without turning their rebalancing of the system into a fundamental alteration.\u201d Def. Surreply, doc. no. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>88, at 6, n. 1. In seeking to defeat class certification, the State, it seems, is venturing into issues that are properly addressed at trial, in the context of its fundamental alteration defense, but which are not particularly relevant to the class certification inquiry. <em>See Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1203-04 (rejecting defendant\u2019s attempt to litigate a defense as part of class certification). <em>See also Glazer, </em>722 F.3d at 851-52 (\u201c[District courts may not \u2018turn the class certification proceedings into a dress rehearsal for the trial on the merits.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Messner v. Northshore Univ. HealthSys., </em>669 F.3d 802, 811 (7th Cir.2012)). In any event, if the State turns out to be right in predicting an intra-class conflict, the creation of \u201cindependently represented sub-classes\u201d stands as an available managerial device to resolve such potential issues. <em>Ortiz v. Fibreboard, Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 864, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715 (1999). <em>See also Manning v. Boston Med. Ctr. Corp., </em>725 F.3d 34, 59-60 (1st Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">2. <em>Future Need for Institutional Care</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The State also contends that differences in <em>future </em>needs among the class members destroy commonality. It has submitted evidence suggesting that an increase in funding for community services will result in a critical reduction in already inadequate acute care services. This is problematic, it says, because many class members may need acute care in the future, but, if plaintiffs secure the relief they seek, institutional treatment may not be available. According to Erik Reir\u00e1, Administrator of the New Hampshire Bureau of Behavioral Health, if community-based services are expanded to the extent sought by plaintiffs, \u201c[t]he State would have to radically alter its mental health care budget to the detriment of individuals who need acute in-patient care or long-term care.\u201d Reir\u00e1 Aff., doc. no. 77-2, at \u00b6 24. He further states that, \u201c[t]o make the expenditures sought by Plaintiffs without raising the overall mental health care budget will require drastic cuts to important programs the Department runs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29. He concludes that \u201c[e]uts of magnitude demanded by the expenditures Plaintiffs seek could only be accomplished by a drastic reduction in funding for NHH and Glencliff Home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reira\u2019s factual assertions are more properly addressed in the context of the State\u2019s fundamental alteration defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">3. <em>Preference for Institutional Care</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The State\u2019s point about differences in treatment preferences between community services and institutional care likely overstates the willingness of individuals with serious mental illness to accept needless institutionalization over services in the community. But even so, the existence of preference differences among class members does not change the fact that the State\u2019s practices with regard to community services have been shown, by substantial proof, to affect all class members. <em>See Glazer, </em>722 F.3d at 852 (on remand after <em>Wal-Mart, </em>affirming district court\u2019s finding of commonality in products liability ease, explaining that, where the question of the product\u2019s defectiveness was common to all class members, \u201c[t]he existence [in the class] of currently satisfied [product] owners did not preclude the district court from certifying the ... class.\u201d). And, because preferences can change, class members who today might prefer institutionalization, can reasonably be thought to also have an interest in the availability of community-based treatment options should their preferences change tomorrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The State seems, therefore, to \u201cexaggerate[ ] the impact on the feasibility and desirability of class action treatment of the fact\u201d that some class members may prefer institutionalization. <em>McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>672 F.3d 482, 490 (7th Cir.2012) (Posner, J.) (finding commonality after <em>Wal-Mart, </em>where plaintiff minority stockbrokers submitted sufficient proof of a company-wide policy affecting all class members, even though \u201cthe exercise of discretion at the local level is undoubtedly a factor in the differential success of brokers, even if not a factor that overwhelms the effect of the corporate policies\u201d). Indeed, the relatively recent decision in Foss, 592 F.3d at 253, provides some assurance of feasibility because it supports the notion, albeit .'by implication, that the claims of people with different treatment preferences \u201ccan productively be litigated at once.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>5. Ct. at 2551. <em>See Voss, </em>592 F.3d at 253 (approving class settlement providing for an increase in community services for developmentally disabled persons, and leaving for the State\u2019s individual service planning process, placement decisions that would take individual preferences into account).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">For all of these reasons, the court finds that plaintiffs have met the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">C. <em>Typicality and Adequacy of Representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Rule 23(a)(3) provides that \u201cthe claims or defenses of the representative parties [must be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3). Rule 23(a)(4) requires that \u201cthe representative parties ... fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4). The typicality and adequacy requirements overlap. <em>Shanley, </em>277 F.R.D. at 69. The State argues that the named plaintiffs are not adequate representatives of the class and that their claims are not typical of class member claims because (1) they seek to shift funds away from institutional care, yet some class members currently prefer institutional care, or may need care at a <em>particular </em>institution in the future; (2) some class members need or prefer different, or a different mix of, community-based services than the named plaintiffs; and (3) the State\u2019s review of the named plaintiffs\u2019 medical files purportedly reveals that some either need or prefer institutionalization, or may need institutionalization in the future. The arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The court has determined that all class members, as defined and without regard to current preferences, have an abiding interest in securing the availability of community-based services options sufficient to preclude unnecessary institutionalization. Moreover, as noted, the State\u2019s arguments that funding for institutional care will be unavailable if the named plaintiffs get what they want, and that the funding \u201cpie\u201d is not large enough to maximize the funding of all four community-based services, are issues properly addressed at trial in the context of the State\u2019s fundamental alteration defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">In addition, it has been adequately shown that, due to a shortage of the types of community-based services sought, each of the named plaintiffs either continues to experience unnecessary institutionalization, has experienced unnecessary institutionalization in the past, or, although currently not institutionalized, is otherwise at serious risk of being unnecessarily institutionalized. Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence also suggests that these same circumstances are shared by the defined class members. Although the State submitted contradictory evidence from its own experts with regard to the needs and preferences of the named plaintiffs, plaintiffs countered with supplemental affidavits from their mental health experts, and from the named plaintiffs themselves or their guardians. Having reviewed this evidence, the court finds that plaintiffs have shown that the named plaintiffs\u2019 experiences and claims are typical of those of the members of the class, and that the named plaintiffs are adequate representatives of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The State does not challenge the experience or qualifications of the putative class attorneys, nor, reasonably, could it. The court finds, therefore, that plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will adequately represent the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">V. <em>Rule 23(b)(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">Plaintiffs seek to maintain this suit as an injunctive class action under Rule 23(b)(2). As noted, plaintiffs have submitted evidence to support their allegation that a systemic deficiency in the State\u2019s communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ty-based mental health services system affects the class. As the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted in <em>M.D. v. Perry, </em>675 F.3d 832, 841 (5th Cir.2012), the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are met where plaintiffs show that the \u201cState engages in a pattern or practice of agency action or inaction\u2014including a failure to correct a structural deficiency within the agency ... with respect to the class.\u201d Plaintiffs have, therefore, met their burden to show that the State has \u201cacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Nevertheless, the State argues that certification of a (b)(2) class is improper because the class member claims are not \u201ccohesive.\u201d There is some debate, even after <em>Wal-Mart, </em>whether Rule 23(b)(2) contains an implicit cohesiveness requirement <em>(see </em>Newberg, Sec. 4:33), and the court of appeals for this circuit has never endorsed one. <em>See Donovan v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>268 F.R.D. 1,11-12 (D.Mass.2010) (finding that there is no authority in the First Circuit for grafting a cohesiveness requirement onto Rule 23(b)(2)). The court need not address that legal issue, however, because in any event, the class here is sufficiently cohesive.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">A class is \u201ccohesive\u201d where common questions predominate and there are \u201cfew conflicting interests among its members.\u201d <em>Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., </em>151 F.3d 402, 413 (5th Cir.1998). The State argues, primarily, that the proposed class is not cohesive given the same dissimilarities between and among class members that it believes undermine commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. It argues, in sum, that the class members here do not \u201chave a \u2018strong commonality of interests,\u2019\u201d such that alL of them will benefit from a single injunction. Def. Br., doc. no. 78, at 13 (quoting <em>Gates v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co., </em>655 F.3d 255, 264 (3d Cir.2011) (applying cohesiveness requirement)). <em>See also </em>Def. Surreply, doc. no. 88, at 2. The court has addressed and rejected the State\u2019s arguments regarding class member dissimilarities, finding that all class members share a strong common interest in enhanced options for community treatment. Injunctive relief prohibiting a discriminatory lack of community service options would, therefore, benefit all class members. <em>See D.G. ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaughn, </em>594 F.3d 1188, 1200 (10th Cir. 2010) (holding that class was cohesive, noting that, \u201cbecause the Named Plaintiffs assert that excessive caseloads are harming or putting at risk of harm all children in the class, the imposition of caseload limits would apply to the entire class.\u201d) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">For these reasons, the court finds that plaintiffs have met the requirements of Rule 28(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Reasonable minds may of course differ as to whether the traditional approach taken in ADA integration cases (or related disability cases) of certifying broad classes of persons with different specific disabilities, needs, and preferences (an approach taken both before and after <em>Wal-Mart), </em>is in tension with Wal-Mart\u2019s recent procedural commands. But plaintiffs here have defined the class more narrowly than is usually done in ADA integration cases; their class claims are limited to parallel claims under the ADA and RA; they challenge alleged deficiencies related to a discrete set or class of services; and they seek a single declaration or injunction aimed at correcting a systemic discriminatory imbalance (not mini-injunctions for each class member), thus leaving individual treatment determinations for the State\u2019s existing individually-targeted administrative process. All of this, the court concludes, has enabled plaintiffs to meet Wal-Mart\u2019s commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification, doc. no. 73, is granted in part and denied in part. The requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2) are met with regard to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, but not with regard to the PASARR claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">The class certified is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">All persons with serious mental illness who are unnecessarily institutionalized in New Hampshire Hospital or Glencliff or who are at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization in these facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>At risk of institutionalization means persons who, within a two year period: (1) had multiple hospitalizations; (2) used crisis or emergency room services for psychiatric reasons; (3) had criminal justice involvement as a result of their mental illness; or (4) were unable to access needed community services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Upon certification, the court must appoint class counsel. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(g). Plaintiffs here seek the appointment of four firms or legal services organizations as class co-counsel: DRC, Devine, Millimet &amp; Branch, the Bazelon Center, and CPR. These firms and organizations, and their designated attorneys, meet the requirements of Rule 23(g)(1)(A). Pursuant to this court\u2019s authority under Rule 23(g)(l)(C)-(E), class counsel shall submit ex parte, or under seal, a proposed budget related to anticipated fees in this case within sixty (60) days from the date of this order. Given the number of attorneys seeking active participation in this litigation, it seems prudent to ensure some control and oversight over the generation of fee claims at the outset, in the interest of both plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and defendants, who may at some point be asked to pay those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Undoubtedly, class certification carries risk, but such decisions are conditional, and the court retains the authority to modify the class description, or even decertify the class, if subsequent developments suggest that either is appropriate. Should decertification become advisable or necessary, the involvement of the United States\u2014which seeks system-wide remedies\u2014substantially reduces the risk that litigation efforts and resources will have been wasted.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Finally, given that the class is certified under Rule 23(b)(2), and notice is discretionary, the court declines to require that notice be given to all members of the class, since the relief sought is systemic in nature and can only benefit members of the class. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\">. An \"integrated setting\u201d is one that \"enables individuals with disabilities to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible. ..28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">. The State suggests, without developed argument, that class members who are \"at serious risk\u201d of needless institutionalization do not have standing. The State did not brief the issue, but only mentioned it at oral argument, and it is, as presented, unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. As the United States points out, in defining rights and duties under the ADA's integration mandate, the court in <em>Olmstead, </em>by negative implication, seemed to tie the class action procedural device to vindication of rights under the integration mandate. <em>See Olmstead, </em>527 U.S. at 606, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (warning against \"displacement of persons at the top of the community-based treatment waiting list by individuals lower down who commenced civil actions.\u201d). <em>Id. </em>That <em>Olmstead </em>claims may, as a general matter, be suited for class treatment is also suggested by the fact that the fundamental alteration defense involves an inquiry into the needs of all persons served by the state's mental health system. <em>Id. </em>Class treatment would avoid \u201crepetitious resolution\u201d of that inquiry. <em>Gintis v. Bouchard Transp. Co., </em>596 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir.2010) (\"[M]ost or all cases, if individually litigated, would require repetitious resolution of an objection by [defendant] that is common to each one of them.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-5\">. Evidence of a serious risk here seems substantial in light of cases applying that standard. <em>See e.g., Hunter ex rel. Lynah v. Cook, </em>2013 WL 2252917, at *6 (N.D.Ga. May 22, 2013); <em>Pashby v. Cansler, </em>279 F.R.D. 347 (E.D.N.C.2011) <em>aff'd Pashby v. Delia, </em>709 F.3d 307, 322 (4th Cir. 2013). Moreover, the cases seem to indicate, at least by implication, that no individualized inquires need be made to determine whether a systemic condition places class members at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization; instead, the inquiry can properly turn on system-wide proof. Notably, as evidenced by its 2011 \"Investigation of the New Hampshire Mental Health System,\u201d its brief in this case, and its comments at oral argument, the United States seems to agree with this interpretation of its regulation. Of course, whether plaintiffs can prove their claim is a question for trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">. The State also argues that another relevant dissimilarity is that between class members who are already receiving community services and those who are not. That difference, however, does not destroy commonality because, under plaintiffs' modified class definition, those class members who are receiving community services (meaning, they are not \"unnecessarily institutionalized\u201d) are, nevertheless, \"at serious risk\u201d of needless institutionalization\u2014a status that implies inadequacy or insecurity of community service options.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">. Such a process may best ensure vindication of rights under the ADA and RA, since the <em>meaningful </em>exercise of a preference will be possible only <em>if </em>an adequate array of community services are available to those who do not need institutionalization. As plaintiffs point out, preferences may be \"conditioned by availability, ... limited by information, and are likely to evolve in a system that complies with the ADA.\u201d PI.
