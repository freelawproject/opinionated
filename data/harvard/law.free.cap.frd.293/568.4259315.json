SCHEINDLIN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">This is a consolidated multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) relating to contamination\u2014actual or threatened\u2014of groundwater from various defendants\u2019 use of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d) and/or tertiary butyl alcohol, a product formed by the breakdown of MTBE in water. In this ease, plaintiff Orange County Water District (the \u201cDistrict\u201d), which is charged with maintaining groundwater quality, alleges that defendants\u2019 use and handling of MTBE has contaminated, or threatens to contaminate, groundwater within its jurisdiction. Familiarity with the background of the case is presumed for the purposes of this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Currently before the Court on letter briefs is the District\u2019s objection to Special Master Kenneth J. Warner\u2019s Pre-Trial Order No. 76 (\u201cPTO 76\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, I affirm PTO 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">II. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJ5\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">This dispute relates to a document that one the District\u2019s experts, Stephen W. Wheateraft, Ph.D., referred to in order to refresh his recollection during his deposition. Wheateraft is engaged by the District as both a consulting expert and a testifying exPert- In his capacity as a testifying exPert&gt; he intends to offer affirmative opinions on the alleged future impacts of MTBE to drinking wells in the Orange County Water district, and to offer rebuttal testimony in response to Defendants\u2019 experts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">Defendants deposed Wheateraft on January 17, 2012. The dispute underlying the present matter concerns Wheatcraft\u2019s criticism of defense experts\u2019 failure to replicate results that plaintiffs\u2019 experts had obtained from a certain computational model. The District asserts that Defendants have improperly failed to turn over certain input parameters used by their experts in modeling the threatened impact of MTBE.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During Wheatcraft\u2019s deposition, defense counsel asked him for an example of a defense expert that ran the District\u2019s \u201cmodel with their own variations and where the information has not been provided----\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response, Wheateraft referred to the 45-page spreadsheet that is the subject of this objection (the \u201cSpreadsheet\u201d), and then read into the record a quote from a defense expert report reproduced in the Spreadsheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-21\">Later in the deposition, defense counsel asked Wheateraft to describe the Spreadsheet. In response, he testified that it is \u201ca document that contains information about each expert and the details of opinions they provide that relate to the issue we have been discussing.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel then asked if the document \u201csummarize[d] the deficiencies that [existed] in connection with the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>experts\u2019 reports[]____\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Counsel for the District objected, stating that Wheatcraft merely used the document \u201cas a reference to refresh his recollection.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When defense counsel continued to press Wheatcraft about the nature of the Spreadsheet, counsel for the District again objected to the line of questioning. However, Wheatcraft testified that he and his assistant had prepared the Spreadsheet. The District maintains that \u201cthe [Spreadsheet was created at the direction of counsel for the District, as the result of a communication by the District\u2019s counsel to [] Wheatcraft, and was subsequently provided to the District by [ ] Wheat-craft in response to counsel\u2019s request.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">B. PTO 71 (Special Master Warner\u2019s First Ruling on Defendants\u2019 Motion to Compel)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On January 20, 2012, defendants filed a motion with Special Master Warner to compel production of the Spreadsheet. The District opposed the motion. On January 27, 2012, the day that the District\u2019s opposition was due, counsel for the District informed Special Master Warner and defense counsel that she would produce the materials \u201creviewed and relied upon\u201d by Dr. Wheatcraft during his deposition by close of business on January 30, 2012, thereby mooting the pending motion. Ultimately, though, the District only produced eight pages of the Spreadsheet, along with a cover-page asserting that production of the entire Spreadsheet was not required because Wheatcraft had only read a portion of it during his deposition. In response, Defendants renewed their motion on February 6, 2012. Two weeks later, on February 20, 2012, Special Master Warner held a telephonic hearing at which he heard the arguments of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">On February 29, 2012, Special Master Warner entered PTO 71. Based on his <em>in camera </em>review, he found that the entirety of the Spreadsheet related to Dr. Wheatcraft\u2019s testimony at the deposition, and ruled that Federal Rule of Evidence 612 therefore required its production. This ruling was expressly limited to \u201conly [ ] the document at issue,\u201d and did not \u201cconstitute a ruling that the attorney/client privilege has been waived as to any other document.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In fact, the ruling did not reach the issue of whether the Spreadsheet was entitled to work-product protection at all. Instead, it rested on the rationale that Rule 612 trumps a claim of work-produet immunity, such that the District was required to produce the Spreadsheet regardless of the existence of privilege.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">I reviewed PTO 71 upon the District\u2019s objection, and concluded that Special Master Warner had erred in concluding that, under Rule 612, a writing relied upon in a deposition is categorically barred from work product protection. Instead, \u201cthe proper approach is to conduct a balancing test to determine whether Rule 612 requires disclosure, notwithstanding the existence of a privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I remanded for a determination of whether the Spreadsheet must be produced in light of this principle of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">C. PTO 76 (Special Master Warner\u2019s Ruling After Remand)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">After remand, on April 8, 2013, Special Master Warner issued PTO 76, which overrules the District\u2019s objection and orders production of the Spreadsheet in its entirety. This ruling rests on Special Master Warner\u2019s determination that Wheatcraft relied upon and/or prepared the Spreadsheet in a testimonial capacity, and his conclusion that this excludes the Spreadsheet from the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>work-product protection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> PTO 71 also holds, in the alternative, that if the Spreadsheet <em>is </em>subject to work-product protection, the District need not produce more of it than it has already produced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">III. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The Order appointing Special Master Warner states that: \u201c[t]he Court will set aside a ruling [of the Special Master] on a procedural matter only where it is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cDiscovery rulings, including those regarding privilege issues, are nondispositive matters subject to [the] standard of review [applicable to procedural matters].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cAn assessment of the evidence is clearly erroneous where the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">B. Production of Documents Relied Upon During a Deposition</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Rule 612 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs circumstances where a witness refreshes her recollection with a writing while testifying, whether during a deposition or at trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">[A]n adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness about it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the witness\u2019s testimony. If the producing party claims that the writing includes unrelated matter, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any unrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party. Any portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">C. The Work-Product Doctrine and Testifying Experts</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">The work-product doctrine was recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Hickman v. Taylor</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and later codified by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It protects from discovery documents and materials prepared \u201cin anticipation of litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cA claim of work-product has three elements: [t]he material must (1) be a document or a tangible thing, (2) that was prepared in anticipation of litigation, and (3) was prepared by or for a party, or by or for his representative.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">Work-product immunity must be invoked expressly, and the party relying on it must \u201cdescribe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed\u2014and do so in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cThe initial burden of justifying the application of the work product doctrine is on the asserting party, and the burden is a heavy one because privileges are neither lightly created nor expansively construed.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In particular, the burden of showing a document is entitled to work-product protection may not be \u201c \u2018discharged by mere conclusory or <em>ipse dixit </em>assertions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Work-product immunity is conditional. Once properly invoked, it may be overcome upon a showing that: (1) the requested material is otherwise discoverable; and (2) the party seeking production \u201chas substantial need for the materials to prepare its ease and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Even if this showing is made, the \u201cmental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party\u2019s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation[ ]\u201d must be protected.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Like other qualified privileges, work-product protection may be waived.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201ccommunications between [a] party\u2019s attorney and any witness required to provide a report\u201d are protected by the work-product doctrine,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> but \u201cfacts or data that [a] party\u2019s attorney provided and that the [party\u2019s testifying] expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed\u201d are outside the scope of work-product protection.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Similarly, an expert report must contain all \u201cthe facts or data considered by the [expert] in forming\u201d the opinions that the expert is to offer.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In light of this framework, furnishing work-product of a factual nature to a testifying expert constitutes implied waiver of work-product protection to the extent that the expert considers the facts or data disclosed in forming her opinion.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, <em>draft </em>reports and disclosures continue to be protected work-product.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">It is irrelevant whether the expert ultimately relies upon the facts or data in forming her expert opinion; instead, the test is whether the expert \u2018considered\u2019 the materials. Further, because \u201ca testifying expert [must] disclose all materials that he <em>considered </em>in reaching his opinion, ... [a] party seeking to compel the production of [ ] documents should not have to rely on the [resisting party\u2019s] representation that the documents were not considered by the expert in forming his opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>D. Consulting Expert Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In addition to codifying the work-product doctrine, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also establishes that, ordinarily, \u201cthe [] facts known or opinions held\u201d by a <em>consulting </em>expert are not discoverable.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, a party may be entitled to such discovery upon \u201cshowing exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party to obtain [the] facts or opinions on the same subject by other means[ ]\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>\u2014most commonly, in cases of spoliation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">There are four commonly articulated policy considerations underlying [protecting the facts or opinions known by consulting experts from discovery] [:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">(1) the \u201cinterest in allowing counsel to obtain the expert advice they need in order properly to evaluate and present their clients\u2019 positions without fear that every consultation with an expert may yield grist for the adversary\u2019s mill\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">(2) the view that \u201ceach side should prepare its own case at its own expense\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">(3) the concern that it would be unfair to the expert to compel [her] testimony and also the concern that experts might become unwilling to serve as consultants if they suspected their testimony would be compelled; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\">(4) the risk of prejudice to the party who retained the expert as a result of the mere fact of retention.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">E. Dual-Capacity Experts</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">In some cases, the rules applicable to consulting and testifying experts overlap or conflict. As stated above, factual materials considered by testifying experts in forming their opinions are not protected work-produet.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> For this reason, tendering materials generated by a consulting expert to a testifying expert may waive that protection.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-18\">It is conceivable that an expert could be retained to testify and in addition to advise counsel outside of the subject of his testimony. Under such a circumstance it might be possible to claim a work product privilege if this delineation were clearly made.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-19\">Prior to the 2010 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the \u201c2010 Amendment\u201d), courts in this Circuit uniformly held that, in such dual-capacity eases, \u201cdocuments having <em>no relation </em>to the expert\u2019s role as an expert need not be produced[,] but [] any ambiguity as to the role played by the expert when reviewing or generating documents should be resolved in favor of the party seeking discovery.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> I now turn to the continued viability of this bright-line approach after the 2010 Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADq8\">There is ample basis in the record to affirm PTO 76. As Special Master Warner correctly found, there is at least an ambiguity as to whether Wheatcraft considered the Spreadsheet in his capacity as a testifying expert.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Wheatcraft has been engaged by the District to rebut the Defendants\u2019 expert testimony, and it was partially in this capacity that he was deposed. At his deposition, Wheatcraft used the Spreadsheet to support his rebuttal of Defendants\u2019 experts, and, as Special Master Warner found, \u201cit is evident that Wheatcraft would have similarly relied upon additional portions of the spreadsheet\u201d had the District not objected.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Finally, Wheatcraft acknowledged that the Spreadsheet \u201ccontains information ... that relate[s] to the issue we have been discussing.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In sum, Special Master Warner did not abuse his discretion in finding that Wheatcraft considered the Spreadsheet in his capacity as the District\u2019s rebuttal expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Nor was Special Master Warner\u2019s decision contrary to law. Before the 2010 Amendment to Rule 26, courts in this Circuit had consistently held that where, as here, it is ambiguous whether allegedly privileged materials were generated or used by a dual-capacity expert in her capacity as a testifying expert, the materials would have to be produced.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The gravamen of the District\u2019s present objection is that the 2010 Amendment changes this analysis. Specifically, the District argues that under amended Rule 26, the Spreadsheet is entitled to work-product immunity, because it was created by Wheat-craft at the request of counsel and in his capacity as a consulting expert.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> For the following reasons, this argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Prior to the 2010 Amendment, Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(ii) permitted discovery of \u201cdata or other information\u201d considered by a testifying expert in connection with her opinion, leading many courts to conclude that \u201cRule 26 creates a bright-line rule mandating disclosure of all documents, including attorney opinion work product, given to testifying experts.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The 2010 Amendment to Rule 26 abrogates this bright-line approach in favor of the work-product doctrine\u2019s original function: protecting the \u201corderly prosecution and defense of legal claims[ ]\u201d by preventing \u201cunwarranted inquiries into the files and the mental impressions of attorneys....\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Among other <em>changes\u2014e.g., </em>designating drafts of expert reports as work-product through Rule 26(b)(4)(B)\u2014the 2010 Amendment: (1) clarifies that \u201ccommunications between [a] party\u2019s attorney and\u201d a testifying expert are within the scope of the work-product doctrine;<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and (2) excepts from the work-product doctrine \u201cfacts or data\u201d considered by a testifying expert, rather than \u201cdata or other information[,]\u201d thereby clarifying that attorney theories and impressions are not discoverable.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">In sum, the 2010 Amendment to Rule 26 requires disclosure of \u201cmaterial of a factual nature\u201d considered by testifying experts, but not the \u201ctheories or mental impressions of counsel____\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Or, as one court aptly summarized, \u201c[t]he bright-line rule is no longer valid; attorneys\u2019 theories or mental impressions are protected, but everything else is fair game.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Thus, even after the 2010 Amendment, the scope of expert discovery contemplated by Rule 26 is still expansive. As the Advisory Committee Note to the 2010 Amendment clarifies, Rule 26 \u201crequire[s] disclosure of any material considered by [a] [testifying] expert, from whatever source, that contains factual ingredients.\u201d Moreover, the amended Rule 26 protects only the communications of counsel: \u201c[work-product] protection does not extend to [an] expert\u2019s <em>own </em>development of the opinions to be presented; those are subject to probing in deposition or at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Against this backdrop, I conclude that the 2010 Amendment to Rule 26 does not alter the considerations applicable to dual-capacity experts in any way pertinent to this dispute. The 2010 Amendment did not change the rules (or policies) applicable to <em>consulting </em>expert discovery: a party seeking discovery of facts known or opinions held by a consulting expert must still demonstrate exceptional need to overcome the federal policy of encouraging parties to seek, and enabling parties to obtain, competent consultation.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> And the District provides no basis to conclude that the 2010 Amendment\u2014which, in substance, merely clarifies that traditional work-product does not lose its protection merely because it is transmitted to a testifying expert\u2014should change this District\u2019s jurisprudence with respect to <em>factual </em>matters transmitted from a consulting expert to a testifying expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">As every court in this Circuit to consider the issue prior to the 2010 Amendments concluded, the policy considerations justifying the protections afforded to consulting experts do not apply when the consulting expert furnishes facts to a testifying expert who considers them in forming an opinion to be offered at trial.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Instead, the specific mandate of Rule 26(b)(4)(C)(ii)\u2014that a testifying expert must produce the \u201cfacts or data\u201d that she \u201cconsidered\u201d in forming her opinion\u2014controls, and any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of production, \u201clest the privilege interfere with the goal of the disclosure requirements, which is to allow an adversary to expose whatever weaknesses, unreliabilities, or biases might infect the opinions of testifying experts called by [an] adverse party.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Accordingly, I conclude that the 2010 Amendment alters the analysis of privilege for dual-capacity experts only when \u2018core\u2019 work <em>product\u2014e.g., </em>attorney theories and impressions\u2014is involved.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">PTO 76 rules that because there is an ambiguity as to whether Wheatcraft <em>created </em>the Spreadsheet in his capacity as a testifying expert or consulting expert, \u201cthe [Spreadsheet is not protected by the work product privilege, and [the District] must produce the document in its entirety.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark>. In light of the principles of law stated above, this holding is slightly inaccurate. The relevant question is not the \u201chat [that] [ ] Wheat-craft was wearing[] when he <em>created </em>the [Spreadsheet____\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Instead, the relevant question is whether Wheatcraft might have <em>considered </em>the Spreadsheet\u2014which qualifies as \u201cfacts or data\u201d for the purposes of Rule 26<footnotemark>60</footnotemark>\u2014in connection with his rebuttal testimony.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The record on review answers this question in the affirmative. I find no error in Special Master Warner\u2019s findings that: (1) Wheatcraft relied on the Spreadsheet at his deposition; (2) \u201cWheatcraft\u2019s reliance on the [Spreadsheet was consistent with his job as [the District\u2019s] testifying [rebuttal] expert[;]\u201d and (3) the Spreadsheet \u201cdirectly relates [to Wheatcraft\u2019s] rebuttal testimony, as it is comprised of organized excerpts from defendants\u2019 experts\u2019 reports.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> In light of these findings, I affirm PTO 76 on the ground that the Spreadsheet constitutes \u201cfacts or data\u201d under Rule 26, and any work-product and/or consulting expert privilege protecting the Spreadsheet was forfeited by virtue of Wheatcraft\u2019s consideration of it in forming his opinions in his capacity as a testifying expert.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">One final point bears note. The District fears that Defendants are engaged in a fishing expedition, and that PTO 76 \u201ceffectively forces the District to waive <em>all </em>of its attorney work product privileges with respect to undisclosed! ] consulting assistance provided by, .. Wheatcraft.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> These fears are unfounded. This Order merely holds that when a testifying expert considers factual information in forming an opinion that she intends to offer at trial, an unconditional claim of privilege cannot be maintained, regardless of whether the factual information came from a consulting expert. It does not impact the protections afforded to work generated by consulting experts in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The ruling of PTO 76 is affirmed.
