The case was tried to a jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and now comes before us on the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts. On August 2, 1938, \u201caround seven o\u2019clock in the evening,\u201d the plaintiff went to \u201cKenny &amp; McMurray\u2019s Delicatessen Store\u201d located on Main Street, in Woburn, for the purpose of buying a bottle of coca cola to drink. He had been in the habit of going there daily to get something to drink, and had bought coca cola there many times. In accordance with his \u201cusual practice . . . [he] put a nickel on the counter and reached into the container and . . . [[took] out a bottle of coca cola,\u201d and told Kenny that he was \u201ctaking\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\">The container was about four by two and a half feet and was made of sheet metal. \u201cThere were different kinds of beverages in the container with ice.\u201d The coca cola was \u201cchilled as usual.\u201d The plaintiff did not inspect the bottle when he took it out of the container. He \u201cwiped the water off the bottle and reached for the opener on the right side of the container. When he was within three or four inches of the opener, the bottle of coca cola which he was holding by the middle, exploded in his hand, breaking a little below the neck of the bottle.\u201d In consequence, his right index finger was cut. \u201cBefore the explosion he did not touch the cap of the bottle to the opener.\u201d In taking the bottle from the container the plaintiff \u201cdid not push it up against or touch the container.\u201d He \u201cdidn\u2019t take it carefully\u201d; it did not make any difference to him whether it to\u00fached anything or not. As he last left his testimony he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say\u201d that he knew whether the bottle hit \u201canother bottle or piece of tin\u201d when he lifted it from the container; but he was sure that he \u201cdid not strike the edge of the container.\u201d After the accident the bottle was in two or three pieces. \u201cThere was a cap on the neck of th\u00e9 bottle laying underneath the opener.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">One of the proprietors of the store (Kenny) testified that he sold coca cola which he bought from the coca cola company. At about the time of the accident he was buying ten or twenty cases a week. Each case contained twenty-four bottles. In the course of delivery the cases, which were laid in rows on the defendant\u2019s truck, were placed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the truck driver on top of one another in the back room, of the store. As they were needed the bottles were taken out of \u201cthe cage and put ... in the cooler.\u201d As he placed them in the cooler Kenny looked at them to see that they were \u201call right.\u201d When he put them in the container he handled them carefully, and when he was taking them out \u201che took them out easy.\u201d There were between \u201ctwo and three\u201d cases of bottles in the container. Kenny\u2019s partner probably \u201cfilled it last.\u201d Kenny had not touched the container on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">No citation of authorities is needed to support the familiar principle that ordinarily the mere happening of an accident is not evidence of negligence. The burden of proving that t\u00fce detendant was'neg\u00edige\u00f1t was upon the plaintiff, and the matter could not be left to surmise or conjecture. While the plaintiff was not bound to exclude every other possibility of cause for his injury, nevertheless he \u201cwas required tTrsfauW by evidence a greater likelihood that it was occasioned by some act of negligence on the partTof the diZend\u00e1nt for which iOTresponsible, rather than by a cause for\" which it~ is not liable. <em>Rocha v. Alber, </em>302 Mass. 155, 157, 158. <em>Mucha v. Northeastern Crushed Stone Co. Inc. </em>307 Mass. 592, 596. We are of opinion that the plaintiff did not sustain that burden and that therefore the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Other than the \u201cexplosion\u201d there was no evidence that would warrant the jury m finding that the bottle in question was not properly constructed! or that IE*\" was not\u201d an appropriate vessel for the purposes for which it was used when it was delivered to the proprietors of the store and thus had passed out of the management and control of the defendant. On the other hand, the jury would be required to find that the bottle had been placed in the cooler with ice and many other bottles, that it was wet when removed by the plaintiff, that the plaintiff did not remove it carefully, and that he would not say that while he was removing the bottle it did not \u201chit another bottle or piece of tin.\u201d In all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, we think it could not be found properly that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>had excluded certain other causes, such as that, after the bottle had gone out of the management and control of the defendant, a defect, such as a crack whicTT\"would weaken the bottle, arose while it was in the cooler in contact with ice~and other bottles. or. was caused by the negligence of the plaintiff in failing to remove it carefullvJrom _the cooler.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We are of opinion that as matter of law the jury would not be warranted in finding that it was more probable that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by an act for which the defendant is responsible than by the other causes disclosed by the evidence, for which it is not responsible. The plaintiff failed to present evidence sufficient to take the cause of his injury out of the realm of surmise and conjecture. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>225 Mass. 408. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Laurel Bottling Works, </em>111 Miss. 442. <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Seitz, </em>35 Misc.
