[1940], that day being Columbus Day, did keep open his shop in . . . Cambridge, between the hours of seven o\u2019clock ante meridian and one o\u2019clock post meridian, for the purpose of doing retail business therein.\u201d The defendant was found guilty. Upon appeal to the Superior Court the case was heard by a judge, sitting without a jury, on an agreed statement of facts, and the defendant was found guilty and sentenced. With the consent of the defendant the case was reported to this court for the decision of questions of law arising therein. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7 30. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>233 Mass. 535, 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 136, \u00a7 5 \u2014 herein referred to as the Lord\u2019s day statute \u2014 provides that \u201cWhoever on the Lord\u2019s day keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any manner of labor, business or work, except works of necessity and charity, shall be punished by a fine . . . .\u201d And G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 7, as finally amended by St. 1938, c. 245, so far as here material \u2014 herein referred to as the Columbus day statute \u2014 provides that \u201call laws, statutes, orders, decrees, rules and regulations regulating the keeping open of retail stores on the Lord\u2019s day shall be applicable to the keeping open of retail stores on October twelfth between the hours of seven o\u2019clock ante meridian and one o\u2019clock post meridian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">. Material facts appearing in the agreed statement of facts include the following: \u201cThe defendant, at the time of the complaint, was duly licensed by the licensing authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ties of the city of Cambridge as a tavern keeper within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 138, \u00a7 1, at 480 Cambridge Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, where defendant conducted his business. The premises were outfitted with a bar and booths and seats for the convenience of his customers, who were served either at the bar or while seated in the booths. Service of alcoholic beverages to customers of the defendant were made to be drunk on the premises only, and were served either as a \u2018mixed drink,\u2019 i.e., mixed with other ingredients or \u2018straight,\u2019 i.e., without dilution but with some other nonalcoholic beverage as a \u2018 chaser.\u2019 On Columbus Day, October 12, 1940, he was open to do business between the hours of eight o\u2019clock ante meridian and one o\u2019clock post meridian, as such tavern keeper, which are part of the usual hours for doing business by virtue of the defendant\u2019s license as a tavern keeper unless prohibited by the statute here drawn in issue .... At or about eight twenty ante meridian, Cambridge police officers entered the defendant\u2019s tavern and observed five men drinking at the bar and a sale being completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The facts agreed clearly warranted a finding that the defendant kept open his place of business, for the purpose of doing business therein, within the specified hours on Columbus day, 1940. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>2 Cush. 556; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>8 Gray, 384; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dextra, </em>143 Mass. 28, 31. The defendant contends, however, that his place of business was not a \u201cretail store\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 7, as amended. According to the agreed facts his place of business was a \u201ctavern.\u201d' He was duly licensed as a \u201ctavern keeper\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 138, \u00a7 1, as amended. See St. 1935, c. 253, \u00a7 1. \u201cTavern\u201d is therein defined as \u201can establishment where alcoholic beverages may be sold, as authorized by this chapter, with or without food, to be served to and drunk by patrons in plain view of other patrons, all entrances to which shall open directly from a public way.\u201d Said c. 138 is entitled \u201cAlcoholic Liquors.\u201d Section 12 thereof, as amended (see St. 1933, c. 376, \u00a7 2; St. 1934, c. 121, \u00a7 2; St. 1935, c. 253, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>St. 1936, c. 207, \u00a7 2; St. 1937, cc. 264, 331), provides under the subtitle \u201cSale of alcoholic beverages or wines and malt beverages to be drunk on the premises,\u201d among other things, for the granting of a license to a \u201ccommon victualler duly licensed ... to conduct a restaurant, an innholder duly licensed ... to conduct a hotel and a keeper of a tavern as defined by this chapter\u201d \u201cto sell to travelers, strangers and other patrons and customers not under twenty-one years of age, such beverages [\u2018all alcoholic beverages or only wines and malt beverages, as the case may be\u2019] to be served and drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The charge in the complaint is keeping open a \u201cshop\u201d as that word is used in the Lord\u2019s day statute, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 136, \u00a7 5 \u2014\u25a0 a statute that, so far as the use of the word \u201cshop\u201d is concerned, has not been changed in substance in many years. See Rev. Sts. c. 50, \u00a7 1; Gen. Sts. c. 84, \u00a7 1; Pub. Sts. c. 98, \u00a7 2; St. 1895, c. 434, \u00a7 2; R. L. c. 98, \u00a7 2. In these earlier statutes, as now, the phrase \u201cshop, warehouse or workhouse\u201d was used. Doubtless the word \u201cshop\u201d may have different meanings when used with different contexts. But in <em>Boston Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>137 Mass. 332, 336, where, however, the word \u201cshop\u201d was used in a different statute from the statute here involved, it was said: \u201c\u2018Shop,\u2019 in its popular as well as legal meaning, is not confined to a workshop. It is a word of various significance, and \u2018store\u2019 and \u2018workshop\u2019 are both included in it, and do not exhaust its meaning.\u201d And in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riggs, </em>14 Gray, 376, 378, where there was an indictment for larceny in a \u201cbuilding, called and being a shop,\u201d the court said that the building was \u201crightly denominated a shop,\u201d being a \u201cplace kept and used for the sale of goods.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Annis, </em>15 Gray, 197, 199, 201. Moreover, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>176 Mass. 5, 6, under the Lord\u2019s day statute then in effect, a defendant was charged with keeping open her shop on the Lord\u2019s day, and there was evidence that she, a licensed victualler, kept a restaurant open as a dining room, supplied meals to a large number of persons and sold cigars to some of them. (The sale of tobacco on the Lord\u2019s day by common victual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>lers was not then permitted.) The court assumed in favor of the defendant that a \u201croom kept open by a common victualler merely as a dining room is not a shop\u201d within the meaning of the statute, but said that if \u201cone of her purposes in keeping the place open was the sale of cigars she was guilty of the offence charged.\u201d Closer, however, to the present case are <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trickey, </em>13 Allen, 559, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>117 Mass. 142. In the former of these cases a conviction was sustained, under the Lord\u2019s day statute then in effect, for keeping open a \u201cshop\u201d where the evidence showed that the defendant\u2019s place of business was kept open for the sale of liquor. In the latter of these cases a conviction was sustained under that statute for keeping open a \u201cshop,\u201d the court saying that, under the instructions given to the jury, they must have found \u201cthat the defendant kept a liquor shop and bar room open for ordinary traffic with the public indiscriminately on the Lord\u2019s day,\u201d and that this \u201cwas clearly a violation of the Gen. Sts. c. 84, \u00a7 1 [the Lord\u2019s day statute then in effect], upon which the indictment is based.\u201d In the light of these cases it is clear upon the facts agreed that the defendant\u2019s tavern was a \u201cshop\u201d within the meaning of the Lord\u2019s day statute. Indeed, the defendant apparently makes no contention to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">But the defendant contends that his tavern was not within the description of \u201cretail stores\u201d in the Columbus day statute. Obviously the Columbus day statute is narrower in scope than the Lord\u2019s day statute, since the former statute incorporates the provisions of the latter statute only with respect to \u201cretail stores.\u201d The word \u201cshop,\u201d as already pointed out, may include places of business that are not \u201cretail stores\u201d or even \u201cstores.\u201d Some doubt as to the meaning of the word \u201cstore\u201d was suggested in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>M\u2019Monagle, </em>1 Mass. 517. But in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>131 Mass. 419, 421, where the defendant was charged with breaking and entering \u201ca certain building, to wit . . . [a] store,\u201d and the evidence showed that in the building in question there were dining rooms in which meals were served but in one of them there was a bar, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>that lager beer and cigars were kept and sold, it was said that \u201ca place in which merchandise was kept for sale\u201d \u201cis one of the common significations of the word \u2018store\u2019 in this country.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Annis, </em>15 Gray, 197, 199, 201. And in <em>Boston Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>137 Mass. 332, 335, it was said, with reference to the use of the word \u201cstore\u201d in a tax statute, that the \u201cword \u2018store,\u2019 as applied to a building and used in the statute, is intended to designate a place where traffic is carried on in goods, wares, or merchandise.\u201d We think that the word \u201cstores\u201d in the phrase \u201cretail stores\u201d in the Columbus day statute was used with this meaning. The Columbus day statute, however, is further limited to \u201cretail stores.\u201d The word \u201cretail\u201d imports primarily that the sale or traffic in goods, wares or merchandise carried on in such \u201cstores\u201d shall be in small quantities. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>205 Mass. 124, and cases cited. <em>Petros </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Buildings of Lynn, </em>306 Mass. 368, 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">On the facts agreed the defendant\u2019s tavern was not only a \u201cshop\u201d within the meaning of the Lord\u2019s day statute, but was also a \u201cretail store\u201d within the meaning of the Columbus day statute, as above interpreted, so that the provisions of the Lord\u2019s day statute, extended to Columbus day with respect to \u201cretail stores,\u201d were applicable to the defendant\u2019s tavern. Alcoholic beverages, notwithstanding their nature and the statutory limitations upon the sale thereof, are \u201cmerchandise\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in the cases interpreting the word \u201cstore.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>131 Mass. 419; <em>New England &amp; Savannah Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Mass. 385, 391; <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 Fed. 649, 653. And the business carried on by the defendant at his tavern obviously was \u201cretail\u201d in its nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The defendant contends, however, that in serving patrons at his tavern he was not <em>selling </em>alcoholic beverages in such a sense as to constitute his tavern a \u201cstore\u201d for the sale of or traffic in merchandise. He argues the analogy of a tavern to a restaurant, with respect to which it has been suggested that the restaurant keeper does not <em>sell </em>the food but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\"the charge made is not for the food alone, but includes the service rendered and the providing of a place in which to eat.\u201d This suggestion was made in <em>Friend </em>v. <em>Childs Dining Hall Co. </em>231 Mass. 65, 70, 77-79, a case relied on by the defendant. The suggestion, however, was not the ground of the decision of the case, though the result of the case would have been the same if the suggestion had been followed. But it was said in that case, with respect to a transaction between a restaurant keeper and a patron of the restaurant, that there \"is strong ground for holding that the contract made between one who keeps a restaurant and one who resorts there for food to be served and eaten on the premises is a sale of food,\u201d and, after citing decisions including <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>126 Mass. 256, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>160 Mass. 533, that in \"view of these decisions it would be difficult for this court to hold that the transaction arising from a contract to serve to a guest food to be eaten by him upon the premises of the keeper of an eating house, is not a sale.\u201d Pages 68-69. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>126 Mass. 256, 257, arose upon a complaint for keeping and maintaining a \"dwelling-house . . . used for the illegal sale and illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors,\u201d and there was evidence that people resorted to the defendant\u2019s dwelling house and there were served with meals and as a part thereof intoxicating liquor was provided. The court said that, if \"the meal included intoxicating liquors, the purchase of the meal would be a purchase of the liquors.\u201d The strong intimation in the <em>Friend </em>case that the transaction between a restaurant keeper and a patron of his restaurant constituted a \"sale\u201d has been established as the law by later decisions. Indeed, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Gerrish, </em>256 Mass. 183, 186, it was said to have been settled in this Commonwealth by the <em>Friend </em>case that \u201cthe service of food for immediate consumption on the premises is a sale.\u201d And it was said in <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Union News Co. </em>295 Mass. 350, 353, with respect to such a transaction that \u201cthere is now no doubt, under our decisions, that the transaction amounted to a sale covered by the sales act, at least as to the food actually consumed.\u201d (This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>case arose under the sales act, but the statement there made as to the nature of the transaction is not to be considered as limited to transactions within that act.) See also <em>Merrymount Co. </em>v. <em>Edwardes, </em>263 Mass. 282, 284; <em>Liggett Drug Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>License Commissioners of North Adams, </em>296 Mass. 41, 49, 51. The defendant, therefore, is not aided by any analogy of a tavern to a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On the contrary, the decisions relating to the serving of food at a restaurant for immediate consumption support the conclusion that the serving of an alcoholic beverage at a tavern to be drunk on the premises constitutes a sale of such alcoholic beverage. And this conclusion is in accord with the language of the statute relating to alcoholic beverages. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 138, as amended. A \u201ckeeper of a tavern,\u201d as the word \u201ctavern\u201d is defined in the statute, is licensed to \u201csell\u201d such alcoholic beverages, according to the express language of the statute, to be \u201cserved and drunk,\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 138, \u00a7 12, as amended, under a subtitle of the statute, \u201cSale of alcoholic beverages . . . to be drunk on the premises.\u201d And a \u201ctavern,\u201d as so defined, is \u201can establishment where alcoholic beverages may be sold.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 138, \u00a7 1, as amended. Clearly the statute treats the transaction between a tavern keeper and a patron as a \u201csale.\u201d The fact that the alcoholic beverage is to be drunk on the premises does not preclude the transaction from being a \u201csale,\u201d any more than does the fact that food served at a restaurant is to be consumed on the premises prevent such a transaction from being a \u201csale.\u201d It is not the less a \u201csale\u201d because a place is provided where the alcoholic beverage is to be drunk, nor because of the fact that the alcoholic beverage sold may be a \u201cmixed drink,\u201d or, if \u201cstraight,\u201d may be served with a \u201cchaser.\u201d In this respect the transaction is analogous to the service of food at a restaurant to be consumed on the premises. The accommodations provided and the service rendered are incidents of the \u201csale.\u201d See <em>Petros </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Buildings of Lynn, </em>306 Mass. 368, 371-372. Obviously such a \u201csale\u201d is at retail.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Doubtless not every \u201csale\u201d of an alcoholic beverage at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>retail would constitute the place at which such \u201csale\u201d was made a \u201cretail store.\u201d It may well be that there are places at which sales of alcoholic beverages at retail may be made legally which, by reason of other characteristics, are not \u201cretail stores\u201d within the meaning of these words as used in the Columbus day statute. We are not required in this case to determine generally the scope of the words. But there is nothing in the nature of a \u201ctavern\u201d as defined in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 138, \u00a7 1, in its amended form, that excludes a \u201ctavern\u201d from the category of \u201cretail stores.\u201d By definition a \u201ctavern\u201d is \u201can establishment where alcoholic beverages may be sold\u201d under the authority of a license to the tavern keeper to \u201csell\u201d such beverages to be served and drunk. The dominant purpose of a \u201ctavern\u201d is the selling of a kind of merchandise \u2014 alcoholic beverages\u2014 at retail. Such a place of business is a \u201cshop\u201d within the decisions of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trickey, </em>13 Allen, 559, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>117 Mass. 142, and a \u201cstore\u201d within the decision of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>131 Mass. 419, 421, in each of which cases a place where alcoholic beverages were sold was involved. We perceive no reason in the apparent purpose of the Columbus day statute for excluding a'' tavern \u2019 \u2019 from its application. Moreover, the governing statute, of course, is not modified by the regulations of the alcoholic beverages control commission referred to in the statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
