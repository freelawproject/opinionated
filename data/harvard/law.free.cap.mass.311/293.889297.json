There was a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s only exception is to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict, and the sole question raised is whether the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 260, \u00a7 2, First, which provides, among other things, that actions of contract founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>upon contracts or liabilities, express or implied, shall, except as otherwise provided, be commenced only within six years next after the cause of action accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">There was evidence that the plaintiff rendered the services to the testatrix upon her promise that if the plaintiff would come to live with her, she would \u201cwill the place there\u201d to the plaintiff and her husband \u201cas long as . . . [they] lived\u201d; that in December, 1931, or January, 1932, the testatrix requested the plaintiff to leave; and that the \u201cseverance of relations as far as the house was concerned was February 1, 1932, and that, so far as performance of household duties for which she was now making claim, she severed her relations on February 1, 1932, at the same time as she moved out.\u201d The testatrix died on December 11, 1936, and the defendant was appointed administrator with the will annexed and gave bond on May 6, 1937. The plaintiff\u2019s action was commenced by writ dated March 15, 1938. It was agreed that the testatrix did not will the house where she lived to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">It is unnecessary to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action (see <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>303 Mass. 16, 23) arose on February 1, 1932, or on December 11, 1936, when the testatrix died. See <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>114 Mass. 530; <em>Tirrell </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>244 Mass. 200, 203. Compare <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>133 Mass. 74; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Slate, </em>184 Mass. 317. The defendant contends, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was \u201ccomplete on February 1, 1932,\u201d and that inasmuch as her writ was not brought until March 15, 1938, the statute of limitations, which was pleaded, was a bar to recovery. This last contention cannot be sustained. The plaintiff\u2019s right of action survived the death of the testatrix. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 228, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1934, c. 300, \u00a7 1. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 260, \u00a7 10, provides, among other things, that if a person liable to any action \u201cbefore mentioned dies before the expiration of the time hereinbefore limited\u201d (see \u00a7 2 of said c. 260), and the cause of action by law survives, the action may be commenced against the executor or administrator in accordance with the limitations provided by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>relative to the limitation of actions against the executor or administrator by creditors of the deceased. Section 9 of said c. 197, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 221, \u00a7 4, in so far as applicable to the case at bar, gave the plaintiff one year from the time the defendant gave his bond within which to bring her action. It follows that the plaintiff\u2019s action was seasonably brought. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Mixter, </em>5 Allen, 27, 28. <em>Boston &amp; Boxbury Mill Corp. </em>v. <em>Tyndale, </em>218 Mass. 425, 429. See <em>Converse </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>146 Mass. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
