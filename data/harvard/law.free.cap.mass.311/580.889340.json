The bill is not based upon infringement of copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">The cause was referred to a master to \u201cfind the facts upon the question of liability of the defendants or either of them\u201d and \u201cupon such determination\u201d to file his report and to await the further order of the court. The defendants appealed from an interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report and thereafter moved for a final decree dismissing the bill and appealed from an interlocutory decree denying the motion. Thereupon the judge signed a report to this court reciting that the master had heard the case on the question of liability only; that at the hearing before the judge of the defendants\u2019 motion for a final decree dismissing the bill all parties agreed that \u201cthe question of liability should be finally determined at this stage of the proceedings\u201d; that he had denied the motion; and that, being of opinion that his ruling so affected the merits of the controversy that the accuracy thereof should be determined before further proceedings were had, at the request of the defendants he stayed all further proceedings except such as might be necessary to preserve the rights of the parties and reported \u201cthe question of law presented by . . . [his] said ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">On this record neither appeal is properly before us. Under the present practice appeals from interlocutory decrees cannot be entered here until after final decree in the Superior Court. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>291 Mass. 383, 387. <em>Leffler </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>308 Mass. 243, 245. See <em>McCracken's Case, </em>251 Mass. 347, 350. This seems an almost necessary consequence of statutory provisions now embodied in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135, introducing rigid requirements as to the time of each step in perfecting an appeal. See St. 1929, c. 265, \u00a7 1, and its amendment by St. 1931, c. 219; <em>Niosi </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>Leveroni, </em>274 Mass. 115. If this were not so, as the statute now reads every interlocutory appeal would have to be fully completed and the papers printed and entered in this court, unless \u201cfor cause shown after hearing\u201d the trial court should extend the time, no matter how inconsequential the subject of the appeal might become in the subsequent course of the litigation. A construction of the statute that would produce such a result would be hard to reconcile with the wording of the present c. 231, \u00a7 135, would cause unnecessary expense to litigants, and is not to be adopted. The rule of practice existing before the statute of 1931 seems to have differed somewhat from the present rule as here stated, and statements appropriate to the former rule have been repeated in some of the cases since the passage of that statute. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>165 Mass. 1. <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>212 Mass. 118, 120. <em>Romanausky </em>y. <em>Skutulas, </em>258 Mass. 190, 192. <em>Siciliano </em>v. <em>Barbuto, </em>265 Mass. 390, 393, 394. <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>273 Mass. 109, 110. <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Bragg, </em>300 Mass. 298, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\">When this record was entered here the case was not ripe for final decree in the Superior Court because the judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motion that a decree be entered dismissing the bill, as long as it stood unchanged, left the case open for further proceedings in that court. But the recitals in the report show that with the consent of all parties the judge treated the defendants\u2019 motion as raising the question whether on the master\u2019s report as it stood the plaintiffs had made out a case entitling them to an accounting for profits or an assessment of damages. The reference to the master had been limited with a view to raising this question before entering upon a possibly lengthy hearing as to profits or damages or both. We think that the judge could report this question under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 30, as a question arising upon the making of an interlocutory decree, and that the case is properly here on the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The plaintiffs had formerly been associated together in writing and producing musical comedy revues. In March, 1924, they copyrighted a short skit under the title \u201cMillion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Dollar Legs.\u201d The full text of this skit fills only about four pages of the printed record. It took about fifteen minutes to play. The central idea or \u201cpunch\u201d consists in the partial disclosure on the stage of a pair of shapely legs which are supposed to be those of a female artist\u2019s model but which at the end of the skit are suddenly revealed to be the legs of a man. The words \u201cmillion dollar legs\u201d occur three times in the dialogue. People who saw the skit would associate those kprds with it. The idea was novel and was well received by the public. The skit was used from March, 1924, until April, 1925, as one of the numbers of a revue produced by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had approximately twenty-one different revues, each with a different title. Each revue contained from five to seven scenes and lasted about an hour. During most of the period from March, 1924, until April, 1925, the skit was played as one of the numbers of the revue entitled \u201cStep Lively.\u201d In the latter part of the period it was played as one of the numbers of the revue \u201cKeep Moving.\u201d \u201cIn the nineteen twenties it was usual to have a show consist of variety act, news reel and one big picture.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 advertising matter emphasized their own names, describing them as \u201cTip Top Merrymakers,\u201d and often included the names of the revues to be played, but in their advertising no reference was made to the skit \u201cMillion Dollar Legs.\u201d So far as appears the title of the skit was brought to the attention of the public only \u201cby programs or by announcement through a master of ceremonies.\u201d Programs were used \u201cin many of the theatres\u201d \u2014 how many does not appear. Where the show was \u201csold outright\u201d no programs were used. In some of the theatres where no programs were used \u2014 how many does not appear \u2014 an announcer \u201cinformed the audience about the various acts.\u201d In this way between March, 1924, and April, 1925, the skit was exhibited as one number in a revue three times a day on one hundred twenty-nine days to a total of approximately three hundred twenty-two thousand five hundred people in about forty cities and towns in Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine, and in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Moncton, New Brunswick. Most of the presentations were in the smaller cities and towns, although Philadelphia, Boston, Worcester, and Springfield were included. Usually the skit was exhibited in motion picture theatres. From April, 1925, until August 8, 1939, when this suit was brought, the plaintiffs \u201cdid nothing by way of exhibition or otherwise to inform the public of the existence of the playlet 'Million Dollar Legs/ and there was no evidence that others exhibited it to the public.\u201d The plaintiffs have not engaged together in the production or exhibition of shows since 1926. Coleman continued in business until 1929, and apparently neither of the plaintiffs was in the show business when this suit was brought. In the early spring of 1939, however, the plaintiffs \u201cwere considering the advisability\u201d of producing a comedy to last from two to two and a half hours to be built around the skit and to be called by the same name. This plan was abandoned when the plaintiffs heard of the defendants\u2019 1939 picture of the same name hereinafter referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">In 1932, and again in 1939, the defendant Paramount Pictures, Inc., produced, and the other defendants were concerned in distributing, a motion picture named \u201cMillion Dollar Legs.\u201d An officer of Paramount \u201cthought up\u201d the title for the first picture without knowledge of its previous use. Neither picture bore any resemblance to the plaintiffs\u2019 skit or made any use of the plaintiffs\u2019 idea. The 1932 picture featured the Olympic games, then being held, and showed runners at the games. The 1939 picture included a horse race. The master characterizes the name as a misnomer as applied to either picture and finds that it was adopted only because it had \u201cbox office appeal.\u201d Two attorneys employed in behalf of Paramount reported in 1932 and again in 1939 that a search revealed the plaintiffs\u2019 copyright, but that they found no evidence that the plaintiffs\u2019 skit had been exhibited to the public, and that the title was available for use. Paramount knew, however, that the search might not disclose \u201clocalized productions,\u201d and knew that it was \u201ctaking a risk.\u201d An investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>would have disclosed that the plaintiffs were well known in theatrical circles in New York and Boston, but for \u201cbusiness reasons\u201d Paramount intentionally omitted to make contact with them. The 1932 picture was exhibited in six thousand five hundred twenty-eight theatres throughout the United States and Canada over a period of several years, including seventy-three theatres in metropolitan Boston, and was exhibited in twenty-four foreign countries. It was reviewed in several magazines of national distribution. Except for' the identity of title the master finds no evidence that any of the advertising or publicity given this picture \u201cwas such as to lead any of the general public who might have seen the complainants\u2019 skit in 1924-1925 to believe that the picture was based upon, or in any way related to, the skit.\u201d The plaintiffs, who lived in Boston, \u201chad little or no interest in motion pictures\u201d and were not aware of the production of the 1932 picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\">The 1939 picture had, up to the time of the hearings before the master, been exhibited in seven thousand nine hundred ninety-five theatres in the United States, including the territory in which the plaintiffs\u2019 skit had been exhibited fourteen years before. The plaintiffs learned in May, 1939, that Paramount was planning to produce a motion picture entitled \u201cMillion Dollar Legs,\u201d but delayed action \u201cin good faith\u201d to ascertain whether the picture would actually be produced and released under that title. Paramount copyrighted this picture under the name \u201cMillion Dollar Legs\u201d on July 14, 1939, and released it to the public on the same day. Under date of July 17 counsel for the plaintiffs notified the defendants by letter of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Paramount had incurred a substantial expense for production and advertising, and the defendants continued to exhibit the picture. The master reports a single instance in which an actor entered a theatre in the belief that the defendants\u2019 1939 picture was connected with the plaintiffs\u2019 skit, but reports that this was the only direct evidence of confusion and that the actor would be more likely to recall the skit and its title than would an ordinary member of the public. The master found, as a conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>from the facts hereinbefore stated, that during the period while the plaintiffs\u2019 skit was being used from March, 1924, until April, 1925, their title \u201cMillion Dollar Legs\u201d acquired and retained a secondary meaning, so that it became \u201cassociated and identified\u201d with the plaintiffs\u2019 skit in the localities where it was shown, and that this continued, \u201cnot particularly affected by lapse of time\u201d until Paramount produced its pictures in 1932 and in 1939. He also found (not stated as a conclusion from other findings) that by reason of the extensive exhibition of Paramount\u2019s 1932 picture, the title \u201cMillion Dollar Legs\u201d acquired a secondary meaning as associated with that picture, so that the title had two secondary meanings which were \u201cparallel and coexistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\">Much of the argument has been devoted to the question whether the master\u2019s subsidiary findings support his conclusion resting solely upon them that the words \u201cMillion Dollar Legs\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning as indicating to the public the plaintiffs\u2019 skit. We prefer to approach the case from a slightly different angle and to decide it upon the realities as disclosed by the subsidiary findings rather than to run the risk of overemphasis upon a formula of words more closely appropriate to the branding of merchandise than to the entitling of a book, playlet or skit. Upon the subsidiary findings we are convinced that the plaintiffs have failed to prove any appreciable interference with any substantial property right which they possessed by reason of either of the defendants\u2019 motion pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Of course those of the plaintiffs\u2019 patrons who saw the name of the skit on a program or heard it announced by an announcer would for the time being associate the name with the skit. A few might remember the name for a while. But in <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Keith Massachusetts Corp. </em>309 Mass. 185, at page 186, a case in many respects strikingly similar to the present case, we held, with citation of the authorities, that \u201cWhether a book or play is copyrighted or not, neither the author nor the proprietor has any property right in the title entitling him to the exclusive use of it.\u201d The defendants did not plagiarize the plaintiffs\u2019 work or pirate any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>their ideas. The defendants merely conceived and used the same title for productions entirely different from any the plaintiffs had put out. The defendants did not deceive the public into the belief that they were to see the plaintiffs\u2019 skit or that they were seeing motion pictures produced by the plaintiffs or derived from the plaintiffs\u2019 production. \u201cMillion Dollar Legs\u201d had never been employed or advertised by the plaintiffs as the title of their performance. They had advertised other titles for their performance as a whole and for their various revues. When they brought this name to the attention of the public at all it was only as designating a single act in a variety show of the type which prevailed in the nineteen twenties before the talking pictures were generally adopted. This use of the name resembled the heading of a chapter in a book rather than the title of the book itself. It seems to us to have been casual and unlikely to make a permanent impression upon many people. Such publicity as the name acquired in this way was like the \u201cfugitive publicity\u201d of a magazine to which reference is made in <em>International Film Service Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Producers, Inc. </em>273 Fed. 585, 587. In the absence of further findings the single instance of the actor must be regarded as exceptional. The defendants did not appropriate to themselves advertising, reputation, or good will belonging to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs\u2019 skit had never been advertised by name outside the theatre and had not been shown for seven years when the defendants\u2019 1932 picture came out. Fourteen years had elapsed when their 1939 picture came out. It does not appear that the defendants did anything to injure the reputation of the plaintiffs or of their product. The defendants are not shown to have made profit by using anything of value belonging to the plaintiffs or to have caused the plaintiffs loss. We do not find here present any of the recognized elements of so called unfair competition. <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Keith Massachusetts Corp. </em>309 Mass. 185. <em>Manners </em>v. <em>Triangle Film Corp. </em>247 Fed. 301. <em>Beech-Nut Packing Co. </em>v. <em>P.
