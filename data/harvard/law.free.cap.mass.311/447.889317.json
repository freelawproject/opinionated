Blair. The defendant waived her right to a trial by jury, and the trial proceeded before the Chief Justice of the Superior Court, subject to the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, inclusive. The defendant was found guilty on this count, and not guilty on the two other counts in the indictment. We consider the assignments of error of the defendant that have been argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">One assignment is to the denial of the request that upon all the evidence the defendant is entitled to a finding of not guilty. Under the indictment, the defendant could be found guilty of larceny at common law, of larceny by a false pretence, or of embezzlement, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 266, \u00a7 30, depending upon the state of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>184 Mass. 320, 324. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>202 Mass. 379, 387-389.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">There was evidence that the complainant, Mrs. Blair, first met the defendant in February, 1938, when she was brought to Mrs. Blair\u2019s house by a Mrs. Wheeler, a friend of Mrs. Blair. On that occasion Mrs. Wheeler said that the defendant had a very large account with a brokerage concern in Boston and that she had invested a great deal of money with her; that the defendant had had phenomenal \u2022success in the stock market over a period of years, and she asked Mrs. Blair why she did not give the defendant some money to invest for her in the stock market. The defendant asked Mrs. Blair if she would like to invest some money with her and said that she had a very large account with the brokerage concern that had been named by Mrs. Wheeler. Nothing was decided upon at this time. In March, Mrs. Blair received a letter from the defendant in which the latter \"recalled\u201d that she had suggested that Mrs. Blair give her some money to invest for her in the stock market, and asked that she destroy the letter because the defendant was not a broker and had no right to invest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>for her, but that she was going to do it in a friendly way. Thereafter, the defendant called Mrs. Blair on the telephone once or twice and asked her if she had decided to give her money to invest for her, and Mrs. Blair told her that she had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In April, 1938, Mrs. Wheeler, Mrs. Blair and the defendant met again and the defendant asked Mrs. Blair if she was ready to give \u201cher the money to invest for . . . [Mrs. Blair]\u201d and suggested $1,200, saying that Mrs. Blair could get a loan at the bank. Mrs. Blair told her that she would get the loan and the defendant said she was very glad of this because she knew she could get money for her; that she could make money for her. The defendant said that she had a \u201cvery, very large account\u201d and that all her stocks were \u201chigh-grade . . . American Telephone &amp; Telegraph; American Tobacco; Eastman Kodak; United States Steel.\u201d Mrs. Blair went to the bank and obtained a loan of $1,200, the proceeds of which were $1,183.50, and returned to the defendant, who then told her that she would never regret giving her the money \u201cfor investment,\u201d and that during her absence she had called up the brokerage concern and ordered fifty shares of United States Steel, adding, \u201cSo we are already started ... in this investment plan.\u201d She also said that she was going to buy sixteen shares of Eastman Kodak stock for Mrs. Blair; that the brokerage concern had given her a desk in their office because her account was so large; that she was going to invest in \u201cgilt-edged\u201d securities and was going to deliver them to her; .and that this was a friendly transaction because she was not a broker and had \u201cno right to take money to invest.\u201d Mrs. Blair gave the defendant the check that she had received from the bank, and the defendant signed and gave her the following writing: \u201cApril 27, 1938. Received of Eunice Blair twelve hundred dollars to be used in stock market. I agree to pay back 1200 plus 16 shares Eastman Kodak. Final transaction completed Monday, June 6th, 1938, and transfers made and account closed. This was a friendly transaction.\u201d On June 21, 1938, the defendant signed and gave Mrs. Blair the following writing: \u201cReceived of Mrs. Blair, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>$45, toward transfer and taxes on securities. (Signed) Helen Leland. June 21, 1938.\u201d Mrs. Blair never received any stocks of any kind from or through the defendant, and up to June 6, 1938, she received no money from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Sometime in May the defendant told Mrs. Blair that she was getting along \u201cfine\u201d with Mrs. Blair\u2019s account. In June, 1939, Mrs. Blair and her daughter met the defendant, and Mrs. Blair told her that she had found out that the defendant had been \u201cblacklisted\u201d in all brokerage houses in Boston. The defendant said that this was not true. Mrs. Blair told her that it had been a long time since she had promised her the stock and asked where it was, and the defendant replied: \u201cIt is coming, but I have been held up, one thing after another has happened, but you are surely going to get it, but things have been slow.\u201d In August, 1940, Mrs. Blair telephoned the defendant that she wanted her to come to her home as she wished to talk with her, whereupon the defendant said: \u201cYou won\u2019t have anyone there, will you?\u201d and Mrs. Blair said: \u201cOh, no.\u201d Mrs. Blair told the defendant that she had waited a long time for the stock and that she had decided that, if the stocks were not delivered to her, she was going to the district attorney. The defendant seemed very much perturbed and said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that. . . . You don\u2019t know what it feels like to walk down the street expecting any moment to have some one touch you on the shoulder. ... If you will give me ... a little more time, I will have your stock.\u201d Mrs. Blair went to the police in December, 1940. In the meantime the defendant had given her $30, and, thereafter, $72.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">On cross-examination Mrs. Blair testified that on April 27, 1938, when the three women were at lunch, she had practically made up her mind to let the defendant have the money as soon as she found out how much it would take; that she had decided to wait until she had talked with her and that when the defendant mentioned $1,200, she then decided to let her have the money; that she asked the defendant what she was going to invest in and was told that she always invested in \u201chigh-grade\u201d stocks and was going to get her sixteen shares of Eastman Kodak; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>she was going to buy and sell stock in the meantime; that she was a \u201ctrader\u201d; that she was to deliver these sixteen shares of Eastman Kodak stock on June 6; that the writing that the defendant gave her stated her agreement with the defendant; that she understood that the defendant gave- her this \u201cmemorandum\u201d acknowledging $1,200 and that she was going to return that and sixteen shares of Eastman Kodak stock by June 6; that she was going to get the shares with the money and with buying and selling stock; and that the money was to be used by the defendant in trading back and forth in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">There was other evidence that in June, 1939, the defendant stated in Mrs. Blair\u2019s presence that she was trading for her and investing money for her in stocks, and that the stocks \u201cwould be on their way\u201d; that eventually all the stock would come through to her satisfaction, and that the stock was coming.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">There was other evidence that in June, 1941, after Mrs. Blair had seen the police, the defendant telephoned to one of the probation officers in Boston and stated that she had been making \u201crestitution\u201d to the two people involved, including Mrs. Blair. The defendant was interviewed by the police in December, 1940, to whom she stated that she never received $1,183.50 from Mrs. Blair; that she was not in the stock \u201cbusiness\u201d and had not bought or sold \"stock since 1933; and that she was not supposed to buy any stock and never received the money. When asked about another transaction with Mrs. Blair involving $200, she said that that was a loan. When asked what she would say if she was shown the receipt or writing of April 27, 1938, she said: \u201cHave you got that?\u201d When informed that they had, she added: \u201cI won\u2019t answer any more questions.\u201d At the close of the interview she was asked if she was positive that she did not receive $1,183 from Mrs. Blair and said: \u201cI am positive.\u201d When asked again about the receipt, she added: \u201cI have nothing more to say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In this state of the evidence we are of opinion that there was no error in the denial of the request that upon all the evidence the defendant is entitled to a finding of not guilty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>It is to be observed that in the consideration of this assignment of error this court is not concerned with the specific aspect of the crime of larceny of which the defendant was found guilty. On the contrary, the request presents the question whether the defendant could be found guilty at all. It could have been found that the transaction, in so far as the defendant was concerned, was a fraud from start to finish. In fact, the judge found \u201cupon all the evidence,\u201d that the defendant did not intend, at the time the money was delivered to her, to repay it. It could have been found that Mrs. Blair intended to part merely with the possession of the money, not with her title or ownership. Upon all the evidence, it could have been found that the defendant was guilty of larceny at common law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>124 Mass. 325, 327. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lannan, </em>153 Mass. 287, 289. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>167 Mass. 460, 463. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>202 Mass. 379, 392, 393. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pappathanous, </em>257 Mass. 459, 464. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glassman, </em>253 Mass. 65, 71-73. We are also of opinion that the evidence warranted a finding of guilty of larceny by false pretence. It could have been found that the defendant obtained Mrs. Blair\u2019s money by false pretence as to her intention concerning its use, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Althause, </em>207 Mass. 32, 47, 48; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>289 Mass. 530, 546-547, and cases cited; <em>Schleifer </em>v. <em>Worcester North Savings Institution, </em>306 Mass.0 226, 228, 230, and by other false representations of fact upon which Mrs. Blair relied to her damage. Inasmuch as the evidence warranted these findings, it is unnecessary to determine, in dealing with this specific assignment of error, whether the defendant could have been found guilty of embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The next assignment of error is to the refusal of the judge to rule, as matter of law, that the transaction of April 28, 1938, was a loan. In support of this contention the defendant stresses the importance of the writing dated April 27, 1938, hereinbefore set out. She contends that this was the agreement, and, in fact, there is evidence that Mrs. Blair said that it was. The defendant contends that the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ment, in effect, was one by the terms of which she was to pay interest on a loan. Her contention appears to be based upon the theory that the Commonwealth was bound by Mrs. Blair\u2019s testimony. It is true that the evidence of the relationship between the defendant and Mrs. Blair depends upon the latter\u2019s testimony. But it was for the judge to determine what part, or parts, were to be accepted as true. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>277 Mass. 27, 28. <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>309 Mass. 205, 206-207. Moreover, if Mrs. Blair\u2019s testimony as to her understanding of the force and effect of the writing be put to one side, it cannot be said that there was no other evidence in the case to support the judge\u2019s finding that the transaction was not a loan. It is unnecessary to repeat the evidence already recited, although reference is made to the fact that in the writing in question the statement appears that the $1,200 was received by the defendant \u201cto be used\u201d in the stock market. The contention of the defendant has not been overlooked that the agreement between Mrs. Blair and her was that she was paying interest for the use of the money in the nature of a bonus, the interest being the difference between the amount of the check that was given the defendant and $1,200, plus sixteen shares of Eastman Kodak. The judge was not required to take this view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The defendant states in her brief that the issue whether the transaction was a loan is also raised by other assignments of error. All of these assignments are to the refusal of requests for rulings that are based upon the premises that her agreement was to repay the money within a fixed time or to repay a loan at a future date with a stock bonus for the accommodation. The judge, however, in dealing with these requests, found that the money was not delivered to the defendant upon an agreement to repay the same, that the relationship of debtor and creditor did not exist between the defendant and Mrs. Blair, and that Mrs. Blair did not bargain for a contract to repay a loan with a stock bonus \u201cfor the accommodation.\u201d From what has already been said, we think these findings were warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>by the evidence and that there was no error in the manner in which the judge dealt with these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">Error is assigned in the denial of the request for a ruling that, upon all the evidence, the transaction created a relationship of debt, and not of trust. In denying this request the judge stated that he found as a fact that the defendant did not intend, at the time the money was delivered to her, to repay the same; that the transaction did not create the \u201crelationship of debt between the parties, but that on the contrary [it] created one of trust.\u201d It could have been found that Mrs. Blair gave the defendant her money for the general purpose of investing it for her, not wholly for the purpose of buying specific securities (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Anthony, 306 Mass. 470, 476, 477), but upon her reliance upon the defendant\u2019s false representation that it was her intention to use the money for this general purpose. In this connection, however, it is to be observed that the writing that the defendant gave Mrs. Blair related, in part, specifically to sixteen shares of Eastman Kodak stock, and we think it could have been found that at least the money was delivered for the specific purpose of purchasing these shares. We think that, upon all the evidence, it could have been found that legal title to the money was vested in the defendant as trustee, and that she was to exercise dominion over at least a part of it in determining the kind of investments that were to be made. Compare <em>Millett </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>285 Mass. 87, 89. The true relationship between the parties to the arrangement is to be ascertained from all the evidence. Apart from the undertaking relative to the sixteen shares of Eastman Kodak stock, it could have been found that the defendant was to be free from any interference or control by Mrs. Blair, except for wrongdoing, and that if she had honestly received the money upon a trust, express or implied, her possession would have been rightful. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>124 Mass. 325, 327; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>187 Mass. 581, 584. The defendant contends that the relationship between Mrs. Blair and her was of a business character, and not fiduciary, and that the case comes within the purview of <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Luce, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>310 Mass. 789. But the facts in that case distinguish it from the case at bar. The judge found that the transaction was not a loan and that no debt was created, and further, that when the defendant received the money she did not intend to repay it, and that she made false representations to Mrs. Blair with the intent to deceive and defraud her; and, accordingly, we think there was no error in the manner in which the request now under consideration was dealt with by him. We think it could have been found that the entire transaction, so far as the defendant was concerned, was permeated with fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The remaining assignments of error relate to the manner in which the judge dealt with two requests as to the effect of any misrepresentations that may have been made after Mrs. Blair \u201chad made up her mind\u201d or \u201chad fully determined\u201d to turn over or pay the money in question to the defendant, and also that these representations, as matter of law, did not warrant the conviction of the defendant of larceny by obtaining money by false pretences. The judge allowed the request relating to any representation made after Mrs. Blair \u201chad made up her mind,\u201d with the qualification that it was applicable if Mrs. Blair\u2019s mental process had reached a point that did not admit of a further change. The other request, relating to a representation made after Mrs. Blair \u201chad fully\u201d determined to pay over the money to the defendant, was denied, not for the reason that it was not a correct statement of law, but for the reason that when the representation was made, she had not so fully determined. Here again the defendant apparently relies upon the proposition that the Commonwealth is bound by some parts of Mrs. Blair\u2019s testimony. It is true that she testified that she had decided to give the defendant the money at the time they were at lunch, and, from the evidence, it appears that this was before she had borrowed the money, and also before the defendant told her that she had ordered fifty shares of United States Steel stock. However, from what has already been said, it was for the judge to determine when Mrs. Blair did make up her mind, or when she became fully determined, and it could have been found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that this was not until the money was, in fact, handed to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>277 Mass. 27, 28. We think there was no error in the manner in which the judge dealt with these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">It is unnecessary to refer to the evidence of the conduct and statements of the defendant after April 27, 1938, beyond saying that from it, it could be found that the defendant was conscious of guilt (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>261 Mass. 281, 288, and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>263 Mass. 39, 46, 47), and also, that she never intended to carry out her undertaking and made no effort to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Finally, the defendant contends that the case at bar comes within what was said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>310 Mass. 811, 820-821, but that case is distinguishable. In the case at bar there was no error as to the matters assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
