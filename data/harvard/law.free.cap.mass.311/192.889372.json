Henry Neal and others upon certain real estate in said city. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended. No evidence is reported, but copies of the tax bill and the application to the assessors for abatement are included in the record as provided by said \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The assessors contend that the Appellate Tax Board had no jurisdiction to grant the abatement for the reason that there was no application to the assessors for abatement that complied with the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 59, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 266, \u00a7 1, and amended by St. 1935, c. 187, \u00a7 1. See now St. 1939, c. 250, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 59, as amended, so far as here material, provides that a \u201cperson aggrieved by the tax assessed upon him may . . . apply in writing to the assessors, on a form approved by the commissioner [of corporations and taxation], for an abatement thereof.\u201d \u201cThe only remedy available to a taxpayer to secure a reduction of his annual property tax on the ground that the assessment is excessive is by proceedings for an abatement under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 59 . . . An essential step in that procedure is the filing of an application with the assessors. The failure to file such an application bars relief. And an application that does not comply with the requirements of the statute is ineffectual.\u201d <em>Choate </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>304 Mass. 298, 301-302. <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Suffolk Law School, </em>295 Mass. 489, 496-499. <em>Assessors of Brookline </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>310 Mass. 300, 303, 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The tax in question was assessed to \u201cJ. Henry Neal, Edmund C. Campbell and William H. Hitchcock, Trs. First Peoples Trust.\u201d It is not questioned that the tax was assessed to the proper persons or that it was assessed to the individuals named. See <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Lowell Building Corp. </em>309 Mass. 165, 170-172. Though real estate is held in trust, it is to be assessed to the persons having legal title thereto, as the owners thereof. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 11, as appearing in St. 1936, c. 92. See now St. 1939, c. 175. <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Pingree, </em>110 Mass. 47. <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>200 Mass. 468. Since, however, trustees are joint owners, it is the entire tax that is to be assessed to them, and such tax may be assessed \u201cin the name of one or more of the record owners.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 60, \u00a7 56. <em>Curtiss </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>213 Mass. 239, 245. Moreover, with exceptions not here material, it is the persons assessed as owners who must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>apply for abatement. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 59, as amended. See <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>200 Mass. 468, 469; <em>Choate </em>v. Assessors <em>of Boston, </em>304 Mass. 298, 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\">The Appellate Tax Board, with respect to the application for abatement, found as follows: \u201cAn application for abatement was 'filed September 21, 1936 ... It was on a form approved by the commissioner of corporations and taxation. At the bottom of the form were two lines with the word \u2018signature\u2019 printed to the left of them. On these lines there was typewritten the words:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u2018Trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Treasurer\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Through inadvertence no name was written above or beside the word \u2018Treasurer.\u2019 When the application was filed with the assessors it was accompanied by a letter stating that the application was enclosed. This letter was signed \u2018First People\u2019s Trust, W. C. Larsen, Treasurer.\u2019 \u201d The Appellate Tax Board decided that an application was filed and that \u201cthe application in question was in writing on a form approved by the commissioner,\u201d as required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 59, as amended. The question for determination is whether, on the facts disclosed by the record, this decision was erroneous as matter -of law. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">It is apparent from the finding of the Appellate Tax Board and the copy of the application for abatement that this application was \u201cin writing ... on a form approved by the commissioner\u201d in the narrow sense that the writing was on such a form. See <em>Assessors of Brookline </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>310 Mass. 300, 307. Properly it is not questioned that the application was \u201cin writing\u201d so far as the body thereof is concerned, though the application is on a printed form and the answers thereon to the printed'questions are typewritten. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 7, Thirty-eighth, provides that in construing statutes \u201c\u2018Written\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u2018in writing\u2019 shall include printing, engraving, lithographing and any other mode of representing words and letters,\u201d with a special provision relating to a \u201cwritten signature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">The assessors, however, argue, in support of their basic contention: (a) that the application in question was not the application of the persons entitled to apply for abatement \u2014 the individuals to whom the real estate was assessed \u2014 and (b) that the application was not properly signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">1. The implied finding of the Appellate Tax Board, that the application for abatement was the application of the individuals assessed and entitled to apply for abatement, was not, on this record, erroneous as matter of law. In the record of the Appellate Tax Board the case is entitled \u201cJ. Henry Neal &amp; others, trustees, <em>vs. </em>Board of Assessors of the City of Boston,\u201d and the Appellate Tax Board in its \u201cFindings of Fact and Report\u201d recites that the \u201cappellants [meaning appellants from the failure of the assessors to act upon the application within four months after it was filed \u2014 an implied denial thereof \u2014 see G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 6, as amended] are trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust,\u201d and that \u201cthe appellant trustees were the owners\u201d of the real estate in question. The tax bill, after naming J. Henry Neal, Edmund C. Campbell and William H. Hitchcock, describes them as \u201cTrs. [obviously an abbreviation of \u201cTrustees\u201d] First Peoples Trust.\u201d The application for abatement recites, \u201cRespectfully represents J. Henry Neal et al, Trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust,\u201d and describes the \u201cowner of record\u201d as of the assessment date as \u201c J. Henry Neal et al, Trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust.\u201d Opposite the word \u201csignature\u201d at the end of the form approved by the commissioner is typewritten \u201cTrustees of the First People\u2019s Trust . . . Treasurer,\u201d obviously referring to \u201c J. Henry Neal et al, Trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust,\u201d previously named in the application. The references in the application to the real estate, the assessors\u2019 book, the assessed valuation, and the tax clearly warranted the conclusion that the application related to the same real estate and the same tax as are referred to in the tax bill. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>nothing in the record precluded the Appellate Tax Board from concluding that the application in question filed with the assessors, accompanied by a letter signed \u201cFirst People\u2019s Trust, W. C. Larsen, Treasurer,\u201d was filed in behalf of the persons purporting by such application to be seeking abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The nature of an application for abatement was pointed out in Assessors <em>of Brookline </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>310 Mass. 300. It was there said that the application is \u201ca \u2018notice\u2019 by which \u2018information\u2019 is given to the assessors \u2018in reference to a possible pecuniary liability\u2019 ... a \u2018request\u2019 or \u2018claim\u2019 for reduction of the tax assessed by them and, as incidental thereto, for an opportunity to be heard by them as to the propriety of the original assessment and, if denied, a foundation for later proceedings before an appellate board\u201d (page 312), and that \u201cthe information to be included in an application for abatement of a tax on real estate, at the risk that if not so included the application cannot be considered, is such information as will adequately inform the assessors that a claim for abatement of a tax upon real estate therein referred to is being made by a person entitled to apply for such abatement, with a \u2018sufficient description of the particular real estate as to which an abatement is requested.\u2019\u201d Page 313. No question, however, is here raised as to the sufficiency of the description of the particular real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Notwithstanding the fact that the application described the applicants for abatement as \u201cJ. Henry Neal et al, Trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust,\u201d without expressly naming the other individual trustees, we think it could have been found by the Appellate Tax Board that the description in the application of the persons seeking abatement, considered in connection with other statements in the application, was such as \u201cadequately [to] inform the assessors that a claim for abatement of a tax upon real estate therein referred to\u201d was being made by all three of the trustees as the individuals to whom the tax had been assessed and who were the persons \u201centitled to apply for such abatement.\u201d It is not to be assumed that the assessors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>.with-whom the application was filed were ignorant as to the persons to whom they had assessed the tax referred to in detail in the application even to the extent of referring to the assessors\u2019 book by line and page. The persons assessed and those seeking abatement are described as trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust, and the tax in question obviously is the same tax. The result here reached is not fairly open to the objection that extrinsic evidence was required to identify the persons seeldng abatement. Compare <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>229 Mass. 511, 514; <em>Roland </em>v. <em>Kilroy, </em>282 Mass. 87, 89, 90-91; <em>DePrizio </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>291 Mass. 143, 149. Extrinsic evidence was not required to inform assessors of their own action to which reference is made in the application. They were presumed to be familiar with such action. Manifestly the application was intended to serve as a foundation for abatement by the assessors or for further proceedings before an appellate board with respect to the tax assessed to these individuals, who were, as described in the tax bill, the trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust. Since the principles governing assessment and application for abatement are not the same in all respects, it is unnecessary to consider whether an assessment of the real estate in question to \u201cJ. Henry Neal et al, Trustees of the First People\u2019s Trust,\u201d would have been a valid assessment of the real estate to the individual trustees. See, however, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 60, \u00a7 21; <em>Alvord </em>v. <em>Collin, </em>20 Pick. 418, 426; <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>7 Gray, 125, 127-128; <em>Westhampton </em>v. <em>Searle, </em>127 Mass. 502, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">2. The assessors, however, object to the application on the ground that it was not properly \u201csigned.\u201d The substance of this objection is twofold: (a) that the application was not \u201csigned\u201d in the handwriting of anybody, and (b) that it was not \u201csigned\u201d in the name of the individual trustees who were the persons assessed. Opposite the printed word \u201csignature\u201d at the end of the form of application approved by the commissioner was typewritten \u201cTrustees of the First People\u2019s Trust . . . Treasurer,\u201d but no name was inserted before the word \u201cTreasurer\u201d in handwriting or otherwise. There was no \u201csignature\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the handwriting of any person actually on the form approved by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We cannot say upon this record that the typewritten words were not placed upon the form by authority of the individual trustees with the intention of authenticating the application as their act for the purpose of securing an abatement of the tax assessed to them. And as already pointed out, the Appellate .Tax Board could have found that the application was sufficient \u201cadequately [to] inform the assessors\u201d that a claim for abatement was being made by the individual trustees. The objection now under consideration, therefore, is solely to the form of signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In dealing with this objection it is necessary to consider the requirement of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 59, as amended, with respect to an application being \u201csigned.\u201d This statute does not, in terms, require that an application be \u201csigned,\u201d differing in this respect from some somewhat similar statutes. For example, the statute of frauds, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 259, \u00a7 1, requires a memorandum \u201cin writing and signed by the party to be charged ... or by some person thereunto by him lawfully' authorized\u201d (see also G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 106, \u00a7 6), and the statute relating to injuries from a \u201cdefect or want of repair\u201d in a public way, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 19, as substituted by St. 1933, c. 114, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, requires a notice \u201cin writing, signed by the person injured or by some one in his behalf.\u201d In the absence of such an express provision requiring that an application be \u201csigned,\u201d a requirement of this nature must be found by implication from the nature of an application and the requirement that the application be \u201cin writing,\u201d or in the fact that the application is required to be \u201con a form approved by the commissioner\u201d coupled with the fact that the form so approved provides a place for a \u201csignature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Doubtless a \u201csignature\u201d by or in behalf of an applicant for abatement would be a natural incident of such an application, but apparently the Legislature did not regard a \u201csignature\u201d in any particular form \u2014 if at all \u2014 as essential to an application if, without a \u201csignature,\u201d an application received from a proper source was sufficient \u201cade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>quately [to] inform\u201d the assessors \u201cin writing\u201d as to the identity of the person applying for abatement. The change in the requirement as to an application effected by St. 1933, c. 266, \u00a7 1, now embodied in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 59, as amended \u2014 apart, at least, from the effect of St. 1931, c. 150, \u00a7 2, and St. 1933, c. 165, \u00a7 2 \u2014 was from an oral application (see <em>Assessors of Brookline </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>310 Mass. 300, 301, and cases cited) \u2014 which, of course, required no \u201csignature\u201d \u2014 to an application \u201cin writing\u201d on an approved form. It is to be assumed that in making this change the Legislature used the words \u201cin writing\u201d in the sense in which they had long been defined by statute for the purpose of the construction of statutes (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 4, \u00a7 7, Thirty-eighth), as including \u201cprinting, engraving, lithographing and any other mode of representing words and letters.\u201d Even if it is to be inferred that an application must be \u201csigned,\u201d though the statute contains no such express requirement, the further inference is not to be drawn that the application must be \u201csigned\u201d other than \u201cin writing\u201d as these words are defined by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">Under the statute of frauds, whereby it is expressly provided that a memorandum be \u201csigned,\u201d it is generally the law that the statute is complied with by signing the memorandum \u201cin writing\u201d substantially as these words are defined by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 7, Thirty-eighth, with the declared or apparent intent of authenticating the signature as that of the signer, though the point has not been directly decided in this Commonwealth. Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 210. 2 Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 585. See <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>19 Pick. 502, 504-505; <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Spooner, </em>13 Allen, 353, 357-358. Moreover, in <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Lucy, </em>157 Mass. 439, where a statute was involved providing, among other things, that a husband or wife under some circumstances \u201cmay give notice in writing, signed by him or her,\u201d to a person requesting him not to sell intoxicating liquor to the wife or husband of the person making the request, the court held that a \u201csignature in the proper handwriting\u201d of the person giving the notice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>not required, notwithstanding the provision in Pub. Sts. c. 3, \u00a7 3, Twenty-fifth, unchanged in substance in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 7, Thirty-eighth,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that \u201cwhen the written signature of a person is required by law, it shall always be the proper hand-writing of such person, or, in case he is unable to write, his proper mark.\u201d The court said: \u201cThere are many instances where, by express provisions of statute, or by rules of law, a person is required to make a demand or give a notice, and whereby express requirement or by implication his name is to be signed. . . . Ordinarily, and in the absence of anything to show the contrary, it can hardly be supposed that the Legislature meant to require in all such cases a signature in the proper handwriting of the person. ... In the case before us, the statute did not in terms require the plaintiff\u2019s 'written signature,\u2019 but only that the notice should be 'signed.\u2019 Signing does not necessarily mean a written signature, as distinguished from a signature by mark, by print, by stamp, or by the hand of another.\u201d Page 443. If, under statutes requiring that an instrument be \u201csigned,\u201d a signature in handwriting is not required, a statute, like that now under consideration, containing no such express requirement and providing merely that the instrument be \u201cin writing\u201d cannot rightly be construed as requiring that the instrument be signed in handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">We need not consider whether the commissioner, under his authority to approve a form of application, could require that an application be signed in handwriting when the statutory requirement is merely that the application be \u201cin writing\u201d on such an approved form, for the form approved makes no such requirement. The form cannot be interpreted as going farther than to provide that the application be signed in a manner that conforms to the law respecting signing of such instruments, and to indicate the place on the application where it shall be signed in that manner. (Whether signing at that place on the approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>form is essential to an effective application need not be considered on the facts of this case.) And the statement on the' form, \u201cSigned this . . . day of . . . 1936 Under the Penalties of Perjury,\u201d which is to be filled out by the person signing the application, does not import that the application must be signed in handwriting. The effect of such a statement is to subject to liability to the penalties of perjury a person who \u201csigns and issues\u201d a \u201cwritten statement required by law\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 268, \u00a7 1A, set out in a footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is unnecessary to decide whether an application for abatement constitutes such a \u201cwritten statement\u201d within the meaning of the statute, or whether, on the other hand, the statute applies only to statements that, by other provisions of law, must be made on oath or affirmation, for which requirement this statute and related statutes provide a substitute. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 6, Sixth. An application for abatement, unlike numerous other documents required by statutes for the purpose of taxation (see, with various amendments, G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30, 31; c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 24; c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 13, 17, 25, 35, 36, 53, 67; c. 64A, \u00a7 4; and see <em>Central National Bank </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>259 Mass. 1, 3-4), is not by statute required to be made on oath or affirmation. Presumably the omission of such a requirement in the statute relating to applications for abatement was due to the nature of such an application, as pointed out in <em>Assessors of Brookline </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>310 Mass. 300, 312, as \u201ca 'notice\u2019 by which 'information\u2019 is given to the assessors 'in reference to a possible pecuniary liability\u2019 ... a 'request\u2019 or 'claim\u2019 for reduction of the tax assessed by them,\u201d and not \u201cthe presentation of evidence in support of such claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In view, however, of the definition of \u201cwritten\u201d in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 7, Thirty-eighth, it is obvious that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>a \u201cwritten statement\u201d need not be in handwriting. And so far as the form of signing is concerned, signing in any manner that conforms to other requirements of law, even though not in handwriting, would bring the person so signing within the scope of the statute. No reason appears for giving to the word \u201csigns\u201d in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 268, \u00a7 1A, a narrower definition than is ordinarily given, as already pointed out, to the word \u201csigned.\u201d A person who \u201csigns\u201d a \u201cwritten statement,\u201d within the scope of the statute, other than in handwriting, should not for that reason be free of liability for a statement so \u201csigned\u201d that is \u201cwilfully false in a material matter.\u201d General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 268, \u00a7 1A, therefore, furnishes no basis for an inference that an application for abatement, even if within the statute, must be signed in handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Since an application for abatement can be made not only directly by a person entitled to apply for abatement but also by an agent in his behalf (see <em>Choate </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>304 Mass. 298), it is apparent that the application need not be signed in the handwriting of the applicant. And no greater reason appears for requiring an agent of the applicant to sign in his own handwriting. We conclude, therefore, that the application in question was not ineffective because not signed in handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The other objection of the assessors, on this branch of the case, to the application for abatement is based on the fact that such application was not signed in the names of the individual trustees who were assessed, but instead the words \u201cTrustees of the First People\u2019s Trust\u201d were used. It could have been found that these words described the individual trustees who were the persons actually assessed for the tax, partial abatement of which was sought by this application, and nothing in the record precluded a finding that these words were adopted by them as their signature for the purpose of the application. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the assessors were deceived, or likely to be deceived, by the form of signature to the application, or that, as already stated, the assessors were not adequately informed as to the persons seeking abatement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>In these circumstances it cannot be ruled as matter of law that the signature of the individual trustees in descriptive words by which such individuals could readily have been identified, rather than in their own names, rendered the application ineffective. Compare <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Flagler, </em>9 Allen, 474, 477-478; <em>McGovern </em>v. <em>Hern, </em>153 Mass. 308, 310; <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>183 Mass. 389, 391; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>229 Mass. 511, 514; <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Lowell Building Corp. </em>309 Mass. 165, 172-173; 2 Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 578, 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The conclusion of the Appellate Tax Board that it had jurisdiction of the application cannot be said upon this record to be erroneous as matter of law. Consequently, since no other question of law is presented by the appeal, there must be an abatement in the amount determined by the Appellate Tax Board, $2,850, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\"> This clause now reads: \u201c \u2018Written\u2019 and \u2018in writing\u2019 shall include printing, engraving, lithographing and any other mode of representing words and letters; but if the written signature of a person is required by law, it shall always be in his own handwriting or, if he is unable to write, his mark.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\"> \u201cExcept in a judicial proceeding or in a proceeding in a course of justice, no written statement required by law shall be required to be verified by oath or affirmation before a magistrate if it contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury.
