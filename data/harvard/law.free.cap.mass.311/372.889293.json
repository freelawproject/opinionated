After issue joined in the Superior Court the plaintiff, by a writing filed in the clerk\u2019s office in accordance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, .\u00a7 60A, offered to waive the rules of evidence. The offer was not rejected and in accordance with the provisions of the section \u201cshall be deemed to have been accepted.\u201d The statute further provides that in these circumstances \u201csuch action or suit shall be advanced for speedy trial\u201d; but the plaintiff\u2019s motion to advance was denied. The record states that the \u201cdefendant\u201d excepted. We assume, however, that the word \u201cdefendant\u201d is a clerical error for \u201cplaintiff,\u201d since the bill of exceptions purports to be that of the plaintiff founded upon the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">This bill of exceptions is not properly before us. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96, relating to actions at law, contains a provision that \u201cno appeal or exception shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>entered in the supreme judicial court until the case is in all other respects ripe for final disposition by the superior court.\u201d Plainly the case is not ripe for final disposition by the Superior Court. It has not been tried. There is nothing in \u00a7 60A, first above referred to, that confers upon a party special privileges in this court contrary to the express prohibition of \u00a7 96. The Legislature would not naturally expect that the entry of bills of exceptions in this court contrary to \u00a7 96 would be necessary to the successful functioning of \u00a7 60A. That section operates as an immediate direction to the trial court. An appellate court would not commonly be expected to concern itself with the order of cases on the list of a trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The plaintiff relies upon the decision in <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>216 Mass. 545, where it was held that the rule that exceptions cannot be entered and heard in this court until the case is ripe for judgment in the court below was \u201ca rule of practice established by the court\u201d (page 547) and not a jurisdictional rule arising out of statute, and he asks us to make an exception to that rule in this case in order to give effect to \u00a7 60A. An insuperable obstacle to our taking this course is that since the decision of the <em>Weil </em>case, and with the taking effect of the General Laws of 1921, statutory changes embodied in \u00a7 96 have converted what was formerly \u201ca rule of practice established by the court\u201d into a rule of statutory law, compliance with which is a prerequisite to jurisdiction in this court. See <em>Cheraska </em>v. <em>Ohanasian, </em>259 Mass. 341, 344, 345; <em>Keljikian </em>v. <em>Star Brewing Co. </em>303 Mass. 53, 60, 61. We have no power to write exceptions into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">This decision is based upon an express statutory provision relating to exceptions. It has no application to any other remedy that may be open to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\n<em>Exceptions dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
