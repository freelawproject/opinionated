The employee was engaged in loading bags of .coal upon a truck without tailboard or sides. The truck was noti fully loaded and the employee lay on his stomach in the back of the' truck trying to keep the bags of coal in position on the truck. His legs were dangling over the back of the truck. 'As the operator of the truck backed it up, to enable mor\u00e9 coal to be loaded, the employee\u2019s right leg was broken when caught between the rear of the truck and a railroad embankment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The Industrial Accident Board found a compensable injury, and the Superior Court awarded compensation. The insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">It cannot be said that the employee voluntarily incurred a danger outside the contemplated scope of his employment, as in <em>Lazarz\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 538, <em>Wozniak\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 471, and <em>Eifler\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 1. The employee at the time of the injury was still engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>in the work for which he was hired. In our opinion the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment\".</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
