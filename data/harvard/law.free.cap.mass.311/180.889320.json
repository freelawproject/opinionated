Of course this will make it a little inconvenient for those living on these streets, but it seems to be the only way out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cThe same source from which the writer learned of the ' discontinue \u2019 movement, stated that in the future he would support the idea of cutting out all appropriations for oil for roads in town, as last year the town appropriated the largest amount of money in history for oiling roads and this spring finds our roads in their worst condition \u2014 obviously the more we appropriate for oil, the less actually finds its way on the roads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cThe condition of our roads may have been responsible for certain results of the recent election, but it\u2019s the writers guess that it will take more than bad roads to stop a change in administration of road affairs next spring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cYours for less bumps in some places and more in others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">M.

The Dept, of Public Works must be pessimists \u2014 there are still Snow Fences up in some sections of the town.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">From the sustaining of a demurrer to the declaration, the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The declaration, in substance, alleged that the letter above set forth was published concerning the plaintiff and his conduct in office. It is settled that any writing is a libel that discredits the plaintiff in the minds of \u201cany considerable and respectable class in the community.\u201d <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>304 Mass. 31, 33. <em>Themo </em>v. <em>New England Newspaper Publishing Co. </em>306 Mass. 54, 56.
