The statute defines \"racketeering activity\" to encompass dozens of state and federal offenses, known in RICO parlance as predicates. These predicates include any act \"indictable\" under specified federal statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 1961(1)(B)-(C), (E)-(G), as well as certain crimes \"chargeable\" under state law, \u00a7 1961(1)(A), and any offense involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activity that is \"punishable\" under federal law, \u00a7 1961(1)(D). A predicate offense implicates RICO when it is part of a \"pattern of racketeering activity\"-a series\n   of related predicates that together demonstrate the existence or threat of continued criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    H.J.

Section 1962(a)makes it unlawful to invest income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity in an enterprise. Section 1962(b)makes it unlawful to acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section 1962(c)makes it unlawful for a person employed by or associated with an enterprise to conduct the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Finally, \u00a7 1962(d)makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of the other three prohibitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Violations of \u00a7 1962are subject to criminal penalties, \u00a7 1963(a), and civil proceedings to enforce those prohibitions may be brought by the Attorney General, \u00a7\u00a7 1964(a)-(b). Separately, RICO creates a private civil cause of action that allows \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962\" to sue in federal district court and recover treble damages, costs, and attorney's fees. \u00a7 1964(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case arises from allegations that petitioners-RJR Nabisco and numerous related entities (collectively RJR)-participated in a global money-laundering scheme in association with various organized crime groups. Respondents-the European Community and 26 of its member states-first sued RJR in the Eastern District of New York in 2000, alleging that RJR had violated RICO. Over the past 16 years, the resulting litigation (spread over at least three separate actions, with this case the lone survivor) has seen multiple complaints and multiple trips up and down the federal court system. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20843957\">\n    2011 WL 843957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1-*2 (E.D.N.Y., Mar. 8, 2011)(tracing the procedural history through the District Court's dismissal of the present complaint). In the interest of brevity, we confine our discussion to the operative complaint and its journey to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Greatly simplified, the complaint alleges a scheme in which Colombian and Russian drug traffickers smuggled narcotics into Europe and sold the drugs for euros that-through a series of transactions involving black-market money brokers, cigarette importers, and wholesalers-were used to pay for large shipments of RJR cigarettes into Europe. In other variations of this scheme, RJR allegedly dealt directly with drug traffickers and money launderers in South America and sold cigarettes to Iraq in violation of international sanctions. RJR is also said to have acquired Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation for the purpose of expanding these illegal activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The complaint alleges that RJR engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of numerous acts of money laundering, material support to foreign terrorist organizations, mail fraud, wire fraud, and violations of the Travel Act. RJR, in concert with the other participants in the scheme, allegedly formed an association in fact that was engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, and therefore constituted a RICO enterprise that the complaint dubs the \"RJR Money-Laundering Enterprise.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 238a, Complaint \u00b6 158; see \u00a7 1961(4)(defining an enterprise to include \"any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Putting these pieces together, the complaint alleges that RJR violated each of RICO's prohibitions. RJR allegedly used income derived from the pattern of racketeering to invest in, acquire an interest in, and operate the RJR Money-Laundering Enterprise in violation of \u00a7 1962(a); acquired and maintained control of the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering in violation of \u00a7 1962(b); operated the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering in violation of \u00a7 1962(c); and conspired with other participants in the scheme in violation of \u00a7 1962(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These violations allegedly harmed respondents in various ways, including through competitive harm to their state-owned cigarette businesses, lost tax revenue from black-market cigarette sales, harm to European financial institutions, currency instability, and increased law enforcement costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   RJR moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that RICO does not apply to racketeering activity occurring outside U.S. territory or to foreign enterprises. The District Court agreed and dismissed the RICO claims as impermissibly extraterritorial.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20843957\">\n    2011 WL 843957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Second Circuit reinstated the RICO claims. It concluded that, \"with respect to a number of offenses that constitute predicates for RICO liability and are alleged in this case, Congress has clearly manifested an intent that they apply extraterritorially.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183772\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/129/#p133\">\n    764 F.3d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (2014). \"By incorporating these statutes into RICO as predicate racketeering acts,\" the court reasoned, \"Congress has clearly communicated its intention that RICO apply to extraterritorial conduct to the extent that extraterritorial violations of these statutes serve as the basis for RICO liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183772\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/129/#p133\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183772\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/129/#p133\">\n    at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Turning to the predicates alleged in the complaint, the Second Circuit found that they passed muster.

First, do RICO's substantive prohibitions, contained in \u00a7 1962, apply to conduct that occurs in foreign countries? Second, does RICO's private right of action, contained in \u00a7 1964(c), apply to injuries that are suffered in foreign countries? We consider\n   each of these questions in turn. To guide our inquiry, we begin by reviewing the law of extraterritoriality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is a basic premise of our legal system that, in general, \"United States law governs domestically but does not rule the world.\"\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp. v.

We then engaged in a separate inquiry to determine whether the complaint before us involved a permissible\n   <em>\n    domestic\n   </em>\n   application of \u00a7 10(b) because it alleged that some of the relevant misrepresentations were made in the United States. At this second step, we considered the \" 'focus' of congressional concern,\" asking whether \u00a7 10(b)'s focus is \"the place where the deception originated\" or rather \"purchases and sale of securities in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At the first step, we ask whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted-that is, whether the statute gives a clear, affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially. We must ask this question regardless of whether the statute in question regulates conduct, affords relief, or merely confers jurisdiction. If the statute is not extraterritorial, then at the second step we determine whether the case involves a domestic application of the statute, and we do this by looking to the statute's \"focus.\" If the conduct relevant to the statute's focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad; but if the conduct relevant to the focus occurred in a foreign country, then the case involves an impermissible extraterritorial application regardless of any other conduct that occurred in U.S. territory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   What if we find at step one that a statute clearly\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   have extraterritorial effect? Neither\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Kiobel\n   </em>\n   involved such a finding. But we addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Morrison,\n   </em>\n   explaining that it was necessary to consider \u00a7 10(b)'s \"focus\" only because we found that the statute does not apply extraterritorially: \"If \u00a7 10(b) did apply abroad, we would not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it would apply to all of them (barring some other limitation).\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    561 U.S., at 267, n. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The scope of an extraterritorial statute thus turns on the limits Congress has (or has not) imposed on the statute's foreign application, and not on the statute's \"focus.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With these guiding principles in mind, we first consider whether RICO's substantive prohibitions in \u00a7 1962may apply to foreign conduct. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kiobel,\n   </em>\n   we find that the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted-but only with respect to certain applications of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The most obvious textual clue is that RICO defines racketeering activity to include a number of predicates that plainly apply to at least some foreign conduct. These predicates include the prohibition against engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property, which expressly applies, when \"the defendant is a United States person,\" to offenses that \"tak[e] place outside the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201957\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). Other examples include the prohibitions against the assassination of Government officials, \u00a7 351(i)( \"There is extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct prohibited by this section\"); \u00a7 1751(k) (same), and the prohibition against hostage taking, which applies to conduct that \"occurred outside the United States\" if either the hostage or the offender is a U.S. national, if the offender is\n   found in the United States, or if the hostage taking is done to compel action by the U.S. Government, \u00a7 1203(b). At least one predicate-the prohibition against \"kill[ing] a national of the United States, while such national is outside the United States\"-applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to conduct occurring outside the United States. \u00a7 2332(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We agree with the Second Circuit that Congress's incorporation of these (and other) extraterritorial predicates into RICO gives a clear, affirmative indication that \u00a7 1962applies to foreign racketeering activity-but only to the extent that the predicates alleged in a particular case themselves apply extraterritorially. Put another way, a pattern of racketeering activity may include or consist of offenses committed abroad in violation of a predicate statute for which the presumption against extraterritoriality has been overcome. To give a simple (albeit grim) example, a violation of \u00a7 1962could be premised on a pattern of killings of Americans abroad in violation of \u00a7 2332(a)-a predicate that all agree applies extraterritorially-whether or not any domestic predicates are also alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We emphasize the important limitation that foreign conduct must violate \"a predicate statute that manifests an unmistakable congressional intent to apply extraterritorially.\" 764 F.3d, at 136. Although a number of RICO predicates have extraterritorial effect, many do not. The inclusion of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   extraterritorial predicates does not mean that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   RICO predicates extend to foreign conduct. This is apparent for two reasons. First, \"when a statute provides for some extraterritorial application, the presumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that provision to its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    561 U.S., at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, RICO defines as racketeering activity only acts that are \"indictable\" (or, what amounts to the same thing, \"chargeable\" or \"punishable\") under one of the statutes identified in \u00a7 1961(1). If a particular statute does not apply extraterritorially, then conduct committed abroad is not \"indictable\" under that statute and so cannot qualify as a predicate under RICO's plain terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   RJR resists the conclusion that RICO's incorporation of extraterritorial predicates gives RICO commensurate extraterritorial effect. It points out that \"RICO itself\" does not refer to extraterritorial application; only the underlying predicate statutes do. Brief for Petitioners 42. RJR thus argues that Congress could have intended to capture only\n   <em>\n    domestic\n   </em>\n   applications of extraterritorial predicates, and that any predicates that apply only abroad could have been \"incorporated ... solely for when such offenses are part of a broader pattern whose overall locus is domestic.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The presumption against extraterritoriality does not require us to adopt such a constricted interpretation. While the presumption can be overcome only by a clear indication of extraterritorial effect, an express statement of extraterritoriality is not essential. \"Assuredly context can be consulted as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 265,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Context is dispositive here. Congress has not expressly said that \u00a7 1962(c)applies to patterns of racketeering activity in foreign countries, but it has defined \"racketeering activity\"-and by extension a \"pattern of racketeering activity\"-to encompass violations of predicate statutes that\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   expressly apply extraterritorially. Short of an explicit declaration,\n   it is hard to imagine how Congress could have more clearly indicated that it intended RICO to have (some) extraterritorial effect. This unique structure makes RICO the rare statute that clearly evidences extraterritorial effect despite lacking an express statement of extraterritoriality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We therefore conclude that RICO applies to some foreign racketeering activity. A violation of \u00a7 1962may be based on a pattern of racketeering that includes predicate offenses committed abroad, provided that each of those offenses violates a predicate statute that is itself extraterritorial. This fact is determinative as to \u00a7 1962(b)and \u00a7 1962(c), both of which prohibit the employment of a pattern of racketeering. Although they differ as to the end for which the pattern is employed-to acquire or maintain control of an enterprise under subsection (b), or to conduct an enterprise's affairs under subsection (c)-this difference is immaterial for extraterritoriality purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 1962(a)presents a thornier question. Unlike subsections (b) and (c), subsection (a) targets certain uses of\n   <em>\n    income\n   </em>\n   derived from a pattern of racketeering, not the use of the pattern itself. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p461\">\n    547 U.S. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461-462,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p461\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p461\">\n    164 L.Ed.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). While we have no difficulty concluding that this prohibition applies to income derived from foreign patterns of racketeering (within the limits we have discussed), arguably \u00a7 1962(a)extends only to domestic uses of the income. The Second Circuit did not decide this question because it found that respondents have alleged \"a domestic investment of racketeering proceeds in the form of RJR's merger in the United States with Brown &amp; Williamson and investments in other U.S. operations.\" 764 F.3d, at 138, n. 5. RJR does not dispute the basic soundness of the Second Circuit's reasoning, but it does contest the court's reading of the complaint. See Brief for Petitioners 57-58. Because the parties have not focused on this issue, and because it makes no difference to our resolution of this case, see\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   at 2110, we assume without deciding that respondents have pleaded a domestic investment of racketeering income in violation of \u00a7 1962(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, although respondents' complaint alleges a violation of RICO's conspiracy provision, \u00a7 1962(d), the parties' briefs do not address whether this provision should be treated differently from the provision (\u00a7 1962(a), (b), or (c)) that a defendant allegedly conspired to violate. We therefore decline to reach this issue, and assume without deciding that \u00a7 1962(d)'s extraterritoriality tracks that of the provision underlying the alleged conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   RJR contends that, even if RICO may apply to foreign patterns of racketeering, the statute does not apply to foreign\n   <em>\n    enterprises\n   </em>\n   . Invoking\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   's discussion of the Exchange Act's \"focus,\" RJR says that the \"focus\" of RICO is the enterprise being corrupted-not the pattern of racketeering-and that RICO's enterprise element gives no clear indication of extraterritorial effect. Accordingly, RJR reasons, RICO requires a domestic enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This argument misunderstands\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   . As explained above,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2100 - 2101, only at the second step of the inquiry do we consider a statute's \"focus.\" Here, however, there is a clear indication at step one that RICO applies extraterritorially. We therefore do not proceed to the \"focus\" step. The\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   Court's discussion of the statutory \"focus\" made this clear, stating that \"[i]f \u00a7 10(b) did apply abroad, we would not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it would apply\n   to all of them (barring some other limitation).\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    561 U.S., at 267, n. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same is true here. RICO-or at least \u00a7\u00a7 1962(b)and (c)-applies abroad, and so we do not need to determine which transnational (or wholly foreign) patterns of racketeering it applies to; it applies to all of them, regardless of whether they are connected to a \"foreign\" or \"domestic\" enterprise. This rule is, of course, subject to the important limitation that RICO covers foreign predicate offenses only to the extent that the underlying predicate statutes are extraterritorial. But within those bounds, the location of the affected enterprise does not impose an independent constraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It is easy to see why Congress did not limit RICO to domestic enterprises. A domestic enterprise requirement would lead to difficult line-drawing problems and counterintuitive results. It would exclude from RICO's reach foreign enterprises-whether corporations, crime rings, other associations, or individuals-that operate within the United States. Imagine, for example, that a foreign corporation has operations in the United States and that one of the corporation's managers in the United States conducts its U.S. affairs through a pattern of extortion and mail fraud. Such domestic conduct would seem to fall well within what Congress meant to capture in enacting RICO. Congress, after all, does not usually exempt foreigners acting in the United States from U.S. legal requirements. See 764 F.3d, at 138(\"Surely the presumption against extraterritorial application of United States laws does not command giving foreigners carte blanche to violate the laws of the United States in the United States\"). Yet RJR's theory would insulate this scheme from RICO liability-both civil and criminal-because the enterprise at issue is a foreign, not domestic, corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Seeking to avoid this result, RJR offers that any \" 'emissaries' \" a foreign enterprise sends to the United States-such as our hypothetical U.S.-based corporate manager-could be carved off and considered a \"distinct domestic enterprise\" under an association-in-fact theory. Brief for Petitioners 40. RJR's willingness to gerrymander the enterprise to get around its proposed domestic enterprise requirement is telling. It suggests that RJR is not really concerned about whether an enterprise is foreign or domestic, but whether the relevant conduct occurred here or abroad. And if that is the concern, then it is the pattern of racketeering activity that matters, not the enterprise. Even spotting RJR its \"domestic emissary\" theory, this approach would lead to strange gaps in RICO's coverage. If a foreign enterprise sent only a single \"emissary\" to engage in racketeering in the United States, there could be no RICO liability because a single person cannot be both the RICO enterprise and the RICO defendant.\n   <em>\n    Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v.

But this test quickly becomes meaningless if, as RJR suggests, a corporation with a foreign nerve center can, if necessary, be pruned into an association-in-fact enterprise with a domestic nerve center. The nerve center test, developed with ordinary corporate command structures in mind, is also ill\n   suited to govern RICO association-in-fact enterprises, which \"need not have a hierarchical structure or a 'chain of command.' \"\n   <em>\n    Boyle v.

These difficulties are largely avoided if, as we conclude today, RICO's extraterritorial effect is pegged to the extraterritoriality judgments Congress has made in the predicate statutes, often by providing precise instructions as to when those statutes apply to foreign conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The practical problems we have identified with RJR's proposed domestic enterprise requirement are not, by themselves, cause to reject it. Our point in reciting these troubling consequences of RJR's theory is simply to reinforce our conclusion, based on RICO's text and context, that Congress intended the prohibitions in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)and (c)to apply extraterritorially in tandem with the underlying predicates, without regard to the locus of the enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although we find that RICO imposes no domestic enterprise requirement, this does not mean that every foreign enterprise will qualify. Each of RICO's substantive prohibitions requires proof of an enterprise that is \"engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a), (b), (c). We do not take this reference to \"foreign commerce\" to mean literally all commerce occurring abroad. Rather, a RICO enterprise must engage in, or affect in some significant way, commerce directly involving the United States-\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   commerce between the United States and a foreign country. Enterprises whose activities lack that anchor to U.S. commerce cannot sustain a RICO violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Applying these principles, we agree with the Second Circuit that the complaint does not allege impermissibly extraterritorial violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1962(b)and (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The alleged pattern of racketeering activity consists of five basic predicates: (1) money laundering, (2) material support of foreign terrorist organizations, (3) mail fraud, (4) wire fraud, and (5) violations of the Travel Act.

The court found that the fraud statutes and the Travel Act do not contain the clear indication needed to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.

Congress not only armed the United States with authority to initiate criminal and civil proceedings to enforce RICO, \u00a7\u00a7 1963, 1964(b), Congress also created in \u00a7 1964(c)a private right of action for \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of [RICO's substantive provision].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Invoking this right, respondents, the European Community and 26 member states, filed suit against petitioners, RJR Nabisco, Inc., and related entities.

See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2098 - 2100. Denying respondents a remedy under RICO, the Court today reads into \u00a7 1964(c)a domestic-injury requirement for suits by private plaintiffs nowhere indicated in the statute's text. Correctly, the Court imposes no such restriction on the United States when it initiates a civil suit under \u00a7 1964(b). Unsupported by RICO's text, inconsistent with its purposes, and unnecessary to protect the comity interests the Court emphasizes, the domestic-injury requirement for private suits replaces Congress' prescription with one of the Court's own invention.

But when a statute demonstrates Congress' \"affirmative inten[t]\" that the law should apply beyond the borders of the United States, as numerous RICO predicate statutes do, the presumption is rebutted, and the law applies extraterritorially to the extent Congress prescribed.

As the Court relates, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2101 - 2104, Congress deliberately included within RICO's compass predicate federal offenses that manifestly reach conduct occurring abroad. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1956-1957 (money laundering); \u00a7 2339B (material support to foreign terrorist organizations). Accordingly, the Court concludes, when the predicate crimes underlying invocation of \u00a7 1962thrust extraterritorially, so too does \u00a7 1962. I agree with that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I disagree, however, that the private right of action authorized by \u00a7 1964(c)requires a domestic injury to a person's business or property and does not allow recovery for foreign injuries. One cannot extract such a limitation from the text of \u00a7 1964(c), which affords a right of action to \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of\n   section 1962.\" Section 1962, at least subsections (b) and (c), all agree, encompasses foreign injuries. How can \u00a7 1964(c)exclude them when, by its express terms, \u00a7 1964(c)is triggered by \"a violation of section 1962\"? To the extent RICO reaches injury abroad when the Government is the suitor pursuant to \u00a7 1962(specifying prohibited activities) and \u00a7 1963(criminal penalties) or \u00a7 1964(b)(civil remedies), to that same extent, I would hold, RICO reaches extraterritorial injury when, pursuant to \u00a7 1964(c), the suitor is a private plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   I would not distinguish, as the Court does, between the extraterritorial compass of a private right of action and that of the underlying proscribed conduct.

See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2106 - 2108. When the United States considers whether to initiate a prosecution or civil suit, the Court observes, it will take foreign-policy considerations into account, but private parties will not. It is far from clear, however, that the Court's blanket rule would ordinarily work to ward off international discord. Invoking the presumption against extraterritoriality as a bar to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   private suit for injuries to business or property abroad, this case suggests, might spark, rather than quell, international strife. Making such litigation available to domestic but not foreign plaintiffs is hardly solicitous of international comity or respectful of foreign interests.
