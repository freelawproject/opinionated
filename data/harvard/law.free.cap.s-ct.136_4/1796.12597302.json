After\n   <em>\n    Roper,\n   </em>\n   death sentences imposed on prisoners convicted of murders committed as minors were reduced to lesser sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the present case, petitioner committed a heinous murder in 1997 when he was 17 years old. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8319340\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/1037/#p1047\">\n    955 So.2d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047-1049 (Ala.Crim.App.2003). Wielding a knife and wearing a stocking mask to conceal his face, petitioner climbed through a window into the home of Melissa and Andrew Mills. Petitioner demanded money, but the Mills family had only $9 on hand. While petitioner remained in the Mills home with Melissa Mills and her three young children, Andrew Mills raced to an ATM and withdrew $375, the maximum amount available. Petitioner then demanded more money, so Andrew went to a nearby grocery store to cash a check. While holding her at knife point, petitioner raped Melissa Mills, who was four months pregnant, before stabbing her repeatedly in the neck, upper and lower chest, and back. The stab wounds pierced her liver and lungs, and she eventually succumbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When police arrived at the Mills' home, summoned by the grocery store clerk, Melissa Mills was gasping for breath and bleeding profusely. Petitioner fled but was captured nearby 20 minutes later. His clothes were covered in Melissa Mills' blood, and he had in his possession the knife used to kill her, which was also covered in her blood. Nine blood-smeared dollar bills were located nearby. Petitioner's DNA matched the semen recovered from the rape kit performed as part of Melissa Mills' autopsy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A jury found petitioner guilty of murder and then proceeded to decide whether he should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8319340\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/1037/#p1047\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1048 ; see Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-5-45 (1982). Under the Alabama law then in force, \"[t]he age of the defendant at the time of the crime\" was one of the statutory \"[m]itigating circumstances\" that the jury was required to consider. \u00a7 13A-5-51(7). The jury nevertheless concluded that petitioner's age did not warrant a sentence of less than death. After\n   <em>\n    Roper,\n   </em>\n   however, petitioner's sentence was commuted to life without parole. See\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Adams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8319371\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/1106/\">\n    955 So.2d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In cases like this, it can be argued that the original sentencing jury fulfilled the individualized sentencing requirement that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   subsequently imposed. In these cases, the sentencer necessarily rejected the argument that the defendant's youth and immaturity called for the lesser sentence of life imprisonment without parole. It can therefore be argued that such a sentencer would surely have felt that the defendant's youth and immaturity did not warrant an even lighter sentence that would have allowed the petitioner to be loosed on society at some time in the future. In short, it can be argued that the jury that sentenced petitioner to death already engaged in the very process mandated by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and concluded that petitioner was not a mere \" ' child' \" whose crimes reflected \" 'unfortunate yet transient immaturity,' \"\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1800 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in decision to grant, vacate, and remand), but was instead one of the rare minors who deserves life without parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    \u2020\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In cases in which a juvenile offender was originally sentenced to death after the sentencer considered but rejected youth as a mitigating factor, courts are free on remand to evaluate whether any further individualized consideration is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, concurring in the decision to grant, vacate and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The petitioners in these cases were sentenced to death for crimes they committed before they turned 18.
