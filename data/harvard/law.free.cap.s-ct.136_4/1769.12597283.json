Green is a black man who worked for the Postal Service for 35 years. In 2008, he was serving as the postmaster for Englewood, Colorado when he applied for a promotion to the vacant postmaster position in nearby Boulder. He was passed over. Shortly thereafter, Green complained he was denied the promotion because of his race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Green's relations with his supervisors crumbled following his complaint. Tensions peaked on December 11, 2009, when two of Green's supervisors accused him of intentionally delaying the mail-a criminal offense. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They informed Green that the Postal Service's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was investigating the charge and that OIG agents had arrived to interview him as part of their investigation. After Green met with the OIG agents, his supervisors gave him a letter reassigning him to off-duty status until the matter was resolved. Even though the OIG agents reported to Green's supervisors that no further investigation was warranted, the supervisors continued to represent to Green that \"the OIG is all over this\" and that the \"criminal\" charge \"could be a life changer.\" App. 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 16, 2009, Green and the Postal Service signed an agreement whose meaning remains disputed. Relevant here, the Postal Service promised not to pursue criminal charges in exchange for Green's promise to leave his post in Englewood. The agreement also apparently gave Green a choice: effective March 31, 2010, he could either retire or report for duty in Wamsutter, Wyoming-population 451-at a salary considerably lower than what he earned in his Denver suburb. Green chose to retire and submitted his resignation to the Postal Service on February 9, 2010, effective March 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 22-41 days after submitting his resignation paperwork to the Postal Service on February 9, but 96 days after signing the settlement agreement on December 16-Green contacted an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor to report an unlawful constructive discharge. He contended that his supervisors had threatened criminal charges and negotiated the resulting agreement in retaliation for his original complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He\n   alleged that the choice he had been given effectively forced his resignation in violation of Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Green eventually filed suit in the Federal District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that the Postal Service constructively discharged him. The Postal Service moved for summary judgment, arguing that Green had failed to make timely contact with an EEO counselor within 45 days of the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory,\" as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The District Court granted the Postal Service's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" encompassed only the Postal Service's discriminatory actions and not Green's independent decision to resign on February 9.\n   <em>\n    Green v. Donahoe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149360\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/1135/\">\n    760 F.3d 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Therefore, the 45-day limitations period started running when both parties signed the settlement agreement on December 16, 2009. Accordingly, because 96 days passed between the agreement and when Green contacted an EEO counselor on March 22, 2010, his constructive-discharge claim was time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Two other Courts of Appeals agree with the Tenth Circuit's view that the limitations period begins to run for a constructive-discharge claim after the employer's last discriminatory act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Tenth Circuit recognized, however, other Courts of Appeals have held that the limitations period for a constructive-discharge claim does not begin to run until the employee resigns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We granted certiorari to resolve this split. 575 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589669,12589670,12589671,12589672,12589673,12589674\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1892/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589669,12589671,12589676,12589837,12589678,12589679,12589680,12589838\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/191/762/\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).

To exhaust those remedies, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has promulgated regulations that require, among other things, that a federal employee consult with an EEO counselor prior to filing a discrimination lawsuit. Specifically, he \"must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The timeliness\n   of Green's claim therefore turns on our interpretation of this EEOC regulation implementing Title VII.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although we begin our interpretation of the regulation with its text, the text in this case is not particularly helpful. Nowhere does \u00a7 1614.105indicate whether a \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" in a constructive-discharge claim includes the employee's resignation, as Green contends, or only the employer's discriminatory conduct, as\n   <em>\n    amica\n   </em>\n   contends. The word \"matter\" simply means \"an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,\" Black's Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014)-a term that could readily apply to a discrimination-precipitated resignation. So the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" could refer to all of the allegations underlying a claim of discrimination, including the employee's resignation, or only to those allegations concerning the employer's discriminatory conduct. We therefore must turn to other canons of interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The most helpful canon in this context is \"the 'standard rule' \" for limitations periods.\n   <em>\n    Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist. v.

Although the standard rule can be displaced such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit, we \"will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication\" in the text of the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Reiter v. Cooper,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227285\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/258/#p267\">\n    507 U.S. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525866\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/113/1213/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227285\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/258/#p267\">\n    122 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Applying this default rule, we are persuaded that the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" in a constructive-discharge claim necessarily includes the employee's resignation for three reasons. First, in the context of a constructive-discharge claim, a resignation is part of the \"complete and present cause of action\" necessary before a limitations period ordinarily begins to run. Second, nothing in the regulation creating the limitations period here, \u00a7 1614.105, clearly indicates an intent to displace this standard rule. Third, practical considerations confirm the merit of applying the standard rule here. We therefore interpret the term \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" for a constructive-discharge claim to include the date Green resigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The standard rule for limitations periods requires us first to determine what is a \"complete and present cause of action\" for a constructive-discharge claim. We hold that such a claim accrues only after an employee resigns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The constructive-discharge doctrine contemplates a situation in which an employer discriminates against an employee to the point such that his \"working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n    542 U.S. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). When the employee resigns in\n   the face of such circumstances, Title VII treats that resignation as tantamount to an actual discharge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n    at 142-143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A claim of constructive discharge therefore has two basic elements. A plaintiff must prove first that he was discriminated against by his employer to the point where a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n    at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But he must also show that he actually resigned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858697\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/129/#p141\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"A constructive discharge involves\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   an employee's decision to leave and precipitating conduct ...\" (emphasis added)). In other words, an employee cannot bring a constructive-discharge claim until he is constructively\n   <em>\n    discharged.\n   </em>\n   Only after both elements are satisfied can he file suit to obtain relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the standard rule for limitations periods, the limitations period should begin to run for a constructive-discharge claim only after a plaintiff resigns. At that point-and not before-he can file a suit for constructive discharge. So only at that point-and not before-does he have a \"complete and present\" cause of action. And only after he has a complete and present cause of action does a limitations period ordinarily begin to run. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Mac's Shell Service, Inc. v. Shell Oil Products Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581913,12446769\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/175/\">\n    559 U.S. 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189-190,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446769,3581913\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1251/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446769,3581913\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1251/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010)(the limitations period for a constructive termination of a franchise agreement starts running when the agreement is constructively terminated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this respect, a claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee is no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee. An ordinary wrongful discharge claim also has two basic elements: discrimination and discharge. See\n   <em>\n    St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355912\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/502/#p506\">\n    509 U.S. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355912\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/502/#p506\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355912\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/502/#p506\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993); 1 B. Lindemann, P. Grossman, &amp; C. Weirich, Employment Discrimination Law 21-33 (5th ed. 2012) (Lindemann) (\"The sine qua non of a discharge case is, of course, a discharge\"). The claim accrues when the employee is fired. At that point-and not before-he has a \"complete and present cause of action.\" So at that point-and not before-the limitations period begins to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With claims of either constructive discharge or actual discharge, the standard rule thus yields the same result: a limitations period should not begin to run until after the discharge itself. In light of this rule, we interpret the term \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" in \u00a7 1614.105to refer to all of the elements that make up a constructive-discharge claim-including an employee's resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although the standard rule dictates that a limitations period should commence only after a claim accrues, there is an exception to that rule when the text creating the limitations period clearly indicates otherwise. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dodd v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209230\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/353/#p360\">\n    545 U.S. 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209230\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/353/#p360\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209230\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/353/#p360\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Nothing in the text of Title VII or the regulation, however, suggests that the standard rule should be displaced here. To the contrary, the language of the regulation confirms our application of the default rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As noted previously, the word \"matter\" generally refers to \"an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1126. The natural reading of \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" thus refers to the allegation forming the basis of the discrimination claim-here, a claim of constructive discharge. And as discussed above, a constructive discharge claim requires two basic allegations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   discriminatory conduct by the employer that leads to resignation of the employee. So long as those acts are part of the same, single claim under consideration, they are part of the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory,\" whatever the role of discrimination in each individual element of the claim. Cf.\n   <em>\n    National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    536 U.S. 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115-121,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002)(holding that a hostile-work-environment claim is a single \"unlawful employment practice\" that includes every act composing that claim, whether those acts are independently actionable or not).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, we are also persuaded that applying the standard rule for limitations periods to constructive discharge makes a good deal of practical sense. Starting the limitations clock ticking\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   a plaintiff can actually sue for constructive discharge serves little purpose in furthering the goals of a limitations period-and it actively negates Title VII's remedial structure.

If the limitations period begins to run following the employer's precipitating discriminatory conduct, but before the employee's resignation, the employee will be forced to file a discrimination complaint after the employer's conduct and later amend the complaint to allege constructive discharge after he resigns. Nothing in the regulation suggests it intended to require a layperson, while making this difficult decision, to follow such a two-step process in order to preserve any remedy if he is constructively discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, forcing an employee to lodge a complaint before he can bring a claim for constructive discharge places that employee in a difficult situation. An employee who suffered discrimination severe enough that a reasonable person in his shoes would resign might nevertheless force himself to tolerate that discrimination for a period of time. He might delay his resignation until he can afford to leave. Or he might delay in light of other circumstances, as in the case of a teacher waiting until the end of the school year to resign. Tr. 17. And, if he feels he must stay for a period of time, he may be reluctant to complain about discrimination while still employed. A complaint could risk termination-an additional adverse consequence that he may have to disclose in future job applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Amica\n   </em>\n   and the dissent read \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" as having a clear enough meaning to displace our reliance on the standard rule for limitations periods.

According to\n   <em>\n    amica\n   </em>\n   and the dissent, \"matter\" refers only to the discriminatory acts of the Postal Service, not Green's resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We disagree. There is nothing inherent in the phrase \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" that clearly limits it to employer\n   conduct. Rather, as discussed above, the term can reasonably be interpreted to include the factual basis for a claim. Green is not alleging just that the Postal Service discriminated against him. He claims that the discrimination left him no choice but to resign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Amica\n   </em>\n   and the dissent dispute that a constructive discharge is a separate claim.

In\n   <em>\n    Ricks,\n   </em>\n   for example, the Court considered the discrimination claim of a college faculty member who was denied tenure and given a 1-year \" 'terminal' \" contract for his last year teaching.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715909\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/250/#p262\">\n    449 U.S., at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715909\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/250/#p262\">\n    101 S.Ct. 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff's claim accrued-and he could have sued-when the college informed him he would be denied tenure and gave him \"explicit notice that his employment would end\" when his 1-year contract expired.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . The Court held that the limitations period began to run on that date, and not after his 1-year contract expired. That final year of teaching was merely an inevitable consequence of the tenure denial the plaintiff claimed was discriminatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Green's resignation, by contrast, is not merely an inevitable consequence of the discrimination he suffered; it is an essential part of his constructive-discharge claim. That is, Green could not sue for constructive discharge until he actually resigned. Of course, Green could not resign and then wait until the consequences of that resignation became most painful to complain. For example, he could not use the date of the expiration of his health insurance after his resignation to extend the limitations period. But the \"inevitable consequence\" principle of\n   <em>\n    Ricks,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ledbetter,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   does not change the focus of\n   the limitations period, which remains on the claim of discrimination itself.

The dissent suggests that our holding will make a discrimination victim the master of his complaint, permitting him to \" 'exten[d] the limitation[s period] indefinitely' \" by waiting to resign.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1794 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The concurrence claims that an employee who relies on the limitations period in waiting to resign is \"doubly out of luck\" if his otherwise-meritorious discrimination claim is time barred and he cannot show the discrimination was so intolerable that it amounted to a constructive discharge.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1789 (opinion of ALITO, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   These concerns are overblown.\n   <em>\n    Amica\n   </em>\n   may be right that it is more difficult to achieve conciliation after an employee resigns. But the same is true for a federal civil servant who is fired by his agency for what the employee believes to be a discriminatory purpose. And neither decision is necessarily permanent-a resignation or a termination may be undone after an employee contacts a counselor. Conciliation, while important, does not warrant treating a constructive discharge different from an actual discharge for purposes of the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As for the dissent's fear, we doubt that a victim of employment discrimination will continue to work in an intolerable environment merely because he can thereby extend the limitations period for a claim of constructive discharge. If anything, a plaintiff who wishes to prevail on the merits of his constructive discharge claim has the opposite incentive. A claim of constructive discharge requires proof of a causal link between the allegedly intolerable conditions and the resignation. See 1 Lindemann 21-45, and n. 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   And as for the concurrence's double-loser concern, no plaintiff would be well advised to delay pursuing what he believes to be a meritorious non-constructive-discharge-discrimination claim on the ground\n   that a timely filed constructive discharge claim could resuscitate other time-lapsed claims. The 45-day limitations period begins running on any separate underlying claim of discrimination when that claim accrues, regardless of whether the plaintiff eventually claims constructive discharge. The limitations-period analysis is always conducted claim by claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Our decision that a resignation triggers the limitations period for a constructive-discharge claim raises the question of when precisely an employee resigns. Here, Green and the Government agree that an employee resigns when he gives his employer definite notice of his intent to resign. If an employee gives \"two weeks' notice\"-telling his employer he intends to leave after two more weeks of employment-the limitations period begins to run on the day he tells his employer, not his last day at work. (This issue was not addressed by the Tenth Circuit and, accordingly,\n   <em>\n    amica\n   </em>\n   takes no position on it.

We have repeatedly held that the time to pursue an employment discrimination claim starts running when a discriminatory act occurs, and that a fresh limitations period does not start upon the occurrence of a later nondiscriminatory act-even if that later act carries forward the effects of the earlier discrimination.

Without mentioning this consistent line of precedent, the Court categorically declares that the limitations period for constructive discharge cases starts upon the employee's resignation, no matter when the last discriminatory act occurred. This effectively disposes of the discriminatory-intent requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Rather than jettison our precedent, I would hold that the limitations period for constructive discharge claims-like all other employment discrimination claims-starts running upon a discriminatory act of the employer. But I would also hold that an employee's resignation can, in many cases, be considered a discriminatory act of the employer. This is so where an employer subjects an employee to intolerable working conditions\n   <em>\n    with the discriminatory intent to force the employee to resign\n   </em>\n   . In these circumstances, the employee's consequent resignation is tantamount to an intentional termination by the employer, and so gives rise to a fresh limitations period just as a conventional termination would. Absent such intent, however, the resignation is not an independent discriminatory act but merely a delayed consequence of earlier discrimination. The resignation may be a basis for enhancing damages in a claim brought on the underlying discrimination, but it cannot restart the limitations clock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In this case, Green presented sufficient evidence that the Postal Service intended to force him to resign when it presented him with a settlement agreement requiring that he either retire or transfer to a distant post office for much less pay. Accordingly, the 45-day window for him to initiate counseling opened when he gave the Postal Service notice of his resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The regulation at issue here requires a federal employee who complains of unlawful discrimination to initiate contact with an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor \"within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (2015). The Court observes that this language \"is not particularly helpful\" in resolving the question presented, and so it quickly moves on to other considerations.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1776. I think that more can be discerned from the regulation's text. The Court observes that a \"matter\" in this context is \"an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014);\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1776. But the Court fails to plug in the regulation's critical qualifier: The matter must be (alleged to be)\n   <em>\n    discriminatory\n   </em>\n   . The phrase \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" is thus most fairly read to refer to the allegation\n   <em>\n    of discrimination\n   </em>\n   that underlies an employee's claim, not just any fact that supports the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Even if the regulation's text were unclear on this point, the next place I would look is not to a \"standard rule\" governing limitations periods, as the majority does,\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   but to the specific limitations rules we apply in other Title VII cases. Private-sector Title VII plaintiffs are required to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 or 300 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1); see\n   <em>\n    Morgan,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (construing this statutory provision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although this language is not identical to the regulation at issue here, nothing in either text requires that they be read as setting different rules. Indeed, the EEOC's Compliance Manual treats them the same-it describes the regulation as requiring federal employees to contact a counselor within 45 days of \"the alleged discriminatory employment\n   <em>\n    practice,\n   </em>\n   \" and it cites\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   as providing the governing standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also granted review in this case on the premise that the same rule would apply to both federal-sector and private-sector Title VII cases: Green's petition and merits brief ask us to decide when the filing period for constructive discharge claims begins as a matter of \"federal employment discrimination law\" generally, Pet. for Cert. i; Brief for Petitioner i, and the Circuit split he alleges consists primarily of cases in which the limitations period ran from the date of an unlawful employment \"practice,\" see Pet. for Cert. 11-16. The majority, for its part, seems to agree that the same rules should apply in the federal and private sectors, and it too relies on private-sector cases in describing the Circuit split that today's decision is meant to \"resolve.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1775 - 1776, and nn. 2-4. The majority's relegation of our Title VII timeliness cases to its rebuttal argument, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1779 - 1781, is thus surprising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Our Title VII precedents set somewhat different limitations rules for claims based on a discrete act of discrimination (such as termination, failure to hire, or demotion) and claims based on a hostile work environment. I will focus on the former set of rules because Green's resignation was a discrete act that was precipitated by another discrete act-namely, the settlement agreement that required him to retire or transfer to a far-off, lower paying position. For private-sector claims based on discrete acts, the limitations period starts to run on the day the discriminatory act occurred and expires 180 or 300 days later.\n   <em>\n    Morgan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    536 U.S., at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This means that an act done\n   <em>\n    with discriminatory intent\n   </em>\n   -not merely some act bearing on the claim-must have occurred within the limitations period.

In my view, an employee's resignation in the face of intolerable working conditions can be considered a discriminatory act of the employer when the employer makes conditions intolerable\n   <em>\n    with the specific discriminatory intent of forcing the employee to resign\n   </em>\n   . If the employer lacks that intent, however, the limitations period runs from the discriminatory act that precipitated the resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This approach reflects the fact that there are two kinds of constructive discharge. Much of the disagreement between the majority and dissent stems from their differing views of the nature of constructive discharge. To the majority, constructive discharge is always a standalone \"claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1779. To Justice THOMAS and the friend of the Court we appointed to defend the judgment below, constructive discharge is never a separate claim, but merely \"a counterdefense to an employer's contention that a resignation was voluntary\" that allows the resigning employee to recover backpay and other relief unavailable to employees who quit voluntarily.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1795. As I see it, each side is partly right. The label \"constructive discharge\" is best understood to refer to two different (though related) concepts, one a distinct claim and one not. This case requires us to distinguish between the two and to \"identify with care the specific employment practice that is at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Ledbetter, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 624,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556087\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/618/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Morgan,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    at 110-111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The first kind of constructive discharge occurs when an employer subjects an employee to intolerable conditions with the specific discriminatory\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   of forcing the employee to quit. In this situation, the employer has deliberately terminated the employee-a discrete employment action. The discharge is termed \"constructive,\" however, because it is formally effected by\n   the employee's resignation rather than the employer's pink slip. The termination can nevertheless be considered a discriminatory act of the employer because the employer intends to terminate the employee and-through the imposition of intolerable conditions-forces the employee to \"rubberstamp\" that decision by resigning.

In such cases, the constructive discharge should, like a formal discharge, be treated as a distinct cause of action-what we might call a proper \"constructive discharge claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The employer's discriminatory intent sometimes will manifest itself only outside the limitations period. Consider, for example, an employer that demotes an employee (say, from executive to office assistant) for discriminatory reasons and with the intent that the loss of prestige will force the employee to quit. By the time the employee finally cracks and resigns, the discriminatory\n   <em>\n    demotion\n   </em>\n   may be outside the limitations window and not independently actionable.

The resignation cannot be considered an intentionally discriminatory act of the employer because it is not something the employer deliberately brought about; it is simply a later-arising consequence of the earlier discrimination.

It also comports with the default rule that limitations periods start to run when a cause of action accrues. When an employer intends to force an employee to resign, the resignation gives rise to a new cause of action for constructive discharge, with a limitations period that runs from the date of the resignation. But when an employer does not intend to force the employee to resign, the employee's only cause of action is based on the underlying discriminatory acts, and the limitations period runs from the time\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   claim accrued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is thus entirely unnecessary for the majority to abandon the discriminatory-intent requirement in service of the \"standard\" limitations rule. These two rules fit together perfectly once one appreciates the dual nature of constructive discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   It is abundantly clear that the majority has abandoned the discriminatory-intent requirement and would deem a constructive discharge claim timely even if no discriminatory act occurred within the limitations period. The majority admits as much. It declares that the employer's discriminatory conduct and the employee's resignation are both \"part of the 'matter alleged to be discriminatory,' \" and therefore (in its view) the resignation may trigger the limitations period \"\n   <em>\n    whatever\n   </em>\n   the role of discrimination in [the resignation] element.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1777 (emphasis added). To support this dubious proposition, the majority cites\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   's holding that an individual act contributing to a hostile work environment need not be independently actionable for the act to start a fresh limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1777 - 1778. This analogy is particularly inapt because Green's constructive discharge claim is based on a discrete act, not a hostile work environment. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1784. Even setting that aside,\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   held only that an act contributing to a hostile work environment need not be independently actionable by dint of its\n   <em>\n    severity\n   </em>\n   . That is because a hostile work environment claim is based on the \"\n   <em>\n    cumulative\n   </em>\n   effect of individual acts\" that may not \" 'sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII' \" unless considered in the aggregate.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    536 U.S., at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The question therefore is whether Green adduced sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the Postal Service\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to force his resignation when it presented him with the settlement agreement. If so, then the limitations period ran from the date of Green's resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   I have little trouble concluding that Green has carried his burden. Indeed, the Postal Service virtually concedes the point. It observes that the agreement expressly stated that Green\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   retire, and provided for his reporting to duty in Wamsutter, Wyoming, only in the event that the retirement fell through. App. 60-61; Brief for Respondent 33. A jury could reasonably conclude that the Postal Service, by offering Green a choice between retiring and taking a lower paying job hundreds of miles away, intended to make him choose retirement. Accordingly, for summary judgment purposes, the 45-day window for contacting an EEO counselor ran from the date on which Green resigned-or, more precisely, the date on which he gave the Postal Service notice of his retirement, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   I am inclined to agree with Green that-viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to him-he did not give notice of his retirement until he submitted his retirement papers, making his claim timely. Although the settlement agreement provided that he would retire, it alternatively allowed him to transfer to Wyoming. Unless Green would have been turned away from the Wamsutter Post Office despite that language had he chosen to go there, it was not until Green submitted his retirement papers that one could say with certainty that his position would be terminated rather than transferred. That said, like the majority I am content to leave this question for the Tenth Circuit to tackle on remand. I accordingly concur in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    We assume without deciding that it is unlawful for a federal agency to retaliate against a civil servant for complaining of discrimination.

The regulation instructs that the limitations period begins to run when\n   the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" occurs-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the discriminatory conduct of the employer.

This reasoning cannot be reconciled with the regulatory text and fails to grapple with our precedents\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   By isolating Green's late response to the settlement agreement rather than his employer's alleged coercion of Green to sign that agreement, the majority ignores the discriminatory act and bestows on Green an advantage that other employees subject to wrongful discrimination do not have. Had Green signed termination papers rather than settlement papers, there would be no question about the untimeliness of his claims. As in\n   <em>\n    Ricks,\n   </em>\n   the time for Green's claim would have begun to run when his employer discriminated against him, even if the termination was not effective until months later.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715909\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/250/#p262\">\n    449 U.S., at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715909\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/250/#p262\">\n    101 S.Ct. 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Chardon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182311\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/6/\">\n    454 U.S., at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182311\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/6/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).

The majority's rule transforms constructive discharge into a claim focused on the employee's conduct, instead of the employer's. Green does not allege that, after he signed the settlement agreement, any other act-by a supervisor or even a co-worker-occurred or otherwise immediately precipitated his decision to quit. See App. 19, \u00b6\u00b6 83-85. The majority's holding-that Green's claim accrued when he resigned-must rest then on Green's own subjective feelings about the forced settlement. By ignoring the date on which an employer's discriminatory act occurred and instead focusing only on an employee's subjective response to that discriminatory act (see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1779 - 1781), the majority dispenses with the function of an employer's conduct. The effect of the majority's analysis, then, is that constructive discharge no longer involves any sort of objective inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   I cannot agree. The concept of constructive discharge is already on tenuous footing. It is not based on the text of Title VII but instead on the fiction that an employee's resignation can be attributed to his employer in limited circumstances. As initially conceived by the NLRB, this fictitious attribution could be justified if an employer's unlawful employment practice \"\n   <em>\n    standing alone,\n   </em>\n   render[ed] an employee's resignation reasonable and [thus] entitle[d] the employee to backpay.\" Shuck, 23 Berkeley J.
