To fight this problem, all States have laws that prohibit motorists from driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) that exceeds a specified level. But determining whether a driver's BAC is over the legal limit requires a test, and many drivers stopped on suspicion of drunk driving would not submit to testing if given the option. So every State also has long had what are termed \"implied consent laws.\" These laws impose penalties on motorists who refuse to undergo testing when there is sufficient reason to believe they are violating the State's drunk-driving laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the past, the typical penalty for noncompliance was suspension or revocation of the motorist's license. The cases now before us involve laws that go beyond that and make it a crime for a motorist to refuse to be tested after being lawfully arrested for driving while impaired. The\n   question presented is whether such laws violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The problem of drunk driving arose almost as soon as motor vehicles came into use. See J. Jacobs, Drunk Driving: An American Dilemma 57 (1989) (Jacobs). New Jersey enacted what was perhaps the Nation's first drunk-driving law in 1906, 1906 N.J. Laws pp. 186, 196, and other States soon followed. These early laws made it illegal to drive while intoxicated but did not provide a statistical definition of intoxication. As a result, prosecutors normally had to present testimony that the defendant was showing outward signs of intoxication, like imbalance or slurred speech. R. Donigan, Chemical Tests and the Law 2 (1966) (Donigan). As one early case put it, \"[t]he effects resulting from the drinking of intoxicating liquors are manifested in various ways, and before any one can be shown to be under the influence of intoxicating liquor it is necessary for some witness to prove that some one or more of these effects were perceptible to him.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Noble,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037212\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/119/674/#p677\">\n    119 Ore. 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037212\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/119/674/#p677\">\n    250 P. 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 834 (1926).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The 1930's saw a continued rise in the number of motor vehicles on the roads, an end to Prohibition, and not coincidentally an increased interest in combating the growing problem of drunk driving. Jones, Measuring Alcohol in Blood and Breath for Forensic Purposes-A Historical Review, 8 For. Sci. Rev. 13, 20, 33 (1996) (Jones). The American Medical Association and the National Safety Council set up committees to study the problem and ultimately concluded that a driver with a BAC of 0.15% or higher could be presumed to be inebriated. Donigan 21-22. In 1939, Indiana enacted the first law that defined presumptive intoxication based on BAC levels, using the recommended 0.15% standard. 1939 Ind. Acts p. 309; Jones 21. Other States soon followed and then, in response to updated guidance from national organizations, lowered the presumption to a BAC level of 0.10%. Donigan 22-23. Later, States moved away from mere presumptions that defendants might rebut, and adopted laws providing that driving with a 0.10% BAC or higher was\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal. Jacobs 69-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Enforcement of laws of this type obviously requires the measurement of BAC. One way of doing this is to analyze a sample of a driver's blood directly. A technician with medical training uses a syringe to draw a blood sample from the veins of the subject, who must remain still during the procedure, and then the sample is shipped to a separate laboratory for measurement of its alcohol concentration. See 2 R. Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases \u00a7\u00a7 17.03-17.04 (3d ed. 2015) (Erwin). Although it is possible for a subject to be forcibly immobilized so that a sample may be drawn, many States prohibit drawing blood from a driver who resists since this practice helps \"to avoid violent confrontations.\"\n   <em>\n    South Dakota v.

Solomon, Use of Warrants to Reduce Breath Test Refusals: Experiences from North Carolina 1 (No. 811461, Apr. 2011). One such device, called the \"Drunkometer,\" was invented and first sold in the 1930's.

The test subject would inflate a small balloon, and then the test analyst would release this captured breath into the\n   machine, which forced it through a chemical solution that reacted to the presence of alcohol by changing color.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20N.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20302\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20N.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20302\">\n    at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A more practical machine, called the \"Breathalyzer,\" came into common use beginning in the 1950's, relying on the same basic scientific principles. 3 Erwin \u00a7 22.01, at 22-3; Jones 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Over time, improved breath test machines were developed. Today, such devices can detect the presence of alcohol more quickly and accurately than before, typically using infrared technology rather than a chemical reaction. 2 Erwin \u00a7 18A.01; Jones 36. And in practice all breath testing machines used for evidentiary purposes must be approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. See 1 H. Cohen &amp; J. Green, Apprehending and Prosecuting the Drunk Driver \u00a7 7.04[7] (LexisNexis 2015). These machines are generally regarded as very reliable because the federal standards require that the devices produce accurate and reproducible test results at a variety of BAC levels, from the very low to the very high. 77 Fed.Reg. 35747 (2012); 2 Erwin \u00a7 18.07; Jones 38; see also\n   <em>\n    California v.

The subject must take a deep breath and exhale through a mouthpiece that connects to the machine. Berger, How Does it Work? Alcohol Breath Testing, 325 British Medical J. 1403 (2002) (Berger). Typically the test subject must blow air into the device \" 'for a period of several seconds' \" to produce an adequate breath sample, and the process is sometimes repeated so that analysts can compare multiple samples to ensure the device's accuracy.\n   <em>\n    Trombetta, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 481,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p489\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also 2 Erwin \u00a7 21.04[2][b](L), at 21-14 (describing the Intoxilyzer 4011 device as requiring a 12-second exhalation, although the subject may take a new breath about halfway through).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Modern breath test machines are designed to capture so-called \"deep lung\" or alveolar air.\n   <em>\n    Trombetta,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p489\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p489\">\n    at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p489\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Air from the alveolar region of the lungs provides the best basis for determining the test subject's BAC, for it is in that part of the lungs that alcohol vapor and other gases are exchanged between blood and breath. 2 Erwin \u00a7 18.01[2][a], at 18-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When a standard infrared device is used, the whole process takes only a few minutes from start to finish. Berger 1403; 2 Erwin \u00a7 18A.03[2], at 18A-14. Most evidentiary breath tests do not occur next to the vehicle, at the side of the road, but in a police station, where the controlled environment is especially conducive to reliable testing, or in some cases in the officer's patrol vehicle or in special mobile testing facilities. NHTSA, A. Berning et al., Refusal of Intoxication Testing: A Report to Congress 4, and n. 5 (No. 811098, Sept. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because the cooperation of the test subject is necessary when a breath test is administered and highly preferable when a blood sample is taken, the enactment of laws defining intoxication based on BAC made it necessary for States to find a way of securing such cooperation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   So-called\n   \"implied consent\" laws were enacted to achieve this result. They provided that cooperation with BAC testing was a condition of the privilege of driving on state roads and that the privilege would be rescinded if a suspected drunk driver refused to honor that condition. Donigan 177. The first such law was enacted by New York in 1953, and many other States followed suit not long thereafter.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 177-179. In 1962, the Uniform Vehicle Code also included such a provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 179. Today, \"all 50 States have adopted implied consent laws that require motorists, as a condition of operating a motor vehicle within the State, to consent to BAC testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained on suspicion of a drunk-driving offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Missouri v. McNeely,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p1566\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1566,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p1566\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013)(plurality opinion). Suspension or revocation of the motorist's driver's license remains the standard legal consequence of refusal. In addition, evidence of the motorist's refusal is admitted as evidence of likely intoxication in a drunk-driving prosecution. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p1566\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In recent decades, the States and the Federal Government have toughened drunk-driving laws, and those efforts have corresponded to a dramatic decrease in alcohol-related fatalities. As of the early 1980's, the number of annual fatalities averaged 25,000; by 2014, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the number had fallen to below 10,000. Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving 1 (Nov. 1983); NHTSA, Traffic Safety Facts, 2014 Data, Alcohol-Impaired Driving 2 (No. 812231, Dec. 2015) (NHTSA, 2014 Alcohol-Impaired Driving). One legal change has been further lowering the BAC standard from 0.10% to 0.08%. See 1 Erwin, \u00a7 2.01[1], at 2-3 to 2-4. In addition, many States now impose increased penalties for recidivists and for drivers with a BAC level that exceeds a higher threshold. In North Dakota, for example, the standard penalty for first-time drunk-driving offenders is license suspension and a fine. N.D. Cent.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-08-01(5)(a)(1)(Supp.2015); \u00a7 39-20-04.1(1). But an offender with a BAC of 0.16% or higher must spend at least two days in jail. \u00a7 39-08-01(5)(a)(2). In addition, the State imposes increased mandatory minimum sentences for drunk-driving recidivists. \u00a7\u00a7 39-08-01(5)(b)-(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Many other States have taken a similar approach, but this new structure threatened to undermine the effectiveness of implied consent laws. If the penalty for driving with a greatly elevated BAC or for repeat violations exceeds the penalty for refusing to submit to testing, motorists who fear conviction for the more severely punished offenses have an incentive to reject testing. And in some States, the refusal rate is high. On average, over one-fifth of all drivers asked to submit to BAC testing in 2011 refused to do so. NHTSA, E. Namuswe, H. Coleman, &amp; A. Berning, Breath Test Refusal Rates in the United States-2011 Update 1 (No. 811881, Mar. 2014). In North Dakota, the refusal rate for 2011 was a representative 21%.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2. Minnesota's was below average, at 12%.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To combat the problem of test refusal, some States have begun to enact laws making it a crime to refuse to undergo testing. Minnesota has taken this approach for decades. See 1989 Minn. Laws p. 1658; 1992 Minn. Laws p. 1947. And that may partly explain why its refusal rate now is below the national average. Minnesota's rate is also half the 24% rate reported for 1988, the year before its first criminal refusal law took effect. See Ross,\n   Simon, Cleary, Lewis, &amp; Storkamp, Causes and Consequences of Implied Consent Refusal, 11 Alcohol, Drugs and Driving 57, 69 (1995). North Dakota adopted a similar law, in 2013, after a pair of drunk-driving accidents claimed the lives of an entire young family and another family's 5- and 9-year-old boys.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   2013 N.D. Laws pp. 1087-1088 (codified at \u00a7\u00a7 39-08-01(1)-(3)). The Federal Government also encourages this approach as a means for overcoming the incentive that drunk drivers have to refuse a test. NHTSA, Refusal of Intoxication Testing, at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Petitioner Danny Birchfield accidentally drove his car off a North Dakota highway on October 10, 2013. A state trooper arrived and watched as Birchfield unsuccessfully tried to drive back out of the ditch in which his car was stuck. The trooper approached, caught a strong whiff of alcohol, and saw that Birchfield's eyes were bloodshot and watery. Birchfield spoke in slurred speech and struggled to stay steady on his feet. At the trooper's request, Birchfield agreed to take several field sobriety tests and performed poorly on each. He had trouble reciting sections of the alphabet and counting backwards in compliance with the trooper's directions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Believing that Birchfield was intoxicated, the trooper informed him of his obligation under state law to agree to a BAC test. Birchfield consented to a roadside breath test. The device used for this sort of test often differs from the machines used for breath tests administered in a police station and is intended to provide a preliminary assessment of the driver's BAC. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Berger 1403. Because the reliability of these preliminary or screening breath tests varies, many jurisdictions do not permit their numerical results to be admitted in a drunk-driving trial as evidence of a driver's BAC. See generally 3 Erwin \u00a7 24.03[1]. In North Dakota, results from this type of test are \"used only for determining whether or not a further test shall be given.\" N.D. Cent.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-20-14(3). In Birchfield's case, the screening test estimated that his BAC was 0.254%, more than three times the legal limit of 0.08%. See \u00a7 39-08-01(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The state trooper arrested Birchfield for driving while impaired, gave the usual\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, again advised him of his obligation under North Dakota law to undergo BAC testing, and informed him, as state law requires, see \u00a7 39-20-01(3)(a), that refusing to take the test would expose him to criminal penalties. In addition to mandatory addiction treatment, sentences range from a mandatory fine of $500 (for first-time offenders) to fines of at least $2,000 and imprisonment of at least one year and one day (for serial offenders). \u00a7 39-08-01(5). These criminal penalties apply to blood, breath, and urine test refusals alike. See \u00a7\u00a7 39-08-01(2), 39-20-01, 39-20-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although faced with the prospect of prosecution under this law, Birchfield refused to let his blood be drawn. Just three months before, Birchfield had received a citation for driving under the influence, and he ultimately pleaded guilty to that offense.\n   <em>\n    State v. Birchfield,\n   </em>\n   Crim. No. 30-2013-CR-00720 (Dist. Ct. Morton Cty., N.D., Jan. 27, 2014). This time he also pleaded guilty-to a misdemeanor violation\n   of the refusal statute-but his plea was a conditional one: while Birchfield admitted refusing the blood test, he argued that the Fourth Amendment prohibited criminalizing his refusal to submit to the test. The State District Court rejected this argument and imposed a sentence that accounted for his prior conviction. Cf. \u00a7 39-08-01(5)(b). The sentence included 30 days in jail (20 of which were suspended and 10 of which had already been served), 1 year of unsupervised probation, $1,750 in fine and fees, and mandatory participation in a sobriety program and in a substance abuse evaluation.

Aside from noncriminal penalties like license revocation, \u00a7 169A.52, subd. 3, test refusal in Minnesota can result in criminal penalties ranging from no more than 90 days' imprisonment and up to a $1,000 fine for a misdemeanor violation to seven years' imprisonment and a $14,000 fine for repeat offenders, \u00a7 169A.03, subd. 12; \u00a7 169A.20, subds. 2-3; \u00a7 169A.24, subd. 2; \u00a7 169A.27, subd. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The officers asked Bernard to take a breath test.

The officer saw Beylund try unsuccessfully to turn into a driveway. In the process, Beylund's car nearly hit a stop sign before coming to a stop still partly on the public road. The officer walked up to the car and saw that Beylund had an empty wine glass in the center console next to him. Noticing that Beylund also smelled of alcohol, the officer asked him to step out of the car. As Beylund did so, he struggled to keep his balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The officer arrested Beylund for driving while impaired and took him to a nearby hospital. There he read Beylund North Dakota's implied consent advisory, informing him that test refusal in these circumstances is itself a crime. See N.D. Cent.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-20-01(3)(a). Unlike the other two petitioners in these cases, Beylund agreed to have his blood drawn and analyzed. A nurse took a blood sample, which revealed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.250%, more than three times the legal limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Given the test results, Beylund's driver's license was suspended for two years after an administrative hearing. Beylund appealed the hearing officer's decision to a North Dakota District Court, principally arguing that his consent to the blood test was coerced by the officer's warning that refusing to consent would itself be a crime. The District Court rejected this argument, and Beylund again appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed. In response to Beylund's argument that his consent was insufficiently voluntary because of the announced criminal penalties for refusal, the court relied on the fact that its then-recent\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   decision had upheld the constitutionality of those penalties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20ND%2018\">\n    2015 ND 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14-15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889192\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/859/403/#p408\">\n    859 N.W.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408-409.

Petitioners Birchfield and Beylund were told that they were obligated to submit to a blood test, whereas petitioner Bernard was informed that a breath test was required. Birchfield and Bernard each refused to undergo a test and was convicted of a crime for his refusal. Beylund complied with the demand for a blood sample, and his license was then suspended in an administrative proceeding based on test results that revealed a very high blood alcohol level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Despite these differences, success for all three petitioners depends on the proposition that the criminal law ordinarily may not compel a motorist to submit to the taking of a blood sample or to a breath test unless a warrant authorizing such testing is issued by a magistrate. If, on the other hand, such warrantless searches comport with the Fourth Amendment, it follows that a State may criminalize the refusal to comply with a demand to submit to the required testing, just as a State may make it a crime for a person to obstruct the execution of a valid search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Conn.

We therefore consider how the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine applies to breath and blood tests incident to such arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The search-incident-to-arrest doctrine has an ancient pedigree. Well before the Nation's founding, it was recognized that officers carrying out a lawful arrest had the authority to make a warrantless search of the arrestee's person. An 18th-century manual for justices of the peace provides a representative picture of usual practice shortly before the Fourth Amendment's adoption:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"[A] thorough search of the felon is of the utmost consequence to your own safety, and the benefit of the public, as by this means he will be deprived of instruments of mischief, and evidence may probably be found on him sufficient to convict him, of which, if he has either time or opportunity allowed him, he will besure [sic] to find some means to get rid of.\" The Conductor Generalis 117 (J. Parker ed. 1788) (reprinting S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Welch, Observations on the Office of Constable 19 (1754)).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   One Fourth Amendment historian has observed that, prior to American independence, \"[a]nyone arrested could expect that not only his surface clothing but his body, luggage, and saddlebags would be searched and, perhaps, his shoes, socks, and mouth as well.\" W. Cuddihy, The Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning: 602-1791, p. 420 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   No historical evidence suggests that the Fourth Amendment altered the permissible bounds of arrestee searches. On the contrary, legal scholars agree that \"the legitimacy of body searches as an adjunct to the arrest process had been thoroughly established in colonial times, so much so that their constitutionality in 1789 can not be doubted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 752; see also T.

Although the DNA obtained under the law at issue in that case could lawfully be used only for identification purposes, 569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1967-1968, the process put into the possession of law enforcement authorities a sample from which a wealth of additional, highly personal information could potentially be obtained.

Nevertheless, for many, the process is not one they relish. It is significantly more intrusive than blowing into a tube.

See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2166 - 2170. We briefly recapitulate. After pegging inebriation to a specific level of blood alcohol, States passed implied consent laws to induce motorists to submit to BAC testing. While these laws originally provided that refusal to submit could result in the loss of the privilege of driving and the use of evidence of refusal in a drunk-driving prosecution, more recently States and the Federal Government have concluded that these consequences are insufficient. In particular, license suspension alone is unlikely to persuade the most dangerous offenders, such as those who drive with a BAC significantly above the current limit of 0.08% and recidivists, to agree to a test that would lead to severe criminal sanctions. NHTSA, Implied Consent Refusal Impact, pp. xvii, 83 (No. 807765, Sept. 1991); NHTSA, Use of Warrants for Breath Test Refusal 1 (No. 810852, Oct. 2007). The laws at issue in the present cases-which make it a crime to refuse to submit to a BAC test-are designed to provide an incentive to cooperate in such cases, and we conclude that they serve a very important function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Petitioners and Justice SOTOMAYOR contend that the States and the Federal Government could combat drunk driving in other ways that do not have the same impact on personal privacy. Their arguments are unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The chief argument on this score is that an officer making an arrest for drunk driving should not be allowed to administer a BAC test unless the officer procures a search warrant or could not do so in time to obtain usable test results. The governmental interest in warrantless breath testing, Justice SOTOMAYOR claims, turns on \" 'whether the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search.' \"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 2188 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Camara v.

In\n   <em>\n    Robinson,\n   </em>\n   for example, no one claimed that the object of the search, a package of cigarettes, presented any danger to the arresting officer or was at risk of being destroyed in the time that it would have taken to secure a search warrant. The Court nevertheless upheld the constitutionality of a warrantless search of the package, concluding that a categorical rule was needed to give police adequate guidance: \"A police officer's determination as to how and where to search the person of a suspect whom he has arrested is necessarily a quick\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   judgment which the Fourth Amendment does not require to be broken down in each instance into an analysis of each step in the search.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/\">\n    414 U.S., at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; cf.\n   <em>\n    Riley,\n   </em>\n   573 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct., at 2491-2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If police are to have workable rules, the balancing of the competing interests must in large part be done on a categorical basis-not in an ad hoc, case-\n   by-case fashion by individual police officers\" (brackets, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   It is not surprising, then, that the language Justice SOTOMAYOR quotes to justify her approach comes not from our search-incident-to-arrest case law, but a case that addressed routine home searches for possible housing code violations.

But\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   concerned an exception to the warrant requirement-for exigent circumstances-that always requires case-by-case determinations. That was the basis for our decision in that case. 569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1560-1561. Although Justice SOTOMAYOR contends that the categorical search-incident-to-arrest doctrine and case-by-case exigent circumstances doctrine are actually parts of a single framework,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2190 - 2191, and n. 3, in\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   the Court was careful to note that the decision did not address any other exceptions to the warrant requirement, 569 U.S., at ----, n. 3, 133 S.Ct., at 1559, n. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Petitioners and Justice SOTOMAYOR next suggest that requiring a warrant for BAC testing in every case in which a motorist is arrested for drunk driving would not impose any great burden on the police or the courts. But of course the same argument could be made about searching through objects found on the arrestee's possession, which our cases permit even in the absence of a warrant. What about the cigarette package in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ? What if a motorist arrested for drunk driving has a flask in his pocket? What if a motorist arrested for driving while under the influence of marijuana has what appears to be a marijuana cigarette on his person? What about an unmarked bottle of pills?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   If a search warrant were required for every search incident to arrest that does not involve exigent circumstances, the courts would be swamped. And even if we arbitrarily singled out BAC tests incident to arrest for this special treatment, as it appears the dissent would do, see\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2192 - 2194, the impact on the courts would be considerable. The number of arrests every year for driving under the influence is enormous-more than 1.1 million in 2014. FBI, Uniform Crime Report, Crime in the United States, 2014, Arrests 2 (Fall 2015). Particularly in sparsely populated areas, it would be no small task for courts to field a large new influx of warrant applications that could come on any day of the year and at any hour. In many jurisdictions, judicial officers have the authority to issue warrants only within their own districts, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(b); N.D. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(a) (2016-2017), and in rural areas, some districts may have only a small number of judicial officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   North Dakota, for instance, has only 51 state district judges spread across eight\n   judicial districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those judges are assisted by 31 magistrates, and there are no magistrates in 20 of the State's 53 counties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At any given location in the State, then, relatively few state officials have authority to issue search warrants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet the State, with a population of roughly 740,000, sees nearly 7,000 drunk-driving arrests each year. Office of North Dakota Attorney General, Crime in North Dakota, 2014, pp. 5, 47 (2015). With a small number of judicial officers authorized to issue warrants in some parts of the State, the burden of fielding BAC warrant applications 24 hours per day, 365 days of the year would not be the light burden that petitioners and Justice SOTOMAYOR suggest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In light of this burden and our prior search-incident-to-arrest precedents, petitioners would at a minimum have to show some special need for warrants for BAC testing. It is therefore appropriate to consider the benefits that such applications would provide. Search warrants protect privacy in two main ways. First, they ensure that a search is not carried out unless a neutral magistrate makes an independent determination that there is probable cause to believe that evidence will be found.

In order to persuade a magistrate that there is probable cause for a search warrant, the officer would typically recite the same facts that led the officer to find that there was probable cause for arrest, namely, that there is probable cause to believe that a BAC test will reveal that the motorist's blood alcohol level is over the limit. As these three cases suggest, see Part II,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   the facts that establish probable cause are largely the same from one drunk-driving stop to the next and consist largely of the officer's own characterization of his or her observations-for example, that there was a strong odor of alcohol, that the motorist wobbled when attempting to stand, that the motorist paused when reciting the alphabet or counting backwards, and so on. A magistrate would be in a poor position to challenge such characterizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As for the second function served by search warrants-delineating the scope of a search-the warrants in question here would not serve that function at all.

Relying on a recent NHTSA report, petitioner Birchfield identifies 19 strategies that he claims would be at least as effective as implied consent laws, including high-visibility sobriety checkpoints, installing ignition interlocks on repeat offenders' cars that would disable their operation when the driver's breath reveals a sufficiently high alcohol concentration, and alcohol treatment programs. Brief for Petitioner in No. 14-1468, at 44-45. But Birchfield ignores the fact that the cited report describes many of these measures, such as checkpoints, as significantly more costly than test refusal penalties. NHTSA, A. Goodwin et al., Countermeasures That Work: A Highway Safety Countermeasures Guide for State Highway Safety Offices, p. 1-7 (No. 811727, 7th ed. 2013). Others, such as ignition interlocks, target only a segment of the drunk-driver population. And still others, such as treatment programs, are already in widespread use, see\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1-8, including in North Dakota and Minnesota. Moreover, the same NHTSA report, in line with the agency's guidance elsewhere, stresses that BAC test refusal penalties would be\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   effective if the consequences for refusal were made more severe, including through the addition of criminal penalties.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1-16 to 1-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Petitioner Bernard objects to the whole idea of analyzing breath and blood tests as searches incident to arrest. That doctrine, he argues, does not protect the sort of governmental interests that warrantless breath and blood tests serve. On his reading, this Court's precedents permit a search of an arrestee solely to prevent the arrestee from obtaining a weapon or taking steps to destroy evidence. See Reply Brief in No. 14-1470, at 4-6. In\n   <em>\n    Chimel,\n   </em>\n   for example, the Court derived its limitation for the scope of the permitted search-\"the area into which an arrestee might reach\"-from the principle that officers may reasonably search \"the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772077\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/752/#p754\">\n    395 U.S., at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772077\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/752/#p754\">\n    89 S.Ct. 2034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stopping an arrestee from destroying evidence, Bernard argues, is critically different from preventing the loss of blood alcohol evidence as the result of the body's metabolism of alcohol, a natural process over which the arrestee has little control. Reply Brief in No. 14-1470, at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The distinction that Bernard draws between an arrestee's active destruction of evidence and the loss of evidence due to a natural process makes little sense. In both situations the State is justifiably concerned that evidence may be lost, and Bernard does not explain why the cause of the loss should be dispositive. And in fact many of this Court's post-\n   <em>\n    Chimel\n   </em>\n   cases have recognized the State's concern, not just in avoiding an arrestee's intentional destruction of evidence, but in \"evidence preservation\" or avoiding \"the loss of evidence\" more generally.\n   <em>\n    Riley,\n   </em>\n   573 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct., at 2484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Robinson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/\">\n    414 U.S., at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the need to preserve evidence on his person\");\n   <em>\n    Knowles v.

Bernard fails to note the issue that this paragraph addressed.\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   concerned only one exception to the usual warrant requirement, the exception for exigent circumstances, and as previously discussed, that exception has always been understood to involve an evaluation of the particular facts of each case. Here, by contrast, we are concerned with the search-incident-to-arrest exception, and as we made clear in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   and repeated in\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   itself, this authority is categorical. It does not depend on an evaluation of the threat to officer safety or the threat of evidence loss in a particular case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Having assessed the effect of BAC tests on privacy interests and the need for such tests, we conclude that the Fourth Amendment permits warrantless breath tests incident to arrests for drunk driving. The impact of breath tests on privacy is slight, and the need for BAC testing is great.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   We reach a different conclusion with respect to blood tests. Blood tests are significantly more intrusive, and their reasonableness must be judged in light of the availability of the less invasive alternative of a breath test. Respondents have offered no satisfactory justification for demanding the more intrusive alternative without a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Neither respondents nor their\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   dispute the effectiveness of breath tests in measuring BAC. Breath tests have been in common use for many years. Their results are admissible in court and are widely credited by juries, and respondents do not dispute their accuracy or utility. What, then, is the justification for warrantless blood tests?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   One advantage of blood tests is their ability to detect not just alcohol but also other substances that can impair a driver's ability to operate a car safely. See Brief for New Jersey et al. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   9; Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   6. A breath test cannot do this, but police have other measures at their disposal when they have reason to believe that a motorist may be under the influence of some other substance (for example, if a breath test indicates that a clearly impaired motorist has little if any alcohol in his blood). Nothing prevents the police from seeking a warrant for a blood test when there is sufficient time to do so in the particular circumstances or from relying on the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement when there is not. See\n   <em>\n    McNeely,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S., at ---- - ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1568.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   A blood test also requires less driver participation than a breath test. In order for a technician to take a blood sample, all that is needed is for the subject to remain still, either voluntarily or by being immobilized. Thus, it is possible to extract a blood sample from a subject who forcibly resists, but many States reasonably prefer not to take this step. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neville,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p559\">\n    459 U.S., at 559-560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p559\">\n    103 S.Ct. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . North Dakota, for example, tells us that it generally opposes this practice because of the risk of dangerous altercations between police officers and arrestees in rural areas where the arresting officer may not have backup. Brief for Respondent in No. 14-1468, p. 29. Under current North Dakota law, only in cases involving an accident that results in death or serious injury may blood be taken from arrestees who resist. Compare N.D. Cent.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-20-04(1), 39-20-01, with \u00a7 39-20-01.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   It is true that a blood test, unlike a breath test, may be administered to a person who is unconscious (perhaps as a result of a crash) or who is unable to do what is needed to take a breath test due to profound intoxication or injuries. But we\n   have no reason to believe that such situations are common in drunk-driving arrests, and when they arise, the police may apply for a warrant if need be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   A breath test may also be ineffective if an arrestee deliberately attempts to prevent an accurate reading by failing to blow into the tube for the requisite length of time or with the necessary force. But courts have held that such conduct qualifies as a refusal to undergo testing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

There is no indication in the record or briefing that a breath test would have failed to satisfy the State's interests in acquiring evidence to enforce its drunk-driving laws against Birchfield. And North Dakota has not presented any case-specific information to suggest that the exigent circumstances exception would have justified a warrantless search. Cf.\n   <em>\n    McNeely,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S., at ---- - ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1567. Unable to see any other basis on which to justify a warrantless test of Birchfield's blood, we conclude that Birchfield was threatened with an unlawful search and that the judgment affirming his conviction must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Bernard, on the other hand, was criminally prosecuted for refusing a warrantless breath test. That test\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a permissible search incident to Bernard's arrest for drunk driving, an arrest whose legality Bernard has not contested. Accordingly, the Fourth Amendment did not require officers to obtain a warrant prior to demanding the test, and Bernard had no right to refuse it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Unlike the other petitioners, Beylund was not prosecuted for refusing a test. He submitted to a blood test after police told him that the law required his submission, and his license was then suspended and he was fined in an administrative proceeding. The North Dakota Supreme Court held that Beylund's consent was voluntary on the erroneous assumption that the State could permissibly compel both blood and breath tests. Because voluntariness of consent to a search must be \"determined from the totality of all the circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    Schneckloth, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041we leave it to the state court on remand to reevaluate Beylund's consent given the partial inaccuracy of the officer's advisory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We accordingly reverse the judgment of the North Dakota Supreme Court in No. 14-1468 and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

But I dissent from the Court's disposition of\n   <em>\n    Bernard v. Minnesota,\n   </em>\n   No. 14-1470, in which the Court holds that the same exception permits warrantless breath tests.

The Fourth Amendment provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The \"ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is 'reasonableness.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brigham City v.

A citizen's Fourth Amendment right to be free from \"unreasonable searches\" does not disappear upon arrest.

They may want to pat the arrestee down, search her pockets and purse, peek inside her wallet, scroll through her cellphone, examine her car or dwelling, swab her cheeks, or take blood and breath samples to determine her level of intoxication. But an officer is not authorized to conduct all of these searches simply because he has arrested someone. Each search must be separately analyzed to determine its reasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Both before and after a person has been arrested, warrants are the usual safeguard against unreasonable searches because they guarantee that the search is not a \"random or arbitrary ac[t] of government agents,\" but is instead \"narrowly limited in its objectives and scope.\"\n   <em>\n    Skinner v.

In that case, Missouri argued that the natural dissipation of alcohol in a person's blood justified a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement-in essence, a new kind of categorical exception. The Court recognized that exigencies could exist, like in\n   <em>\n    Schmerber,\n   </em>\n   that would justify warrantless searches. 569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1560. But it also noted that in many drunk driving situations, no such exigencies exist.

Both are wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   As discussed above, regardless of the exception a State requests, the Court's traditional framework asks whether, in light of the privacy interest at stake, a legitimate governmental interest ever requires conducting breath searches without a warrant-and, if so, whether that governmental interest is adequately addressed by a case-by-case exception or requires a categorical exception to the warrant requirement. That framework directs the conclusion that a categorical search-incident-to-arrest rule for breath tests is unnecessary to address the States' governmental interests in combating drunk driving\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Beginning with the governmental interests, there can be no dispute that States must have tools to combat drunk driving.

See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2178 - 2179. But it is critical to note that once a person is stopped for drunk driving and arrested, he no longer poses an immediate threat to the public. Because the person is already in custody prior to the administration of the breath test, there can be no serious claim that the time it takes to obtain a warrant would increase the danger that drunk driver poses to fellow citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Second, the Court cites the governmental interest in preventing the destruction or loss of evidence. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2182 - 2183. But neither the Court nor the States identify any practical reasons why obtaining a warrant after making an arrest and before conducting a breath test compromises the quality of the evidence obtained. To the contrary, the delays inherent in administering reliable breath tests generally provide ample time to obtain a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   There is a common misconception that breath tests are conducted roadside, immediately after a driver is arrested. While some preliminary testing is conducted roadside, reliability concerns with roadside tests confine their use in most circumstances to establishing probable cause for an arrest. See 2 R. Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases \u00a7 18.08 (3d ed. 2015) (\"Screening devices are ... used when it is impractical to utilize an evidential breath tester (EBT) (e.g. at roadside or at various\n   work sites)\"). The standard evidentiary breath test is conducted after a motorist is arrested and transported to a police station, governmental building, or mobile testing facility where officers can access reliable, evidence-grade breath testing machinery. Brief for Respondent in No. 14-1618, p. 8, n. 2; National Highway Transportation Safety Admin. (NHTSA), A. Berning et al., Refusal of Intoxication Testing: A Report to Congress 4, and n. 5 (No. 811098, Sept. 2008). Transporting the motorist to the equipment site is not the only potential delay in the process, however. Officers must also observe the subject for 15 to 20 minutes to ensure that \"residual mouth alcohol,\" which can inflate results and expose the test to an evidentiary challenge at trial, has dissipated and that the subject has not inserted any food or drink into his mouth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In many States, including Minnesota, officers must then give the motorist a window of time within which to contact an attorney before administering a test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, if a breath test machine is not already active, the police officer must set it up. North Dakota's Intoxilyzer 8000 machine can take as long as 30 minutes to \"warm-up.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Because of these necessary steps, the standard breath test is conducted well after an arrest is effectuated. The Minnesota Court of Appeals has explained that nearly all breath tests \"involve a time lag of 45 minutes to two hours.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Larson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10658882\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/429/674/#p676\">\n    429 N.W.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676 (Minn.App.1988); see also\n   <em>\n    State v.

Both North Dakota and Minnesota give police a 2-hour period from the time the motorist was pulled over within which to administer a breath test. N.D.

That is particularly true in light of \"advances\" in technology that now permit \"the more expeditious processing of warrant applications.\"\n   <em>\n    McNeely,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S., at ---- - ----, and n. 4, 133 S.Ct., at 1562, and n. 4(describing increased availability of telephonic warrants);\n   <em>\n    Riley,\n   </em>\n   573 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct., at 2493-2494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing jurisdictions that have adopted an e-mail warrant system that takes less than 15 minutes); Minn.

Moreover, counsel for North Dakota explained at oral argument that the State uses a typical \"on-call\" system in which some judges are available even during off-duty times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Where \"an officer can ... secure a warrant while\" the motorist is being transported and the test is being prepared, this Court has said that \"there would be no plausible justification for an exception to the warrant requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    McNeely,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1561. Neither the Court nor the States provide any evidence to suggest that, in the normal course of affairs, obtaining a warrant and conducting a breath test will exceed the allotted 2-hour window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Third, the Court and the States cite a governmental interest in minimizing the costs of gathering evidence of drunk driving. But neither has demonstrated that requiring police to obtain warrants for breath tests would impose a sufficiently significant burden on state resources to justify the elimination of the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. The Court notes that North Dakota has 82 judges and magistrate judges who are authorized to issue warrants. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2180 - 2181. Because North Dakota has roughly 7,000 drunk-driving arrests annually, the Court concludes that if police were required to obtain warrants \"for every search incident to arrest that does not involve exigent circumstances, the courts would be swamped.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2180. That conclusion relies on inflated numbers and unsupported inferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Assuming that North Dakota police officers do not obtain warrants for any drunk-driving arrests today, and assuming that they would need to obtain a warrant for every drunk-driving arrest tomorrow, each of the State's 82 judges and magistrate judges would need to issue fewer than two extra warrants per week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Minnesota has nearly the same ratio of judges to drunk-driving arrests, and so would face roughly the same burden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   These back-of-the-envelope numbers suggest that the burden of obtaining a warrant before conducting a breath test would be small in both States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   But even these numbers\n   <em>\n    overstate\n   </em>\n   the burden by a significant degree. States only need to obtain warrants for drivers who refuse testing and a significant majority of drivers voluntarily consent to breath tests, even in States without criminal penalties for refusal. In North Dakota, only 21% of people refuse breath tests and in Minnesota, only 12% refuse. NHTSA, E. Namuswe, H. Coleman, &amp; A. Berning, Breath Test Refusal Rates in the United States-2011 Update 2 (No. 811881 2014). Including States that impose only\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   penalties for refusal, the average refusal rate is slightly higher at 24%.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 3\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Say that North Dakota's and Minnesota's refusal rates rise to double the mean, or 48%. Each of their judges and magistrate judges would need to issue\n   fewer than one extra warrant a week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   That bears repeating: The Court finds a categorical exception to the warrant requirement because each of a State's judges and magistrate judges would need to issue less than one extra warrant a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Fourth, the Court alludes to the need to collect evidence conveniently. But mere convenience in investigating drunk driving cannot itself justify an exception to the warrant requirement. All of this Court's postarrest exceptions to the warrant requirement require a law enforcement interest separate from criminal investigation. The Court's justification for the search incident to arrest rule is \"the officer's safety\" and the prevention of evidence \"concealment or destruction.\"\n   <em>\n    Chimel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772077\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/752/#p754\">\n    395 U.S., at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772077\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/752/#p754\">\n    89 S.Ct. 2034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's justification for the booking exception, which allows police to obtain fingerprints and DNA without a warrant while booking an arrestee at the police station, is the administrative need for identification.

The Court's justification for the inventory search exception, which allows police to inventory the items in the arrestee's personal possession and car, is the need to \"protect an owner's property while it is in the custody of the police, to insure against claims of lost, stolen, or vandalized property, and to guard the police from danger.\"\n   <em>\n    Colorado v.

If the simple collection of evidence justifies an exception to the warrant requirement even where a warrant could be easily obtained, exceptions would become the rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633863\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/1/#p4\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Finally, as a general matter, the States have ample tools to force compliance with lawfully obtained warrants. This Court has never cast doubt on the States' ability to impose criminal penalties for obstructing a search authorized by a lawfully obtained warrant. No resort to violent compliance would be necessary to compel a test. If a police officer obtains a warrant to conduct a breath test, citizens can be subjected to serious penalties for obstruction of justice if they decline to cooperate with the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   This Court has already taken the weighty step of characterizing breath tests as \"searches\" for Fourth Amendment purposes. See\n   <em>\n    Skinner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032926\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/602/#p616\">\n    489 U.S., at 616-617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032926\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/602/#p616\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is because the typical breath test requires the subject to actively blow alveolar (or \"deep lung\") air into the machine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032926\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/602/#p616\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the process of physically blowing into the machine can be completed in as little as a few minutes, the end-to-end process can be significantly longer. The person administering the test must calibrate the machine, collect at least two separate samples from the arrestee, change the mouthpiece and reset the machine between each, and conduct any additional testing indicated by disparities between\n   the two tests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although some searches are certainly more invasive than breath tests, this Court cannot do justice to their status as Fourth Amendment \"searches\" if exaggerated time pressures, mere convenience in collecting evidence, and the \"burden\" of asking judges to issue an extra couple of warrants per month are costs so high as to render reasonable a search without a warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fourth Amendment becomes an empty promise of protecting citizens from unreasonable searches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   After evaluating the governmental and privacy interests at stake here, the final step is to determine whether any situations in which warrants would interfere with the States' legitimate governmental interests should be accommodated through a case-by-case or categorical exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   As shown, because there are so many circumstances in which obtaining a warrant will not delay the administration of a breath test or otherwise compromise any governmental interest cited by the States, it should be clear that allowing a categorical exception to the warrant requirement is a \"considerable overgeneralization\" here.\n   <em>\n    McNeely,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1561. As this Court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McNeely,\n   </em>\n   any unusual issues that do arise can \"better [be] addressed through consideration of case-specific exceptions to the warrant requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Riley,\n   </em>\n   573 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct., at 2486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    McNeely,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1564(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Without even considering the comparative effectiveness of case-by-case and categorical exceptions, the Court reaches for the categorical search-incident-to-arrest exception and enshrines it for all breath tests. The majority apparently assumes that any postarrest search should be analyzed under the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2195 (\"In the three cases now before us, the drivers were searched or told that they were required to submit to a search after being placed under arrest for drunk driving. We therefore consider how the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine applies to breath and blood tests incident to such arrests\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   But, as we explained earlier, police officers may want to conduct a range of different searches after placing a person under arrest. Each of those searches must be separately analyzed for Fourth Amendment compliance. Two narrow types of\n   postarrest searches are analyzed together under the rubric of our search-incident-to-arrest doctrine: Searches to disarm arrestees who could pose a danger before a warrant is obtained and searches to find evidence arrestees have an incentive to destroy before a warrant is obtained.\n   <em>\n    Chimel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772077\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/752/#p754\">\n    395 U.S., at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772077\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/752/#p754\">\n    89 S.Ct. 2034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other forms of postarrest searches are analyzed differently because they present needs that require more tailored exceptions to the warrant requirement. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2188 - 2189 (discussing postarrest application of the \"exigency\" exception); see also\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2193 - 2194 (discussing postarrest booking and inventory exceptions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The fact that a person is under arrest does not tell us which of these warrant exceptions should apply to a particular kind of postarrest search. The way to analyze which exception, if any, is appropriate is to ask whether the exception best addresses the nature of the postarrest search and the needs it fulfills. Yet the majority never explains why the search-incident-to-arrest framework-its justifications, applications, and categorical scope-is best suited to breath tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   To the contrary, the search-incident-to-arrest exception is particularly ill suited to breath tests. To the extent the Court discusses any fit between breath tests and the rationales underlying the search-incident-to-arrest exception, it says that evidence preservation is one of the core values served by the exception and worries that \"evidence may be lost\" if breath tests are not conducted.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2182 -2183. But, of course, the search-incident-to-arrest exception is concerned with evidence destruction only insofar as that destruction would occur before a warrant could be sought. And breath tests are not, except in rare circumstances, conducted at the time of arrest, before a warrant can be obtained, but at a separate location 40 to 120 minutes after an arrest is effectuated.

But the government's need to conduct a breath test is present only in arrests for drunk driving. And the asserted need to conduct a breath test without a warrant arises only when a warrant cannot be obtained during the significant built-in delay between arrest and testing.

Under that approach, both warrantless breath and blood tests are constitutional because \"the natural metabolization of [BAC] creates an exigency once police have probable cause to believe the driver is drunk.

The Court ruled that \"the natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood\" could not \"categorically\" create an \"exigency\" in every case.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1563. The destruction of \"BAC evidence from a drunk-driving suspect\" that \"naturally dissipates over time in a gradual and relatively predictable manner,\" according to the Court, was qualitatively different from the destruction of evidence in \"circumstances in which the suspect has control over easily disposable evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1561.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Today's decision rejects\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   's arbitrary distinction between the destruction of evidence generally and the destruction of BAC evidence. But only for searches incident to arrest.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2182 - 2184. The Court declares that such a distinction \"between an arrestee's active destruction of evidence and the loss of evidence due to a natural process makes little sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2182. I agree.

But it also \"makes little sense\" for the Court to reject\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   's arbitrary distinction only for searches incident to arrest and not also for exigent-circumstances searches when both are justified by identical concerns about the destruction of the same evidence.\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   's distinction is no less arbitrary for searches justified by exigent circumstances than those justified by search incident to arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The Court was wrong in\n   <em>\n    McNeely,\n   </em>\n   and today's compromise is perhaps an inevitable consequence of that error.

In any event, the Court is wrong to conclude that warrants provide little benefit here.

Virtually all warrants will rely to some degree on an officer's own perception. The very purpose of warrants is to have a neutral arbiter determine whether inferences drawn from officers' perceptions and circumstantial evidence are sufficient to justify a search. Regardless of the particulars, the Court's mode of analysis is a dangerous road to venture down. Historically, our default has been that warrants are required. This part of the Court's argument instead suggests, without precedent, that their value now has to be proven.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
