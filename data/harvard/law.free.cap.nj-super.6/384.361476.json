J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A46\">In February, 1949, the plaintiff Elizabeth B. Ferrari filed her complaint for divorce on the ground of desertion. The defendant failed to file any answer and on June 20, 1949, after hearing, judgment <em>nisi </em>was entered finding the defendant guilty of willful, continued and obstinate desertion and adjudging that the parties be divorced unless sufficient cause be shown why the judgment should not be made absolute within three months from the date thereof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The judgment <em>nisi </em>also directed the defendant to pay the sum of $35 a week for the plaintiff\u2019s support and maintenance and a counsel fee of $350.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">On September 16, 1949, the plaintiff applied for an order vacating the judgment <em>nisi </em>and dismissing her complaint. The defendant sought to oppose the dismissal but the lower Court ruled that he had no standing and granted the plaintiff\u2019s application. On September 20, 1949, a judgment of dismissal was entered and the defendant filed a notice of appeal therefrom. In support of his appeal he asserts that he should have been permitted to establish before the lower Court that the plaintiff was not acting in good faith and that her application for dismissal should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In <em>McLaughlin v. McLaughlin, </em>44 <em>R. I. </em>429, 117 <em>A. </em>649 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1922), the Court, after referring to the strong State policy which favors the continuance of marriage and disfavors divorce, reaffirmed the rule \u201cthat it is error to enter a final decree for divorce against the wish of a petitioner in whose favor a decision has been given.\u201d Within this rule allegations that the plaintiff is acting in bad faith or with ulterior motives have been held insufficient to bar her voluntary dismissal of her action before final judgment. See <em>Nicolai v. Nicolai, </em>283 <em>Mass. </em>241, 186 <em>N. E. </em>240 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1933); <em>Sheffer v. Sheffer, </em>316 <em>Mass. </em>575, 56 <em>N. E. </em>2d 13 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1944); <em>Vinyard v. Vinyard, </em>43 <em>Del. </em>422, 48 <em>A. </em>2d 497 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1946); <em>Di Meglio v. Di Meglio, </em>- <em>R. I. </em>-, 66 <em>A. </em>2d 430 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1949). And the fact that, as an incident to the proceeding, the defendant has made payments pursuant to judgment <em>nisi </em>has likewise been held to be of no significance. See <em>Sheffer v. Sheffer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The defendant refers to <em>Buie 3 </em>:87-5 which provides that the judgment <em>nisi </em>shall become final at the expiration of three months unless, before the expiration of that time, the Court \u201cfor sufficient cause\u201d upon its own motion, or upon the application of any party, whether interested or not, otherwise orders. It seems clear to use that this Rule, which merely followed <em>B, S. </em>2:50-30, was not intended .to alter the' long standing practice in our State which permitted the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>tioner in a divorce proceeding, where no answer had been filed, to \u201cdismiss the suit at any time up to the entry of the final decree.\u201d <em>Child, New Jersey Divorce </em>(1929), <em>p. </em>216. <em>Cf. Rule </em>3 :41-1. Admittedly, the marriage relation between the parties existed notwithstanding the judgment <em>nisi (Sobel v. Sobel, </em>99 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>376, 378 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1926)), and the State\u2019s policy in favor of the continuance of the marriage still applied. Under the circumstances the plaintiff\u2019s timely request for the dismissal of her action constituted sufficient cause within <em>Rule </em>3 :87-5 and the defendant was in no position to oppose it. It may be noted that the Massachusetts and Delaware statutes passed upon in the <em>Sheffer </em>and <em>Vinyard cases </em>contained substantially the identical pertinent language embodied in <em>Rule </em>3 :87-o.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We are satisfied that the action of the lower Court in dismissing the complaint on the plaintiff\u2019s application was proper and did not in any wise prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
