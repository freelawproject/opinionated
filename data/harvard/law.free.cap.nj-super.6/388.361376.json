Appellants argue (1) that the plaintiff failed to establish any fact from which an inference of negligence on the part of the defendants could be drawn; (2) that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law; (3) that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and (4) that the court erred in denying a motion to strike certain testimony of the plaintiff with respect to an alleged conversation between him and the defendant Kerner. No useful purpose will be served in detailing the evidence in this cause. Suffice it to say that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>reading of the record leaves no doubt in our minds but that the question of the negligence of the defendants and the contributory negligence of the plaintiff was properly left with the jury for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"> The plaintiff\u2019s automobile overturned and in the course of his examination he was asked what was the first thing said when he got out of the overturned car and his answer was \u201cAfter I got out I says, \u2018Who is the man that turned me over or cut me off,\u2019 and a fellow standing on the curb said, \u2018It\u2019s me.\u2019 \u201d There was no evidence that the person making this statement was the defendant Kerner and therefore we think that it was error in the absence of proof .of identification to admit this evidence. Under <em>Bule </em>1:2-20 (b), applicable to the Appellate Division under <em>Buie </em>4:2-6, the Appellate Court- will not reverse unless, after examination of the whole case, it appears that the error injuriously affected the substantial rights of a party. The ear driven by Kerner and the plaintiff\u2019s car were the only two at the scene when the accident happened. From the evidence the jury might well find that the accident was caused by the presence of the defendant Miller\u2019s car at a point in fhe highway where it should not have been and that such fact impelled plaintiff, faced, as he thought, with an emergency, to act in the manner that he did. We are satisfied from an examination of the whole case that the erroneous admission in evidence did not injuriously affect the substantial rights of the defendants. <em>Batts v. Newman, Inc., </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>503 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
