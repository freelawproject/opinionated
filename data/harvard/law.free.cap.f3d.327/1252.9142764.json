Cash requested that the district court order the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) to conduct a hearing on her second application for social security benefits, which the ALJ dismissed as barred by res judicata. The ALJ also denied Cash\u2019s implied request to reopen her first application for benefits. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">A. Cash\u2019s First Application for Disability Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">In 1996, Cash filed an application for disability benefits, alleging her disability began on June 1, 1988. This application was denied initially and on reconsideration. It is undisputed that Cash had a right to a hearing before an ALJ on her first application, if she timely requested one. The problem for Cash is that she did not request a hearing before an ALJ or appeal the determination of her first application in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">B. Cash\u2019s Second Application for Disability Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">In 1999, Cash filed a second application for disability benefits, again alleging her disability began on June 1, 1988. The agency staff at the regional level denied Cash\u2019s second application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cash requested reconsideration, and that request also was denied in an agency letter stating, \u201cYou asked us to take another look at your Social Security disability case. Someone who did not make the first decision reviewed your case, including any new facts we received. After reviewing all the information carefully, we found that our first decision [on the second application] was correct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">Cash then requested a hearing before an ALJ as to her second application. The ALJ conducted a hearing on whether Cash\u2019s claim should be reopened but not an evidentiary hearing on the merits of her claim. The ALJ dismissed Cash\u2019s hearing request on the basis of res judicata because he found that Cash\u2019s \u201ccurrent request for hearing involves the rights of the same claimant on the same facts and on the same issues which were decided in the final and binding determination ... made on the [first] application.\u201d Throughout this case in the district court and on appeal, there has been no dispute over the ALJ\u2019s finding that Cash\u2019s second application involved the same facts and issues as her first application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-13\">Apparently in light of Cash\u2019s res judica-ta problem, the ALJ also construed Cash\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>request for a hearing on her second application as an implied request to reopen her first application for benefits. The ALJ then found that there was <em>no </em>good cause to reopen Cash\u2019s first application, pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.987-404.989, because (1) no new and material evidence had been submitted with Cash\u2019s second application and (2) the denial of Cash\u2019s first application was not based on a clerical error or an error on the face of the evidence. The Appeals Council denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">C. Cash\u2019s Petition for Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">Cash then filed this petition for writ of mandamus, which sought an order requiring the ALJ to hold an evidentiary hearing on the merits of her second application. The Commissioner moved to dismiss Cash\u2019s \u201ccomplaint,\u201d arguing that there had been no \u201cfinal decision\u201d by the Commissioner and thus the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. A magistrate judge recommended that Cash\u2019s \u201caction\u201d be dismissed. Over Cash\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed Cash\u2019s \u201caction\u201d for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 405(g). Neither the magistrate judge nor the district court discussed mandamus jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">In the district court and on appeal, the parties focus on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) as the basis for jurisdiction. Thus, we first discuss 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and then mandamus jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-14\">A. Limited Jurisdiction Under \u00a7 405(g)</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-15\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited by the Social Security Act, and judicial review exists only over the \u201cfinal decision of the Commissioner of Social Security.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2002).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Social Security Administration\u2019s regulations provide that the Commissioner may dismiss a hearing request and decline to issue a \u201cfinal decision\u201d if the doctrine of res judi-cata applies in the Commissioner has made a previous decision about the claimant\u2019s rights on the same facts and the same issues, and this previous determination has become final. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.957(c)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cash does not dispute that the two applications involve essentially the same onset date and same facts and issues. Instead, Cash primarily contends that, in considering her hearing request on her second application, the ALJ was estopped from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>applying res judicata because her first application had been <em>defacto </em>reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">As a general matter, district courts do not have jurisdiction over the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to reopen a claim, since such a refusal is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 405(g). <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107-09, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). Instead, a decision refusing to reopen an earlier application ordinarily is considered an interim decision not reviewable under \u00a7 405(g). <em>See, e.g., Loudermilk v. Barnhart, </em>290 F.3d 1265, 1268 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Sherrod v. Chater, </em>74 F.3d 243, 245 (11th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Nonetheless, we have recognized an exception to this rule. Subject matter jurisdiction exists in those cases' where a final decision on a prior \u201csocial security claim is in fact reopened and reconsidered on the merits to any extent on the administrative level.\u201d <em>Sherrod, </em>74 F.3d at 245. Although the ALJ denied her implicit request to reopen, Cash argues that a <em>de facto </em>reopening of her first claim occurred. Thus, our task is to determine whether there was a <em>defacto </em>reopening of Cash\u2019s first application resulting in a new final decision to support jurisdiction under \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">In this case, it is undisputed that the ALJ did not consider the merits of Cash\u2019s second application. Instead, the ALJ did two things. The ALJ looked at Cash\u2019s second application and her prior claim only to the extent required to determine if they involved the same claims, facts and issues. After doing so, the ALJ concluded Cash\u2019s second application was barred by res judicata. Secondly, the ALJ construed the second application as a motion to reopen the final decision on her first application and expressly denied the motion to reopen. The Appeals Council then denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">In prior decisions, this Court has held that no reopening of a prior application occurs and no jurisdiction exists under \u00a7 405(g) to .support judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s and the Appeal Council\u2019s decisions in these circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1233, 1237 (11th Cir. 1991) (stating that, in determining whether res judicata applies, \u201cif the [Commissioner] merely considers newly proffered evidence without reconsidering the merits of the previously denied application, then he has not reopened that application\u201d); <em>Cherry v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 1186, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985) (noting that the Commissioner \u201cmust in fairness look far enough into the proffered factual and legal support [for the first application] to determine whether it is the same claim, and if so, whether it should nevertheless be reopened as a discretionary matter\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">In contrast, when our precedent has concluded that a reopening occurred, the case involved an actual reopening of a prior claim by either the ALJ or the Appeals Council. <em>See, e.g., Wolfe v. Chater, 86 F.3d </em>1072 (11th Cir.1996) (reopening occurred when ALJ, considering third application for benefits, reexamined merits of determination on first and second application concerning claimant\u2019s educational level); <em>Macon v. Sullivan, </em>929 F.2d 1524 (11th Cir.1991) (reopening occurred when Appeals Council reexamined merits of determination on claimants\u2019 first application concerning their status as surviving chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>dren after ALJ denied request for a hearing on basis of res judicata).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">We recognize that Cash argues that, prior to the ALJ\u2019s action in this case, the letters from the regional level of the Social Security Administration indicated that the agency staff had examined and denied her second application on the merits initially and then on reconsideration. Thus, Cash contends there was a <em>de facto </em>reopening of her first application by the agency staff. Our prior above decisions did not detail exactly what had happened at the staff level before the ALJ determined that res judicata barred a claimant\u2019s second application. However, we conclude that those decisions are sufficiently similar to control this case. In addition, the district court has jurisdiction to review only the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, and thus we must look to what the ALJ and the Appeals Council did to determine if a reopening occurred and not to the initial interim decisions at the lower agency levels. Further, the ALJ\u2019s res ju-dicata analysis and review did not constitute a <em>de facto </em>reopening of Cash\u2019s first application. More importantly in this case, the ALJ also construed Cash\u2019s second application as a motion to reopen her first claim and <em>expressly </em>denied Cash\u2019s motion. Given the particular facts in this case, we conclude there was no actual or <em>de facto </em>reopening of the final decision on the first application to serve as a basis for jurisdiction under \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the ALJ\u2019s refusal to reopen was an interim decision, not a final decision, and does not support jurisdiction under \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">B. Jurisdiction Under \u00a7 1361</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, otherwise known as The Mandamus Act, the district court has original jurisdiction over a mandamus action \u201cto compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[Mjandamus is an extraordinary remedy which should be utilized only in the clearest and most compelling of cases.\u201d <em>Carter v. Seamans, </em>411 F.2d 767, 773 (5th Cir. 1969). Although the issuance of a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>mandamus is \u201ca legal remedy, it is dargely controlled by equitable principles and its issuance is a matter of judicial discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">\u201cThe test for jurisdiction is whether mandamus would be an appropriate means of relief.\u201d <em>Jones v. Alexander, </em>609 F.2d 778, 781 (5th Cir.1980). Mandamus relief is only appropriate when: (1) the plaintiff has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) \u201cno other adequate remedy [is] available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Put another way, a writ of mandamus \u201cis intended to provide a remedy for a plaintiff only if he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 616, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984). \u201cIn resolving whether section 1361 jurisdiction is present, allegations of the complaint, unless patently frivolous, are taken as true to avoid tackling the merits under the ruse of assessing jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>609 F.2d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Here, Cash argues that, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b), she was entitled to, and the ALJ had a clear duty to provide her with, a hearing on her second application for benefits because her first application for benefits had been <em>de facto </em>reopened. Given that no <em>de facto </em>reopening of Cash\u2019s first application occurred, we conclude that the ALJ had no clear duty to provide Cash with a hearing on her second application. Thus, the district court also lacked jurisdiction over Cash\u2019s action under \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">. The initial denial letter from the agency staff stated that, \"[bjased on a review of your health problems you do not qualify for benefits on this claim. This is because you are not disabled under our rules.\u201d The letter further explained that, after examining medical records from Pensacola Naval Hospital, Milwaukee Medical Clinic, and Sacred Heart Hospital, the Regional Commissioner had determined that Cash was not disabled at the time she last met the earnings requirement for social security benefits on March 31, 1995. There is no reference to Cash\u2019s first claim in the letter denying her second application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1294-14\">. The reconsideration letter explained that the agency had examined the response of Dr. Lawrence L. Prokop, received on November 30, 1999, and a report from Pensacola Naval Hospital, dated June 3, 1999, in addition to the medical records identified in the initial denial of benefits. The Regional Commissioner then reiterated its determination that Cash was not disabled then on any date through March 31, 1995, when she was last insured for disability benefits. There is also no reference to Cash's first claim in the reconsideration denial of her second application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">. Although Cash styled her complaint as a mandamus petition, Cash did complete and file a \"civil cover sheet\u201d expressly stating she was filing her action pursuant to \"42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">. The decision of the district court as to its subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See, e.g., Sherrod v. Chafer, </em>74 F.3d 243, 245 (11th Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">. Section 405(g) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-10\">Any individual, after any final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Commissioner of Social Security may allow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab8J\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1295-18\">.Section 405(b) of Title 42 mandates an evi-dentiary hearing before an administrative law judge on an original application for benefits if one is timely requested by the claimant. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.929, 404.930. However, an ALJ may dismiss a request for a hearing, <em>inter alia, </em>on res judicata grounds. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.957(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">. <em>See also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.900(a)(5) (defining a final decision for purposes of judicial review as an initial determination that has been pursued through all four steps in the administrative review process); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.903(1) (excluding a denial of a request to reopen a determination from the definition of final determinations, which are subject to judicial review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">. We have recognized a second exception to the general rule that courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to reopen a claim. We have found that subject matter jurisdiction exists when the claimant raises a colorable constitutional issue. <em>Sherrod, </em>74 F.3d at 245. Cash contends that she raises a colorable constitutional claim because she argues that her due process rights were violated when the ALJ denied her an evidentiary hearing on the merits of her second application. However, her due process argument hinges on a finding that a reopening occurred, thus entitling her to a hearing under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.992(b). As we explained, no reopening occurred in Cash\u2019s case. Therefore, Cash has not asserted a colorable constitutional claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">. Other circuits have expressly rejected the argument that a reopening of a prior final decision can occur at a lower level of staff agency review and estop the ALJ and in turn the Commissioner from asserting res judicata and refusing to consider a second application. <em>See Johnson v. Sullivan, </em>936 F.2d 974 (7th Cir.1991); <em>Morris v. Sullivan, </em>897 F.2d 553 (D.C.Cir.1990). At a glance, one circuit decision appears to differ, but the facts there are materially different. <em>See Cleaton v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>815 F.2d 295 (4th Cir. 1987) (not involving a second application at all but addressing the agency and the ALJ examining only the first application a second time). Moreover, the Fourth Circuit appears to have receded somewhat from its earlier approach. <em>See Hall v. Chater, </em>52 F.3d 518, 520-21 (4th Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">.Section 1361 states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-13\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
