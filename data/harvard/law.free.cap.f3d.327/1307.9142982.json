Whether a petition before the Florida Monroe County Career Service Counsel [sic] was a proceeding in a \u201ccourt of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-6\">2. If so, whether the petition was seeking \u201cmoney damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1348-7\"><em>Mosquito Control Dist. of Fla. v. Coregis Ins. Co., </em>281 F.3d 1207, 1208 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">The Florida Supreme Court responded. <em>Coregis Ins. Co. v. Mosquito Control Special Taxing Dist., </em>838 So.2d 1100 (Fla. 2002). It set out the facts as follows: The appellee, Mosquito Control Special Taxing District, a/k/a The Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (\u201cDistrict\u201d), purchased a public officials and employees liability insurance policy from the appellant, Coregis Insurance Company. The policy stated: \u201c[a]s respects Claims for Loss which is covered by this Policy ... [Coregis] shall have the right and duty to select counsel and to defend any Suit.\u201d The policy further defined \u201cclaim\u201d as \u201ca demand for Money Damages as of right,\u201d while \u201cmoney damages\u201d was further defined as \u201cmonetary compensation for past harms or injuries.\u201d The term \u201csuit\u201d was also defined in the policy as \u201ca proceeding in a court of law where Money Damages may be awarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">An employee of the District filed a petition before the Monroe County Career Service Council (\u201cMCCSC\u201d), alleging that the District improperly discriminated against him in employment decisions on the basis of political affiliation. That petition requested declaratory judgments regarding the propriety of the contested employment decisions and sought an award of attorney fees as well as costs incurred in bringing the petition. A related suit was filed in Florida state circuit court at the same time. The District notified Coregis of both the circuit court action and the petition before the MCCSC. Coregis undertook to defend the circuit court action, but it declined to provide a defense before the MCCSC on the ground that the petition was not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">The District then filed the present action against Coregis in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking declaration that the policy required Coregis to provide a legal defense for the claims asserted in the petition before the MCCSC and seeking the recovery of attorney fees incurred by the District in defending itself before the MCCSC. The United States District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the District, holding that the MCCSC qualified as a court of law under the policy and that the petition was a suit seeking money damages in the form of attorney fees. Coregis appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit certified to the Florida Supreme Court the above questions regarding contract interpretation under Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">The Florida Supreme Court responded. 838 So.2d 1100 (Fla 2003). It answered the first certified question in the negative and declined to reach the second certified question. The Court concluded that \u201ccourt of law\u201d was a term of definite legal meaning expressly limited by Article V section 1 of the Florida Constitution, which vests judicial power in designated courts and forbids the establishment of other courts by any political subdivision of municipality. Therefore, it found that the petition before MCCSC was not a proceeding before a \u201ccourt of law\u201d but rather an administrative agency possessing only quasi-judicial powers. It found that the negative answer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>the first question rendered moot the question regarding money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\">The determination of Florida law by the Supreme Court of Florida is determinative of this appeal. Coregis was entitled to a summary judgment. The decision of the United States District Court is therefore REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the District Court with direction to enter summary judgment for Coregis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
