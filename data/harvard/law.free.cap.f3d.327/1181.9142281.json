The district court dismissed his complaint as time barred, and he now appeals <em>pro se. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-19\">\u201cWe independently review the district court\u2019s ruling concerning the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Uboh v. Reno, </em>141 F.3d 1000, 1002 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cFederal courts apply their forum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions to actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Federal law determines when the statute of limitations begins to run. <em>Rozar v. Mull\u00eds, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir.1996). Generally, \u201cthe statute of limitations does not begin to run until the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561-62 (internal marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-20\">Georgia\u2019s statute of limitations is two years. <em>Thigpen v. Bibb County, Ga., Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>223 F.3d 1231, 1243 (11th Cir.2000). Lott was notified by the defendants in September 1998 that he would not be reconsidered for parole until 2006. As of that time he knew, or should have known, all of the facts necessary to pursue a cause of action, but he did not file his complaint until August 10, 2001, more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>two years later. Therefore, his claim was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Lott contends his complaint should not be time barred under the continuing violation doctrine. \u201cThe critical distinction in the continuing violation analysis ... is whether the plaintiff[ ] complaints] of the present consequence of a one time violation, which does not extend the limitations period, or the continuation of that violation into the present, which does.\u201d <em>Knight v. Columbus, Ga., </em>19 F.3d 579, 580-81 (11th Cir.1994) (internal marks omitted). Here, the defendants\u2019 act (deciding not to consider Lovett for parole again until 2006) was a one time act with continued consequences, and the limitations period is not extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Lovett\u2019s final argument is that the untimeliness of his complaint should be excused. He states that he filed his complaint in 2000 but that it was not docketed until later because of delays in the processing of his in forma pauperis paperwork. Because he raises that argument for the first time in his reply brief, it is not properly before us. <em>Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994). Further, the only evidence regarding Lovett\u2019s alleged 2000 complaint is an exhibit to his reply brief, which appears to be from a different case because it contains a different docket number.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
