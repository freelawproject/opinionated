The State argues that the record contained sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict finding Rainey guilty of third-degree assault, as an accomplice, in that she or her boyfriend, Patrick Middlebrook, recklessly created a grave risk of death or serious physical injury to Victim by slamming, hitting, or kicking her. Because the evidence is sufficient to support the jury's verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on an accomplice liability theory, we reverse the trial court's grant of Rainey's motion for judgment of acquittal and remand the case to the trial court for determination of the legal claims in Rainey's motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State charged Rainey with one count of the class A felony of child abuse in violation of \u00a7 568.060.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State alleged that Rainey had recklessly caused Victim to suffer serious physical injury resulting in her death. Following trial, the jury found Rainey guilty of the lesser-included offense of assault in the third\n   degree on a theory of accomplice liability. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court granted Rainey's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Notwithstanding the Verdict of the Jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence adduced at trial favorable to the jury's verdict was as follows. On August 16, 2014, Rainey was living in an apartment with three of her children (including Victim), Middlebrook, and his child. Middlebrook remained at home with Rainey's three children that day while Rainey ran errands. At 11:58 a.m., Rainey left the apartment for about half an hour to do laundry at her father's house roughly six blocks away. While there, Rainey told her father that Victim had some rash or bruises that looked like \"little hickey marks on her face.\" Rainey said that she thought Victim might have \"purpura\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Rainey planned to take Victim to the doctor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Rainey returned to her apartment at 12:33 p.m., she tried to feed Victim lunch, but Victim would not eat. Rainey then put Victim down for a nap about 1:20 p.m. At 1:32 p.m., Rainey left the apartment to finish the laundry; she returned to the apartment at 3:24 p.m. to get her EBT card and left again at 3:25 p.m. because she was meeting Victim's biological father's daughter, Cyile Bernard, at Walmart. Rainey and Bernard shopped at Walmart for roughly 20 minutes. During that time, Rainey told Bernard that Victim was not feeling well and had some red spots on her head. After leaving Walmart, Rainey returned to her father's house to finish the laundry. Her movements on August 16, 2014, were confirmed by the security cameras at her apartment complex and at Walmart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Around 4:15 p.m. that day, Rainey received a telephone call from Middlebrook telling her that Victim was not breathing; Rainey did not ask Middlebrook what had happened but, instead, returned to the apartment. Middlebrook then called 911, and police officers and EMS responded to the call for an unresponsive two-year-old child. EMS noticed that there was lividity in Victim's back, rigor mortis in her jaw, and cyanosis in her fingertips.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Victim had fixed and dilated pupils, indicating a neurological injury, and she had no pulse. EMS noted bruising on Victim's arms, forehead, and chin; a cut on her nose; and blood around her nostrils and lips. EMS declared Victim dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the scene, Rainey told officers that she sometimes left the children alone with Middlebrook but tried to do so only when the children were sleeping so Middlebrook would not be overwhelmed. Rainey said that she had tried to feed Victim that morning, but Victim had not been hungry; Middlebrook fed the children in the afternoon, and Victim ate a few bites of pizza rolls then. Officers noticed what looked like regurgitated pizza rolls near Victim's bed; they smelled like vomit. Rainey also told officers that, when she returned to the apartment briefly to get her EBT card, she had checked in on Victim, who was sleeping and appeared to be breathing. When officers asked Rainey who Victim's\n   biological father was, Rainey hesitated before telling them it was Brian Blackmon; she then said, \"[h]e would be so mad at me.\" Rainey cooperated with police at the scene, speaking with one officer for nearly an hour; Rainey also signed a consent to search and agreed to be transported to the hospital to give a blood sample.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next morning, Rainey went to Bernard's house to tell her that Victim had died and to ask Bernard to accompany Rainey to Blackmon's house. When the women arrived at Blackmon's house, Rainey told Blackmon that Victim had died, and Blackmon collapsed on his porch. Blackmon asked what happened, and Rainey told him she did not know. Rainey then hugged Blackmon and told him, \"Don't worry about this. We still have another [child] we have to take care of.\" Blackmon got angry after that statement and told Rainey to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also that day, August 17, 2014, Dr. Erik Mitchell, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on Victim, finding various bruises on her body as well as fresh bruises on her head. A detective interviewed Rainey later that day and told her that Victim had injuries to her head, nose, mouth, lip, tongue, neck, and leg. Rainey told the detective that she did not know how any of the injuries occurred except for a bruise on Victim's left temple that happened when Victim and Rainey collided in the hallway, causing Victim to bump her head on a door frame.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Mitchell concluded that some of the injuries were not of the type that result from child's play, opining that the number and distribution of the injuries \"indicate that something is happening to this child that is not just play.\" Dr. Mitchell found a blood clot under Victim's skull that was consistent with head trauma. He concluded that Victim's cause of death was head trauma and that the manner of death was homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A few days after Victim's death, Rainey told Bernard that Victim died of \"a blood clot in her brain\" and that it was hereditary. At Victim's funeral, Bernard asked Rainey about visible bruises on Victim's head and cheekbones; Rainey again told Bernard that Victim died of a hereditary blood clot on the brain. At some point, Rainey told a police officer that \"she believed a ghost may have harmed her baby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the completion of the investigation, Rainey was arrested at her mother's home in Nebraska and transported back to Missouri. Following her arrest, Rainey called Middlebrook from jail and told him to stay strong and that she loved him, and she further instructed him not to talk about the case because the police were trying to play them against each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defense counsel moved for acquittal at the close of the State's evidence and again at the close of all evidence, but the trial court denied both motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury received the following relevant instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [No. 5]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A person is responsible for her own conduct and she is also responsible for the conduct of another person in committing an offense if she acts with another person with the common purpose of committing that offense or if, for the purpose of committing that offense, she\n   aids or encourages the other person in committing it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [No. 7]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   If you do not find the defendant guilty of abuse of a child as submitted in Instruction No. 6, you must consider whether she is guilty of assault in the third degree under this instruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   If you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   First, that on or about August 16, 2014, in the County of Buchanan, State of Missouri, the defendant or Patrick Middlebrook recklessly created a grave risk of death or serious physical injury to [Victim] by slamming, hitting or kicking [Victim],\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   then you are instructed that the offense of assault in the third degree has occurred, and if you further find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, that with the purpose of promoting or furthering the commission of that assault in the third degree, the defendant acted together with or aided Patrick Middlebrook in committing the offense, then you will find the defendant guilty of assault in the third degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   However, unless you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt each and all of these propositions, you must find the defendant not guilty of that offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [No. 8]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A person acts \"recklessly\" as to causing serious physical injury if he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his conduct will result in serious physical injury and such disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The jury found Rainey guilty of assault in the third degree under a theory of accomplice liability. Rainey filed a timely Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Notwithstanding the Verdict of the Jury or, in the Alternative, for a New Trial. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court granted Rainey's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Notwithstanding the Verdict of the Jury and entered a judgment acquitting Rainey of assault in the third degree. The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   All right. The Court is actually going to sustain the motion and I'll make that basis-I'll tell you why. It was apparent-in considering the defendant's motion and evidence presented at trial, it was apparent to the Court that the jury's questions during deliberation that they were struggling with the concept of accomplice liability in this case and holding the defendant responsible for the abuse of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A separate jury found the defendant Patrick Middlebrook, guilty of abuse of a child [on] the evidence in that trial. And this defendant's trial supported that inference, that Patrick Middlebrook committed the acts of abuse resulting in the death of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The issue for the jury in this case, in Ms. Rainey's case, was whether or not on August 16, 2014 did she act with Defendant Middlebrook with the common purpose of committing the offense of abuse of a child or did she aid or encourage Defendant Middlebrook in committing that offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   And the jury answered the questions on the submitted case of abuse of a child by saying \"No,\" that she was not guilty of that charge, and returned a verdict as\n   such.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   They then went on and considered a lesser-included offense, a submission of assault in the third degree, a misdemeanor offense, which the jury did find the defendant guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   However, that finding would require the same finding, either she acted together with Defendant Middlebrook with the common purpose of committing that offense or that she aided or encouraged him in committing that abuse of a child.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   In reviewing the evidence post-trial and in considering defendant's post-trial motion of a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the jury's verdict, the Court reviewed the evidence extensively and the Court does not believe in hindsight that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury finding [Rainey] guilty-not only of abuse of a child, but also the lesser-included offense of assault in the third degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The evidence really came down to a-the speculation as to whether or not Rainey was lying with regards to her conduct on the date of the offense. I think the evidence pretty clearly indicated-the State's theory was that she had lied-she lived at the home with the child and Defendant Middlebrook, only her and Defendant Middlebrook had access to the child, and-but, however, the State's evidence also showed no evidence that she was present when the offense was committed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The only logical inference-in fact, I think that was argued in the Middlebrook trial as well as this trial that she likely was not present during the time when the assault occurred. And I think that's what-the logical inference from the evidence presented was that she was not present. So it really came down to whether or not she was responsible for the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   And the State's theory that was argued at trial, which the Court considered at the time and questioned at the time, was the idea that perhaps she was lying with regards to her conduct and whether or not she was lying about when she returned to the home at-I believe it was 3:25-or 3:24 and left at 3:25 and then the 911 call came about 48 minutes later, I believe, maybe longer, that somehow she lied and that based on that lie that she should be found guilty as an accomplice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   However, in reviewing it I don't see any clear evidence that she was lying. It was-to me, it was essentially speculation as to whether or not she was lying about the events and what she observed\n   with Mr. Middlebrook's action on that date. And I don't believe that's sufficient evidence for the jury to make a finding of the defendant's guilt of the underlying offense of the misdemeanor finding of assault in the third degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   And so the Court is granting the defendant's judgment or-judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict of the jury. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As a result of its ruling on the motion for acquittal, the trial court did not address Rainey's alternative motion for new trial. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Where, as here, a trial court grants a motion for judgment of acquittal notwithstanding a jury's guilty verdict because the court believed the evidence to be insufficient to support the verdict, the issue on review \"is whether ... the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, was sufficient for reasonable persons to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt with matters of credibility and inconsistencies in testimony being left to the jury's consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 565.070.1(4) states that \"[a] person commits the crime of assault in the third degree if ... [t]he person recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death or serious physical injury to another person[.]\" \"A person 'acts recklessly' ... when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, and such disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation.\" \u00a7 562.016.4.

App. S.D. 2000) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this case, both sides agree that the evidence does not support an inference that Rainey slammed, hit, or kicked Victim, causing her death. The disputed issue is whether the evidence supports an inference that Rainey, with the purpose of promoting or furthering the commission of assault in the third degree, acted together with or aided Middlebrook in committing the offense. The State identifies nine pieces of evidence supporting Rainey's guilt: (1) Rainey and Middlebrook were the only adults present with Victim the day she died; (2) Victim had multiple injuries, both old and new, on her body, including injuries that were not the result of normal child's play; (3) Rainey tried to explain away some of Victim's injuries when Rainey spoke with her father and Bernard before Victim died; (4) Rainey did not ask Middlebrook what had happened when he\n   called to tell her that Victim was not breathing; (5) Rainey told police that Blackmon would be mad at her about Victim's death; (6) Rainey told Blackmon not to worry because they had another child to raise; (7) Rainey told Bernard that Victim died of a hereditary blood clot ; (8) Rainey later told police that she believed a ghost might have harmed Victim; and (9) Rainey told Middlebrook not to talk about what happened so police would not be able to play them against one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To begin, there was evidence that Rainey was present at the scene both before and after the crime occurred.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [W]hile the mere presence of an accused at the scene of a crime will not sustain a conviction, presence may be considered along with other incriminating evidence to determine if the\n   <em>\n    total circumstances raise a reasonable inference\n   </em>\n   that the accused was a participant in the offense charged. Presence, companionship and conduct before and after the offense are also circumstances from which one's participation in the crime may be inferred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9942836\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/651/550/#p554\">\n    651 S.W.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554 (Mo. App. W.D. 1983) (emphasis in original). In addition to her presence at the scene, Rainey continued to associate herself with Middlebrook even after Victim's death as evidenced by her post-arrest call to him, during which she told him to stay strong, that she loved him, and that he should not talk about the case because the police were trying to play them against each other. From this evidence, the jury could have reasonably inferred that Rainey was attempting to cover for her own involvement in the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, the evidence showed that Rainey told officers that, though she sometimes left the children alone with Middlebrook, she tried to do so only when the children were sleeping so Middlebrook would not be overwhelmed, thereby suggesting her awareness that Middlebrook posed a risk of harm to the children if he became overwhelmed. Additionally, Victim had multiple injuries, both old and new, on her body, including injuries that were not the result of normal child's play, which supported an inference that either Middlebrook or Rainey caused some of Victim's older injuries. And, on the day Victim died, Rainey told both her father and Bernard that Victim was not feeling well and had a rash, which demonstrated that Rainey was aware of or concerned about Victim's existing injuries and yet failed to seek help for Victim, thereby deflecting attention away from her role in the injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The evidence also showed a consciousness of guilt. Rainey did not ask Middlebrook what had happened when he called to tell her that Victim was not breathing. Rainey told police that Blackmon would be mad at her about Victim's death, and she told Blackmon not to worry because they had another child to raise. Rainey twice told Bernard that Victim died of a hereditary blood clot even though she knew otherwise, as the police had previously discussed the autopsy results with Rainey, and Rainey later told police that she believed a ghost might have harmed Victim. From this evidence, the jury could have reasonably inferred consciousness of guilt in that (1) Rainey did not have to ask Middlebrook what had happened to Victim because Rainey already knew; (2) Rainey feared that Blackmon would be \"mad at her\" because of her role in Victim's death; and (3) Rainey continued to offer alternative and implausible explanations of Victim's death to cover up her own involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict and leaving matters of credibility to the jury's consideration, we hold that there was sufficient evidence for reasonable persons to find Rainey guilty of third-degree assault beyond a reasonable doubt on a theory of\n   accomplice liability. Considered together, Rainey's presence at the scene and association with Middlebrook both before and after the crime, her failure to seek help despite her awareness of Victim's injuries, and her statements about false or implausible alternative causes of Victim's injuries and death are all sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Rainey affirmatively participated in the third-degree assault of Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, Rainey testified at trial, allowing the jury to observe her and assess her credibility. There was evidence that she was dishonest about both the source of Victim's injuries and the cause of her death. On that basis, the jury apparently determined that Rainey was dishonest about either her participation in the crime or her discovery of Victim's death. As its verdict indicates, the jury chose to disregard Rainey's testimony that she did not know how Victim had received most of her injuries and that Rainey had checked on Victim before heading to Walmart at which time Victim appeared to be fine. Credibility is an issue for the jury, and this jury did not find Rainey's explanations credible. Given the evidence described above, combined with a credibility determination that Rainey's exculpatory testimony was untruthful, the evidence was sufficient to support the inference that Rainey was present at or near the time of Victim's assault, that Rainey failed to seek help for Victim despite her awareness that Victim had been injured, that Rainey made statements demonstrating a consciousness of guilt, that she continued to associate with Middlebrook after Victim was injured, and that Rainey encouraged him to remain silent so that they each could avoid criminal liability. Contrary to the trial court's conclusion, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's determination of guilt. Point I is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   There was sufficient evidence for reasonable persons to find Rainey guilty of third-degree assault beyond a reasonable doubt on a theory of accomplice liability.
