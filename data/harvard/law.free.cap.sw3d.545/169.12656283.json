Edwards, inherited from his mother. Like some cases of this type, the relatively straightforward contract issues blur because of the inaccuracies in mass produced loan documents and foreclosure paperwork. Nonetheless, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   James T. Edwards inherited a house in Trophy Club, Texas, from his mother, Ruth Edwards. Sometime after her death, Bank of America, N.A., the successor of Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP, filed suit to foreclose on the property. The suit claimed that a \"home equity loan agreement\" created under the TEX.CONST. art. XVI, \u00a7 50 (a)(6), and secured by a deed of trust on the property, was in arrears. Edwards filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   unverified answer that asserted the signature on the promissory note was not that of Ruth Edwards. He also claimed that any Texas home equity loan must be executed in the offices of a lawyer, lender, or title company to be valid, and this loan was not so executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) was substituted as plaintiff. It filed an amended petition claiming that Ruth Edwards executed a promissory note (the Note) secured by a deed of trust, omitting any reference to a home equity loan or the Texas Constitution. The amended petition alleged that Ruth passed away in 2009, and that Edwards held title to the property through a general warranty deed dated May 13, 2010. As of the date of the amended petition, fifty-two monthly payments had not been made. Fannie Mae sought a declaration establishing its lien, as well as judicial foreclosure of the lien. The amended petition attached the Note and Deed of Trust that require further discussion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Note is dated \"March 15, 2007,\" and contains Ruth's promise to pay $156,500.00 along with interest to the original lender in monthly installments of $963.60, beginning\n   May 1, 2007. The final payment was due April 1, 2037. The Note refers to a property address of \"308 Village Trl., Trophy Club, Texas.\" The Note also refers to a deed of trust, dated the same date as the Note, which secures the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Deed of Trust has a type written date on the first page of \"March 6, 2007,\" but Ruth actually signed the document on March 15, 2007. The Deed of Trust refers to a note, dated \"March 6, 2007,\" with the principal sum of $158,400.00 and a final payment date of April 1, 2037. The Deed of Trust transfers the rights to property at \"308 Village Trl, Trophy Club, Texas\" (and provides the legal description of the same). The Deed of Trust further describes the note as a renewal and extension of a previous 2003 note, but expressly disclaims that the note is a home equity loan as defined by Section 50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ruth apparently had three living children at the time of her death in 2009. Two of Edwards' siblings filed a general warranty deed conveying their interest in the Trophy Club property to him. The warranty deed states that Edwards would assume the obligations under the promissory note dated \"March 15, 2007\" and in the principal amount of \"$156,500.00.\" The date and loan amount are handwritten into the deed, with the original typed date of \"March 6, 2007\" and the original typed loan amount of \"$158,400.00\" having been struck through.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fannie Mae filed a traditional motion for summary judgment seeking judicial foreclosure on the property. The motion was supported in part by the affidavit of Amy D. Gauthier a \"foreclosure specialist\" for Seterus, Inc., which she identifies as the mortgage servicer for Fannie Mae. She attached as business records several documents in Seterus's file, including the Note. She similarly identified the Deed of Trust that was executed \"[i]n conjunction with the Note.\" The affidavit attaches additional records showing that Edwards stopped making payments in 2011, and paperwork documenting the notice of default and acceleration of the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gauthier's affidavit makes one other assertion important to this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about March 15, 2005, Ruth Edwards executed a\n   <em>\n    Texas Home Equity Note\n   </em>\n   ('Note') in the amount of $156,500.00 originally payable to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. [Emphasis added].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Edwards filed a response to the summary judgment, pointing out discrepancies in the documents attached to Fannie Mae's own motion. Edwards highlighted the statement in Gauthier's affidavit describing the loan as a \"Texas Home Equity Loan executed on March 15, 2007.\" The Deed of Trust refers to a Note dated March 6, 2007. The Deed of Trust also expressly states that the Loan is not a Texas Home Equity Loan. Given these variances, Edwards claims the Note referred to in the Deed of Trust cannot be the same note attached to the summary judgment motion and made the basis of the lawsuit. Edwards then claimed that Fannie Mae failed to produce a note tied to its Deed of Trust, and the deed is therefore not enforceable. He also claimed that if the Note is indeed a home equity loan, it is not enforceable because it was not signed in the office of a lender, attorney, or title company, as required by the Texas Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, Edwards' response included his own declaration which states in relevant part, \"I am familiar with my deceased mother, Ruth Edwards' signature. The signature purporting to be her signature on the last page of the Note dated March 15, 2007 and attached as Exhibit A-l to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is not\n   my mother's signature.\" The trial court granted the motion and this appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We review a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins.

Once the movant establishes its right to summary judgment, the burden then shifts to the non-movant to present evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact, thereby precluding summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9947817\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/589/671/#p678\">\n    589 S.W.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678 (Tex. 1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    PROPRIETY OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Edwards presents three issues on appeal. He contends Fannie Mae failed to prove its entitlement to summary judgment because: (1) the Note and Deed of Trust are not clearly linked to one another; (2) Edwards denied that the signature on the Note was that of his mother; and (3) Fannie Mae's affiant claimed the Note was a home equity loan, and if so, it was not executed in the office of an attorney, lender, or title company, as required by the Texas Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Is There A Missing Note?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Edwards first issue argues that Fannie Mae's own evidence, and particularly the discrepancies in that evidence, suggest the existence of another note. If so, then Fannie Mae's summary judgment motion failed to produce the note that is tied to its Deed of Trust such that any lien purportedly created by the deed is unenforceable. The summary judgment record reflects potential discrepancies on two levels. The first is in the transactional documents themselves. The Deed of Trust refers to a note dated March 6, 2007 when the Note sued upon is dated March 15, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second arises from the affidavit used to support the summary judgment (stating the Note to be a Texas home equity loan), compared to the Deed of Trust (expressly disclaiming the same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before addressing the merits, however, we turn to Fannie Mae's claim that the argument is waived. Fannie Mae contends that because Edwards did not object to the summary judgment evidence, any challenge to the authenticity of the Note is forfeited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calvillo v. Carrington Mortg. Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804413\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/487/626/#p633\">\n    487 S.W.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2015, pet. denied) (holding that debtor who failed to object to note waived any complaint on appeal concerning authenticity or trustworthiness). We agree with that argument as far as it goes, but Edwards is not by virtue of the discrepancies\n   challenging the authenticity of the Note attached to the summary judgment record. Rather, he contends that the discrepancies suggest there is some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   note to which the Deed of Trust is tied, and without proof of default of that note, Fannie Mae has not met its summary judgment burden of proof. The question before us, then, is whether the discrepancies create a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of another note. In response to that argument, Fannie Mae contends these discrepancies are nothing more than typographical errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As long as scriveners have plied their trade, there have undoubtedly been typographical errors. While sometimes nothing more a mere annoyance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   occasionally those errors have blossomed into legal disputes. In\n   <em>\n    Neese v. Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2223159\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex/77/348/\">\n    77 Tex. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20S.W.%2065\">\n    14 S.W. 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1890), for instance, the court confronted two notes which referred to the same deed. One note stated the land securing the loan contained 90 acres while the other note claimed 93 acres. The court concluded the discrepancy as to the number of acres was \"immaterial,\" because the metes and bounds description left no doubt the \"same land is meant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20S.W.%2065\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20S.W.%2065\">\n    at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Typographical errors have also reared their ugly head in the legal description of property-a potentially dangerous occurrence given that a party cannot foreclose a lien when the deed does not describe the land conveyed.\n   <em>\n    Cushing v. Riddel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10313075\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/255/479/#p480\">\n    255 S.W. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480 (Tex.Civ.App.-El Paso 1923, no writ). Yet a debtor cannot forestall foreclosure based on a \"trivial\" discrepancy that \"deceived no one.\"\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v. Buel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10313931\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/287/683/#p685\">\n    287 S.W. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1926, no writ) (noting trivial discrepancy in description of land). Similarly, discrepancies between a judgment and abstract of the judgment of a minor nature, including a date off by a few days, do not affect a judgment lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10172658\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/333/892/#p894\">\n    333 S.W.2d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 894 (Tex.Civ.App.-Eastland 1960, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (discrepancy of three days);\n   <em>\n    Guar. State Bank of Donna v. Marion Cnty. Nat'l Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10293392\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/293/248/#p248\">\n    293 S.W. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1927, no writ) (discrepancy of three days).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The date discrepancy between the Note and Deed of Trust similarly falls into this immaterial category. The documents contain enough other connections that we can say they unquestionably reference each other. The maker and borrower referred to in both documents is the same. The final installment payment date referred to in both documents is also the same. The documents were both executed at the same time. And both documents reference the exact same piece of property. The difference in date is analogous to that addressed in\n   <em>\n    Rosestone Properties, Inc. v. Schliemann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9926004\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/662/49/#p51\">\n    662 S.W.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51-52 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e). There, the defendant obtained title to property under a warranty deed. The deed included an assumption clause whereby the defendant agreed to take over the payment of a note. The stated date of the note in the assumption clause was wrong-stating the wrong year of the loan-but otherwise, the amount of the loan, the parties, and the subject property were all the same. The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The complaint regarding the erroneous date of the promissory note in the assumption clause unquestionably has reference to the original promissory note. If the instrument containing the reference has enough information to enable\n   one, by pursuing an inquiry based upon the information contained therein, to identify the particular properly to the exclusion of all others, the reference and description are sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maupin v.

Rather, he argues it creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Note attached to the motion is the one referenced by the Deed of Trust. We find that position unavailing. The statement in the affidavit was a superfluous descriptor of the Note, which is otherwise\n   clearly identified as a specifically numbered exhibit. The affiant attached the Note as \"Exhibit A-1,\" correctly stating it was dated March 15, 2007, in the amount of $156,500.00, and payable to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.

Edwards' forgery claim is based on two statements: (1) that he is familiar with his mother's signature; and (2) that the signature on the Note attached to the summary judgment is not her signature. He provides no additional explanation for these statements. We conclude that both are conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, Edwards provides no factual basis for how he is familiar with his mother's signature. While we do not doubt that many children are well acquainted with a parent's handwriting, they usually have some basis for that knowledge. They have gone through their parents' papers, or they regularly exchanged handwritten notes. TEX.R.EVID. 901(b)(2) permits a non-expert to testify that handwriting is genuine based on familiarity with the handwriting that was not acquired for the current litigation. Early cases focused on the basis for that familiarity.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Joffre v.

It does not explain what unique qualities of his mother's signature were missing or different on the Note. Cases finding lay testimony sufficient include something more than a simple claim the signature is forged.

(mem.op.), for instance, the affiant raised a genuine issue of material fact by stating that the signature affixed to the credit application was not his signature\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   he never signed the document. This court in\n   <em>\n    In re Est. of Swanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274754\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/130/144/#p148\">\n    130 S.W.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2003, no pet.) held that one sister's unequivocal testimony that she knew her sister's signature, and that the signature on the will was not her sister's, raised a fact issue precluding summary judgment.

(mem. op.), the court held a son's testimony that he was familiar with his father's signature and the signature on a will was not his father's was some evidence of a forged signature. The son's testimony described changes in the father's signature as his handwriting began to go \"downhill.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201274059\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also based his opinion on several other documents with the father's signature, all of record, by which the jury could have made the same comparison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Conversely, bare opinions that a signature is a forgery are insufficient.
