Healey raises five points on appeal, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial court's denial of his requests for a jury trial and to remove the case from the trial docket, the trial court's alleged bias against Healey, and the validity of the sale. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
