The first is procedural: Did ACT Pipe and Supply, Inc., in defending a favorable judgment notwithstanding the jury's verdict, successfully raise a \"cross-point\" in the court of appeals that preserved an alternative argument proscribing the jury's original verdict? We say yes-ACT did not formally label its argument a \"cross-point,\" but the substance of that argument, if accepted, would nonetheless vitiate the jury's original verdict. The second presents an issue of statutory interpretation: Are attorney's fees recoverable for a claim brought under the Texas Construction Trust Fund Act? Our answer is no-neither the Act nor Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 38.001 specifically provides for attorney's fees, so they are unavailable. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals' judgment in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal stems from a billing dispute between a general contractor and a pipe supplier. Dudley Construction, Ltd., the general contractor, enlisted ACT Pipe and Supply, Inc., as a supplier for two municipal water- and sewer-improvement projects: the Reclaimed Water Project in College Station and the Tabor Project in Bryan. This dispute primarily concerns the Tabor Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To assist Dudley in bidding for the Tabor Project, ACT's operations manager, Mark Stroud, quoted prices for the \"slip-joint\" pipe Dudley anticipated using for the project at $95 per unit of 36-inch and $74.53 per unit of 30-inch pipe. Dudley won the contract, and Stroud ordered the slip-joint pipe from ACT's manufacturer to lock in the quoted prices and ensure timely delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After Stroud placed the order, however, the city rejected the proposed use of slip-joint pipe, insisting the project required \"restrained-joint\" pipe. Stroud provided Dudley a second proposal, quoting the city's preferred pipe at a more-expensive price of $109.71 per unit of 36-inch and $82 per unit of 30-inch pipe. The city approved Dudley's revised proposal, but ACT never modified the original slip-joint purchase order with the pipe manufacturer. Consequently, Dudley received slip-joint rather than restrained-joint pipe at the job site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dudley's project manager, Michael Ham, informed Stroud that Dudley had received the wrong pipe. Stroud advised Ham that restrained-joint pipe was available at a higher cost, but Ham insisted ACT supply the restrained-joint pipe at the same price ACT quoted for the slip-joint pipe. Dudley's owner, Richard Dudley, began working with ACT's regional manager, Curt Murray, to resolve the dispute. After reviewing the project plans, Murray told Dudley he believed that slip-joint pipe met the project's specifications and was allowed under the contract, the city's objections notwithstanding. Dudley subsequently took the position with the city that the Tabor Project contract did not specify which pipe must be used and that slip-joint pipe was adequate. The city relented, agreeing to Dudley's use of slip-joint\n   pipe so long as it was reinforced by external restraints. Dudley agreed. Accordingly, Dudley installed the errantly ordered slip-joint pipe it had already received along with $17,500 worth of external restraints ACT supplied at no cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dudley and ACT could not, however, agree on how much Dudley owed for the pipe. Dudley signed a purchase order on September 14, 2011, for the slip-joint pipe that was ultimately used at the originally quoted price of $95 and $74.53 per 36- and 30-inch unit, respectively. But after the project's completion, ACT billed Dudley for restrained-joint pipe at the second proposal's higher cost. Murray testified at trial that the parties verbally agreed to use the higher-quoted prices to offset cost reductions for pipe used in the Reclaimed Water Project. Dudley denied any such agreement, but nonetheless submitted ACT's invoices for both projects to the cities, which paid Dudley for the full amounts ACT sought. Dudley deposited these payments in its account, but citing the ongoing dispute, paid ACT nothing for either project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ACT sued Dudley on a sworn account for $143,714.19, the total it claims Dudley owes it for the Tabor and Reclaimed Water projects. Because Dudley did not pay ACT after the cities paid Dudley the amounts due on ACT's invoices, ACT also alleged misapplication of trust funds under the Texas Construction Trust Fund Act. As to ACT's sworn-account claims, the jury found that the prices ACT charged were \"in accordance with the agreement\" for the Reclaimed Water Project and awarded ACT $14,214.20. For the Tabor Project, however, the jury answered that the prices ACT charged were not \"in accordance with the agreement,\" but nonetheless awarded ACT $110,629.70 for \"reasonable compensation.\" The jury also found ACT perfected a bond-payment claim and awarded the same damages as ACT's sworn-account claims. Finally, the jury found that Dudley misapplied trust funds under the trust-fund act but awarded no corresponding damages to compensate ACT for either project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ACT moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. It urged the trial court to change the jury's answer to the sworn-account liability question for the Tabor Project. ACT argued the $110,629.70 damages award necessitated a finding that ACT had indeed charged Dudley \"in accordance with the agreement.\" ACT also encouraged the trial court to disregard the jury's finding that it was not entitled to damages in light of the jury's finding that Dudley misapplied trust funds. ACT asked the trial court to instead substitute the $110,629.70 in damages the jury found for its sworn-account and bond-payment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court granted ACT's motion and issued a final judgment. In its judgment, the court set aside the jury's liability finding on ACT's sworn-account claim for the Tabor Project, instead concluding it was \"conclusively proven\" that the prices charged by ACT were in accordance with the parties' agreement. The trial court further found that ACT's damages were uncontroverted and conclusively proven, and substituted the jury's $110,629.50 award for the Tabor Project and $14,214.20 for the Reclaimed Water Project under the sworn-account and bond-payment claims in place of the jury's zero-damages findings for trust-fund-act damages. The judgment awarded ACT $131,823.99 in attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dudley appealed on several grounds. Relevant to the case here, Dudley argued the trial court erred in rendering judgment notwithstanding the verdict on ACT's sworn-account claim because sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding\n   that the price ACT charged for the Tabor Project was not in accordance with the parties' agreement. Dudley also argued the evidence supports the jury's zero-damages finding on ACT's trust-fund-act claim or, alternatively, that the trial court erred in awarding damages based on the amount the jury awarded for ACT's sworn-account and bond-payment claims. Finally, Dudley argues the trial court improperly awarded attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    531 S.W.3d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748 (Tex. App.-Texarkana 2016). On the claims relevant to this appeal, it agreed with Dudley that sufficient evidence supported the jury's finding that the prices ACT charged Dudley for the Tabor Project were not in accord with the parties' agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    at 754-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment on that issue and rendered judgment that ACT take nothing on its sworn-account claim for the Tabor Project.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court of appeals therefore held that the trial court erred in determining damages for ACT's trust-fund act claim, reasoning that \"it does not appear that the obligations of Dudley under any contract yielded exactly $110,629.70.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   But the court of appeals also took issue with the jury's zero-damages finding: \"While the jury found zero damages, we conclude that it was conclusively proven and not really contested that there was some sum of money, more than nothing, that constituted a trust fund under the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For that reason, the court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment as to ACT's trust-fund-act damages and remanded to that court \"to determine the appropriate amount of recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    at 754, 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A dissenting opinion, however, noted that ACT did not raise a cross-point on appeal asserting that the evidence did not support the jury's zero-damages finding for ACT's trust-fund-act claim as required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 324(c) and Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.2(b)(1). In light of ACT's omission, the dissenting insisted these rules \"require us to render judgment of zero damages on ACT's trust-fund cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Burgess, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the court of appeals concluded that any attorney's-fees dispute must be decided on remand. Based on its disposition of the issues before it, the court noted that ACT had yet to establish that it was a prevailing party in an action for which attorney's fees are recoverable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    at 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, noting as well that ACT's trust-fund-act claim has \"as of yet, undetermined damages\" to be reconsidered by the trial court, the court of appeals remanded the attorney's-fees issue for \"re-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    at 759-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We granted Dudley's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We first consider whether ACT waived its argument that the court of appeals should not enter judgment on the jury's original verdict after concluding the trial court erroneously rendered judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Like the dissenting opinion at the court of appeals, Dudley argues that two procedural rules-civil-procedure rule 324(c) and appellate-procedure rule 38.2(b)(1) -required the court of appeals to reinstate the jury's zero-damages finding after it concluded the evidence did not support the trust-fund-act damages award the trial court substituted. The rules are similar in some respects and identical in others. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 324(c) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Judgment Notwithstanding Findings; Cross-Points\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   When judgment is rendered non obstante verdicto or notwithstanding the findings of a jury on one or more questions, the appellee may bring forward by cross-point contained in his brief filed in the Court of Appeals any ground which would have vitiated the verdict or would have prevented an affirmance of the judgment had one been rendered by the trial court in harmony with the verdict, including although not limited to the ground that one or more of the jury's findings have insufficient support in the evidence or are against the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence as a matter of fact, and the ground that the verdict and judgment based thereon should be set aside because of improper argument of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The failure to bring forward by cross-points such grounds as would vitiate the verdict shall be deemed a waiver thereof; provided, however, that if a cross-point is upon a ground which requires the taking of evidence in addition to that adduced upon the trial of the cause, it is not necessary that the evidentiary hearing be held until after the appellate court determines that the cause be remanded to consider such a cross-point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 324(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.2(b) similarly provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Cross-Points\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict. When the trial court renders judgment notwithstanding the verdict on one or more questions, the appellee must bring forward by cross-point any issue or point that would have vitiated the verdict or that would have prevented an affirmance of the judgment if the trial court had rendered judgment on the verdict. Failure to bring forward by cross-point an issue or point that would vitiate the verdict or prevent an affirmance of the judgment waives that complaint. Included in this requirement is a point that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (A) the verdict or one or more jury findings have insufficient evidentiary support or are against the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence as a matter of fact; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (B) the verdict should be set aside because of improper argument of counsel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (2) When Evidentiary Hearing Needed. The appellate court must remand a case to the trial court to take evidence if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (A) the appellate court has sustained a point raised by the appellant; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (B) the appellee raised a cross-point that requires the taking of additional evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 38.2(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This Court has previously articulated the upshot of these rules: \"Normally, when a trial court has entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and an appellate\n   court concludes that this was error, it must reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter judgment in harmony with the verdict, unless the appellee presents by cross-points grounds sufficient to vitiate the jury's verdict or to prevent an affirmance of the judgment had one been entered on the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

And we have clarified the distinction between counter-points and cross-points. Counter-points \"assist the appellate court in finding the answers given to the points of the appellant.

It did, however, argue in defense of the trial court's judgment notwithstanding the verdict overriding the jury's zero-damages finding for its trust-fund-act claim. And its basis for doing so was that the trial court acted properly in disregarding a finding that was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence and contrary to the jury's finding that Dudley had misapplied trust funds. ACT insisted that the \"overwhelming evidence presented at trial supported entering [judgment notwithstanding the verdict]\" on ACT's trust-fund-act claims. It pointed to \"records subpoenaed from each city detail[ing] the amounts [Dudley] submitted in pay applications, which included the materials supplied by [ACT].\" These records \"included the city's approval of the payment applications and the electronic funds transfer records identifying the dates and amounts of the funds transferred to [Dudley].\" Furthermore, \"Mr. Dudley admitted that [Dudley] submitted and received approval from the city for pay applications that included the materials for which [ACT] is seeking recovery\" and that \"he received the funds for [ACT's] materials, as reflected in the city's records.\" And upon cross-examination, Dudley testified that \"the funds he received from the city were 'widely dispersed,' but none were dispersed to [ACT].\" This evidence, ACT insists, \"conclusively establishes\" its entitlement to damages for its trust-fund-act claim. Accordingly, ACT asked the trial court to disregard the jury's zero-damages finding and enter \"the same damage amounts the jury found in response to damages questions\" for ACT's sworn-account and bond-payment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Dudley concedes that ACT's failure to label its argument as a \"cross-point\" is not fatal but insists ACT ultimately failed to preserve its argument because it substantively presented only a counter-point to Dudley's argument that the trial court improperly granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict. But ACT defends the trial court's decision precisely because it repudiates the jury's zero-damages finding. ACT's argument that \"the evidence conclusively establishes ACT's entitlement to damages\" and what Dudley insists it should have argued-that the overwhelming weight of the evidence is against the jury's verdict-are two sides of the same coin: to defend the judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the evidence is overwhelmingly against the jury's verdict\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   to attack the verdict. Whether\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   would classify ACT's argument a \"counter-point\" or a \"cross-point,\" its substance is unmistakable: the evidence commands at least some damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court of appeals permissibly considered ACT's argument a \"cross-point,\" noting that \"[w]hile ACT has not explicitly set out or named any of its appellate points as 'cross-points,' it has substantively made arguments that, if accepted, vitiate the original jury verdict of zero damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    531 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   756 n.16.

Dudley argues, however, that under\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   a remand is improper because \"this case does not require\n   the taking of new evidence which the parties had no opportunity to develop in the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10142201\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/411/715/#p717\">\n    411 S.W.2d at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The purpose of [ rule 324(c) ] was to require a final disposition of the case by the appellate court, where a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is erroneously rendered by the trial court, on the basis of the record before it, and to order a remand only as to questions that require the taking of additional evidence, such as jury misconduct.\"). On this point, we believe\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   -issued more than forty years ago-may have overstated the constraints of rule 324(c) and, by implication, appellate-procedure rule 38.2(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Clearly, the thrust of these rules is to require appellees to present any alternative arguments that would prevent the court of appeals from reinstating the jury's verdict should it agree with the appellant that the trial court erred in rendering judgment notwithstanding the verdict. One purpose of this requirement might be to better position courts of appeals to finally dispose of cases instead of remanding them to trial courts for further proceedings. But nothing in the text of either rule compels the conclusion that a final disposition in the court of appeals is required or that a remand is always limited to instances in which new evidence must be taken. Under the circumstances here, we cannot say the court of appeals erred in remanding the case to the trial court for reconsideration of ACT's trust-fund-act damages.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Texarkana Mem'l.Hosp., Inc. v.

We acknowledge, however, that the parties disagree as to the scope of the court of appeals' remand. Indeed, language in the court of appeals' opinion can be read to suggest that a new trial is required. But the opinion also states that the trial court may \"determine the appropriate amount of recovery,\" suggesting that the trial court could simply alter its judgment in conformance with evidence already in the record.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    531 S.W.3d at 754, 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than attempt to interpret the scope of remand the court of appeals intended, we will simply remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings in light of the holdings of the court of appeals and of this Court. The court of appeals properly reversed the trial court's judgment regarding ACT's trust-fund-act damages-no evidence supports the damages that the trial court substituted. We further agree with the court of appeals that \"it was conclusively proven and not really contested that there was some sum of money, more than nothing, that constituted a trust fund under the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n    at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court of appeals did not consider Dudley's arguments, choosing instead to remand the attorney's-fees issue to the trial court for reconsideration in light of the court of appeals' disposition of other issues. In doing so, however, the court of appeals suggested that attorney's fees for a trust-fund-act claim \"are available for a claim that construction trust funds were misapplied if the relief requested\n   is compensation for work performed or materials supplied.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387396\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 759 n.20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Perry &amp; Perry Builders, Inc. v.

True, section 38.001 makes attorney's fees recoverable for a variety of claims that might factually form the basis of a trust-fund-act claim-a \"trustee\" under the act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. PROP. CODE \u00a7 162.002, might misapply trust funds at the expense of a beneficiary who has \"rendered services,\" \"performed labor,\" \"furnished material,\" or who was a party to \"an oral or written contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM CODE \u00a7 38.001(1) - (3), (8). But this does not\n   merge the statutes for attorney's-fees purposes. Certainly, a pipe supplier might recover attorney's fees under section 38.001 for work performed, materials provided, or for breach of contract. But this does not open the door to attorney's fees for violations of separate statutory provisions simply because the claim is based on the same dispute or because the recovery sought is the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The trust-fund act is a stand-alone, comprehensive statutory scheme defining whether \"construction payments\" and \"loan receipts\" constitute trust funds,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX.
