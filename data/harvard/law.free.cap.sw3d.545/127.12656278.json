Like many cases of this type, the homeowners seek to stave off eviction and retain their home while the lender seeks to enforce a mortgage contract in the face of default and delinquency. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Howard and Lisa Worthing allege that they refinanced the purchase of their homestead in Marble Falls, Texas, through Argent Mortgage Company, LLC (Argent) on August 12, 2003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howard executed a\n   Texas Home Equity Note for $652,500 (the Note) and a Texas Home Security Instrument (Deed of Trust) in favor of Argent. Argent indorsed the Note to Amerquest Mortgage Company. In turn, Amerquest later indorsed the Note in blank. Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for Argent Securities, Inc., Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2003-W5 (Deutsche Bank) was in possession of the Note at the time of the summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Note had a string of different loan service companies. Amerquest, which later changed its name to AMC Mortgage Services, Inc., originally serviced the Note. Two years later AMC assigned the loan servicing functions to Citi Residential Lending, Inc. Effective February 11, 2009, Citi Residential assigned the loan serving to Appellee Homeward Residential Inc., f/k/a American Home Servicing, Inc. (Homeward). As a part of that change, Citi Residential as the \"Attorney in Fact for Argent,\" conveyed, granted, sold, assigned, and transferred the Deed of Trust and Note to Deutsche Bank. The transfer document was executed by Crystal Moore, whose signature was notarized by Bryan Bly. As we note below, both of these persons are important to the Worthings' forgery contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 18, 2009, Homeward provided notice of default and notice of intent to accelerate the Note after the Worthings had stopped making payments. Thereafter, Deutsche Bank filed a proceeding under TEX.R.CIV.P. 736 to judicially authorize the foreclosure. A trial court granted it permission to do so on March 9, 2010. More than two years later, Deutsche Bank appointed a substitute trustee under the Deed of Trust and on July 3, 2012, the substitute trustee sold the property at a foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Worthings, who were still living at the house, sued Deutsche Bank, Homeward, and others. The factual recitations in the lawsuit claimed that Argent did not qualify as one of the designated type of lenders allowed to make a home equity loan in Texas. Consequently, the Worthings assert that Argent automatically forfeited all principal and interest under the Note, and the ensuing foreclosure was invalid. As we explain in more detail below, the Worthings pled additional technical problems with the paperwork in the chain of title, including that the assignment is \"fake\" having been executed by \"robo-signers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From the factual allegations, the Worthings allege causes of action for (1) wrongful foreclosure (2) quiet title (3) breach of contract (4) statutory violations of Chapter 51 of the Texas Property Code (5) violation of Chapter 392 of the Texas Finance Code (6) violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and (7) violation of Chapter 12 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Deutsche Bank and Homeward answered and filed a traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment. The traditional motion addressed Argent's status as a lender and laid out the chain of title documents for the Note and Deed of Trust. In its no-evidence motion, Deutsche Bank set out the pled causes of action and claimed the Worthings lacked evidence on one or more elements of each. The motion further recited that as of December 2, 2014, the Worthings were still living at the property and had made no payment since July 2009. The Worthings responded to the affirmative summary judgment claims, and responded to some, but not all of the challenged causes of action under the no-evidence portion of the motion. The trial court granted the motion and this appeal\n   follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Worthings present three issues with subparts, and we discern there are four remaining disputes between the parties: (1) whether the original lender, Argent, was authorized to make the Worthings' home equity loans; (2) whether the 2009 assignment of the Deed of Trust and loan to Deutsche Bank forged; (3) whether claimed discrepancies in the chain of title create a fact issue; and (4) whether the existence of a non-conforming copy of the Note creates a fact issue as to who now owns the note. Answering these questions resolves the ultimate issue of whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to each of the Worthings' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins.

We take each of the challenges in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    COULD ARGENT REMEDY ITS STATUS AS AN UNLICENSED LENDER?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Worthings claim that because Argent was an unlicensed lender at the time the loan was made, the loan was void at its inception and Argent (and any subsequent holder or assignee of the Note) could not foreclose on the property. Because this was a home equity loan involving homestead property, the loan must have conformed to the requirements for such loans as set out in the Texas Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.CONST. art. XVI, \u00a7 50. Section 50(c) provides that no mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the homestead shall ever be valid unless it secures a debt \"described by this section.\" TEX.CONST. art. XVI, \u00a7 50 (c). One of the constitution's requirements is that only certain entities can make home equity loans.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9947817\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/589/671/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 50 (a)(6)(P). Argent was apparently not such an entity at the time of the loan because it lacked a proper license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   However, when the loan was made, the constitution gave leeway to cure defects. Article XVI, \u00a7 50(a)(6)(Q)(x) at the time read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [T]he lender or any holder of the note for the extension of credit shall forfeit all principal and interest of the extension of credit if the lender or holder fails to comply with the lender's or holder's obligations under the extension of credit\n   <em>\n    within a reasonable time\n   </em>\n   after the lender or holder is notified by the borrower of the lender's failure to comply[.] [emphasis added]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   TEX.CONST. art. XVI, \u00a7 50 (a)(6)(Q)(x)(amended 2003). This language was substantially changed through the 2003 amendment to Section 50 that replaced the \"reasonable time\" language with a sixty-day deadline, and defined specific cures for specific defects. TEX.CONST. art XVI \u00a7 50 (a)(6)(Q)(x)(a)-(f). But the amendment removed entirely the cure language for an unlicensed lender:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [T]he lender or any holder of the note for the extension of credit shall forfeit all principal and interest of the extension of credit if the extension of credit is made by a person other than a person described under Paragraph (P) of this subdivision....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9947817\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/589/671/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 50 (a)(6)(Q)(xi). The amendments became effective on September 13, 2003.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of May 24, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., S.J.R. 42, 2003 TEX.GEN.LAWS 6219, 6225 (setting forth date for election). In this case, Argent remedied the licensure issue on December 17, 2003 when it obtained an appropriate license as a Texas Mortgage Banker. Thus it cured the problem well\n   before the Worthings ever made complaint, but only after the adoption of the 2003 amendment to the Texas Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The pre-amendment version of Section 50 (a)(6)(Q)(x) was construed in\n   <em>\n    Doody v. Ameriquest Mort. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085754\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/342/\">\n    49 S.W.3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 2001). That decision convinces us that under the law in effect at the time the loan's execution, Argent validly remedied the absence of the license. In\n   <em>\n    Doody\n   </em>\n   , the lender charged excessive closing costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085754\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/342/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085754\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/342/\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It discovered the overcharge on its own, and refunded the amount to the borrower, thus curing the overcharge. Nonetheless, the borrower sued claiming both that the lien on his residence was invalid, and that the lender should forfeit all principal and interest. Before the supreme court, the borrower claimed the remedy option in Section 50 (a)(6)(Q)(x) only applies to a forfeiture of principal and interest, and not to remedy the defect in the lien. The court rejected that claim and any narrow construction of Section 50 (a)(6)(Q)(x). Instead, the court held that the cure option applied to all the lender's obligations under the extension of credit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085754\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/342/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085754\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/342/\">\n    at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because licensure of those who can make an extension of credit is one of the obligations, the prior version of the constitution would permit a cure of Argent's lack of licensure.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boutari v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%209453407\">\n    2010 WL 9453407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (W.D.

We conclude that it does not. This same issue was directly addressed in\n   <em>\n    Fix v.

The court there held the portions of the 2003 amendments that replaced the \"reasonable time\" cure period with a specific sixty-day period did not apply retroactively. The court's analysis began with the general rule that constitutional amendments and statutes operate prospectively unless they expressly provide otherwise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8301802\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/242/147/#p155\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8301802\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/242/147/#p155\">\n    at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benchmark Bank v.

As to public policy, the court noted the presumption that parties to a contract know and take into consideration the law in effect at the time of contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 155,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jamestown Partners, L.P. v.

Accordingly, courts should be reluctant to change the rights and obligations of parties by retroactively applying a change in the original law. Moreover, nothing in the text of the 2003 amendment indicates that the makers and adopters intended retroactive application. The legislative history of the constitutional amendment indicates that the makers meant it as nothing more than a \"clarif [ication of] the cure process\", thus belying\n   any public policy purpose that would necessitate retroactive application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   House Comm.

We reject the claim for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, the Worthings' response to the no evidence motion for summary judgment never showed that Moore was not a designated Vice President for Citi Residential.

The Worthings, however, carried the burden of presenting some evidence of the forgery in response to the no-evidence motion for summary judgment. They attempted to meet this burden by attaching the transcript of a congressional hearing and an internet news article to their response. As for the congressional hearing transcript, it only contained as an exhibit a reprint of an Associated Press story. That story includes a claim that several hundred documents filed in a North Carolina county had \"suspect signature[s]\", some of which were from Bryan Bly and Crystal Moore. The two had supposedly admitted to \"signing their names to mortgage documents without having read them.\" The other evidence the Worthings rely on was a web based news article reporting on a deposition taken of Bly and Moore in an unnamed lawsuit. The gist of the article is that each admitted to signing documents without reading them, and some signatures were \"e-signed\" in counties that permit that practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Deutsche Bank objected to the articles on authentication and hearsay grounds, but never obtained a ruling from the trial court. Nonetheless, even accepting the articles as valid summary judgment evidence, they fail to show why the document is a forgery. Under the Texas Penal Code, the term \"forge,\" means: \"(A) to alter, make, complete, execute, or authenticate any writing so that it purports: (i) to be the act of another who did not authorize that act; (ii) to have been executed at a time or place or in a numbered sequence other than was in fact the case; or (iii) to be a copy of an original when no such original existed ...[.]\" TEX.PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 32.21(a)(1)(A) (West 2016);\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408891\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/76/624/#p630\">\n    76 S.W.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (applying definition in civil proceeding). The mere fact that Moore or Bly sign many documents a day does not meet this definition. The Worthings presented no evidence that these particular signatures were \"e-signed\", or if so, that Moore did not authorize the e-signing of her signature. Nor did they link any of the \"robo-signing\" allegations in the two articles to the companies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Worthings place great emphasis on\n   <em>\n    Vazquez v.

The summary judgment filed in\n   <em>\n    Vazquez\n   </em>\n   was a traditional Rule 166a(c) motion where Deutsche Bank carried the burden to disprove the forgery allegation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912117\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/783/#p785\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912117\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/783/#p785\">\n    at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the no evidence portion of the hybrid motion shifted the burden to the Worthings and they simply failed to meet their burden. In\n   <em>\n    Vazquez\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs had also alleged \"Bly's electronic signature was affixed to the assignment by someone else without his knowledge or approval.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912117\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/783/#p785\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912117\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/783/#p785\">\n    at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is a far cry from merely complaining he did not read the document before signing it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore reject the\n   Worthings claim that the assignment was forged and thus void, or that if fraudulent and voidable, that they have standing to raise that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CLAIMED DISCREPANCIES IN THE ASSIGNMENT AND CHAIN OF TITLE DOCUMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Deutsche Bank claims its right to foreclose through actual possession of the Note (indorsed in blank by the previous holder) and through the assignment of the Deed of Trust and Note. It supported its traditional summary judgment with an affidavit laying out the chain of title, and included the assignment for the Deed of Trust and Note. In their response, the Worthings attached an \"Assignment of Lien\" form, which purports to assign the Note and liens to Deutsche Bank\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   Deutsche Bank \"by Citi Residential Lending, Inc. as Attorney-in-Fact.\" The Worthings claim this \"Assignment of Lien\" is in error because it states that the Note was executed by \"Howard Worthing and wife, Lisa Worthing,\" when the actual note was only executed by Howard Worthing. They further claim that the chain of title for the Deed of Trust and the Note take different and inconsistent paths. Their brief fails to explain the significance of the \"Assignment of Lien\" and Deutsche Bank never relied on that document to prove its chain of title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Additionally, an implicit assumption in the argument is that Note and Deed of Trust must travel together, when the weight of authority is to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martins v.

The Worthings never respond to this argument, and we fail to see how the claimed discrepancy in the \"Assignment of Lien\" or the differing routes that the Note and Deed of Trust took create a genuine issue of material fact as to any contested issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    DOES THE EXISTENCE OF A NON-CONFORMING COPY OF THE NOTE CREATE A FACT ISSUE?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Deutsche Bank purportedly produced at some point in the discovery process a copy of the Note that did not have any indorsements.

Because we overrule those contentions, we agree that summary judgment was proper as to the quiet title action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the same reason, we affirm the summary judgment on the wrongful foreclosure claim, which has as one of its elements proof of a defect in the foreclosure sale proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

The Worthings put on no proof of irregularities in the foreclosure sale itself, other than chain of title arguments that we have already rejected. The trial court properly granted summary judgment on the wrongful foreclosure cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Worthings' Texas Property Code claim under Chapter 51 is likewise based on the claimed improper assignment of the Note and Deed of Trust, which in turn implicates Deutsche Banks' appointment of a substitute trustee, acceleration of the note, and other prerequisites required by TEX.PROP.CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.002 (West 2014). We likewise affirm the summary judgment as to this cause of action. The Worthings' fraudulent lien claim under TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 12.002(a) (West 2017) required them to show: (1) the defendant made, presented, or used a document with knowledge that it was a fraudulent lien, (2) the defendant intended that the document be given legal effect, and (3) the defendant intended to\n   cause plaintiff physical injury, financial injury, or mental anguish.\n   <em>\n    Merritt v.

Deutsche Bank challenged each of these elements below. It is enough for us to address the first element, because the Worthings' argument makes clear the foreclosure related documents were fraudulent only because the assignment was \"forged\" or \"void.\" Because we find proof of neither here, the claim that the ensuing foreclosure filings were fraudulent necessarily fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Worthings do not address the specific no evidence challenges made to their breach of contract, DTPA, or Texas Finance Code claims.
