TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. \u00a7 554.002 (West 2012). The case comes to us after the trial court granted EPISD's motion for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Whitney was a long time teacher in EPISD. For the time-period at issue, she taught a computer literacy course to sixth graders at an El Paso middle school. EPISD has two policies, relevant here, that address what a teacher may teach in the classroom. The first policy addresses discussion of religion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The inclusion of religion in the study of history, culture, literature, music, drama, and art is essential to a full and fair presentation of the curriculum. The inclusion of religious elements is appropriate as along as the material included is intrinsic to the field of study in which it is presented and as long as it is presented objectively. ... Such studies shall not foster any particular religious tenet nor demean any religious beliefs, but shall attempt to develop mutual respect among students and advance their knowledge and appreciation of the role that religious heritage plays in the social, cultural, and historic development of civilization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The second policy addresses discussion of controversial topics:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The District shall address controversial topics in an impartial and objective manner. Teachers shall not use the classroom to indoctrinate students with their personal beliefs regarding political or sectarian issues. ... A teacher selecting topics for discussion in the classroom shall be adequately informed about the issue and capable of providing instruction on the subject, free from personal bias.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2005, EPISD claimed Whitney ran afoul of these policies when, in a classroom setting, she engaged in conversations related to religion (by quoting Bible scripture) and she showed an explicit video on AIDS. On November 9, 2005, EPISD issued Whitney a formal letter of reprimand for this conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Some four years later, in May 2009, a student complained that Whitney made inappropriate comments to him to the effect that he was too effeminate. While investigating that complaint, and in interviewing the students in her class, EPISD learned of other comments that it considered inappropriate under the above quoted policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on that investigation, Whitney received another letter of reprimand on October 9, 2009, for making comments to her sixth grade class regarding religion, sex, and politics, when they were not part of the curriculum for a computer tech applications class.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She was also informed this\n   was a final warning and that any further violations of policy would result in a recommendation for her proposed termination from employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This history set the stage for a January 2010 parent-teacher conference, when a parent complained that a few days before, Whitney had engaged the computer class on topics of religion, homosexuality, AIDS, and reported that she prayed to the students in class. The middle school principal initiated an investigation. Perhaps not surprisingly, the sixth graders had different recollections of what Whitney actually said.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A majority of the student interviews confirmed, however, that Whitney had discussed religion, homosexuality, and AIDS in the computer literacy class. No student recalled that she prayed during class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 11, 2010, the middle school principal recommended to her superior that Whitney's employment be terminated. Two days later, EPISD's associate superintendent agreed. EPISD then notified Whitney that on July 13, 2010, the Board of Trustees would take up a motion to recommend her proposed termination. Following a closed meeting which Whitney attended, the Board gave Dr. Lorenzo Garcia, then Superintendent of the EPISD, authority to terminate her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Texas Education Code requires that any employee under contract be notified of any proposed termination in writing and be informed of the grounds for the action. TEX.EDUC.CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.158(a) (West 2012)(\"Before a teacher employed under a continuing contract may be discharged, suspended without pay, or released because of a necessary reduction of personnel, the board of trustees must notify the teacher in writing of the proposed action and the grounds for the action.\"). On July 20, 2010, EPISD issued Whitney a letter that gave formal notice of the proposed termination for cause. The letter specifically referenced the failure to meet the accepted standards of conduct for teaching, and attached the prior letters of reprimand, the most recent parent's complaint, and the report on the investigation of that complaint. The letter also advised Whitney of two procedural deadlines for challenging the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the Education Code and EPISD policy, she was required to notify the Board within ten days of receiving the notice of proposed termination of her intent to contest the action. TEX.EDUC.CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.159(a). By doing so, she was entitled to a Chapter 21 termination hearing as outlined by the Education Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 21.159(b). A Chapter 21 hearing is held before an independent hearing officer, and is conducted as would a non-jury trial in a district court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 21.256(e). The hearing officer then generates a recommendation to the Board based on the adversarial hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 21.257(d). The\n   Board may then accept or reject the hearing officer's recommendations, subject to appeal to the Commissioner of the Texas Education Agency (TEA), and then a district court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 21.259, 21.301-21.307. To obtain that hearing, however, the letter informed Whitney that she needed to file a written request for a hearing with the TEA \"not later than the 15th day after the date you receive this notice of proposed termination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 21.253(a). She also needed to provide the EPISD with a copy of the request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Whitney's response to these deadlines is important to an issue in this case. On July 19, 2010, one day\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   she received the actual notice of proposed termination, Whitney filed a grievance with EPISD. She identified the factual basis of her grievance to include: (1) violations of TEA policy; (2) wrongful termination; (3) violation of her civil rights; and \"multiple violations of federal, state and TEA laws.\" In an attached explanatory letter, she complained that she was not given adequate time to respond to the charges at the Board's hearing on July 13. She also claimed that she had never been informed in writing of the nature of the charges, nor asked for her side of the dispute. EPISD responded to that grievance on July 21, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter indicated that Whitney's right to review was spelled out in the Superintendent's letter to her of July 20, 2010 (i.e. pursuing a Chapter 21 hearing), and that no action would be taken on the July 19, 2010 grievance. The letter attached the EPISD's policy on employee complaints and grievance procedures. On August 3, 2010, Whitney sent a letter to the Commissioner of the TEA. In the letter, Whitney contended that she had been falsely accused of \"saying and doing things in my classroom since 2005.\" She complained that she had been removed from the classroom as a teacher, but did not mention the pending termination. She referenced her grievance of July 19, 2010, and claimed that EPISD had not responded to that grievance. The letter recited that the District had violated numerous provisions of the Texas Administrative Code, the Education Code, and Whitney's civil rights. She claimed to have reported \"about the many violations of my rights, as well as other employees\" to the FBI, the Office of Civil Rights, the EEOC, the Texas Attorney General, the U.S. Department of Education, and a local state senator. The letter ended with a request to meet and further discuss her complaints, but did not specifically ask for a hearing examiner or hearing. The letter was not carbon copied to EPISD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The TEA responded to this letter by urging her to pursue the EPISD's internal process for resolving the July 19 grievance. If EPISD failed to provide her a timely hearing, she could then appeal to the TEA. Otherwise, the response the TEA had no jurisdiction over the matters raised in Whitney's complaint letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the Education Code, had Whitney invoked a Chapter 21 hearing to challenge her proposed termination, the Board would have not acted until the hearing officer made recommendations following the hearing. TEX.EDUC.CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 21.257 - 21.259. Because EPISD had not received notice that Whitney had sought a hearing, it informed her on August 18, 2010, that the EPISD Board would meet on August 24, 2010, to consider terminating her contract immediately. They did so, and terminated\n   her employment effective as of September 15, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The TEA also ultimately concluded that Whitney had not validly requested a Chapter 21 hearing on her termination. Whitney's August 3, 2010 letter never specifically mentioned the termination, nor asked for the appointment of a hearing examiner. The TEA did conclude, however, that Whitney's August 4 letter invoked the TEA's jurisdiction to challenge EPISD's refusal to entertain the July 19 grievance. She had therefore preserved the right to appeal under TEX.EDUC.CODE ANN. \u00a7 7.057 (West Supp. 2016)(\"[A] person may appeal in writing to the commissioner if the person is aggrieved by ... actions or decisions of any school district board of trustees that violate ... the school laws of this state.\"). An appeal under that section, however, expressly cannot include a termination decision that otherwise could be heard under Chapter 21.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 7.057(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When the TEA heard Whitney's Section 7.057 appeal of her grievance, it dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The Commissioner made a specific fact finding that Whitney's August 3, 2010 letter did not request the assignment of a hearing examiner. Consequently, the Chapter 21 hearing procedures for her termination was never invoked. The TEA had allowed Whitney to amend the August 3 letter, which the TEA considered to be a \"Petition for Review.\" The amendment claimed EPISD violated Section 21.301(a), which is the statutory basis for a teacher to appeal a termination decision made at the end of the Chapter 21 hearing process. The TEA rejected that argument because Whitney had never invoked a Chapter 21 hearing, and thus any decision of EPISD was not grounded in the Chapter 21 hearing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Whitney filed this suit on October 15, 2012, alleging a violation of the Texas Whistleblower Act. The suit claims that in June 2009, she reported to the TEA that a counselor in charge of handling the Texas standardized tests at her school was not certified. She also alleged that she had complained to the Superintendent about the bilingual program at her school, and the mishandling of a grant. Whitney complained that her termination was in retaliation for these reports. EPISD answered, asserting a plea to the jurisdiction as a part of its answer. After some discovery, EPISD moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The summary judgment motion advanced five challenges to the whistleblower claim: (1) Whitney did not in good faith report a violation of law; (2) the report was not made to an appropriate law enforcement authority; (3) EPISD did not terminate her for making the report; (4) the claim was barred because it was not administratively pursued; and (5) the suit was untimely. The motion attached numerous records documenting the chronology of events that we have recounted above, and included the affidavit of EPISD's Executive Director of Employee Relations, Vincent Sheffield, at the time of the termination. He claimed to be \"personally acquainted with employment terminations of EPISD teachers in 2010, including the circumstances leading up to the termination of Whitney's employment. Sheffield had signed the final termination letter. He further swore that to his knowledge Whitney's \"employment was terminated for the reasons stated in the [July 20 notice of proposed termination, with attachments] and for no other reason.\" Whitney failed to file any response to the motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the motion, without specifying the\n   grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   EPISD contends that it filed a hybrid motion for summary judgment, including both traditional and no-evidence grounds. TEX.R.CIV.P. 166a(b) and (i). Whitney counters that only a traditional motion is before us. Because the motion attached evidence that extensively addresses each of the grounds discussed below, we conclude that on this record the distinction is immaterial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our ultimate inquiry is whether there is more than a scintilla of probative evidence raising genuine issues of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.R.CIV.P. 166a(c), (i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We review a summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins.

At best, she initiated an appeal under Section 7,057, which by statute does not overlap with Chapter 21 procedures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314336\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/371/391/#p395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 7.057 (e)(1)(\"This section does not apply to ... a case to which Subchapter G, Chapter 21, applies....\").

The problem with her argument is that the TEA has rejected that position, and issued a specific finding of fact and conclusion of law to the contrary. As the TEA finding grew out of a Section 7.057 proceeding, that finding must be challenged in a Travis County lawsuit, if at all. TEX.EDUC.CODE ANN. \u00a7 7.057(d) (\"A person aggrieved by an action of the agency or decision of the commissioner may appeal to a district court in Travis County.\"). Whitney provides no basis or rationale for how we would overcome that agency finding, and indeed, we discern none in the record.

Thanks\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The TEA responded that the agency could not appropriately reply by email, but it would speak to her further if she called a provided phone number. The summary judgment record also includes a March 2008 email from the TEA to Whitney responding to some earlier question she apparently raised about students removed from school during standardized testing. The email asked Whitney to communicate with a specific person and provide the TEA with additional information. The emails do not reveal whether they were copied to anyone at EPISD. When asked on deposition, Whitney had no knowledge that anyone from EPISD was aware of the emailed reports and she had no information that these emails had anything to do with her termination. And while Whitney asks us to take judicial notice that the current TEA website reflects it would include the school district in any of its investigations, the text of these emails does not suggest that any investigation was ever done.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Whitney's August 3, 2010 letter to the TEA referenced other complaints that she had filed with the FBI, the Department Education, the Texas Attorney General, and a state senator. In her deposition, Whitney stated she was either unaware of, or denied, that anyone from the EPISD knew of these additional reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The summary judgment record does contain the Executive Director of Employee Relations claim that Whitney was terminated\n   for the reasons outlined in the notice of proposed termination, \"and for no other reason.\" The reasons cited in the attachments to the notice of proposed termination include violations of district policy prohibiting discussion of religion and controversial topics outside the curriculum of her computer class. Whitney can point to nothing in the summary judgment record that creates a genuine issue of material fact to refute that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We disagree with Whitney that the mere timing of events is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. EPISD's complaints about her classroom conduct, first documented with a letter of reprimand in 2005, occurred years before the June 2009 reports. It is true that EPISD temporarily reassigned her to different duties on August 14, 2009, some two months after the June emails. The reassignment arose from the EPISD's investigation of her May 2009 conduct. That investigation lead to an October 2009 letter of reprimand and not her termination. Her petition never mentions, much less alleges, that the October letter of reprimand was improper or related to her termination. Instead, her petition complains of the January 2010 suspension following the January 2010 parent complaint. Because that event was some seven months after her reports, she is not entitled to the presumption under Section 554.004(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nor does she offer evidence of any other circumstance that creates a genuine issue of material fact on causation. Other than a few generic statements in her unsworn correspondence that the reasons for termination were unfounded, her sworn deposition testimony supports most of the specific reasons cited by the EPISD for her termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whitney does not advance any evidence that other similarly situated employees who had not made comparable reports were treated any differently. At best, the evidence suggested by Whitney is the sort of \"meager circumstantial evidence\" that \"could give rise to any number of inferences, none more probable than another.\"\n   <em>\n    Kingsaire, Inc. v.

We decline to rule on the other grounds. TEX.R.APP.P. 47.1.

Logically, the same would be true when the movant presents evidence that demonstrates an entitlement to summary judgment. Under a traditional motion for summary judgment, when the moving party establishes its right to summary judgment, the burden then shifts to the non-movant to present evidence which raises a genuine issue of material fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of Houston v.

And likewise, in a no evidence motion, once an element of a claim or defense is challenged, the non-movant then needs to present some evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact.\n    <em>\n     Wade Oil &amp; Gas, Inc. v.
