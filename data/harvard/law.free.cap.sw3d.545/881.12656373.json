Appellant was sentenced to five years for each burglary count, five years for first degree assault, one day for each count of second-degree assault, and three years for each armed criminal action count, all to run concurrently, except for one of the burglary counts and its associated count of armed criminal action, which were to run consecutively to each other and to the other counts, for a total of thirteen years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law.
