Albert had a shunt implanted to drain cerebrospinal fluid in his brain, and over the years had undergone at least one shunt revision procedure. At the time of the surgery that gave rise to this suit, Albert was an eight year old who had left-side weakness, but he was able to sit, stand, and walk. In May of 2011, after presenting to the emergency room with complaints of headaches and vomiting, and undergoing testing\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , Albert was admitted to East Tennessee Children's Hospital where he underwent surgery for a shunt revision.

The case was tried before a jury during a two week period in February and March of 2016. After trial, the jury returned its verdict finding no liability on the part of the defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trial Court entered judgment upon the jury's verdict on March 8, 2016.

During cross-examination, Albert's mother was asked several questions about the fact that she and her husband came to the United States in 1999, that she was from Bulgaria and her husband was from Yugoslavia, and that she had worked for a military contractor training United States soldiers for peace-keeping missions. Plaintiffs' counsel did not object to any of these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As this Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Grandstaff v.

As Plaintiffs raised no objection at trial to the introduction of evidence regarding Albert's parents coming to the United States from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, Plaintiffs are precluded from raising this issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in not allowing exhibit number 102 to be taken to the jury room. Exhibit 102 consists of a piece of paper upon which was handwritten, apparently by Plaintiffs' counsel: \"standard of care,\" and underneath those words was typed: \"The practice that protects the patient from unnecessary risk of serious harm.\" At trial, Plaintiffs' counsel asked Dr. Phillips if she agreed with that statement, and she did agree. Plaintiffs' counsel then attempted to file the paper as an exhibit. An objection was raised to admitting the paper as an exhibit as it was cumulative to the testimony just given by Dr. Phillips. The Trial Court marked Exhibit 102 for identification purposes only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As this Court stated in\n   <em>\n    DeLapp v.

Furthermore, even if the issue were not waived, we cannot find the Trial Court abused its discretion in excluding Exhibit 102 as \"needless presentation of cumulative evidence,\" since the statement contained in Exhibit 102 was read to Dr. Phillips at trial, and she testified that she agreed with the statement. Tenn. R. Evid. 403. Furthermore, there was no evidence submitted at trial that Exhibit 102 was a complete definition as to the \"recognized standard of acceptable professional practice ...\" in this case as mandated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-115\">\n    Tenn.

The specifics necessary to flesh out that general statement will vary from case to case depending upon the health care given to the patient. For example, the specifics as to the acceptable standard of professional practice in a case involving a surgery will not be the same as in a case involving the prescribing of medication. As such, allowing Exhibit 102 to go to the jury room likely would have resulted in confusion by giving this written statement undue weight over the oral testimony on that issue. We find no error by the Trial Court on this issue. If we are in error on this, we also find that it would be, at most, harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in refusing to grant the motion for new trial when the defendants allegedly failed to offer evidence of the standard of care.

Dimick\n   </em>\n   in which this Court stated: \"[Defendant] denies any mistake, honest or otherwise, and his defense does not envision 'honest mistake,' \" and held that as there was \"no evidence in this record to support such defense, it was error to give the instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    Godbee v. Dimick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8335860\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/213/865/#p890\">\n    213 S.W.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 890 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The jury instructions given in the instant case differ significantly from those given in\n   <em>\n    Godbee\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Godbee\n   </em>\n   , the relevant portion of the jury instructions included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A physician will not be held responsible for honest mistakes in judgment but only for negligent failure to meet the standard required by the profession in the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A physician does not guarantee a cure for his patients. Presuming careful diagnosis, a physician is not liable for damages resulting from an honest mistake in determining the care and the treatment to be administered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8335860\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/213/865/#p890\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the instant case, the relevant jury instructions included the following\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   By undertaking treatment, a medical professional does not guarantee a good result. A medical professional is not negligent merely because of an unsuccessful result or error in judgment. An injury alone does not raise a presumption of negligence. It is negligence, however, if the error of judgment or lack of success is due to a failure to have and use the required knowledge, care, and skills as defined in these instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Trial Court in the instant case did not charge the jury with regard to 'honest mistake,' as did the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Godbee\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the Trial Court in the instant case charged the jury that: \"A medical professional is not negligent merely because of an unsuccessful result or error in judgment.\" Even if Plaintiffs are correct that the evidence in the record on appeal does not support a defense based upon 'error in judgment,' the jury instruction given provided for another possibility. The jury instruction given provided that a defendant is not negligent merely \"because of an unsuccessful result,\"\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   because of an \"error in judgment.\" Here, it was alleged that Dr. Harris's decision to continue to attempt to remove the shunt after he encountered difficulty was inappropriate and that Dr. Harris should have made a different decision. Clearly, Dr. Harris used his medical judgment when he made the decisions that he made during the surgery. So the fact that defendants did not admit to an 'error in judgment' does not invalidate the use of this instruction when Plaintiffs presented proof that Dr. Harris erred in choosing to continue to attempt to remove the shunt. Given all this, we find the facts and analysis with regard to the jury instructions in\n   <em>\n    Godbee\n   </em>\n   easily distinguishable from the case now before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Reading the Trial Court's \"instructions to the jury in their entirety and in context of the entire charge,\" as we must, we find no error in the Trial Court's use of the pattern jury instruction containing the\n   words 'error in judgment' as they properly reflected the parties' claims and defenses.\n   <em>\n    Goodale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397702\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/243/575/#p584\">\n    243 S.W.3d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finding no error, we affirm the Trial Court's Final Judgment entered upon the jury's verdict on March 8, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The judgment of the Trial Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the Trial Court for collection of the costs below.
