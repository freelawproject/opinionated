A group of alcoholic beverage retailers paid the excess fees, but not under protest. After the municipality denied the retailers' requests for refunds, they sued the municipality for recovery of the excess collections and other damages. The municipality moved to dismiss, arguing that Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-901,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , required the retailers to have paid under protest any disputed taxes before filing suit to recover the overpayments. The trial court disagreed and awarded the retailers a judgment for the overpayments, ruling that Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-1801,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , applied and payment under protest was not required. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We hold that Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-901,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , rather than sections 67-1-1801,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , apply to a suit to recover municipal taxes. Under section 67-1-901(a), the retailers were required to have paid under protest the disputed taxes before filing suit. Because the retailers did not pay the taxes under protest, they are not entitled to refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A municipality may impose by ordinance an inspection fee on licensed alcoholic beverage retailers located within the municipality.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-3-501\">\n    Tenn.

The city set the fee at eight percent of the wholesale price based on the county's population of less than 60,000. By January 2011, the county's population, according to the 2010 federal census, increased to over 60,000. Under the city's ordinance, the inspection fee should have decreased to a maximum fee of five percent of the wholesale price. However, from 2011-2014, the city of Morristown charged the retailers an eight percent inspection fee, which the wholesalers collected and remitted to the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 2014, one of the alcoholic beverage retailers, Chuck's Package Store, forwarded to the city a law firm advertisement letter advising that the city was overcharging inspection fees based on the population increase. The city's administrative services director acknowledged the error and pledged to refund the overpayments. However, in July 2014, after a meeting with other city officials, the administrative services director notified Chuck's Package Store that the city would not issue a refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 14, 2014, a group of alcoholic beverage retailers, Chuck's Package Store; The Cellar, Inc.; T &amp; T Package Store, LLC; Morristown Beverage Associates, Inc., d/b/a Cork &amp; Keg Package Store; The Package Store; and C &amp; C Package, Inc., sued the city of Morristown in the Hamblen County Chancery Court to recover the overpaid taxes, damages, and other relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The city moved to dismiss, arguing in part that the retailers were not entitled to relief because they had failed to pay the disputed taxes under protest as required by Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-901(a) and -911 (2013). The trial court denied the city's motion to dismiss, holding that Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-1801,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2013 &amp; 2017 Supp.), applied and the retailers were not required to have paid under protest the municipal taxes before seeking refunds. Following a bench trial in April 2015, the trial court awarded the retailers a judgment for the excess taxes paid from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2014, in the amount of $452,120.51, prejudgment interest, and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-1807,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , applied to relieve the taxpayers from the requirement of paying under protest disputed taxes before filing suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chuck's Package Store v.

The Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Admiralty Suites\n   </em>\n   did not refer to\n   <em>\n    Lebanon Liquors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hoover\n   </em>\n   , or other cases requiring payment under protest before filing suit. As in\n   <em>\n    Vulcan Materials\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Admiralty Suites\n   </em>\n   did not address the limitations of section 67-1-1807 ; the interplay between sections 67-1-901,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and 67-1-1801,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; or the applicability of section 67-1-911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After reviewing Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-901,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-1801,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , we hold that on or after January 1, 1986, the process for taxpayer recovery of state taxes differs from the process for recovery of municipal taxes. Before January 1, 1986, under\n   Tennessee Code Annotated section 67-1-901, a taxpayer was required to pay under protest both state and municipal taxes before filing suit for a refund. On or after January 1, 1986, under Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-901(b) and 67-1-1807(b)(1), a taxpayer is not required to pay under protest disputed state taxes collected or administered by the commissioner of revenue before filing suit for a refund. The statutory changes in section 67-1-901(b) and section 67-1-1807(b) did not eliminate the requirement of payment under protest in section 67-1-901(a) for disputed municipal taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We base our decision on the following considerations. First, the 1986 enactments of Tennessee Code Annotated section 67-1-901(b) and Tennessee Code Annotated sections 67-1-1801,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , that removed the requirement of payment under protest reference only taxes collected by the commissioner of revenue; there is no mention of taxes collected by a municipality. We cannot add \"municipal taxes\" to these statutes to expand their scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the provision in Tennessee Code Annotated section 67-1-1807(a) that removed the requirement of payment under protest for state taxes is self-limiting. It provides that \"[a]ll taxes paid on or after January 1, 1986, shall be governed by the laws regarding refunds and suits for the recovery of taxes\n   <em>\n    as set out in this part\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-1-1807\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-1-1807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). This italicized language, \"as set out in this part,\" necessarily references a claim for refund under part 18 of Tennessee Code Annotated title 67, chapter 1-sections 67-1-1801 to 67-1-1808-not a claim for refund under part 9 of Tennessee Code Annotated title 67, chapter 1-sections 67-1-901 to 67-1-912. Because there is no conflict between section 67-1-1807 and sections 67-1-901,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , section 67-1-1807 does not supersede the payment-under-protest requirement of section 67-1-901(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-1-1807\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 67-1-1807(c) ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Memphis Managed Care Corp. v.

There is no corresponding provision in sections 67-1-1801,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , making these sections applicable to municipal taxes. The Legislature, by enacting sections 67-1-1807 and 67-1-901(b), specifically removed the payment-under-protest requirement for disputed state taxes collected by the commissioner of revenue but did not eliminate this requirement for municipal taxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-1-911\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 67-1-1807(a).

The General Assembly could have included language in section 67-1-901(b) removing the payment-under-protest requirement for taxes collected or administered by the commissioner of revenue\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   municipalities-but it did not. We are not free to add this language to expand the scope of sections 67-1-1801,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; restrict the scope of sections 67-1-901,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; or substitute our judgment for that of the Legislature.

Under section 67-1-901(a), a taxpayer must pay under protest disputed municipal taxes before filing suit for a refund. Here, the retailers did not pay the municipal taxes under protest before filing suit; therefore, they are not entitled to recover the overpayments.
