The contestant insists the purported Last Will and Testament of the decedent, dated June 19, 2015, is invalid because the attesting witnesses, who duly executed the attestation affidavit, failed to affix their signatures to the will as required by the Tennessee Execution of Wills Act at the time the will was executed. The proponent insists the will was validly executed based on a 2016 amendment to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 32-1-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which applies to wills executed prior to July 1, 2016, and states \"to the extent necessary for the Will to be validly executed, witness signatures affixed to an affidavit meeting the requirements of \u00a7 32-2-110 shall be considered signatures to the Will.\" The trial court ruled that the 2016 amendment did not apply because the testator died before it went into effect. Consequently, the 2015 will was invalid because it was not executed in accordance\n   with the law then in effect. We have determined that the 2016 amendment to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 32-1-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   applies retrospectively to wills executed prior to July 1, 2016, because that is the clear and unambiguous intent of the legislation. We have also determined that the retrospective application of the law does not impair any vested legal right of the contestant. Therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts of this case are not in dispute. On June 19, 2015, Veronica Stewart (\"Ms. Stewart\") executed her Last Will and Testament (\"the will\"). Ms. Stewart signed the bottom of each of the three pages of her will in the presence of two witnesses, and the witnesses signed the attestation affidavit in the presence of Ms. Stewart, each other, and a notary public; however, the witnesses failed to sign the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Stewart died on September 16, 2015, without a surviving spouse or issue. On September 22, the will was admitted to probate in the Chancery Court for Warren County, Tennessee, and the court issued letters testamentary to the executor of the estate, Ms. Stewart's accountant. The primary beneficiary under the will was Lazaro Serna (\"Mr. Serna\"), an unrelated individual. Three days later, Ms. Stewart's father, Derwood Stewart (\"Mr. Stewart\"), who was an heir-at-law, filed a verified complaint contesting the will. Mr. Serna filed an answer in which he insisted that the will was valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 11, 2016, Mr. Stewart filed a motion for summary judgment. Relying primarily on\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Morris\n   </em>\n   , M2014-00874-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20557970\">\n    2015 WL 557970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 2014), Mr. Stewart argued that the will did not meet the execution requirements set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 32-1-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the witnesses to Ms. Stewart's will failed to sign the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 16, 2016, Governor Haslam signed House Bill 1472 into law. It was subsequently codified as an amendment to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 32-1-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pursuant to the amendment, wills executed prior to July 1, 2016, are validly executed if the witness signatures are affixed to an affidavit in compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-2-110\">\n    Tenn.

Code Ann. \u00a7 32-1-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Less than a week later, Mr. Serna filed a response to Mr. Stewart's motion for summary judgment and a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that under the 2016 amendment to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 32-1-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ms. Stewart's will was validly executed. Mr. Stewart then filed a response to Mr. Serna's motion and a notice with the Tennessee Attorney General that he was challenging the constitutionality of the 2016 amendment. In his response, Mr. Stewart argued that a retrospective application of the 2016 amendment to the will would violate Article I, \u00a7 20 of the Tennessee Constitution because it would interfere with Mr. Stewart's vested rights as an heir-at-law. Mr. Serna and the Tennessee Attorney General both argued that a retrospective application of the 2016 amendment did not interfere with any vested right of Mr. Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]he Court finds that the law enacted on April 19, 2016, would have resulted in the decedent's Will being perfectly executed and admissible in this Court had it been in effect at the time of her death. The Court is required to follow the Testamentary laws that were in place at the date of death. Therefore, at the date of her death the decedent's Will did not comply with the rigorous requirements\n   of Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-104 and is therefore invalid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This appeal by Mr. Serna followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Serna insists that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 32-1-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended by Public Chapter 843 of the Acts of 2016, applies retrospectively to validate the execution of Ms. Stewart's 2015 will because the legislature expressly stated that it applies to wills executed prior to July 1, 2016. Mr. Stewart contends that the law in effect when Ms. Stewart died in 2015 applies. He argues that applying the 2016 amendment retrospectively would violate Article I, \u00a7 20 of the Tennessee Constitution by impairing his vested legal right of inheritance as the decedent's heir-at-law. Mr. Serna counters by arguing that the retrospective application of the amendment does not impair any of Mr. Stewart's vested rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This court reviews the granting of a motion for summary judgment de novo without a presumption of correctness.\n   <em>\n    Rye v.

Thus, the 2016 amendment did not interfere with the reasonable expectations of the testator; in fact, it advanced her expectations. For his part, Mr. Stewart contends that, as an heir-at-law at the time of his daughter's death, he had the right to rely on the state of the law in effect at that time. Because his daughter died intestate in accordance with the law at the time of her death, Mr. Stewart claims he had a reasonable expectation as an heir-at-law to inherit from her estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mr. Stewart's right to inherit from his daughter was contingent upon whether she died intestate, partially intestate, or whether and to what extent he was a beneficiary under her will.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether a person died testate or intestate is a determination made by a court in a probate proceeding, and such a determination is often made weeks, if not months, after the decedent's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Trigg\n   </em>\n   , 368 S.W.3d at 496-97.

A law which facilitates the intention of the parties to a contract never impairs its obligations, or divests or impairs any vested right thereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20S.W.%20668\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20S.W.%20668\">\n    at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The 2016 amendment at issue in this case parallels the circumstances discussed in\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   in all three respects. First, the 2016 amendment is not unlike the examples given in\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   of a remedial statute enacted to cure a procedural defect. It validates Ms. Stewart's will in the same way that a statute might validate marriages defectively celebrated. And, like the statute in\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   , the 2016 amendment facilitates the intentions and the expectations of the parties to the will at the time of its execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Stewart had no vested right in a law that would allow him to take advantage of a procedural defect. It was well within the province of the legislature to cure the defect to prevent Mr. Stewart, and others similarly situated, from gaining an unfair advantage based on a mere technicality. As the\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   Court held, such laws can be applied retrospectively without running afoul of Article I, \u00a7 20 of the Tennessee Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Third, the 2016 amendment is remedial in the sense that the General Assembly enacted the 2016 amendment in order to correct a deficiency in the law that resulted in a number of wills being declared invalid. Thus, the procedural flaw in the execution of Ms. Stewart's will is one that the legislature \"might have dispensed with by prior statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20S.W.%20668\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20S.W.%20668\">\n    at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, it is constitutionally permissible for the legislature to dispense with it by subsequent statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Considering the foregoing, Mr. Stewart did not have a vested right to inherit from Ms. Stewart's estate. He merely had what the\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   Court described as a \"consequential right,\" resulting from a defect in the law that allowed him to take advantage of an alleged flaw in the execution of the will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20S.W.%20668\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20S.W.%20668\">\n    at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained that a law that \"facilitates the intention of the parties to a contract never ... impairs any vested right thereunder.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20S.W.%20668\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Similarly, a law which facilitates the intentions of the testator cannot impede any\n   vested right of an heir-at-law. Ms. Stewart intended for her property to be distributed to those beneficiaries named in the will. The Execution of Wills Act focuses first and foremost on the right of the testator to dispose of his or her property by will and not the right of potential heirs-at-law to receive that property. In other words, the right of an heir-at-law to inherit property is merely contingent upon whether the testator has properly exercised his or her right to make a will. A law that vindicates the primary right cannot possibly interfere with a contingent right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The term \"vested right\" is a right \"that is absolute, complete and unconditional to the exercise of which no obstacle exists and which is immediate and perfect in itself and not dependent on a contingency.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9360056\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/126/#p132\">\n    97 S.W.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132 (Tenn.
