CIV.PRAC. &amp; REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.016 (West 2015) (permitting an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act). The trial court denied the motion based on extensive findings supporting some of Yvonne Cardwell's claims that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable. When we first heard this case, we sustained Whataburger's contention that the trial court erred in its unconscionability analysis.\n   <em>\n    Whataburger Restaurants LLC v. Cardwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907492\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/897/#p912\">\n    446 S.W.3d 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 912-13 (Tex.

On petition for review, Yvonne Cardwell did not challenge that part of our opinion, but rather she successfully claimed before the Texas Supreme Court that we erred in not addressing her other reasons to deny arbitration that the trial court had not ruled on.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6811483\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/426/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6811483\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/426/\">\n    at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We now take up those additional arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Our prior opinion sets out the full procedural and factual background. Relevant to the issues before us, it is enough to state that Cardwell claims she was injured while working in the course and scope of her employment with Whataburger when an object struck her on the head. She filed suit alleging a common law negligence cause of action against Whataburger, which is a non-subscriber under the Texas worker's compensation system. Whataburger answered and then moved to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Whataburger supported the motion to compel arbitration with the affidavit of Cardwell's general manager. According to the affidavit, the manager provided Cardwell at the time of hire with Whataburger's arbitration policy that was contained within the Employee Handbook. The policy appears on pages twenty-two and twenty-three of the handbook, under a bold header titled \"Texas Arbitration Policy.\" The policy contains sixteen numbered paragraphs (1.01 to 7.05) which comprehensively set out the terms of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The core of the agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2.01 All employees, by accepting employment or by continuing employment after the implementation of this Policy, shall be required to submit any legally recognized claim or dispute related to their employment, including workplace injury or disease or to the termination of their employment, to arbitration, rather than to litigation, according to this Policy and the rules established for its enforcement. The Company similarly shall be required to proceed to arbitration on all matters properly brought for arbitration by employees and former employees pursuant to this Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The policy has a specific provision that addresses when Whataburger could, and could not, alter this policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The duty imposed on both the Company and on employees to arbitrate all legally recognized claims or disputes arising from the employment relationship shall continue beyond, and not be affected by, the termination of an employee's employment. Moreover the company shall have no right, once the facts giving rise to the legally recognized claim or dispute have occurred, to unilaterally amend or modify this Policy or otherwise avoid its obligation to proceed to arbitration if requested to do so in the absence of mutual consent of the Company and the Employee. Whataburger, Inc. will not alter, modify or amend this Policy without first providing all employees with 30 days advanced written notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   An Employee who chooses to continue employment for at least thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of an amendment or modification of the Policy shall be deemed to have consented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time she was hired, Cardwell signed an \"Acknowledgement Sheet\" where she made four distinct acknowledgements. Relevant here, she acknowledged receipt of the Employee Handbook. That acknowledgment states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK: I understand that the information provided in the Employee Handbook is intended to be used as a guide only. Its provisions are not conditions of employment and may be modified, revoked, changed or deleted by Whataburger Restaurants LLC at any time with or without notice. Nothing in this manual is intended to create, nor is it to be construed to constitute a contract between Whataburger and any of its employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yet the Acknowledgment Sheet also has a specific place where Cardwell acknowledged the binding nature of the arbitration policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ARBITRATION: I understand that Whataburger Restaurant, LLC will submit any legally recognized claim or dispute related to employment, termination of employment, including workplace injury or disease claims except as specifically excluded in paragraph 3.02 of the Arbitration Policy to arbitration and by accepting or continuing employment I shall be required to submit any legally recognized claims or disputes to arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Her regular paychecks also contained an almost identically worded statement acknowledging the arbitration policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Cardwell opposed arbitration on a number of grounds including claims that the agreement was unconscionable and illusory. Following a hearing, the trial court denied arbitration, issuing findings of facts and conclusions of law that sustained one of Cardwell's unconscionability theories. But the findings did not address all of the possible unconscionability theories, and only inferentially refer to the illusory contract argument. In our original opinion, we did not resolve these unaddressed arguments. The supreme court held that was error and we now turn to those additional issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    UNCONSCIONABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   An arbitration agreement might be attacked as either being (1) procedurally unconscionable (referring to the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the arbitration provision) or (2) substantively unconscionable (referring to the fairness of the arbitration provision itself).\n   <em>\n    In re Halliburton Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11446703\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/80/566/#p571\">\n    80 S.W.3d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571 (Tex. 2002). Before the trial court, Cardwell claimed the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable for three reasons. First, Section 7.01 limited her \"rights and remedies.\" That section provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   7.01 Once an arbitration has been requested by either an employee or former employee or by the Company, the arbitration must be completed within twelve months or it will be dismissed with prejudice or want of prosecution unless good cause is shown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Cardwell contended the time limit impaired her ability to conduct discovery, is \"grossly one-sided,\" and employs a subjective \"good cause\" standard that is higher than that under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, Cardwell claimed the agreement was substantively unconscionable because it limited her remedies under the FAA. Section 6.01 of the agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   6.01 Except where it may be shown that the arbitrator's award was procured by fraud or corruption, or where the arbitrator has demonstrated evident partiality or misconduct sufficient to substantially prejudice the rights of one or more of the parties, or where the arbitrator's award shows manifest disregard for the governing law or for this Policy, the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and unappealable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Cardwell contends this provision is more restrictive than the FAA, which for instance allows an agreement to be overturned when it was procured by \"undue means\" (in addition to fraud or corruption). She pointed to several other textual differences between Section 6.01 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) in how arbitration awards are reviewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, Cardwell contended that the requirement for any arbitration to take place in Dallas made the agreement substantively unconscionable because of the expense of litigating there. As we explained in our first opinion, the trial court specifically addressed this last substantive unconscionability argument (arbitrating in Dallas) but did not address the first two arguments (the Section 7.01 and 6.01 challenges).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907492\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/897/#p912\">\n    446 S.W.3d at 910-912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Below, Cardwell also claimed the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because Whataburger \"created an atmosphere that attempted to minimize the possibility of any new hire questioning the arbitration agreement\" and took advantage of the parties \"disparate bargaining ability\" by placing the agreement \"in fine in print buried in an employee manual.\" The trial court made some fact-findings consistent with this claim, but it never expressly held the agreement procedurally unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the supreme court concluded in this case, \"the trial court based its ruling on only some of Cardwell's unconscionability arguments and on its own research and views about arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Cardwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6811483\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/426/\">\n    484 S.W.3d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be more specific, the trial court held the agreement unconscionable on two grounds. Its principle rationale was that Whataburger was buying \"a more favorable fact finder and lying to employees about why [it was doing so].\" This rationale was the trial court's own, as it appears nowhere in Cardwell's written objections and was first raised by the trial judge at the hearing. A second ground that had been urged by Cardwell reasoned that Whataburger might insist that arbitration must take place in Dallas. The trial court deferred ruling on other issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the original appeal to this court, Whataburger attacked both of these rationales. Whataburger also addressed the other unconscionability arguments that Cardwell made in her response to the motion to arbitrate. Cardwell's briefing to this court urged that the trial court was within its discretion to conclude the agreement\n   was unconscionable as it did. Her brief, however, did not specifically address the substantive unconscionability arguments under Section 6.01 or 7.01 of the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We now conclude that the substantive unconscionability claims based on Sections 6.01 and 7.01 of the agreement are waived. Cardwell never urged those issues in this court (nor the Texas Supreme Court) as an alternative basis to affirm the decision. Nor did she respond to Whataburger's arguments contesting those claims. Issues not raised on appeal are generally waived.

These facts, however, would be insufficient to rise to the level of procedural unconscionability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Unconscionability has no precise legal definition because it is not a concept but a determination made in light of a variety of factors.\n   <em>\n    Southwestern Bell Telephone Company v.

Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854109\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/467/494/#p505\">\n    467 S.W.3d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 505 (Tex. 2015). The argument usually arises when the parties agree to arbitrate in one part of a writing, but elsewhere one party has reserved the unilateral right to change the agreement at its sole option.\n   <em>\n    In re 24R, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322667\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/324/564/#p567\">\n    324 S.W.3d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 567 (Tex. 2010) (an arbitration agreement is illusory if one party is able to \"avoid its promise to arbitrate by amending the provision or terminating it altogether\");\n   <em>\n    Carey v. 24 Hour Fitness, USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723751\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/202/#p206\">\n    669 F.3d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 206-09 (5th Cir. 2012) (finding arbitration agreement illusory because employer could unilaterally modify or terminate provision at any time);\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

The arbitration agreement, contained on two pages of the employee handbook, has no escape clause itself. In fact, under the text of the arbitration policy, Whataburger could not alter the agreement, except on thirty days' written notice. Once \"the facts giving rise to the legally recognized claim or dispute have occurred,\" Whataburger had no right \"to unilaterally amend or modify this Policy or otherwise avoid its obligation\" to arbitrate. These types of provisions do not create an illusory contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Halliburton Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11446703\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/80/566/#p571\">\n    80 S.W.3d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570 (Tex. 2002). Rather, Cardwell claims that a statement in the Acknowledgement Sheet provides that everything in the Employee Handbook (which according to Cardwell would necessarily include the Texas Arbitration Policy) \"is intended to be used as a guide only.\" \"Its provisions are not conditions of employment and may be modified, revoked, changed or deleted by Whataburger Restaurants LLC at any time with or without notice. Nothing in this manual is intended to create, nor is it to be construed to constitute a contract between Whataburger and any of its employees.\" Cardwell alternatively contends that at the very least, the seemingly conflicting statements create an ambiguity worthy of remanding the case for the trial court to resolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Whataburger responds that the arbitration agreement is \"stand-alone\" and not part of the Employee Handbook, though it is found there. It also notes that neither the handbook, nor the arbitration agreement\n   incorporate each other-an important factor in prior case law. Whataburger further contends that the acknowledgment form itself proves that the arbitration agreement and the handbook are distinct documents, as each is listed and acknowledged separately on the form. Moreover, the form cannot be considered under the parole evidence rule, and parol evidence is never admissible to create an ambiguity in a complete agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Three prior decisions bear on this issue.

The next nine sentences addressed other employment issues such as the employer's right to verify the answers on the employment application, the need for a pre-employment physical, the at-will nature of the employment, and the employer's right to release information to others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9258255\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/128/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9258255\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/128/223/\">\n    at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We concluded that the arbitration agreement, like that in\n   <em>\n    24R, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , was a stand-alone agreement that contained its own consideration (binding reciprocal promises to arbitrate) and that the non-contractual handbook did not make the agreement illusory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Both sides contend these cases dictate the outcome here. Cardwell contends that\n   <em>\n    In\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re C&amp;H\n   </em>\n   requires us to find the agreement is illusory, or at least\n   <em>\n    J.M. Davidson, Inc.\n   </em>\n   requires a remand with our finding that the agreement is ambiguous. Whataburger likens the case\n   <em>\n    24R, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sun Fab\n   </em>\n   , emphasizing that the agreement here is stand-alone and does not incorporate the handbook. Our problem with both parties' positions is twofold. First, we have an incomplete record because neither party offered the entire employee handbook into the record. We are left with two pages from the middle of that document, and a statement from a separate document that attempts to limit the entire handbook. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Sun Fab\n   </em>\n   , the juxtaposition of the arbitration within the handbook and how it was labeled there, might itself show whether the arbitration agreement is a stand-alone agreement or not. And while Whataburger contends we are limited to looking to the four corners of the agreement under the parole evidence rule, we do not have the four corners of the actual document in our record. We might not even have two corners. We have two pages from the middle of a fifty-page document. We agree that parol evidence cannot be admitted to create an ambiguity to an integrated agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friendswood Dev. Co. v. McDade &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10011007\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/926/280/#p283\">\n    926 S.W.2d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283 (Tex. 1996). The\n   <em>\n    a priori\n   </em>\n   question here, however, is what comprises the integrated agreement. Does the Texas Arbitration Agreement truly stand alone, or is it just a piece of the other provisions in the Employee Handbook?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Our second problem is that the trial court may or may not have considered this issue. The trial court's sixth fact-finding states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   There are provisions in the hand book and the acknowledgment forms which may allow Whataburger to modify, revoke, change, or delete the arbitration policy under some circumstances. Employees have no such powers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court used \"may\" with respect to Whataburger's power to modify, and stated that power existed \"under some circumstances.\" This qualifying language undermines Cardwell's contention that nothing\n   in the handbook was contractual and that Whataburger had an absolute right to negate the arbitration agreement at its pleasure. The circumstances referenced are unclear to us, but our record does suggest that the trial court may have had the entire employee handbook before it (otherwise, how did the court know the number of pages in the document?).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We conclude the wiser course is to remand the illusory contract issue for the trial court to decide on the merits, and upon a full record. As tempting as it may be to bring to an end the procedural wrangling over where to litigate this dispute, we are guided by several other considerations. An appellate court has the discretion to consider alternate grounds to affirm a trial court's decision when those grounds were presented, but not decided by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Life Ins.

The nature of the issue also plays a role, such as whether it is fact intensive and decided on a case-by-case basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v.

C.J., concurring)(agreeing that a fact intensive issue not passed on by trial court should be remanded for it to first consider).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   These considerations guide us to remand without reaching any conclusions on the illusory contract claim. The record is undeveloped. Cardwell's illusory contract theory was barely a page of her thirty-page objection to arbitration. It garnered a bit more prominence at the hearing, but it is at best addressed with only a single glancing blow in the one of the trial court's twenty-seven findings of fact. An operative document, the Employee Handbook, was never introduced below and may (or may not) shed light on whether the arbitration agreement is in fact a stand-alone agreement, implicating the parol evidence rule and several prior and controlling precedents. As even the small subset of cases we discuss above highlight, whether a contract is illusory is often a fact intensive inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We emphasize that we have not decided that the documents before us are ambiguous, nor that if required to do so, we could not decide the case on the present record. We merely decide that the trial court should ensure that the record is complete and that it should take the first pass on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We sustain Whataburger's Issue One as it challenges the trial court's findings invalidating the agreement as being substantively unconscionable. We also overrule Cardwell's alternative basis for asserting procedural and substantive unconscionability.
