Deputy Tracy Watson was traveling in Galveston County when she observed a vehicle, driven by Bernard, approximately a quarter mile in front of her. She testified that the vehicle was \"swerving from lane to lane and even going into the center lane.\" Watson activated her emergency lights and pulled the vehicle over \"to check the welfare of the driver.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Watson testified that Bernard was driving his vehicle at the correct speed, all equipment was functioning properly on the\n   vehicle, the registration and insurance were valid, and Bernard stopped his vehicle normally when he was pulled over. Watson further testified that Bernard's driving did not interfere with any other vehicles and there was nothing unsafe about his driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Video surveillance in Watson's vehicle recorded Bernard's driving for two minutes prior to Watson's activating her emergency lights. After viewing the video at the hearing, Watson conceded that the vehicle's tires went outside the lane only twice and \"not far.\" She also testified that \"there could have been more violations prior to the activation of my lights\" but did not state that there had been. The video shows Watson approaching the vehicle, and Watson testified both that she followed Bernard for one to one-and-one-half minutes and that the video surveillance recorded two minutes before Watson initiated her emergency vehicle lights. Thus, the entire encounter is captured on video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Deputy Jacob Manuel arrived at the scene to assist Watson with the stop. He observed the video at trial and noted that Bernard swerved twice. The first time, Bernard crossed left over the line approximately six to eight inches, and the second time, he crossed right over the line approximately four inches. Manuel later testified on redirect that he observed Bernard on the video cross the line three to four times. But the video reflects that Bernard crossed the line only two times. Manuel did not observe any interference with other vehicles or any unsafe driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court made several findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to our discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Findings\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Watson followed Bernard for approximately one to one-and-one-half minute before Watson activated her emergency lights and initiated a warrantless traffic stop on Bernard;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Watson's dash cam video began recording approximately two minutes prior to her activating her emergency lights;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Bernard properly and without incident initiated his right turn signal, changed lanes into the right lane, and pulled onto the shoulder of the roadway upon seeing Watson's flashing emergency lights;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Watson testified Bernard's vehicle went outside his lane of travel twice and that his vehicle's tires did not cross the line very far, but about three feet or less;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Watson testified there was nothing unsafe about Bernard's driving;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 There was no other traffic around Bernard while he was maintaining or failing to maintain a single lane;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Manuel viewed the dash cam video and testified that Bernard's vehicle only crossed six to eight inches over the lane divider at one point, and approximately four inches at another point. He further testified that in viewing the dash cam video that it appeared to him that Bernard was mostly just \"drifting\" from side to side within his own lane; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Manuel testified Bernard's vehicle did not interfere with any other traffic and his driving was not unsafe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusions\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Watson stopped Bernard without reasonable suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Bernard was not driving in an unsafe manner to any other vehicles on the road, and no reasonable suspicion of a traffic offense under Texas Transportation Code 545.060 existed at the time he was stopped. Bernard's driving was not\n   unsafe to himself or others as evidenced by the testimony of both Watson and Manuel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State argues that the trial court abused its discretion in granting Bernard's motion to suppress because the totality of circumstances establish that there was an objective basis for Watson to have reasonable suspicion that Bernard was driving while intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   When reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress, we give almost total deference to the court's determination of the historical facts that the record supports, especially when those fact findings are based on an evaluation of the witnesses' credibility and demeanor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Leming v.

An officer's stated purpose for a stop can neither validate an illegal stop nor invalidate a legal stop because the stop's legality rests on the totality of the circumstances viewed objectively.\n   <em>\n    Zuniga-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839487\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/845/#p848\">\n    473 S.W.3d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The State argues that the totality of the circumstances establish that Watson had reasonable suspicion supporting the stop based on (1) Watson's observation that Bernard swerved out of his lane \"multiple times\"; (2) the video surveillance; (3) the time of the stop shortly after bars, clubs, and restaurants had closed and the\n   location of the stop; and (4) Watson's training and experience. The State also contends the trial court erroneously based its reasonable suspicion conclusion on Watson's testimony that there could have been an innocent explanation for Bernard's driving and Watson's testimony that she stopped Bernard to do a welfare check and not on suspicion of DWI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Watson's observations and video surveillance\n   </strong>\n   . The State argues that Bernard's \"weaving\" across traffic lanes is sufficient evidence to support a finding of reasonable suspicion of intoxication even if such weaving did not support a finding of a traffic violation. As discussed, the video surveillance revealed that the vehicle crossed the line by a few inches only twice. The State seems to imply that Watson could have observed additional weaving that is not captured on video. But the video shows Watson approaching the vehicle, and Watson testified both that she followed Bernard for one to one-and-one-half minutes and that the video surveillance recorded two minutes before Watson initiated her emergency vehicle lights. Thus, the entire encounter is captured on video. Watson did not testify that she suspected Bernard was intoxicated before she pulled him over, but as noted above, Watson's stated purpose for a stop can neither validate an illegal stop nor invalidate a legal stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839487\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/845/#p848\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She testified that she pulled Bernard over to do a welfare check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State cites three cases from this court to support its argument that Bernard's \"weaving\" supports a finding of reasonable suspicion. Each of these cases involved either weaving back and forth across several lanes of traffic or more erratic actions by the driver than weaving alone:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 In\n   <em>\n    Held v.

The State also complains that the trial court failed to take Watson's training and experience into account in making its determination on reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curtis v.

Here, Watson testified that her DWI training consisted of one 24-hour course she took approximately ten years prior to the stop and that she never took any refresher courses. We do not agree that the record reflects the trial court failed to take Watson's training and experience into account in reaching its conclusion that she lacked reasonable suspicion for the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Challenged Findings\n   </strong>\n   . The State also challenges two of the trial court's findings, contending that they suggest the trial court erroneously concluded Watson lacked reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The State first complains that the following finding suggests the trial court concluded there was no reasonable suspicion because there may have been an innocent explanation for Bernard's driving: \"Watson testified she believed [Bernard] was texting or otherwise using his phone while driving.\" The possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363168,8363134\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/238/376/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363168,8363134\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/238/376/\">\n    at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We conclude under the totality of the circumstances that Watson lacked reasonable suspicion for the stop. The factors relevant to our analysis under this record-Bernard's leaving his lane by a few inches only twice, the time of the stop, and Watson's training and experience-do not amount to specific, articulable facts that, combined with rational inferences from those facts, would have led Watson reasonably to conclude that Bernard was driving while intoxicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State has failed to offer\n   facts characterizing Bernard's driving as erratic or unsafe such that the facts would support a reasonable suspicion of intoxication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
