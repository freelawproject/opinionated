(\"Dr. Hudak\") and I Got Your Back Chiropractic, LLC (\"I Got Your Back\") (collectively \"Defendants\") following a jury trial on Beverly's claim of chiropractic malpractice. Beverly asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial because the trial court made errors involving evidentiary rulings and because the verdict in favor of the Defendants was against the weight of the evidence. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 22, 2007, Beverly fell while playing basketball. It is uncontested that as a result of the fall, Beverly suffered a vertebral artery dissection, which is a tear to the internal layers of the wall of the vertebral artery. Following a vertebral artery dissection, blood flows around the tear, and a blood clot forms to close off the artery, creating a risk that the clot will dislodge and occlude blood vessels in the brain, causing a stroke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Immediately after his fall, Beverly experienced neck pain. Throughout the evening, Beverly's symptoms worsened. Beverly's neck pain progressed in intensity, and he developed neck stiffness. Beverly's head began to hurt. His left eye started to throb and became watery, and he had difficulty keeping his left eye open. Beverly developed blurry vision. Beverly vomited several times and started feeling lightheaded and dizzy. Beverly had no appetite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beverly's symptoms continued through December 28, 2007, when he sought medical treatment at Truman Medical Center's emergency room. Beverly complained of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, decreased appetite, and a severe, constant headache on his left side that was made worse with movement. Truman Medical Center ordered a CT scan and a lumbar puncture. The results of both tests were normal. Truman Medical Center discharged Beverly with medications to treat his symptoms, with instructions to return if his headache persisted or worsened, and with instructions to follow up with his primary care provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 31, 2007, Beverly went to the emergency room at St. Luke's North Hospital, complaining of the same symptoms, though they were more localized to the left-side of his body. St. Luke's North Hospital reviewed the records from Truman Medical Center and examined Beverly. St. Luke's North Hospital gave Beverly medications for his symptoms and allowed him to rest in the emergency room before discharging him with the same instructions Beverly received from Truman Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beverly's symptoms continued, so he went to I Got Your Back on January 2, 2008, to receive chiropractic care from Dr. Hudak. Beverly reported a left-sided headache made worse by movement. Beverly reported that Truman Medical Center performed a CT scan and a lumbar puncture and that the results of both tests were normal. Dr. Hudak took x-rays of Beverly's cervical spine and requested radiology interpretation. Dr. Hudak's notes reported that Beverly's \"[l]eft side eye is protruding and waters a lot,\" and noted nystagmus in Beverly's left eye. Dr. Hudak examined Beverly and found a subluxation at C5, the fifth cervical vertebra located in the lower-middle portion of the neck. Dr. Hudak performed a chiropractic adjustment to\n   Beverly's neck. After the adjustment, Beverly returned home and took a nap. When Beverly woke up, he felt much better and had regained his appetite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next day, Beverly's symptoms returned. Beverly's roommate drove him to I Got Your Back on January 4, 2008, for another chiropractic adjustment. Immediately after Dr. Hudak performed the adjustment on Beverly's cervical spine, Beverly's eyes rolled back into his head, his right arm and left leg shook, and his speech became slurred. Dr. Hudak's assistant called 911. An ambulance transported Beverly to North Kansas City Hospital, where doctors diagnosed Beverly's vertebral artery dissection for the first time and determined that Beverly had suffered four strokes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beverly filed suit against the Defendants. Though it was uncontested that Beverly sustained his vertebral artery dissection while playing basketball on December 22, 2007, the jury was asked to determine whether Dr. Hudak's chiropractic adjustment on January 4, 2008, caused a blood clot to dislodge and occlude blood vessels in the brain, causing Beverly's strokes. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Defendants, and the trial court entered a judgment (\"Judgment\") accepting the jury's verdict. Beverly filed a motion for new trial, which was overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beverly filed this timely appeal. Additional facts will be discussed where relevant to Beverly's points on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Beverly presents five points on appeal, each of which argue that the trial court erred in denying Beverly's motion for new trial. \"[T]o succeed on a motion for new trial, the moving party must establish 'that trial error or misconduct of the prevailing party incited prejudice in the jury.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sherar v.

Specifically, a fundamental hazard arising from the position advocated by ... counsel is the promotion of a form of sandbagging by counsel.

Then, when the time comes for trial ..., counsel could claim \"surprise\" and seek to have the testimony excluded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359067\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/98/628/#p632\">\n    98 S.W.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Beverly's first point on appeal identifies eight \"new\" opinions Dr. Pikus gave at trial: (i) that Beverly did not have nystagmus when he was treated by Dr. Hudak; (ii) that it takes twenty seconds for a blood clot to travel to the brain; (iii) that Beverly had suffered a stroke more than forty-eight hours before Dr. Hudak adjusted his neck; (iv) that Beverly made a remarkable recovery with rehabilitation; (v) that Beverly did not comply with treatment recommendations; (vi) that Beverly's cognitive dysfunction was not caused by his stroke ; (vii) that Beverly reached maximum medical improvement; and (viii) that Beverly's insomnia and memory issues were not caused by his stroke. Beverly argues that these opinions were \"new,\" and subject to exclusion from evidence, because Dr. Pikus was asked in his deposition if he had given all of the opinions he intended to offer at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beverly began his cross-examination of Dr. Pikus by asking him to admit that he had offered \"new opinions\" during his direct examination-that is opinions he had not given during his deposition. Dr. Pikus responded that any \"new opinions\" given at trial involved matters he had not been asked about during his deposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Beverly complains that Dr. Pikus testified at trial that even though Dr. Hudak made a notation that Beverly had \"nystagmus present left eye,\" Dr. Pikus did not believe that Beverly had nystagmus because nystagmus symptoms would have been present in both eyes. Beverly complains that this opinion was not provided during Dr. Pikus's deposition. Beverly's argument fails to account for the fact that Dr. Pikus's trial testimony on this subject was provided in response to Beverly's cross-examination of Dr. Pikus. [Tr. 1236] Beverly did not object to the trial testimony at the time it was given, or otherwise seek relief from the trial court regarding the testimony, leaving his objection on appeal unpreserved for our review.\n   <em>\n    Host\n   </em>\n   , 460 S.W.3d at 106. Moreover, during his deposition, Dr. Pikus was generally asked about the causes of nystagmus. Dr. Pikus testified during his deposition that a dissection will not cause nystagmus, though the sequelae of dissection (such as a stroke or ischemia) might cause nystagmus. He was not asked about Beverly's reported nystagmus. In order for an expert's testimony to constitute a surprise, \"the attorney deposing the witness must ask for the expert's opinion and/or the underlying facts or data.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359067\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/98/628/#p632\">\n    98 S.W.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, Beverly challenges Dr. Pikus's testimony that it takes approximately 20 seconds for a blood clot to travel to the brain once it dislodges. Dr. Pikus offered this trial testimony to explain why he believed that even though Beverly suffered a stroke while he was at Dr. Hudak's office, the stroke was not caused by Dr. Hudak's manipulation. During his deposition, Dr. Pikus consistently testified that \"any little movement\" will free a clot, and that although there was a temporal relationship between when Beverly had a stroke and his presence in Dr. Hudak's office, he could not say that Dr. Hudak's manipulation caused the clot to let lose. Dr. Pikus's trial testimony about the time it takes a blood clot to travel to the brain constituted an explanation for the causation opinion Dr. Pikus provided both at trial and during his deposition. However, Beverly's counsel did not ask Dr. Pikus to explain the basis for his causation opinion during his deposition. \"[T]he attorney deposing the witness must ask for the expert's opinion\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and/or the underlying facts or data\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Sherar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359067\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/98/628/#p632\">\n    98 S.W.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Dr. Pikus's trial testimony was not surprise testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Third, Beverly claims that Dr. Pikus's trial testimony that Beverly suffered a stroke at least forty-eight hours before his January 4, 2008 visit to Dr. Hudak was a surprise. We disagree. Dr. Pikus testified at trial that, in addition to the stroke that Beverly suffered on January 4, 2008 at Dr. Hudak's office, Beverly suffered other strokes, including one that occurred at least forty-eight hours before the CT scan taken after his admission to North Kansas City Hospital. During his deposition, Dr. Pikus similarly testified that Beverly had a stroke before his neck was manipulated by Dr. Hudak on January 4, 2008. He explained that this prior stroke occurred \"at least a day\" before the CT scan on January 4, 2008. Though Dr. Pikus's\n   trial testimony, which suggested that the time frame of the earlier stroke was forty-eight hours before January 4, 2008, was more specific than the \"at least a day\" time frame testified to in his deposition, the discrepancy is not so material as to constitute surprise testimony. The principle requiring a party to disclose when an expert witness changes an opinion \"is not intended as a mechanism for contesting every variance between discovery and trial testimony. Impeachment of the witness will accomplish that goal.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359067\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/98/628/#p632\">\n    98 S.W.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Beverly's fourth objection involves Dr. Pikus's testimony at trial that Beverly's rehabilitation at North Kansas Hospital \"went really well\" and that Beverly \"made a remarkable recovery.\" This was not surprise testimony. Dr. Pikus similarly testified during his deposition that Beverly \"recovered awfully well\" from his January 4, 2008 stroke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Beverly's fifth objection involves Dr. Pikus's testimony at trial that based on a review of Beverly's medical records: (i) Beverly had been referred to complete a sleep study at least two times though no sleep study appeared in Beverly's medical records; (2) Beverly's doctors had requested that Beverly keep a headache diary but there was no indication that Beverly had ever done so; and (3) despite being referred to physical therapy, Beverly did not attend all of his physical therapy appointments. Dr. Pikus's factual impressions were drawn from medical records admitted into evidence. The records identified by Dr. Pikus at trial were the same records Dr. Pikus identified as having been reviewed in advance of his deposition. Beverly's attorney did not ask Dr. Pikus whether he had drawn any impressions from Beverly's medical records regarding Beverly's compliance with treatment recommendations, even though Dr. Pikus was identified as an expert on the subject of the \"nature and cause of [Beverly's] condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359067\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/98/628/#p632\">\n    98 S.W.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The sixth opinion Beverly challenges is Dr. Pikus's trial testimony that Beverly's cognitive dysfunction was not caused by his stroke. This was not surprise testimony. At trial, Dr. Pikus explained that Beverly's strokes occurred in the cerebellum, brain stem, and right thalamus, and that none of those areas of the brain are associated with cognitive function. During Dr. Pikus's deposition, Beverly's attorney asked, \"Do you know [if] there's damage to any of the cerebellum or to the brain stem or to the thalmus, whether it'll impair any of the patient's cognitive abilities?\" Dr. Pikus answered, \"None of those areas should affect his cognitive function at all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The seventh opinion Beverly challenges is Dr. Pikus's trial testimony that he believed Beverly had reached maximum medical improvement within a year of the strokes. Beverly's point on appeal complains about Dr. Pikus's cross-examination testimony. [L.F. 1265-66] However, it was Beverly's question of Dr. Pikus that used the phrase \"maximum medical improvement,\" not Dr. Pikus's response. Dr. Pikus did explain on direct-examination that he had reviewed Beverly's medical records from January 2008 to January 2009 because \"this is the critical period [in which] you can expect that somebody is going to be at their maximum medical improvement.\" One of these records indicated that Beverly was \"neurologically normal\" in August 2008. However, Beverly did not object to this direct examination testimony at trial, and has not cited to this testimony as the basis for his claim of error on appeal, preserving nothing for our review.\n   <em>\n    Host\n   </em>\n   , 460 S.W.3d at 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The eighth opinion Beverly challenges is Dr. Pikus's trial testimony that Beverly's insomnia and memory problems were due\n   to stress. At trial, Dr. Pikus testified that insomnia and memory problems \"are characteristic of stress reaction\" and that he believed that stress is \"responsible for [Beverly's] tension headaches and his insomnia and his perception of cognitive trouble.\" During his deposition, Dr. Pikus was specifically asked for his \"opinion as to why [Beverly is] having the trouble he's having now.\" Dr. Pikus similarly responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Well, it sounds to me that [Beverly is] enduring the sort of stress that a lot of adults endure. I mean, the stress of finding the right job and working and raising a family, and I understand that he's lost a child. You know, it seems like he has a fairly stressful life. And my understanding also is that he-his cognitive function really didn't start out too much differently than it is now ... it sounds like the description of things now is pretty similar to the description of his earlier life, and he's just responding to the stresses of his life the way most adults would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. Pikus's trial testimony was not a surprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial court did not err in denying Beverly's motion for new trial based on Beverly's claims that Dr. Pikus provided surprise expert opinion testimony. Point One is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Point Two: Permitting Dr. Hudak's Expert Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Beverly's second point on appeal argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial because Dr. Hudak should not have been allowed to give surprise expert witness testimony on the subject of whether his treatment of Beverly fell below the chiropractic standard of care. Beverly asserts that Dr. Hudak should not have been permitted to give this opinion because he had not been disclosed or identified as an expert witness on the issue of the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Beverly's claim of error fails to differentiate between the discovery rules applicable to retained versus non-retained experts. \"Discovery rules distinguish between facts and opinions held by non-retained experts from those held by experts who acquired facts and developed opinions in anticipation of litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Louis Cty. v.

In a pretrial conference on April 21, 2016, the trial court denied the motion in limine, explaining that if there was trial testimony that recent drug use could have affected Beverly's injuries, then it would allow the evidence. The trial court added that it would not allow the Defendants to \"ask about prior use in general, but only through an expert if-if there is expert testimony somewhere in that testimony that says the use of it could have affected\" Beverly's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On each occasion during trial when the prospect of admitting evidence of Beverly's drug use was broached by the Defendants, Beverly successfully objected, resulting in the exclusion of the evidence. Beverly nonetheless asserts on appeal that the trial court's denial of his motion in limine set in motion a series of procedural events that were ultimately grounds for a mistrial. During voir dire, Beverly's attorney asked the venire the following question: \"Now, this next issue, the defendants and their witnesses may talk about drugs and whether or not Mr. Beverly, my client, has experimented with them when he was younger. Is there anyone here who believes it would be difficult for them to enter a verdict for a person who may have experimented with drugs when they were younger?\" No venirepersons raised their hands. The Defendants' attorney then asked the venire if anyone had an experience when working in health care when a patient did not fully disclose all relevant information. A juror answered, referencing\n   patients' tendency to hide drug use, particularly cocaine or meth. The Defendants' attorney then stated, \"[Beverly's attorney] indicated that there may be an issue in this case about drug use. And since you're involved with caring for patients-you mentioned cocaine-is that something that can have adverse consequences to patients?\" The venireperson responded affirmatively, and stated that if the patient is currently on cocaine or meth and discloses that information, the treatment plan will be different. Beverly moved for a mistrial the next morning before opening statements. Beverly argued that a mistrial was necessary because \"the jury has been voir dired on the drug issue, and I can't unring that bell.\" The trial court denied the request for mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We express no opinion as to whether Beverly's request for a mistrial should have been granted. Neither Beverly's motion for new trial nor his point on appeal claim error in the denial of his request for a mistrial. Instead, Beverly's point on appeal challenges only the trial court's preliminary ruling denying Beverly's motion in limine, a ruling which preserves nothing for our review. Beverly argues that the motion in limine ruling left him no choice but to question the venire about prejudice or bias regarding drug use. Beverly cites no authority, however, for the proposition that his decision to voir dire on the subject of drug use converted the trial court's interlocutory pre-trial ruling into an appealable ruling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Rule 84.04(d) requires that an Appellant provide appropriate citation to authority in support of his contentions.

We will not disturb that ruling on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Point Five is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The trial court's Judgment is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    All concur\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
