The plaintiffs are property owners in the annexed area who argue that the city had no authority to assess property taxes in the area for 2012 because its annexation of the area took effect after January 1, 2012. The trial court concluded that the tax was lawful because the City's annexation of the area took effect before January 1, 2012 and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Discerning no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 20, 2001, the Memphis City Council passed an ordinance to extend the boundaries of the City of Memphis (the \"City\") by annexing the South Cordova area effective December 31, 2001. On December 18, 2001, Gene B. Cochran and other residents of South Cordova filed a\n   <em>\n    quo warranto\n   </em>\n   action to contest the validity of the annexation ordinance (\"\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   \"). No other\n   <em>\n    quo warranto\n   </em>\n   actions contesting the validity of the annexation ordinance were filed within 30 days of the passing of the ordinance. On April 20, 2011, the trial court entered an order dismissing\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   due to the plaintiffs' failure to prosecute the case. The\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs filed a post-judgment motion to set aside the dismissal, and the trial court entered a final order denying the post-judgment motion on June 28, 2011. No appeal was taken from the dismissal of\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 5, 2011, the\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs filed a second\n   <em>\n    quo warranto\n   </em>\n   action to contest the annexation ordinance (\"\n   <em>\n    Cochran II\n   </em>\n   \"). On May 16, 2012, the trial court entered an order dismissing\n   <em>\n    Cochran II\n   </em>\n   for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The\n   <em>\n    Cochran II\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs appealed, and this Court affirmed the dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cochran v.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, in which they argued that the taxes were lawful because the City's annexation of South Cordova took effect 31 days after the entry of the final judgment in\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   on June 28, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a period of discovery, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. In support of their motion, the defendants submitted portions of the record from\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   demonstrating that a final judgment was entered in that case on June 28, 2011, and no appeal was taken therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants argued that, by statute, the annexation ordinance took effect 31 days later, on July 29, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-51-103\">\n    Tenn.

In support of their motion, the plaintiffs submitted evidence intending to demonstrate that the annexation ordinance took effect, at the earliest, on July 1, 2012. According to the evidence introduced by the plaintiffs, residents of South Cordova paid monthly fire protection fees to Shelby County through June 2012. The City began providing primary emergency and waste removal services to the South Cordova area on July 1, 2012. Around the same time, the residents of South Cordova received a letter, dated June 29, 2012, from the City's mayor that stated in part, \"As the Mayor of Memphis, let me be the first to officially welcome you and your family to the great City of Memphis, Tennessee.\" Enclosed with the letter, the residents of South Cordova received a document titled, \"South Cordova Annexation Frequently Asked Questions.\" In part, the document stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Q: When does this annexation become official?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   : The Memphis City Council officially annexed South Cordova in October 2001. Although action was delayed because of ongoing litigation through May 15, 2012, the Courts ruled that the annexation is effective as of January 1, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Q: I recall some mention of annexation some years ago, but why am I just hearing about our community being officially annexed now?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   : The 2001 annexation was delayed by the lawsuit filed by the residents of the area. This original lawsuit was dismissed by the courts on June 28, 2011 and annexation was official as of July 30, 2011 when the plaintiffs did not file an appeal within the 30 days allowed. By law, annexation was to be fully implemented starting January 1, 2012. However, a second lawsuit was filed by the same residents of the area on July 5, 2011. This second lawsuit was not decided until May 15, 2012. Because of the delay caused by these lawsuits, July 1, 2012 is now the official start date for operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Q: Can't this be put off until next year?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   : The City annexed the South Cordova area on December 4, 2001. The residents of the area contested the annexation by a timely filed lawsuit. That lawsuit was finally concluded June 28, 2011 and pursuant to Tennessee law, South Cordova residents are citizens of Memphis. Also, pursuant to Tennessee law, properties within the area became subject to City of Memphis taxes on January 1, 2012. The tax was assessed that date but will be collected in and used for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012, the new fiscal year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Q: When will I be taxed by the City of Memphis?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   : Residents and businesses in the annexed area will receive a City of Memphis property tax bill for the full 2012 tax year. Property tax bills for 2012 will be mailed to property owners by the third week of July 2012. If you have questions regarding your tax bill please contact the City Treasurer's Office ... or call the Mayor's Citizen's Service Center[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following a hearing, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. In an incorporated statement of its findings and conclusions, the trial court explained that, based on the undisputed evidence submitted by the defendants, the annexation became effective on July 29, 2011 (31 days\n   after a final judgment was entered in\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   ), and the City's assessment of 2012 property taxes in South Cordova was lawful. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a post-judgment motion to alter or amend. The trial court denied the motion, and the plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiffs raise the following issues on appeal, restated from their brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1.

The ordinance stated that the annexation would take effect on December 31, 2001. The\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs timely filed a\n   <em>\n    quo warranto\n   </em>\n   action contesting the validity of the ordinance during the 30-day period before it became operative. No other\n   <em>\n    quo warranto\n   </em>\n   actions were filed during the 30-day period. A final judgment dismissing\n   <em>\n    Cochran I\n   </em>\n   was entered on June 28, 2011, and no appeal was taken from it.\n   <em>\n    Cochran II\n   </em>\n   was not filed in the 30-day period following passage of the annexation ordinance and, as such, did not operate to hold the annexation ordinance in abeyance. Therefore, based on a straightforward application of the governing statutes to the undisputed facts, the City's annexation ordinance became operative, and the City's annexation of South Cordova took effect 31 days later on July 29, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Nevertheless, the plaintiffs argue that the City's annexation ordinance became effective, at the earliest, on July 1, 2012, when the City began providing municipal services to the residents of South Cordova. As we explained, however, only a\n   <em>\n    quo warranto\n   </em>\n   action filed within 30 days of an annexation ordinance's passage will operate to hold the annexation in abeyance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Oak Ridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9954454\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/563/895/#p897\">\n    563 S.W.2d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, once an annexation takes effect, the municipality may only contract its boundaries by ordinance or referendum vote pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 6-51-201. As such, the City's failure to provide municipal services to the residents of South Cordova until July 1, 2012 did not alter or delay the effective date of the annexation. Likewise, the mayor had no authority to alter or delay the annexation. Because the City's annexation of South Cordova took effect on July 29, 2011, it was entitled to collect property taxes from the newly annexed area for 2012, and the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the \"Statement of Issues Presented for Review\" section of their appellate brief, the plaintiffs pose the following question: \"Did the Trial Court err in merely adopting verbatim the eight page Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law submitted by the Defendant\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the Court's ruling?\" As the defendants point out, however, the \"Argument\" section of the plaintiffs' appellate brief contains neither citations to the alleged error in the record, nor any argument explaining how the trial court erred. Courts have routinely held that the failure to make appropriate references to the record and to cite relevant authority in the argument section of an appellate brief as required by Rule 27(a)(7) of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure constitutes a waiver of the issue.\n   <em>\n    Bean v.

The costs of this appeal are taxed to the appellants, Joseph O'Shields, Tommie Isom, Warren Riggs, Roy Fisk, and Ken Netherton, jointly and severally, and their sureties, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Although the plaintiffs request a refund of property taxes collected by the City in 2012, their complaint states only that the City of Memphis has expressed its intent to collect 2012 property taxes from the residents of South Cordova. As such, it is unclear whether the plaintiffs had actually paid any 2012 property taxes to the City of Memphis at the time the complaint was filed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    On May 16, 2013, the General Assembly enacted legislation that established a moratorium preventing municipalities from extending their corporate limits by means of annexation ordinance from April 15, 2013 to May 15, 2014.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-51-122\">\n     Tenn.
