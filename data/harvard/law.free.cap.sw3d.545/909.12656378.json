Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   his sentence for stealing should not have been enhanced to a class C felony, and he should instead have been convicted of a class A misdemeanor. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Watson pleaded guilty to the class C felony of stealing. He was placed on probation. Watson's probation was revoked, and\n   he was thereafter sentenced to five years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Watson timely filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 24.035. Appointed counsel timely filed an amended motion (\"Amended Motion\"). The Amended Motion alleged that pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   , Watson's five-year sentence exceeded the maximum punishment authorized by law for what should have been a class A misdemeanor. On May 23, 2017, the Amended Motion was denied by an unsigned, handwritten docket entry that stated \"Amended Mot to vacate denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 26, 2017, Watson filed a motion for reconsideration or to amend the judgment which argued, among other things, that Rule 24.035(j)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   required the motion court to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on all issues presented, whether or not a hearing is held. Pursuant to Rule 78.07(c), Watson asked the motion court to amend its judgment in order to make the required findings and conclusions. On May 30, 2017, the motion to amend the judgment was denied by an unsigned, handwritten docket entry that stated \"Mot For Reconsideration denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Watson timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Watson asserts a single point on appeal. He alleges that the motion court clearly erred in denying the Amended Motion because Watson's five-year term of imprisonment exceeded the maximum sentence authorized by law because pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   , Watson's sentence should not have been enhanced to a class C felony and should instead have remained a class A misdemeanor with a maximum one-year term of imprisonment. Before addressing the merits of Watson's point on appeal, we are required to address two procedural issues that potentially impact our authority to entertain this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Whether the motion court entered a final judgment for purposes of appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Prior to reaching the merit of the issues set forth in this case, this Court must determine,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , if there is a final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ndegwa v.

Here, the May 23, 2017 docket entry denying Watson's Amended Motion was in writing, but was neither signed by the motion court nor denominated as a judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is settled, however, that orders disposing of post-conviction motions are not bound by the denomination requirement set forth in Rule 74.01(a). Although post-conviction proceedings pursuant to Rules 24.035 and 29.15 are civil proceedings, they are \"governed by the rules of civil procedure insofar as applicable.\" Rule 24.035(a); Rule 29.15(a). Thus, \"[a]ny rule\n   of civil procedure that conflicts with Rule 29.15 or Rule 24.035 does not govern.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Reber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11693156\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/976/450/#p451\">\n    976 S.W.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451 (Mo. banc 1998) (citing\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Rules 24.035(k) and 29.15(k) provide that \"[a]n order sustaining or overruling a motion filed under the provisions of [either rule] shall be deemed a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\" In\n   <em>\n    Reber\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found this language to be in conflict with the denomination requirement set forth in Rule 74.01(a).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11693156\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/976/450/#p451\">\n    976 S.W.2d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Reber\n   </em>\n   then concluded that the conflicting language in Rule 74.01(a) \"runs counter to the purposes of Rule 29.15 [and Rule 24.035]\" as \"[i]t would only cause delay in the processing of the [post-conviction] claim [to] apply[ ] the denomination requirement of Rule 74.01(a) to post-conviction appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11693156\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/976/450/#p451\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, an order disposing of a post-conviction motion filed pursuant to Rules 24.035 or 29.15 need not be denominated as a judgment in order to be final for purposes of appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11693156\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/976/450/#p451\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Reber\n   </em>\n   did not address the signature requirement described in Rule 74.01(a). However, when it addressed the denomination requirement,\n   <em>\n    Reber\n   </em>\n   first compared Rules 24.035 and 29.15 with Rule 74.01(a) to determine whether the provisions were in conflict. Employing the same template, a comparison of Rules 24.035 and 29.15 with the signature requirement described in Rule 74.01(a) does not reveal any conflict. If anything, Rules 24.035(k) and 29.15(k) are expressly co-extensive with a signature requirement as both provide that \"[a]ppellate review\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     of the trial court's action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   on the motion filed under [either Rule] shall be limited to a determination of whether the findings and conclusions\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     of the trial court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   are clearly erroneous.\" (Emphasis added). A signature ensures that the order being reviewed is, indeed, the trial court's action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We are cognizant, however, of the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Mercer v.

In\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court addressed whether a docket entry denying a section 547.035 motion for post-conviction DNA testing was final for purposes of appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374718\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/748/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374718\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/748/\">\n    at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The docket entry stated: 'Cause called.

Unlike the approach taken in\n   <em>\n    Reber\n   </em>\n   , however,\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   did not first compare section 547.035 with Rule 74.01(a) to determine if the provisions were in conflict. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   construed the phrase \"insofar as applicable\" to mean that a conflict exists simply \"[i]f a rule of civil procedure conflicts\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     with the purpose\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the post-conviction rules,\" even in the absence of conflict in the provisions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374718\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/748/\">\n    512 S.W.3d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   observed that the purpose of post-conviction rules is \"to process prisoners' claims promptly, prevent the litigation of stale claims, and to ensure the legality of a sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374718\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/748/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   thus concluded that \"[a]ny delay in dismissing the case merely so the circuit court could denominate its order as a judgment would thwart the purposes of Missouri's post-conviction rules in that it would not lead to a prompt resolution of Mercer's claim or ensure the legality of his conviction and sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374718\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/748/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374718\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/748/\">\n    at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though unmentioned, this rationale applies equally to the order's failure to comply with Rule\n   74.01(a)'s signature requirement. There is no escaping that even though the docket entry in\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   was neither signed by a judge nor denominated a judgment, the docket entry was deemed a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374718\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/748/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374718\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/748/\">\n    at 752-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We are constrained, therefore, to analogously conclude that Rule 74.01(a)'s signature requirement does not apply to orders denying Rule 24.035 or Rule 29.15 motions. The May 23, 2017 docket entry denying Watson's Amended Motion is a final judgment for purposes of appeal, even though the docket entry was not signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Whether the motion court's failure to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law precludes appellate review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Though the May 23, 2017 docket entry is a final judgment for purposes of appeal, it does not include any factual findings or legal conclusions. Rules 24.035(j) and 29.15(j) require a motion court to \"issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on all issues presented, whether or not a hearing is held.\" Written findings and conclusions are required because appellate review of a motion court's disposition of a post-conviction motion is limited to determining whether the trial court's findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 24.035(k); Rule 29.15(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, error occasioned by a motion court's failure to issue findings and conclusions must be preserved by filing a Rule 78.07(c) motion to amend the motion court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Watson filed a timely motion to amend the May 23, 2017 docket entry.

Though a\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   claim that a sentence has been unlawfully entered may be procedurally cognizable under Rule 24.035 in a strictly technical sense, a\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   claim asserted pursuant to Rule 24.035 is substantively without merit as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
