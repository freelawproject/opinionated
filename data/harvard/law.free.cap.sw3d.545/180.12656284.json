(West 2015), more commonly referred to as the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA). This case began as a routine collections suit: a creditor sued several debtors for non-payment of a debt, as evidenced by unpaid invoices. The debtors counterclaimed, asserting that several cross-defendants conspired to falsify the invoices, and then communicated the fact of their subsequent non-payment to third-parties. The counterclaim triggered the creditors' use of the TCPA seeking to dismiss various counts of the counterclaim. While denying they improperly conspired or made the specific derogatory communications complained of, the creditors contended that the communications as alleged would implicate their rights to free speech, right of petition, and right of association as those terms are uniquely defined by the TCPA. After it dismissed some, but not all, of the counterclaims for other reasons, the trial court decided the TCPA motion was moot. We disagree with that conclusion reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This suit began as an action to collect a debt. MVS International Corp. (MVS) sued\n   International Advertising Solutions, LLC (IAS) and Next Level Firm, LLC (Next Level) for $60,115.45 allegedly owed for unpaid advertising and other services. MVS runs a radio station. IAS and Next Level are advertising agencies that buy ad time and design media campaigns on behalf of their clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This otherwise mundane commercial dispute took an unusual twist when IAS and Next Level, along with their principal, Rene Rascon, (collectively the Appellees) filed an Original Counterclaim and Third Party Claim. The pleading added new parties, including MVS's General Manager, Manuel Saturno. It also added Southwest University and its principals as defendants (Southwest defendants).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gist of the Counterclaim's factual allegations contend that in 2014, Rascon and the Southwest defendants settled a legal dispute between themselves, but the Southwest defendants continued to harbor animosity towards Rascon. The Southwest defendants and Saturno were close friends, and allegedly developed a plan to injure the credit and business reputation of Appellees. According to the Counterclaim, the Southwest defendants paid Saturno $300,000 in exchange for MVS changing computerized invoice records to add false charges to Appellees' accounts. MVS would then sue on the unpaid invoices as evidenced by the original petition in this case. The Counterclaim further alleged that MVS and Saturno reported to the credit bureaus that the false billings were unpaid, and published to \"other public media outlets\" that Appellees were \"deadbeats\" and advised others not to do business with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After deposing Rascon and serving paper discovery, MVS and Saturno responded to the Counterclaim with a series of motions. They moved to dismiss under TEX.R.CIV.P. 13 and 91a, as well as TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 9.011 and \u00a7 10.001 (West 2017). And pertinent to this appeal, they filed a motion on April 4, 2016, to dismiss the case under the TCPA. The TCPA motion claimed that the allegations in the Counterclaim were based on, related to, or were asserted in response to Appellants' right to free speech, right to petition and right of association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellees responded by filing Defendants' Supplemental Answer and Counter Plaintiffs and Third Party Plaintiffs Amended Claims (the amended Counterclaim).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended pleading omitted some earlier factual allegations, such as the contention that the counter-defendants had reported the bad debt to the credit bureaus, or had somehow retrieved and changed filings made with the FCC. The core of the factual allegations, however, were the same: based on an agreement with the Southwest defendants and payment from them, MVS and Saturno had changed and falsified its invoices for advertising that consequently went unpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   They then reported the bad debt along with other disparaging comments to others in the industry who stopped doing business with Appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From these factual allegations, Appellees alleged these causes of action: (1) civil conspiracy; (2) breach of contract; (3) fraud; (4) interference with business relations; (5) business disparagement; (6) defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress; (7) violation of the Deceptive Trade Act and (8) spoliation. MVS and Saturno filed a supplement to their TCPA motion to dismiss, addressing the newly added causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellees then filed a First Supplemental Claim for Breach of Settlement Agreement alleging that the Southwest defendants had agreed to a non-disparagement clause in their earlier settlement agreement. They claimed that the Southwest defendants breached that clause by defaming them, and accused Rascon of having stolen from the Southwest defendants. The supplemental petition further claimed that the Southwest defendants enlisted MVS and Saturno \"to repeat such statements to other media outlets.\" The supplemental petition described MVS and Rascon as agents of the Southwest defendants for spreading the derogatory information to other media outlets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court granted MVS and Saturno's Rule 91a motion in part, dismissing Appellees' DTPA, statutory fraud, breach of FCC rules, breach of Chapter 32 of the Texas Penal Code, and spoliation claims. The trial court also dismissed the infliction of emotional distress claims made by the corporate entities IAS and Next Level. Finally, the trial court dismissed the breach of contract claims asserted against Saturno individually. The court awarded MVS and Saturno attorney's fees under their Rule 91a motion. After noting that the Rule 91a and TCPA motions were argued together, the trial court concluded that the TCPA motion was moot. MVS and Saturno then filed this interlocutory appeal. TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.014(a)(12) (West Supp. 2016)(authorizing an appeal from an interlocutory order that \"denies a motion to dismiss filed under [the TCPA]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    CONTROLLING LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Legislature passed the TCPA to \"encourage and safeguard the constitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise participate in government to the maximum extent permitted by law and, at the same time, protect the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\" TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.002.

Under the first step, a defendant invokes the TCPA by timely moving to dismiss a claim upon an initial showing, supported by a preponderance of the evidence, that the plaintiff's claim \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to the [movant's] exercise of: (1) the right of free speech; (2) the right to petition; or (3) the right of association.\" TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.005(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Though the stated purpose of the TCPA is to protect certain constitutionally protected rights, the manner in which those rights are statutorily defined is not coextensive with constitutional jurisprudence.

The allegation then claims, \"MVS and Saturno committed one or more unlawful, overt acts through violations of the Chapter 32 of the Texas Penal Code.\" The petition does not allege a specific Penal Code provision, but at least two are potentially implicated by a claim of altering an invoice for an improper purpose. TEX.PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 32.21(b) (West 2016)(\"A person commits an offense if he forges a writing with intent to defraud or harm another.\"); TEX.

We focus on only one, the right of free speech. The end-point of the conspiracy was Appellants' communication to third parties that Appellees did not pay their bills and were deadbeats. Under the TCPA, one exercises a right of free speech by making a communication in connection with a matter of public concern. TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.001(3). A public concern can include \"a good, product or service in the marketplace.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202839873\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 27.001(7)(E).

Conversely, businesses have a corresponding right to communicate between themselves about customers, or potential customers. Otherwise, a bank could never inform other financial institutions that a putative borrower chronically defaults on loans, or a merchant could never warn other stores of serial shoplifters. To be sure, the information provided must be truthful, but this free flow of accurate information is essential to an efficient marketplace. Stripping away the falsity component of the allegation, Appellants here have done no more than warn other media outlets about potential customers who (allegedly) do not pay their accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Appellants also urge that their communications in forming the alleged conspiracy are protected by the right of association.

While Rascon repeats the substance of what was told to these entities, he does not state, nor establish any basis for him to have known, the context of how the statements were made to Telemundo, KTSM, or Edwards Homes or the magazines. Consequently, he cannot show the statements were made a part of Appellants' sale of goods or services, or that the recipients were \"actual or potential buyer[s] or customer[s],\"-a necessary predicate for the commercial speech exception to apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John Moore Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 441 S.W.3d at 354 (Bureau rating of company was not part of its own efforts to sell memberships, thus the commercial speech exemption did not apply).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Rascon's affidavit and his deposition testimony that Appellants attached to their TCPA motion present a somewhat different case for Televisa. MVS also promotes large events, and solicits other media outlets for promotional opportunities. The Southwest defendants intended to sponsor a concert in El Paso. Rascon was in negotiations to establish a Televisa presence in El Paso. The concert provided an opportunity to launch that business.

He said, 'He came here for two things. Number one, he came as a goodwill sign to meet director to director, and to offer that the Exa concert be televised,' which has never happened. And the Televisa director told him that that was a very good idea. We just hired somebody who's going to be in charge of El Paso. And he said, 'That's the second reason I'm here.' And he told him, 'Why?' And he said, 'We\n   have worked with Rene Rascon. We have some lawsuits, legal problems, and Southwest University does not want to work with him.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   'We heard that Rene is going to be Televisa's manager for El Paso, and if the concert is going to take place in El Paso, the way it's going to, we don't want to work with Rene.

Because this one single instance meets the commercial speech exception, the TCPA does not apply to the conspiracy count germane to the Televisa communication and promotion of the Exa concert. Conversely, the commercial speech exception does apply to any claim based on dealings with Telemundo, KTSM, Edwards Homes, or other unnamed media outlets to whom the communications may have been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Is There Clear and Specific Evidence of a Prima Facie Case?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Having found the TCPA applies to most of the conspiracy allegations, Appellees carry the burden to clearly and specifically demonstrate a prima facie case.

Rascon's affidavit offers six reasons to support the existence of the conspiracy claim: (1) the Southwest defendants' animosity towards him; (2) the $300,000 payment; (3) the sharing of confidential information protected by the earlier settlement agreement; (4) the alleged disparaging statements made to others; (5) the timing of when the invoices were changed; and (6) the fact that Appellees lost business. Although circumstantial evidence may be a properly considered in response to a TCPA motion,\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p586\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the circumstantial evidence here is far from clear and specific. Rascon's affidavit might establish a possible motive on the part of the Southwest defendants, but motive does not prove that anyone acted on it. Rascon presented some evidence that\n   Southwest paid Saturno or MVS a sum of money, but he presented no evidence for the money's purpose. MVS does not deny it has a business relationship with Southwestern, and it would hardly be surprising for a university to pay for advertising in local media.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rascon's claim that confidential information was shared is conclusory, and he does not explain how it proves the existence of the agreement alleged here. Even were we to accept that Rascon's affidavit substantiates that Appellants said unflattering things about Appellees, that hardly shows that the conduct was part of an agreed course of action with the Southwest defendants. Nor does Rascon develop with any specificity a time line of events that would allow a fact finder to draw an inference of the agreement he alleges. He does not explain how the mere fact of his lost business proves the conspiracy. We also note the logical implausibility of a scheme built around falsifying invoices for advertising that was never aired, when Appellees claim documentary proof of what was aired resides on tapes maintained by Appellants, and on documents provided to the FCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We conclude that the trial court should have granted the TCPA motion as it relates to the civil conspiracy claim (other than as to Televisa) and remand that claim for entry of an order dismissing that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    BREACH OF CONTRACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The breach of contract claim, after incorporating the general factual allegations, makes the following substantive allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Appellees entered into a contract with MVS for the placing of advertising for Appellees' clients; Appellees fully performed under the terms of the agreements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 MVS breached the contracts \"by failing to air the spots as ordered, by either failing to air the spots at any time or by airing the spots at a time when there was no listening audience.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 MVS breached the contracts \"by charging a fee for the spots that had not been aired or had aired at a time when there was no listening audience.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 MVS breached the contract \"by failing to apply payments and offsets to the invoices submitted to IAS and Next Level.\" MVS \"changed invoices to inflate the number of spots aired and change credits to the invoices and then demand payment\" on the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The amended Counterclaim alleges that because of these breaches, Appellees suffered economic damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We conclude that the TCPA does not apply to the breach of contract claim. The specific allegations do not turn on communications made between MVS and any other entity. Moreover, the commercial speech exemption would apply here because any statements were made in direct furtherance of MVS's business of selling advertising time (and services) to its own end customer. Appellants have failed to carry their burden that the TCPA applies to the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    FRAUD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Appellees' fraud allegation, after incorporating the general factual statement, asserts that Appellants \"made numerous material representations or omissions\" to Appellees to induce them into placing orders for advertising. The specific representations included: an accurate rate would be charged; the spots ordered would be aired; the spots would be aired to a listening audience; the invoices would reflect the accurate rate; the actual spots aired; and that documentation would be available to prove that spots were aired. Appellees further allege the representations were false and Appellant knew them to be false, or made them recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as positive assertions. Finally, Appellees allege reliance and damages from the representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Does the TCPA Apply?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For much the same reason as we explain with the breach of contract claim, the majority of the fraud allegations relate to direct dealings between Appellant and Appellees over Appellees' account and the terms of the advertising services that would be provided. Without any reference to the merits of that claim, Appellees have shown it to be covered by the commercial speech exception, and thus the TCPA would not apply. The sole exception is the statement in the fraud section of the Counterclaim that states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [Appellants] as part of the conspiracy to commit fraud then used the fraudulent invoices to damage the reputation of [Appellees] to third parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This sentence, to the extent that it attempts to state a separate claim, incorporates the conspiracy count that we have previously addressed. To that extent, this allegation in the fraud count should be struck on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    INTERFERENCE WITH BUSINESS RELATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The amended Counterclaim alleges that the Appellants and the Southwest defendants, by engaging in the conduct described in the general fact statement, \"disseminated, or caused to be disseminated, false statements in furtherance of their fraud and in doing so, engaged in conduct unlawfully interfering in the business relations\" of Appellees. According to the amended Counterclaim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \u2022 Appellants \"knew that there was a reasonable probability that [Appellees] would have entered into a business relationship with third parties\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 Appellants \"either acted with a conscious desire to prevent the relationship from occurring or knew the\n   interference was certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of their false statements ...\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \u2022 Appellants' conduct was independently tortuous or unlawful in that the statements were false and made in furtherance of their fraud and were based upon invoices changed in violation of Chapter 32 of the Texas Penal Code;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \u2022 The interference proximately caused injury to Appellees \"in that their business with potential clients decreased substantially, their relationships with third parties were terminated or substantially harmed\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \u2022 Appellees suffered actual injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Does the TCPA Apply?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We conclude that the business interference claim falls within the TCPA. An essential allegation in the claim is a communication by Appellants to third parties about the Appellees' fidelity in paying bills, which implicates the exercise of free speech. The amended Counterclaim also adds this one additional statement: \"Such conduct was done knowingly and intentionally with the intention that not only this Court, but that the public would rely upon such false representations.\" While not entirely clear, this allegation potentially reaches back to a claim made in the original counterclaim (as explained by discovery responses) that the filing of the Appellants' lawsuit to collect the debt was actionable because credit bureaus or others might be alerted to the public filing. Appellants' filing of the lawsuit, however, is additionally protected by the right to petition as defined by the TCPA.

There is no specific mention of any transaction between Appellees and KTSM and Telemundo. From the affidavit, we additionally cannot tell if Appellees ever did business with these entities, or if so, what the nature of that business was, what was proposed for the future, or the likelihood of future business. The closest Appellees come is the claim that a current customer, Edwards Homes, stopped doing business with Appellees when it was told that Rascon had failed to apply a payment towards Edwards Homes' account with MVS. Before that, Edwards Homes had transacted four to five thousand dollars of business per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Nonetheless, the affidavit lacks the sort of clear and specific details outlined by prior TCPA case law.

The claim that Edwards ceased doing business because of the alleged statement is also conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Thus, Rascon's affidavit fails to establish a prima facie case for an essential element of Appellees' claim and on remand, the trial court should dismiss the interference with business relationship claim consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    BUSINESS DISPARAGEMENT AND DEFAMATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Counterclaim asserts a claim for business disparagement, and in a separate section, a claim for defamation.

The business disparagement claim references the previously\n   described conduct and then contends Appellants \"disseminated, or caused to be disseminated, false statements\" and \"engaged in the disparagement of the economic interests\" of Appellees to third parties. The Counterclaim contends the statements were false, and Appellants acted knowingly and with malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Similarly, the defamation allegations contend that Appellants \"intentionally published or caused to be published statements of fact\" about Appellees to third parties.

The comments to the Restatement provide two examples of debt collection efforts, one that meets the standard and one that does not. Comment e suggests that the extreme and outrageous standard is met by a creditor who collectively does all these things: forwards threatening letters; reviles the debtor as a deadbeat, dishonest, and a criminal; repeatedly threatens lawsuits that are never filed; threatens garnishment of wages; threatens to have the debtor fired; and makes physical threats.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11541518\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/997/212/#p215\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. e, illus. 7.

In the context of this dispute, the agreement that the supplemental petition alleges is no more than conspiracy dressed up in breach of contract language. We have already concluded that Appellees failed to present any clear and specific evidence of the existence of that agreement. For the same reasons discussed under the conspiracy claim, we remand it to be dismissed, to the extent it seeks to assert a breach of contract claim against Appellants under the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We reverse and remand the case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the following claims: conspiracy, fraud (but only as noted in our discussion above), interference with business relations, business disparagement, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of settlement agreement, as those claims relate to MVS and Manuel Saturno. The Southwestern defendants did not file a TCPA motion and our holding here does not include the claims filed against them. Nor does our holding extend to any of the aforementioned claims against MVS and Manuel Saturno limited to the factual allegations pertaining to Televisa and the Axa concert.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Those new defendants included Quickstudy Learning Centers, Inc. d/b/a Southwest University, and its owners, Benjamin Arriola and Yolanda Arriola.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Appellants' brief contends this pleading asserts supplemental claims, leaving the original counterclaim in play. At best, Appellants claim it creates an ambiguity as to whether it is a true amended or supplemental pleading. Consequently, Appellants refer to factual allegations from the original Counterclaim. The title and body of the pleading, however, convinces us that as to the counterclaim and third party claims, the pleading is a true amendment, and we treat it as such.

Because the TCPA motion attacked causes of action that the trial court did not dismiss under the Rule 91a motion, the motion as to those issues was not moot.

For instance, one sentence reads \"Such conduct constitutes fraud as set forth more specifically below.\" That allegation does nothing more than presage a later allegation of fraud in the amended Counterclaim. Another allegation states that changing the invoices was a criminal act making the contract illegal. The trial court already disposed of any claim based on the alleged illegality, and whether the asserted illegality is a defense to the breach of contract claim-something we do not decide-that issue would be raised as a defense, and not included within a claim for affirmative relief. The same is true of the reference to the spoliation allegation contained in this portion of the pleading. A further assertion that the FCC could take away MVS's broadcasting license has no place in any portion of the pleadings; it appears to have been added for nothing more than its\n    <em>\n     ad terrorem\n    </em>\n    effect.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    We have already determined that the commercial speech exception applied to the other specific transaction involving the AXA concert that Televisa broadcast in Mexico, but not in El Paso.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Appellees did not plead a claim for interference with an existing contract, which has its own distinct elements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Prudential Ins.

The first invoice, dated July 13, 2015, appears to be the invoice upon which the original lawsuit was based. The invoice reflects a number of unpaid charges from February of 2014 to October 2014. For each charge, there is a unique transaction number, followed by a transaction date, a corresponding contract number, and the net amount due. The total unpaid charges show as $56,039.70. The second invoice is dated March 1, 2016, and appears to be a more comprehensive reconciliation of the account, showing not only the unpaid charges on the July invoice, but other charges that were incurred and paid. Comparing the two invoices at least raises an inference that when ten specific account charges were paid, they were re-booked as debits. For instance, the invoice sued upon reflects that on contract # 25001, a $1,290.20 charge was incurred on 7/31/2014 and was not paid. Appellees point out that under the same contract number, an identical amount ($1,290.20) was incurred on 01/26/2014 and was\n    <em>\n     paid\n    </em>\n    on 7/31/2014. A similar pattern is reflected in nine other account numbers, all showing that on 7/31/2014 each incurred a charge in the exact amount for which a payment was made on the same date. We do not discount that upon full discovery that there might be an appropriate explanation for why a series of payments on a single date are also reflected as corresponding debits. But even as it is, this oddity proves nothing more than a possible bookkeeper's error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
