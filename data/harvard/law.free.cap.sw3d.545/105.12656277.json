Daniel Hagood acted as co-counsel alongside Shaw &amp; Lemon in a construction defect case. The lawyers were ultimately successful in obtaining a substantial judgment for their clients. Everyone agrees that Hagood was entitled to twenty-five percent of the of the forty percent contingency fee for his role in the case, which equates to ten percent of the total recovery. The contingency fee issue became thorny, however, when both the judgment creditors and the judgment debtor went into bankruptcy. The case became more complicated still when our Appellant here, D. Brent Lemon, was hired as special counsel in the judgment debtor's bankruptcy case and recovered more than a million dollars for the bankrupt estate, much of which was used to pay part of the judgment that Hagood had helped to obtain. Lemon was paid substantial attorney's fees through the bankruptcy for doing so, but nothing was paid to Hagood. Upset with this state of affairs, Hagood\n   sued Lemon over the unpaid fee in state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following the first trial of this fee dispute case, Hagood prevailed but the judgment was reversed on appeal based on charge error.\n   <em>\n    Lemon v. Hagood\n   </em>\n   , 05-13-00132-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203700687\">\n    2014 WL 3700687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Tex.App.-Dallas July 24, 2014, no pet.) (mem.op.). Following the second trial, Hagood prevailed again. For the reasons stated below, we reverse and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This tale begins with husband and wife Gary Carpenter and Julie Perez (the Carpenters) who claimed that Holmes Builders, Inc. erred in the construction of their home. They hired attorney Van Shaw to represent them in 1999, and signed a fee contract giving Shaw a forty percent contingency in any recovery. At the time, Lemon was doing contract work for Shaw. By 2000, however, Shaw and Lemon entered into a partnership (Shaw &amp; Lemon) and the Carpenters were represented by the partnership. On several occasions Shaw &amp; Lemon had asked Appellee Daniel Hagood to assist with the trial of various cases, and the partnership did so in the Carpenter-Holmes Builders litigation. Hagood was to be paid twenty-five percent of the total forty percent contingency fee out of any recovery. Hagood never had a written agreement with the Carpenters. The general division of responsibilities dictated that Shaw and Hagood would handle the trial, and Lemon would tend to motion practice matters, some discovery, and post-trial collections or appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial, held in the Fall of 2001, went well for the Carpenters. The jury's answers supported a verdict in excess of $1.8 million. The trial court, however, granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict that resulted in a take nothing judgment and saddled the Carpenters with court costs. This turn of events contributed to the Carpenters filing for bankruptcy in February 2002. The Carpenter's claim against Holmes Builders, became an asset of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of the Carpenters' creditors. The bankruptcy trustee\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed an application to employ Shaw and the firm of Shaw &amp; Lemon as special counsel to pursue that claim. Shaw and the firm would do so on the same fee basis that the Carpenters had agreed to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lemon then pursued an appeal of the JNOV that had been entered in the Carpenter-Holmes Builders case. In March 2003, while that appeal was pending, Shaw and Lemon had a falling out. Lemon opened his own office and took the Carpenter file with him. As for the cases that Lemon took, he suggested that as each case \"is resolved or remuneration received (regardless of who has primary possession or responsibility) a distribution to the partners will be made per our agreement.\" The dissolution was less than friendly, leading to protracted litigation beginning in 2003 and which is described in our record as \"contentious\" and \"acrimonious.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Carpenters wrote both Shaw and Lemon in December 2003 expressing their desire not to be involved in the former partners' disputes, and urged both to work collaboratively on the Carpenters' behalf, but they desired that Lemon be their sole point of contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lemon was successful with the appeal. The Eastland Court of Appeals (on transfer from the Dallas Court of Appeals) reversed the JNOV and remanded the case for entry of judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. Holmes Builders, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-02-00132-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20306130\">\n    2004 WL 306130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.App.-Eastland Feb. 19, 2004, pet. denied). On February 11, 2005, the Texas Supreme Court denied Holmes Builders' Motion for Rehearing of its Petition for Review. Important here, on February 28, 2005, a motion was filed in the Carpenters' bankruptcy to sell the bankruptcy estate's interest in the Carpenter-Holmes Builder's case back to the Carpenters. The bankruptcy court approved that sale on March 22, 2005, and in exchange for $62,500, the Carpenters obtained the bankruptcy estates' interest in the litigation claim \"free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 6, 2005, the state trial court in the Carpenter-Holmes Builders case entered a judgment consistent with the court of appeals' mandate, thereby giving the Carpenters a judgment for $2,003,240 against Holmes Builders. Hagood received a copy of the trial court's new judgment in April 2005 and promptly wrote Lemon reminding him of his fee interest. Lemon did not respond to Hagood's letter, nor to two similar letters sent in July 2005 and August 2005. Lemon's unresponsiveness convinced Hagood that \"I was in for a war. I wasn't going to get my money easy.\" To that end, Hagood retained his own counsel and in April 2006 filed an intervention in the Carpenter-Holmes Builders state court litigation asserting his fee interest. He was promptly informed that Holmes Builders had itself filed for bankruptcy and any intervention seeking his fee interest in the state court case was a violation of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the Holmes Builders bankruptcy, the Carpenters and another couple complaining of a defective home, the Galases, were the largest creditors. The initial filings apparently showed few assets to pay those claims. The bankruptcy trustee, with court approval, then hired Lemon to pursue two different claims to infuse assets into estate. One claim related to the denial of coverage under a liability insurance policy in favor of Holmes Builders. The second group of \"alter ego\" claims sought to return money improperly transferred out of the company. Lemon was to be paid a thirty-four percent contingency for any sums he recovered, subject to review and approval by the bankruptcy court. As a part of the application to employ him, Lemon filed an affidavit stating \"[m]y representation of [the Carpenters] has been terminated and I have waived all claim for any recovery of attorney fees, for all past services, directly from [the Carpenters].\" He also swore that \"[n]either I, my firm, nor any member therefor, insofar as I have been able to ascertain has any current connection with the debtor, creditors, or any other party in interest ...\" Hagood added himself to the master service matrix to monitor the progress of the bankruptcy. By November 18, 2009, Lemon had secured a $500,000 settlement of the insurance policy claim for the bankruptcy estate. The trustee proposed an interim distribution of $252,539.70 to the Carpenters, and $157,648.66 to Lemon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hagood\n   objected to the Carpenters' proposed interim payment and raised his entitlement to a portion of the recovery. The bankruptcy judge allowed the interim payments, and in its order approving the Carpenter's payment, noted that $360,000 was available for payment to Hagood and the Galases, who had also filed an objection. Lemon was also able to secure an additional $684,474.24 for the bankruptcy estate through the alter ego claims. On August 6, 2010, the trustee filed a final report which proposed to distribute an additional $324,068.40 to the Carpenters, $40,733.48 to the Galases, and an additional fee award of $230,460.40 to Lemon. Hagood objected through his bankruptcy counsel as no funds were designated for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The bankruptcy judge took up the objection at a hearing on November 3, 2010. During the hearing, the judge raised concerns as to whether Hagood's objection was procedurally proper, suggesting an adversary proceeding was the appropriate procedure to raise this type of claim. The judge was also concerned with Hagood's standing and the timeliness of the claim. The judge inquired whether Hagood should file suit against Lemon in state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hearing was recessed, but prior to being reset, Hagood withdrew his objection. The bankruptcy judge agreed to the final distribution including the additional fee award to Lemon. In all, Lemon's total fee awards for collecting $1,184,474.24 for the bankruptcy estate was $388,109.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hagood then took his fee dispute to state court. In December 2010, he intervened in the on-going litigation between Lemon and Shaw. Lemon successfully moved to strike the intervention. Hagood then filed the suit from which this appeal arises on June 8, 2011. Hagood sued only Lemon; he did not sue Shaw nor the partnership of Shaw &amp; Lemon. Round one of this suit resulted in a judgment in Hagood's favor for $97,024.77 in breach of contract damages, and an additional $125,000.00 in attorney's fees. On appeal, the court held that the charge erroneously referred to Hagood's contract as a contingency in the fees \"\n   <em>\n    related to\n   </em>\n   the Firm's representation\" on the\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   case, and not twenty-five percent of the fees the firm received\n   <em>\n    under\n   </em>\n   the contingent-fee agreement with the Carpenters.\n   <em>\n    Lemon v. Hagood\n   </em>\n   , 05-13-00132-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203700687\">\n    2014 WL 3700687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Tex.App.-Dallas July 24, 2014, no pet.) (mem.op.). The court concluded that the error was harmful because it expanded the scope of Hagood's compensation under the agreement beyond that supported by the evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203700687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court then reviewed the legal sufficiency of the evidence \"under the charge that should have been given, that is, one that stated Hagood's compensation under his contract with the firm was twenty-five percent of the fees received by the firm under the contingent-fee agreement with the Carpenters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Finding the evidence was legally sufficient, the court rejected the contention that because the firm had never received any funds, Hagood was owed nothing. A reasonable jury could have determined that Lemon's affidavit filed in the bankruptcy court \"made impossible the performance of the condition precedent to Lemon's liability under Hagood's agreement-that the firm received\n   funds under the Carpenter agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. \"A reasonable juror could have determined that Lemon failed to cooperate by waiving the fee agreement with the Carpenters and that this failure to cooperate breached the agreement with Hagood.\" While there was some evidence that Lemon breached the agreement with Hagood, the case was reversed and remanded for a new trial because the charge was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On remand the case was tried much as before, but with two different twists. For the first time, Lemon claimed that he had no individual liability as a partner until a judgment was obtained against the partnership of Shaw &amp; Lemon. He raised this issue a few days after the Texas Supreme Court handed down\n   <em>\n    American Star Energy and Minerals Corporation v. Stowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n    457 S.W.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 2015) which contains language consistent with Lemon's claim. Because Hagood never sued the partnership, Lemon contended that he could have no individual liability. The second twist involved the sale order in the Carpenter bankruptcy (selling the claim back to the Carpenters, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances). Lemon argued this order extinguished Shaw &amp; Lemon's fee interest in the claim, and consequently Hagood's dependent interest as well. The trial court rejected a summary judgment and jurisdictional challenge built around these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At trial, the jury found that Shaw and Lemon were in a partnership when Hagood was asked to participate in the Carpenter litigation. The jury also found that Lemon failed to pay Hagood for his services in trying the Carpenter lawsuit. The jury further found that Hagood is excused from, and Lemon is quasi-estopped to complain about, any failure to first satisfy a judgment against the partnership. The jury awarded Hagood $97,204 in damages for Lemon's failure to pay him as agreed, and awarded $207,608.75 in attorney's fees. Hagood was also awarded conditional awards of appellate attorney's fees. Lemon brings nineteen issues for our review. We begin with those issues reflecting the new arguments raised in the second trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    NECESSITY OF OBTAINING A JUDGMENT AGAINST THE PARTNERSHIP\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the case was remanded for a new trial, Lemon claimed that Hagood was required to have first obtained a judgment against the partnership before he could directly sue Lemon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the first trial, precedent in the Dallas Court of Appeals held that there was no requirement to first sue and obtain a judgment against the partnership before pursuing an individual partner.\n   <em>\n    Reagan v.

(\"Reagan cites us to no cases, and we have found none, requiring that the partnership entity be sued separately to hold the individual partners liable. We conclude Reagan's challenges to the judgment against him on the basis of partnership are without merit.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following remand of this case, however, the Texas Supreme Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    American Star Energy and Minerals Corporation v. Stowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n    457 S.W.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 2015) which resolved\n   the issue of when limitations accrue against a partner for a partnership debt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n    at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In deciding that issue, the court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The statutory prerequisites to enforcement make a partner's liability not only derivative of the partnership's liability, but contingent on it for all practical purposes. If a partnership obligates itself to pay a sum or perform a service under a contract, the individual partners, though liable for the obligation under the [Texas Revised Partnership Act], cannot immediately be called on to pay or perform in lieu of the partnership. In either case, the claim must be litigated against the partnership so that its obligation is determined, reduced to damages, and fixed in a judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.BUS.ORGS.CODE \u00a7 152.306(b)(2)(A). Second, the plaintiff-creditor must have ninety days' opportunity to satisfy that judgment from the partnership's assets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 152.306(b)(2)(C).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n    at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Statutory Exceptions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    American Star\n   </em>\n   derives the obligation to obtain a judgment against the partnership from the Texas Revised Partnership Act, and we begin there.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Texas partnership is \"an entity distinct from its partners.\" TEX.BUS.ORGS.CODE ANN. \u00a7 152.056 (West 2012). It can therefore sue and be sued as an entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.R.CIV.P. 28. A creditor must obtain a judgment both against the partnership as an entity and the partner before the partner's individual assets may be executed upon, though this may be accomplished in the same lawsuit. This conclusion flows from Section 152.306 (a) and (b). Subsection (a) provides that a \"judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It makes clear that a \"judgment may be entered against a partner who has been served with process in a suit against the partnership.\" Subsection (b) then provides that a creditor may proceed against a partner or a partner's property only if a judgment \"is also obtained against a partner\" which \"remains unsatisfied for 90 days.\" Section 152.306(b) is, however, subject to several exceptions found in Subsection (c):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (c) Subsection (b) does not prohibit a creditor from proceeding directly against one or more partners or the property of the partners without first seeking satisfaction from partnership property if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) the partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) the creditor and the partnership agreed that the creditor is not required to comply with Subsection (b);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (3) a court orders otherwise, based on a finding that partnership property subject to execution in the state is clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment or that compliance with Subsection (b) is excessively burdensome; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (4) liability is imposed on the partner by law independently of the person's status as a partner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Hagood focuses on the third exception, and argues that the Shaw &amp; Lemon partnership was devoid of assets or that litigating against it would have been excessively burdensome. We disagree for two reasons. The first reason is procedural. Hagood raised this argument as one of\n   many responses to Lemon's motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the motion without elaborating its reasons. Consequently, the court never made a specific finding that partnership property was \"clearly insufficient\" to satisfy the judgment, or that suing the partnership would have been \"excessively burdensome.\" The exception requires such a finding from the trial court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879153\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 152.306(c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second reason is substantive. The exceptions found in Subsection (c) pertain to the ninety-day waiting period, and not the requirement for obtaining the judgment against the partnership. This conclusion follows from a construction of the statute. Statutory construction is a legal question that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re ReadyOne Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094903\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/394/680/#p684\">\n    394 S.W.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2012, orig. proceeding),\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.

The proviso thus addresses only one of the predicates-the passing of the ninety-day satisfaction period. The proviso in fact uses the same root word (\"seeking satisfaction\") as is found in subsection (b)(2)(C)(\"unsatisfied\" judgment against the partnership). The only construction that favors Hagood would assume the Legislature used the phrase \"without first seeking satisfaction from partnership property\" as a shorthand reference to both obtaining a judgment and the satisfaction period.

The term \"satisfaction\" when used in the context of satisfaction of a debt means \"[t]he fulfillment of an obligation; esp., the payment in full of a debt.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). It does not mean obtaining a judgment. And although the statement was dicta, the Texas Supreme Court\n   reached the same conclusion in\n   <em>\n    American Star.\n   </em>\n   The court's opinion describes the ninety-day period but notes that a creditor might \"forego this satisfaction period\" if one of the four Subsection (c) exceptions are met.\n   <em>\n    Am.

In question three, the jury found that Hagood was excused from attempting to satisfy a judgment against Shaw &amp; Lemon. The jury was instructed that it might find the requirement excused if: (a) Lemon waived the requirement, i.e. he intentionally surrendered a known right or engaged in intentional conduct inconsistent with claiming the right; or (b) Lemon made it impossible for Hagood to perform the condition. In question four, the jury found that Lemon was \"quasi-estopped\" to assert the requirement. \"Quasi-estoppel\" was defined as a \"rule to prevent a party from asserting, to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken by him.\" The jury was told this \"doctrine applies where it would be unconscionable to allow a party to maintain a position inconsistent with one in which he acquiesced, or of which he accepted a benefit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal, Lemon argues that neither waiver nor estoppel can create direct liability for a partner in the absence of a judgment against the partnership. In other words, as a matter of law, questions three and four were improper and cannot excuse the failure to first obtain and attempt to satisfy a judgment against the partnership. For this proposition, Lemon first cites\n   <em>\n    Hruska v. First State Bank of Deanville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9990196\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/747/783/#p784\">\n    747 S.W.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 784-85 (Tex. 1988) which holds that a misrepresentation by a homeowner could not create an equitable lien on homestead property, nor could it estop a homeowner from denying the validity of a lien which violates the Texas Constitution. Instead, a lien on a homestead can be created only in the manner set out in the Constitution. Lemon reasons that a partner's liability is similarly limited to that provided in the Texas Revised Partnership Act, and it is not subject to waiver or estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Along the same line, Lemon relies on cases such as\n   <em>\n    Ulico Cas.

Were we to construe the provision as mandatory and jurisdictional, a partner might raise a defect late into the litigation and well after the limitation period for pursuing the partnership has passed. If the statute is construed as mandatory, but not jurisdictional, a partner might still compel the addition of the partnership\n   to the litigation, but be subject to waiver or estoppel defenses based on that partner's conduct. Because one of the exceptions in 152.306(c) already includes the concept of waiver (an agreement by the partner that Section 152.306(b) does not apply), there is little violence to the underlying purpose of the statute if it be non-jurisdiction. Having considered all the factors, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend to make the requirement to obtain a judgment against the partnership jurisdictional.

Hagood's first amended petition was filed on May 11, 2015, and trial started on May 19, 2015. That pleading asserted several defenses to the\n   <em>\n    American Star\n   </em>\n   argument, including laches, waiver, and quasi-estoppel. The pleading was timely under TEX.R.CIV.P. 63. Lemon's argument, as we understand it, is that a pre-trial order entered before the first trial required all amended pleadings to be filed by March 2, 2012. No new scheduling order was issued after remand of the case following the first trial. Lemon apparently contends the first amended petition was tardy under that prior pre-trial order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   By the same token, the same order required all motions for summary judgment to be filed by June 29, 2012. Lemon filed several motions for summary judgment following remand, which the trial court heard over Hagood's objection. The trial court noted both parties' timeliness arguments, and stated that neither had filed a motion to strike, and overruled any timeliness objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A trial court has the discretion to enter a pre-trial order with pleading deadlines that prevail over those in our procedural rules.\n   <em>\n    ForScan Corp. v.

The flipside of that proposition is that a trial court has the discretion to change those deadlines.

As to waiver, many of the arguments below related to the fact that Lemon never asserted the requirement to obtain a judgment against the partnership until well after the first appeal. Hagood contends that\n   <em>\n    American Star\n   </em>\n   's holding grows out of the Texas Revised Partnership Act which has been the law for many decades. By waiting until the eve of the second trial of this case, Hagood contended that Lemon waived any reliance on Section 152.306. That argument ignores that\n   <em>\n    American Star\n   </em>\n   effectively overruled the holding in\n   <em>\n    Lyberger\n   </em>\n   which governed cases in the within the district of the Dallas Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    American Star\n   </em>\n   was not decided until after the first appeal of this case. Waiver was defined as the knowing and intentional surrender of a right. There was no evidence of such a\n   waiver here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Conversely, there was some evidence to support the jury's finding based on Lemon's opposition to Hagood's attempt to intervene into the earlier litigation between Shaw and Lemon. That intervention sought to assert separate tort claims against Lemon, but it also claimed an equitable interest in any partnership assets to the extent of Hagood's claim, based on a claimed breach of contract by the partnership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lemon filed an opposition to the pleading which succeeded in striking the intervention. Accordingly, we find some evidence of waiver based on that act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The jury's answer to question four also excused the failure to obtain a judgment against the partnership based on quasi-estoppel.

At times, Lemon denied or at least equivocated on the existence of his partnership with Shaw. During his litigation with Shaw, he claimed Shaw &amp; Lemon was a partnership. After the trial of the Shaw-Lemon suit, he testified in the first trial of this case that he did not believe Shaw &amp; Lemon was a partnership. During the second trial of this case, Lemon testified the he was in a partnership with Shaw. The jury thus heard testimony that Lemon had changed his position. By agreeing to, then denying, then again agreeing to the existence of the partnership, Lemon urged inconsistent positions that the jury might have believed was unconscionable.

He also focuses on the order in the Carpenter bankruptcy which sold the rights to the Holmes Builder claim to the Carpenters (the Sale Order). In varying ways, Lemon contends that the judgment here is an improper collateral attack on those orders, and that the bankruptcy courts had the exclusive jurisdiction\n   to decide those matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   While we reject Lemon's contention that the Fee Orders bar the claim here, we conclude otherwise as to the Sale Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Fee Orders\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Federal courts possess exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases, but state and federal courts share concurrent jurisdiction over \"all civil proceedings arising under [the Bankruptcy Code], or arising in or related to cases under [the Bankruptcy Code].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b) ;\n   <em>\n    Graber v.

He contends \"the primary basis of Hagood's claim originates\n   with his accusation of misconduct by Lemon in executing\" the affidavit attached to the trustee's application to employ him. Lemon then reasons that only the bankruptcy court could regulate that matter. We first conclude that Lemon misconstrues the basis of Hagood's claim. Hagood does not challenge the legality of the affidavit, nor claim that it was improper under bankruptcy court rules or procedures. Rather, Hagood's claim is that execution of the affidavit had an effect on a third party contract (the Hagood-Shaw &amp; Lemon contract) which was not before the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The earlier opinion of the Dallas Court of Appeals made the same point. In that appeal, Lemon argued that because neither the firm nor Lemon received any funds under the contingent fee agreement with the Carpenters, Hagood was not entitled to any money under Hagood's agreement with the firm.\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203700687\">\n    2014 WL 3700687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6. But there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that Lemon and the firm did not receive any funds under the Carpenter agreement because Lemon, had \"waived all claim for and recovery of attorney fees ... from Gary Carpenter and Julie Perez\" through the affidavit used to secure his position as special counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203700687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the point he filed the affidavit, the contingency agreement was potentially an asset of the partnership. And as even a former partner of Shaw &amp; Lemon, he had some responsibility to look after the partnership's assets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203700687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His act bound the partnership. TEX.BUS.ORGS.CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 152.301, 152.302. Consequently, there was some evidence in the first trial record that Lemon made impossible the performance of a condition precedent, and thus cannot defend based on that non-performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    II Deerfield Ltd.

The affidavit's significance was not to show a violation of some bankruptcy rule or procedure. Rather it was only a circumstance that determined the proof necessary to prosecute a claim based on a contract existing wholly outside the Holmes Builders bankruptcy proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Somewhat more troubling is the measure of damages presented to the jury. Hagood testified that he was entitled to the value of his services, which he quantified by reference to a twenty-five percent share of what Lemon was paid through the bankruptcy. Hagood's lawyer argued for the same measure of recovery to the jury. And that is exactly the figure the jury here used as damages for the breach of contract action. From this, Lemon contends that Hagood sought a split of the fee that bankruptcy court awarded Lemon which is improper under bankruptcy court rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(2016) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3938156\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/397/810/#p819\">\n    397 B.R. at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, Lemon has not urged as a distinct issue error in the admission of the evidence of his fee awards, nor urged a point based on the closing argument in the case. The jury's charge did not compel the jury to award any percentage of the fee awarded under the Fee Orders as the measure of damages. Instead, it asked the jury to find a sum that \"would fairly and reasonably compensate Daniel Hagood for his damages, if any, that resulted from D. Brent Lemon's failure to pay him as agreed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The reference to Lemon's fee award was a convenient proxy for the jury to determine the value of what could have been awarded had Lemon protected the partnerships fee interest.

When the Carpenters filed their own bankruptcy, their claim against Holmes Builders became property of the bankruptcy estate. \" Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that virtually all of a debtor's assets, including causes of action belonging to the debtor at the commencement of the bankruptcy case, vest in the bankruptcy estate upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Kane v.

That contingency interest is a necessary predicate for Hagood's recovery. Courts have described an attorney's contingency interest in a client's case in different ways.

However actually described, a bankruptcy court order which extinguishes all liens, claims, and encumbrances would on its face reach the attorney fee interest. A lien is defined as a \"legal right or interest that a creditor has in another's property.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). An attorney's\n   lien is defined as \"[t]he right of an attorney to hold or retain a client's money or property ... or to encumber money payable to the client (a\n   <em>\n    charging lien\n   </em>\n   ) until the attorney's fees have been properly determined and paid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20Fed.%20Appx.%20795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A \"claim\" can be defined as \"any right to payment or to an equitable remedy, even if contingent or provisional.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20Fed.%20Appx.%20795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   An \"encumbrance\" is defined as \"[a] claim or liability that is attached to property or some other right and may lessen its value, such as a lien or mortgage; any property right that is not an ownership interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20Fed.%20Appx.%20795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Shaw-Lemon contingency interest in the Carpenter's claim could fit any one of these definitions. And if that interpretation of the order is wrong, we conclude that only the bankruptcy court could clarify otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   If the Sales Order expressly invalidates the attorney's contingency interest, then Hagood must somehow invalidate the order.

Hagood's interest in the contingency fee was dependent on Shaw &amp; Lemon's fee. In his words, \"If we got nothing, I got nothing.\" When Shaw &amp; Lemon's fee interest was extinguished, so to was his potential recovery. To recover compensatory damages, a breach-of-contract plaintiff must establish that he suffered some pecuniary loss as a result of the breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    Prudential Sec., Inc. v.

Like the Dallas Court of Appeals earlier concluded with respect to Lemon's action in the Holmes Builder's bankruptcy, a contracting party has an implied duty to cooperate in every contract in which cooperation is necessary for performance of the contract.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203700687\">\n    2014 WL 3700687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Case Corp. v.

With sufficient evidence, a jury might have concluded that Lemon or Shaw would have breached that duty if they sat on their hands as the trustee moved for approval of a Sale Order that extinguished Hagood's interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   But we have no evidence regarding the backstory of the Sale Order. The record is barren of any detail other than the Sale Order itself. It is unknown who if anyone represented the Carpenters in that sale, or who negotiated the terms with the trustee. It is unclear if anyone objected. Shaw was counsel of record for the trustee for the purpose of pursuing the claim, and presumably he would have been alerted to the motion, but it is unclear if he objected, or if not, whether any objection would have been sustained. While a jury had some evidence to conclude that Lemon's action with respect to the Fee Orders made collection by the Shaw &amp; Lemon partnership impossible, there was no similar evidence with respect to the Sale Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The date of the Sale Order preceded the Holmes Builders bankruptcy, and renders any actions based on Lemon's conduct there irrelevant. We accordingly sustain Issues Two, Four, and Ten as they pertain to the Sale Order. We sustain Issue Nineteen to the extent it challenges the attorney's fee recovery incurred for prosecuting this case if there is no valid underlying breach of contract claim. In\n   sustaining these issues, we reverse and render judgment that Hagood take nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    REMAINING ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Lemon has raised several additional issues, some carried over from his first appeal. He contends in Issue Three that Disciplinary Rule 1.04 prevents any fee award as Hagood had no written contract with the Carpenters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

He claims in Issue Five that Hagood is barred by res judicata because he first asserted this very claim in the Holmes Bankruptcy which is now resolved by a final order. In Issue Six, he contends that Hagood's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Finally in Issue Eighteen he challenges the attorney's fee award for prosecuting this case based on late disclosed evidence. As did the Fifth Court of Appeals, we decline to rule on these issues in light of our holding on the Sales Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In reference to Lemon's\n   <em>\n    American Star\n   </em>\n   arguments, we overrule Issues Seven, Eight, Nine, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Seventeen.
