Thus, the court of criminal appeals vacated our previous opinion and remanded this case for further analysis in light of those two opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following the court of criminal appeals' mandate, we issue this new opinion today by re-analyzing the State's appeal challenging the trial court's granting of appellee Jose Ruiz's motion to suppress. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At approximately midnight on September 9, 2012, Gonzales, Texas police officer Bethany McBride responded to an automobile collision between a Lincoln and a Pontiac at the intersection of 90A and Robertson. The driver of the Pontiac remained at the scene and advised Officer McBride that the driver of the Lincoln-later identified as Ruiz-had fled the scene of the crash and had run behind a car wash in the area. Other witnesses at the scene relayed the same information to Officer McBride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon closer inspection of the Lincoln, Officer McBride observed several exploded Bud Light beer cans in the front seat and found insurance paperwork in Ruiz's name. Officer McBride also confirmed that the vehicle was registered to Ruiz. Once Officer McBride's backup officer\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   arrived at the scene, she advised the backup officer that Ruiz had fled behind the car wash on Apache Loop. Officer McBride also testified that at that point \"we had county officers and my backup officer try to locate [Ruiz].\" The officers eventually located Ruiz in \"the exact location\" that witnesses had described and carried him to a patrol unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer McBride testified that once Ruiz was located, \"it took several officers to get [Ruiz] from the field to carry him to the patrol unit.\" Officer McBride described Ruiz as \"unresponsive,\" that he \"couldn't open his eyes\" and \"wouldn't respond\" to the officers. She further recalled that Ruiz had a \"strong odor of alcoholic beverage\" emitting from his person and also had \"no apparent injuries\" to his body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Emergency medical service (EMS) personnel arrived at the scene and performed several sternum rubs on Ruiz but found him to be unresponsive. At that point, EMS transported Ruiz to the hospital, where he remained unconscious throughout the night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer McBride testified that after \"a period of time\" she traveled to the hospital in order to \"make sure that he was cleared medically and to have blood drawn.\" She eventually placed Ruiz under arrest and then gathered and filled out paperwork to order hospital personnel to perform a blood draw. Once the blood was drawn, Officer McBride took custody of the blood sample and \"put it in the icebox at the Gonzales Police Department to be sent to [the] lab.\" While already in custody, doctors at the hospital told Officer McBride that they wanted to keep Ruiz hospitalized overnight \"due to his condition.\" Officer McBride testified that she had no concern that he would flee from the hospital or destroy any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On cross-examination, when asked by Ruiz's attorney whether it would have been reasonable to obtain a warrant to draw Ruiz's blood that night, Officer McBride said no. When asked why, Officer McBride responded: \"that night two officers on, to take one off, no.\" Furthermore, she estimated that it would have taken \"probably about two or three hours\" to get a warrant that night. Additionally, Officer McBride stated that she based her decision to draw Ruiz's blood on section 724.012 of the transportation code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On re-direct, Officer McBride testified that her investigation of Ruiz's crash took \"longer\" than a general traffic stop. Furthermore, she testified that no procedures were in place at the time within the Gonzales Police Department to obtain search warrants for blood evidence. And lastly, Officer McBride stated that it would have been \"difficult\" to find a judge to sign a warrant that night, and if she would have found a judge, she would have had to drive to that judge's house to obtain the appropriate signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the hearing, the trial court granted Ruiz's motion to suppress and issued the following relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

Therefore, the burden shifted to the State to establish that the search was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9017599\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/158/488/#p492\">\n    158 S.W.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 492 (Tex. Crim.

TRANSP. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 724.011 ; 724.014 (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.), established Ruiz's consent to the blood draw to satisfy an exception to the warrant requirement; and in the alternative, exigent circumstances existed to justify the taking of Ruiz's blood. We will analyze each argument below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Implied Consent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Section 724.011(a) of the transportation code implies consent for an individual\n   who has been arrested for driving while intoxicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 724.011. This implied consent, however, may be revoked, absent certain exceptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 724.013 (\"Except as provided by Section 724.012(b), a specimen may not be taken if a person refuses to submit to the taking of a specimen designated by a peace officer.\"). Stated another way, if a drunk-driving suspect refuses to submit to the taking of a specimen, police are prohibited from doing so without a warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, if a drunk-driving suspect is \"dead, unconscious, or otherwise incapable of refusal,\" implied consent is considered \"not to have [been withdrawn] as provided by section 724.011.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 724.014(a). This implied-consent-law framework \"does not give officers the ability to forcibly obtain blood samples from anyone arrested for [driving while intoxicated],\" but instead \"gives officers the ability to present an affidavit to a magistrate in every DWI case, just like every other criminal offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beeman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313025\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/86/613/#p616\">\n    86 S.W.3d 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 616 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In this case, the State relies upon these implied-consent statutes to establish that Ruiz effectively consented to the warrantless blood draw, which is a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. We disagree with the State's position. The record is undisputed that Ruiz was unconscious and hospitalized during the course of Officer McBride's investigation on September 9, 2012. Regardless of this clear fact, the State appears to rely upon section 724.014(a) as a key to unlock the recognized consent exception to the warrant requirement. We do not read the implied consent statutes as expansively as the State advances on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   When the State seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a search, it must prove that the consent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given.\n   <em>\n    Bumper v.

Relevant to the case, the court of criminal appeals highlighted that the sheriff's deputy acknowledged that due to the day of the week of the accident, the substantial delay in obtaining Weems's blood \"was at least foreseeable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784893\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/574/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784893\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/574/\">\n    at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the totality of the circumstances found in the record do not warrant such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We begin by reemphasizing that exigency analyses are fact-intensive and require case-by-case determinations based on the totality of circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n    490 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   923 (citing\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n    569 U.S. at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The record in this case is not as robust as those in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weems\n   </em>\n   . Both\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weems\n   </em>\n   were post-trial direct appeals, in which a seemingly more complete record was developed for review. The present case is before us on a pre-trial State's appeal, with a factual record consisting of one twenty-four-page hearing transcript containing only arguments by counsel and testimony from one witness, Officer McBride. With that in mind, we turn to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The record undisputedly shows that Ruiz was involved in a car crash, fled the scene, and ended up unconscious in a nearby field. Ruiz remained unconscious for the remainder of the night. Further, Ruiz's level of unconsciousness was so severe that he had to be carried by \"several officers\" from the field where he was found to one of the officer's patrol units. EMS personnel unsuccessfully attempted several times to wake him by performing sternum rubs. Moreover, once at the hospital, physicians wanted to keep Ruiz hospitalized overnight \"due to his condition.\" Officer McBride testified that she had no concern that Ruiz would flee from custody that night and \"didn't think [Ruiz] was going anywhere.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Next, the record shows that no procedures were in place for Gonzales police to obtain search warrants for blood from drunk-driving suspects at the time of this accident. Despite the lack of procedures in place, Officer McBride agreed that it would \"have been difficult to find a judge\" to sign a warrant at that time of day on an early Sunday morning, but even if she had found a judge, she would have had to drive the warrant to the judge's house. According to Officer McBride, she estimated that it would have taken \"two or three hours\" to obtain a warrant that night. Officer McBride further testified that it would have been unreasonable that night to obtain a warrant-even if it took two hours to complete-because \"Being that, that night two officers on, to take one off, no.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without further elaboration from Officer McBride, however, this testimony seems to suggest that Officer McBride did not want to remove an officer, including herself, away from regular police duties in order to prepare a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   These facts draw some similarities and differences to the facts involved in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   , fourteen officers were on duty who were performing \"important law enforcement or public-safety duties\" related to the serious and explosive automobile accident involving a death in a busy city street intersection.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n    490 S.W.3d at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The lead accident investigator in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   testified that taking any one of the fourteen officers away \"would have left a necessary duty unfulfilled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the lead investigator testified that even if they would have applied for a warrant, it would have taken \"an hour to an hour and a half\" to obtain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The timing of applying for the warrant concerned the lead investigator in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   because he was reasonably concerned that \"the administration of pain medication, specifically narcotics, would affect the blood sample's integrity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Turning back to the record of this case, Officer McBride testified in a conclusory manner that taking one officer off regular duty to apply for a warrant would have been unreasonable. We conclude that this testimony, without more, is insufficient to support a finding of exigency because it is readily distinguishable from the facts in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   record showed that every available officer was fulfilling a necessary duty related to a serious car crash that caused a fire, explosions, and a death. Additionally, the crash scene in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   was an active scene from approximately 10:30 p.m. until 6 a.m. the following morning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n    at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the record here shows that the available officers on duty that night in Gonzales were fulfilling the type of law enforcement or public safety duties of the tremendous magnitude that existed in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   nor was there any articulated concern that Ruiz's blood sample would be affected as a result of the two to three-hour window it would have taken the officer to apply for and obtain a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We emphasize that our analysis today on officer availability does not foreclose the possibility in future cases of finding exigent circumstances in some other situations when an available police officer might be fulfilling a law enforcement or public safety duty that does not rise to the level exhibited in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   . However, based on the totality of circumstances in this case, we conclude that the State failed to establish exigency. Furthermore, we weigh these facts against a finding of exigency by focusing our analysis on whether officers had a reasonable belief that obtaining a warrant was impractical based on the circumstances and information known at the time of the search rather than through the distorted lenses of hindsight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n    490 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   925 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weems\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784893\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/574/\">\n    493 S.W.3d at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Another officers' presence or the 'hypothetically available officer' that, in theory, could have secured a warrant in the arresting officer's stead will certainly not render all warrantless blood draws a Fourth Amendment violation, nor do we suggest it is a circumstance that the State must disprove in every case to justify a warrantless search under an exigency theory.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Next, the record shows that Officer McBride was without any procedures in place to guide her in obtaining a search warrant in this type of case. Additionally, the trial court found Officer McBride's testimony credible that she believed that it would have been \"difficult\" to find a judge at that time of night. These facts viewed in isolation certainly lend themselves to finding exigency. However, the trial court also found that Officer McBride erroneously relied upon the implied consent statutes of the transportation code in ordering the hospital staff to draw Ruiz's blood. Stated another way, the trial court could have reasonably found that despite finding Officer McBride's testimony credible regarding\n   the reduced likelihood of finding a judge at that hour and the lack of procedural guidelines in place at the time, Officer McBride erroneously believed that she did not need to apply for a warrant based upon the implied consent statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Lastly, as noted above, Officer McBride testified that she had no concern about Ruiz destroying any evidence in her investigation other than the alcohol metabolizing in his blood. In\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   , however, the court of criminal appeals found exigent circumstances after pointing out that officers were concerned about the timing of obtaining Cole's blood quickly to the administration of pain medication affecting Cole's blood sample's integrity, as well as not knowing the elimination rate of methamphetamine in the blood.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797967\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/918/\">\n    490 S.W.3d at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the State was dealing with an alcohol-related offense rather than one involving methamphetamines. As the\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   Court stated, blood alcohol content evidence is \"lost gradually and relatively predictably\" which permits experts to work backwards from the blood alcohol content at the time the sample was taken to determine the blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n    569 U.S. at 155-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that longer intervals may raise questions about the accuracy of the blood alcohol content calculation, which may create exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless blood sample).

We treat all references to chapter 724 of the penal code rather than the transportation code in this record as inadvertent errors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Similar to our note in footnote 3, it appears that the trial court inadvertently referred to sections 724.012 and 724.014 of the penal code in its findings rather than sections 724.012 and 724.014 of the transportation code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    We do not hold that sections 724.011(a) and 724.014(a) of the transportation code are unconstitutional. Instead, we hold that these provisions do not create per se exceptions to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Officer McBride also testified that unidentified \"county officers\" assisted in locating Ruiz at the scene of the crash.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    On February 23, 2017, Ruiz's original appellate attorney, the Honorable Mark Symms, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel in this case. This Court then abated this proceeding and remanded the matter to the trial court for its consideration and possible action of appointing new counsel. On March 1, 2017, the trial court appointed the Honorable Chris Illes to serve as Ruiz's new appellate attorney. To the extent that the Honorable Mark Symms's motion remains pending in this Court, it is hereby granted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
