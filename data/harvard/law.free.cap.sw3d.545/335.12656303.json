This Court need not reach the question posed by Ms. Hink of whether the statute restricts the definition of \"legally qualified health care provider\" in a way that disqualifies experts who would otherwise be able to make a submissible case at trial from supplying the opinion supporting an affidavit. Not only is such a serious constitutional problem unlikely to arise in light of this Court's broad interpretation of what constitutes \"substantially the same\n   specialty\" in\n   <em>\n    Spradling v.

Ms. Hink's case was dismissed because she failed to file any affidavit, not because she offered multiple affidavits or because the judge believed the medical opinions were not offered by persons in substantially the same specialty as experts who would have offered sufficient evidence as to breach of the standard of care, causation, and damages to make a submissible case at trial.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 7, 2013, Dr. Loring Helfrich performed a scheduled surgery to remove Marilyn Hink's gall bladder. Ms. Hink's right hepatic duct was allegedly injured during the procedure, causing bile to leak into the surgical field. Over the next several months, Ms. Hink required additional medical attention and a second surgery to repair the injured duct. On May 5, 2015, just less than two years after her surgery, Ms. Hink filed a petition in the Scott County circuit court alleging (1) Dr. Helfrich was negligent in injuring her hepatic duct during the May 7 surgery and (2) the affidavit requirement of House Bill 393, contained in section 538.225, unconstitutionally barred her access to the courts to pursue her malpractice claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a medical malpractice action, section 538.225 requires the plaintiff or plaintiff's attorney to file an affidavit, often called an \"affidavit of merit,\" stating \"that he or she has obtained the written opinion of a legally qualified health care provider\" that the defendant breached the applicable standard of care and this failure directly caused or contributed to cause plaintiff's damages. The affidavit must be filed within 90 days of filing a petition unless the circuit court grants an extension.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324412\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/313/683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Hink's first petition was dismissed without prejudice on September 24, 2015.

On September 21, 2016, Ms. Hink refiled her petition. She sought, and was granted, a 90-day extension to file her affidavit, as permitted by section 538.225. This made the affidavit due no later than March 20, 2017. When Ms. Hink failed to file an affidavit by that date, Dr. Helfrich filed a motion to dismiss for failure to timely file an affidavit of merit. Ms. Hink conceded she failed to file the required affidavit but asked the court to overrule the motion to dismiss on the ground that section 538.225, as revised in 2005, violates a plaintiff's right to jury trial, Missouri's open courts provision, and separation of powers. The circuit court again dismissed the petition without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although a dismissal without prejudice generally is not appealable because it is not an adjudication on the merits, when an action cannot be refiled or when the litigant chooses to stand on the \"right under the state and federal constitutions to maintain the action unencumbered by [the section 538.225 affidavit] requirement,\" then the dismissal may be appealed because \"the dismissal without prejudice sanction for failure to file the health care\n   provider affidavit is a dismissal of the action, and not merely the petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Mahoney,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9996359\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/807/503/\">\n     807 S.W.2d at 506\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Ms. Hink properly filed her appeal in this Court because she attacks the validity of a Missouri statute.\n   <em>\n    Mo.

The statute was amended in 2005 to provide the court \"shall\" dismiss the action if an affidavit is not filed. The 2005 amendment also added, for the first time, language defining a \"legally qualified health care provider\" as one licensed \"in the same profession as the defendant and either actively practicing or within five years of retirement from actively practicing substantially the same specialty as the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 538.225.2, RSMo 2005\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Hink's sole point relied on states as follows: \"The trial court erred in sustaining Dr. Helfrich's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to File Healthcare Affidavit pursuant to RSMo. \u00a7 538.225 because RSMo. \u00a7 538.225 is unconstitutional in that there are circumstances where it is impossible for the plaintiff to comply with the requirements of RSMo. \u00a7 538.225.\" As the separate opinion notes, Ms. Hink's point is an abstract statement of law and is too general and vague, as is her argument regarding the alleged violation of the right to jury trial and separation of powers.

Rather, this Court held dismissing a claim for lack of compliance with section 538.225\"is a determination that under the substantive law of medical malpractice the petition cannot succeed, and so is frivolous.

Rather, in oral argument, and implicit in the argument section of her brief, is her suggestion\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   can be distinguished because, at the time it was decided, section 538.225 simply said a judge \"may\" dismiss a case for the failure to file an affidavit of merit, whereas now, as a result of a 2005 amendment, section 538.225 provides the judge \"shall\" dismiss the case if plaintiff fails to file an affidavit of merit.\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   did not base its ruling on the statute's use of the word \"may,\" however, and this Court does not agree the change from \"may\" to \"shall\" affects the open courts and jury trial rights. While previously a judge did not have to dismiss the suit when an affidavit was not provided, the trial judge in\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   did dismiss the suit precisely for that failure. The analysis in\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   , therefore, focused on whether dismissal for failure to file an affidavit constitutes denial of the right to jury trial or violates the open courts provision or separation of powers principles, just as is alleged here. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   's analysis is directly applicable without regard to the change from \"may\" to \"shall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Hink argues another change in the statute adopted in 2005 raises an issue not addressed in\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   and dispositive here. In addition to changing \"may\" to \"shall,\" the 2005 amendment to section 538.225 for the first time defined \"legally qualified healthcare providers\" to include only those who practice in \"substantially the same specialty\" as the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ms. Hink argues this new limitation on who can provide the requisite opinion supporting an affidavit of merit imposes a stricter burden on the plaintiff than is required to prove a prima facie case of negligence at trial. At trial, a medical malpractice plaintiff bringing a claim of negligence can make a prima facie case through expert testimony from any qualified expert, regardless of whether the expert practices in substantially the same specialty as the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See Klotz v. St. Anthony's Med. Ctr.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325994\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/752/#p761\">\n     311 S.W.3d 752\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 761 (Mo. banc 2010)\n   </em>\n   (rejecting the notion that proving standard of care \"requires that expert testimony at trial be limited to persons in the defendant's specialty\"). This means a plaintiff might be out of court because he or she is unable to provide an affidavit of merit from a physician in substantially the same specialty even though the plaintiff could make a submissible case if the affidavit requirement did not exist. But this argument fails to recognize this Court has held a \"health care provider may have a different board certification but may practice 'substantially the same specialty' because of an expertise in the medical procedure at issue. Many medical procedures are not peculiar to one board certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Spradling,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324412\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/313/683/\">\n     313 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    689\n   </em>\n   . In most cases, therefore, this Court's interpretation of \"substantially\" the same specialty, which includes persons qualified by expertise rather than board certification, means the same experts would qualify under either standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Hink posits there nonetheless may be some instances in which an expert could not arguably be considered even \"substantially\" in the same specialty yet would be considered a qualified trial expert. She suggests this may be the case, for instance, in the case of the family doctor, who may not be considered a specialist of any sort, or in the case of a failure by such a doctor to diagnose cancer, in which case an oncologist might need to be called, and the latter would be in a different specialty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As just noted, under\n   <em>\n    Spradling,\n   </em>\n   when the expert has gained the requisite expertise through experience, then it would not matter that he or she practiced in different fields. Ms. Hink suggests there may nonetheless be exceptions, particularly in cases that are so complex the plaintiff may need to rely on unique or multiple experts in different fields at trial, including fields not related to that of the defendant's practice, to show damages or to support a complex theory of causation. Some of those experts would likely be in different specialties from the defendant. Even worse, Ms. Hink argues, compliance with the statute may prohibit her from relying on multiple experts at all, for she reads its use of the phrase \"legally qualified health care provider\" to mean a plaintiff must rely on a single health care provider to support standard of care, causation, and damages of all types and all theories. This, she says, is an arbitrary additional requirement and, in a complex case, may require dismissal of an otherwise meritorious case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   These indeed are issues different than those rejected in\n   <em>\n    Mahoney.\n   </em>\n   There, the Court found the affidavit requirement constitutional because it simply required plaintiffs to show what the substantive law already requires-there exists \"a qualified witness [who will attest] that the defendant deviated from an accepted standard of care.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9996359\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/807/503/\">\n     807 S.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    510\n   </em>\n   . This did not violate the right to jury trial or open courts or the separation of powers because, \"Without such testimony, the case can neither be submitted to the jury nor be allowed to proceed by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   did not suggest the legislature could add a requirement that would preclude an otherwise meritorious, submissible case from going to trial because of the inability to find an expert to testify to a matter not required to be shown to submit a cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, however, Ms. Hink has failed to show section 538.225 imposes such requirements. Nothing in section 538.225 provides the affidavit may rely on only a single expert opinion on all issues. Section 538.225 simply provides a plaintiff \"shall file an affidavit with the court stating that he or she has obtained the written opinion of a legally qualified health care provider\" as to the defendant's breach of the standard of care and causation. While the statute uses the term \"a legally qualified health care provider,\" Missouri law expressly provides the singular includes the plural unless otherwise stated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any requirement in this case that the entire breach of standard of care and causation be proven by a single expert appears to have been self-imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, nothing in section 538.225 provides every single element of damage claimed must be supported in the opinion that forms the basis of the affidavit, as Ms.Hink\n   suggests she was unable to accomplish. Neither does\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   support such a reading of the statute. To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   says the purpose of the affidavit requirement is to allow the early dismissal of frivolous claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9996359\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/807/503/\">\n     807 S.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    507\n   </em>\n   . That purpose necessarily is served if the plaintiff files an affidavit stating he or she has the opinion of a qualified health care provider that the defendant failed to meet the standard of care, caused the injury, and damages resulted. Whether every theory or every claimed item of damage later is found to be submissible need not be determined in deciding whether the action itself is frivolous, and that is what the affidavit requirement addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, and most importantly, even were Ms. Hink's unduly labored reading of the statute a correct one, the record simply does not show her case was dismissed because her affidavit showed she could not obtain an opinion from a physician in the right specialty, or because the affidavit showed she obtained only a single expert opinion addressing some but not all her claims of liability or damages. Rather, the record reveals she failed to file any affidavit at all. While Ms. Hink says this was because she feared her affidavit would be rejected if filed, this Court can act only based on the record before it, not based on hypothetical facts not supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Rule 84.04(d)(1) requires an appellant's brief to contain a \"Point Relied On\" identifying a claim of reversible error, concisely stating the legal reasons for the claim, and summarily explaining why the stated legal reasons support the claim of reversible error. The principal opinion acknowledges Ms. Hink's point relied on violates Rule 84.04 because it is an abstract statement of law that fails to explain a claim of reversible error. The principal opinion further acknowledges Ms. Hink's brief fails to set forth any discernible argument that the \u00a7 538.225 affidavit requirement violates the right to trial by\n   jury and separation of powers. Because Ms. Hink's improper briefing preserves nothing for appellate review, her allegations of error \"shall not be considered in any civil appeal.\" Rule 84.13(a). Despite the clear mandate of Rule 84.13(a), the principal opinion reviews Ms. Hink's unpreserved constitutional claims in several pages of unnecessary dicta based on admittedly deficient briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, for decades, and for prudential reasons, this Court has held fast to the principle that \"[a] court will avoid the decision of a constitutional question if the case can be fully determined without reaching it.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Instead of stating facts showing \u00a7 538.225 violates the right to trial by jury and the separation of powers, Ms. Hink summarily referred to \"the same reasons discussed above\" in her open courts argument. Ms. Hink's reference to the facts regarding her open courts claim necessarily failed to state the facts showing a violation of the distinct constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to trial by jury and establishing separation of powers.
