We unanimously reaffirm the legal principles and rules announced in that opinion, but we disagree on the procedural effect of those principles in this case. Because a majority of the Court agrees to reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial, our disposition remains the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In our first opinion, we sought to fulfill our duty to eliminate confusion regarding the Court's previous decisions addressing insureds' claims against their insurance companies. As presented in this case, the primary issue is whether the insured can recover policy benefits based on the insurer's violation of the Texas Insurance Code even though the jury failed to find that the insurer failed to comply with its obligations under the policy. We sought to clarify the Court's previous decisions by announcing five rules addressing the relationship between contract claims under an insurance policy and tort claims under the Insurance Code. We unanimously reaffirm those rules today and provide additional guidance in response to the parties' arguments on rehearing. We also concluded in our first opinion that the trial court erred in this case by disregarding the jury's answer to Question 1, in which the jury failed to find that the insurer failed to comply with its obligations under the policy. We unanimously reaffirm that holding as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In light of the parties' understandable confusion regarding the Court's previous decisions, we decided in our first opinion to remand the case for a new trial in the interest of justice without addressing the procedural effect of our holdings in this case. We address those issues today, but we reach three different conclusions. JUSTICE GREEN , JUSTICE GUZMAN , and JUSTICE BROWN conclude that the jury's answer to Question 1 is dispositive as to the plaintiff's\n   ability to recover damages for the Insurance Code violation the jury found in answer to Question 2, so they would render judgment for the insurer.\n   <em>\n    See post\n   </em>\n   at --- ( GREEN , J., dissenting). THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE LEHRMANN , JUSTICE BOYD , and JUSTICE DEVINE conclude that the jury's answer to Question 1 creates a fatal conflict with its answers to Questions 2 and 3. THE CHIEF JUSTICE concludes that we must remand the case for a new trial because we cannot resolve that conflict on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See post\n   </em>\n   at 522 ( HECHT , C.J., concurring). JUSTICE LEHRMANN , JUSTICE BOYD , and JUSTICE DEVINE conclude that, because the conflicting answers do not present a fundamental error, the insurer waived the conflict by failing to raise it before the trial court discharged the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 295. Nevertheless, because the parties lacked the benefit of the clarity we provide today, they conclude that we should remand the case for a new trial in the interest of justice. JUSTICE BLACKLOCK agrees with that disposition, although he does not join any opinion. With five votes ( JUSTICE JOHNSON not participating), the Court remands the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Hurricane Ike struck Galveston Island in September 2008, Gail Menchaca contacted her homeowner's insurance company, USAA Texas Lloyds, and reported that the storm had damaged her home. The adjuster USAA sent to investigate Menchaca's claim found only minimal damage. Based on the adjuster's findings, USAA determined that its policy covered some of the damage but declined to pay Menchaca any benefits because the total estimated repair costs did not exceed the policy's deductible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   About five months later, at Menchaca's request, USAA sent another adjuster to re-inspect the property. This adjuster generally confirmed the first adjuster's findings, and USAA again refused to pay any policy benefits. Menchaca sued USAA for breach of the insurance policy and for unfair settlement practices in violation of the Texas Insurance Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As damages for both claims, she sought only insurance benefits under the policy, plus court costs and attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties tried the case to a jury. Question 1 of the jury charge, which addressed Menchaca's breach-of-contract claim, asked whether USAA failed \"to comply with the terms of the insurance policy with respect to the claim for damages filed by Gail Menchaca resulting from Hurricane Ike.\" The jury answered \"No.\" Question 2, which addressed Menchaca's\n   statutory claims, asked whether USAA engaged in various unfair or deceptive practices, including whether USAA refused \"to pay a claim without conducting a reasonable investigation with respect to\" that claim. As to that specific practice, the jury answered \"Yes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Question 3 asked the jury to determine the amount of Menchaca's damages that resulted from either USAA's failure to comply with the policy or its statutory violations, calculated as \"the difference, if any, between the amount USAA should have paid Gail Menchaca for her Hurricane Ike damages and the amount that was actually paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury answered \"$11,350.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both parties moved for judgment in their favor based on the jury's verdict. USAA argued that because the jury failed to find in answer to Question 1 that USAA failed to comply with the policy, Menchaca could not recover for \"bad faith or extra-contractual liability as a matter of law.\" Menchaca argued that the court should enter judgment in her favor based on the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3, neither of which required a \"Yes\" answer to Question 1. The trial court disregarded Question 1 and entered final judgment in Menchaca's favor based on the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3. The court of appeals affirmed,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203804602\">\n    2014 WL 3804602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we granted USAA's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Recovering Policy Benefits for Statutory Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties agree that the damages the jury found in response to Question 3 represent the amount of insurance policy benefits the jury concluded USAA \"should have paid\" to Menchaca. USAA contends that Menchaca cannot recover any amount of policy benefits because the jury failed to find that USAA breached its obligations under the policy. Although the jury did find that USAA violated the Insurance Code, USAA contends that Menchaca cannot recover policy benefits based on that\n   finding alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   USAA primarily relies on\n   <em>\n    Provident American Insurance Co. v. Casta\u00f1eda\n   </em>\n   , in which we stated that an insurance company's \"failure to properly investigate a claim is not a basis for obtaining policy benefits.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586162\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/189/#p198\">\n    988 S.W.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198 (Tex. 1998). Menchaca argues that the jury's findings that USAA violated the Code and that the violation resulted in Menchaca's loss of policy benefits USAA \"should have paid\" sufficiently support the award of policy benefits. Menchaca primarily relies on\n   <em>\n    Vail v. Texas Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , in which we stated that an insurer's \"unfair refusal to pay the insured's claim causes damages as a matter of law in at least the amount of the policy benefits wrongfully withheld.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9964894\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/754/129/#p136\">\n    754 S.W.2d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136 (Tex. 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Courts and commentators have expressed confusion over our decisions in this area, and over our statements in\n   <em>\n    Casta\u00f1eda\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   in particular.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit, for example, concluded that\n   <em>\n    Casta\u00f1eda\n   </em>\n   and other \"decisions from the Supreme Court of Texas and Texas's intermediate appellate courts arguably cast doubt on\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   's continued vitality.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    In re Deepwater Horizon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362911\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/689/#p698\">\n    807 F.3d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 698 (5th Cir. 2015).

An insurance policy, however, is a unique type of contract because an insurer generally \"has exclusive control over the evaluation, processing[,] and denial of claims,\" and it can easily use that control to take advantage of its insured.\n   <em>\n    Arnold v.

Because of this inherent \"unequal bargaining power,\" we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   that the \"special relationship\" between an insurer and insured justifies the imposition of a common-law duty on insurers to \"deal fairly and in good faith with their insureds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9964273\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/725/165/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Similar to that common-law duty, the Insurance Code supplements the parties' contractual rights and obligations by imposing procedural requirements that govern the manner in which insurers review and resolve an insured's claim for policy benefits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TEX.

Generally, the answer to this question is \"no,\" but the issue is complicated and involves several related questions. In an effort to clarify these issues, we distill from our decisions five distinct but interrelated rules that govern the relationship between contractual and extra-contractual claims in the insurance context. First, as a general rule, an insured cannot recover policy benefits as damages for an insurer's statutory violation if the policy does not provide the insured a right to receive those benefits. Second, an insured who establishes a right to receive benefits under the insurance policy can recover those benefits as actual damages under the Insurance Code if the insurer's statutory violation causes the loss of the benefits. Third, even if the insured cannot establish a present contractual right to policy benefits, the insured can recover benefits as actual damages under the Insurance Code if the insurer's statutory violation caused the insured to lose that contractual right. Fourth, if an insurer's statutory violation causes an injury independent of the loss of policy benefits, the insured may recover damages for that injury even if the policy does not grant the insured a right to benefits. And fifth, an insured cannot recover\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   damages based on an insurer's statutory violation if the insured had no right to receive benefits under the policy and sustained no injury independent of a right to benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In\n   <em>\n    Progressive County Mutual Insurance Co. v.

In our early decisions, we mentioned this type of statutory violation but did not specifically address whether the general rule applies to such a claim.

If the policy does not cover the insured's loss, the insurer does not breach the policy by failing to pay benefits for that loss because the insured is not entitled to those benefits. Conversely, if the policy does cover the loss,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   the insurer necessarily breaches the policy if it fails to pay benefits for the loss because the insured is entitled to those benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In a more specific sense, however, an important distinction does exist, at least to the extent the term \"breach\" is used to refer specifically to a breach-of-contract claim. Here, for example, USAA contends that, even if its policy covered Menchaca's loss, Menchaca could not recover policy benefits unless she prevailed on her breach-of-contract claim under Question 1. According to USAA, in other words, an insured can only recover policy benefits as damages on a breach-of-contract claim and can never recover policy benefits as damages on a statutory-violation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We disagree. Although our prior decisions refer interchangeably to both \"breach\" and \"coverage,\" our focus in those cases was on whether the insured was entitled to benefits under the policy, because an insurer's statutory violation cannot \"cause\" the insured to suffer the loss of benefits unless the insured was entitled to those benefits. But if the insured was entitled to the benefits and the insurer's statutory violation caused the insured to lose those benefits, the statute authorizes the insured to recover those benefits as \"actual damages ... caused by\" the statutory violation, even if the insured does not submit a separate breach-of-contract claim. TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 541.151. Thus, although we have referred to both \"breach\" and \"coverage,\" what matters for purposes of causation under the statute is whether the insured was entitled to receive benefits under the policy. While an insured cannot recover policy benefits for a statutory violation unless the jury finds that the insured had a right to the benefits under the policy, the insured does not\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   have to prevail on a separate breach-of-contract claim based on the insurer's failure to pay those benefits. As we explain further in the following sections, if the jury finds that the policy entitles the insured to receive the benefits and that the insurer's statutory violation resulted in the insured not receiving those benefits, the insured can recover the benefits as \"actual damages ... caused by\" the statutory violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10006665\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/903/338/#p341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nevertheless, an insurer's obligation to pay policy benefits and the insured's right to receive them derive solely from the insurance policy's terms: \"If the loss is\n   covered, then the insurer is obligated to pay the claim according to the terms of the insurance contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Moriel\n   </em>\n   , 879 S.W.2d at 17. Because an insurer's statutory violation permits an insured to receive only those \"actual damages\" that are \"caused by\" the violation, we clarify and affirm the general rule that an insured cannot recover policy benefits as actual damages for an insurer's statutory violation if the insured has no right to those benefits under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Entitled-to-Benefits Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The second rule from our precedent is that an insured who establishes a right to receive benefits under an insurance policy can recover those benefits as \"actual damages\" under the statute if the insurer's statutory violation causes the loss of the benefits. This rule, a logical corollary to the general rule, is what we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   . The insureds in\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   sued their insurer for common-law bad faith and statutory violations (but not for breach of contract), alleging a \"bad faith failure to pay the claim\" and seeking \"the full amount\" of policy benefits plus statutory damages.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9964894\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/754/129/#p136\">\n    754 S.W.2d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For this question, the Committee recommends that an insured who seeks to recover policy benefits for a statutory violation should expressly submit \"policy benefits\" as an element of damages, unless \"both the amount and causation of policy benefits as damages are conclusively established.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PJC 115.13 cmt. We generally agree with\n   the Committee's recommendations, but our holdings today clarify that, to establish \"causation of policy benefits as damages\" on a statutory-violation claim, the jury must find that the violation caused the insured to lose benefits she was otherwise entitled to receive under the policy. A proper jury submission must include an appropriate question or instruction to establish that element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As USAA points out, submitting both a breach-of-contract claim and a statutory-violation claim in the same jury charge can create the risk of conflicting answers. An insured who seeks to recover policy benefits on a breach-of-contract claim must ask the jury to determine the amount of policy benefits lost as a result of the insurer's failure to comply with the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11348098\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/85/162/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PJC 115.3 &amp; cmt.

For both claims, the jury must find that the insured was entitled to the benefits under the policy. If the jury's answers to questions on one liability theory establish that the insured was not entitled to any policy benefits or was paid all policy benefits to which she was entitled, an answer on the other liability theory that the insured was entitled to benefits would create an irreconcilable and even fatal conflict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arvizu v. Estate of Puckett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315222\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/273/#p276\">\n    364 S.W.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276 (Tex. 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To avoid such a conflict, the court should ensure that the jury answers the entitlement-to-benefits question only once. Here, the trial court may have done best to simply submit Question 2 (to establish that USAA violated the statute) and Question 3 (to establish\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that the statutory violation caused Menchaca actual damages in the form of policy benefits\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that USAA breached the contract by failing to pay benefits Menchaca was entitled to under the policy), without submitting Question 1 at all. Alternatively, the court might have first asked the jury whether Menchaca was entitled to receive benefits under the policy, and then conditioned the remaining questions on a \"Yes\" answer to that first question. Yet another effective alternative may have been to instruct the jury that, because Menchaca seeks only to recover benefits under the policy, USAA did not fail to comply with the policy and Menchaca incurred no damages as a result of any statutory violation unless Menchaca was entitled to benefits under the policy. We offer these proposals-without the benefit of the parties' specific arguments or objections-as examples of how the court might have avoided a potential conflict, but we leave it to the parties and the trial court to determine how best to submit the claims on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Menchaca's Claims Against USAA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Having clarified the governing rules, we now apply them to the case before us. As explained above, the jury in this case (1) failed to find in answer to Question 1 that USAA failed to comply with its obligations under the insurance policy; (2) found in answer to Question 2 that USAA violated\n   the Insurance Code by failing to pay Menchaca's claim for policy benefits \"without conducting a reasonable investigation with respect to\" that claim; and (3) found in answer to Question 3 that USAA's statutory violation resulted in Menchaca incurring damages of $11,350, representing the amount of policy benefits USAA \"should have paid\" Menchaca.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Ever since the jury returned its verdict, the parties have disputed the effect of its answers. Relying on the jury's answer to Question 1, USAA has contended that Menchaca cannot recover any policy benefits for a statutory violation because she did not prevail on her breach-of-contract claim. Meanwhile, Menchaca has consistently argued that she can recover the award of policy benefits even though she did not prevail on her breach-of-contract claim because the jury found in answer to Questions 2 and 3 that USAA violated the statute and the violation caused Menchaca to incur damages in the form of policy benefits that USAA \"should have paid\" to Menchaca.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   USAA's argument overlooks the fact that-as we have clarified today-an insured need not prevail on a separate breach-of-contract claim to recover policy benefits for a statutory violation. Instead, as we have explained, the insured can prevail under the entitled-to-benefits rule or the benefits-lost rule if she establishes (1) the insurer violated the statute and (2) the violation resulted in her loss of benefits she was entitled to under the policy. Menchaca contends she obtained those findings through Questions 2 and 3. But if USAA \"should have paid\" policy benefits to Menchaca and did not, then the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3 conflicted with the jury's answer to Question 1 because USAA necessarily failed to comply with the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The trial court noted this apparent conflict before it dismissed the jury, but both parties took the position that no conflict existed. After the court received the verdict and asked for USAA's response, USAA replied: \"We accept the verdict, Your Honor.\" Menchaca then began explaining why she did not believe the jury's answers conflicted. The trial court asked USAA whether it believed the court should \"call the jury back\" and have it \"reconcile\" its answers. USAA replied that calling the jury back \"would be totally inappropriate. If it was per se irreconcilable it never should have been submitted to them.\" The trial court apparently agreed and discharged the jury. At the hearing on USAA's motion for entry of judgment, the trial court raised the conflict issue again, asking whether the jury's answers to Questions 1 and 2 conflicted. It asked Menchaca:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   I mean, failure to be reasonable in the investigation of the incident and the behavior of the adjuster is a breach of contract, and so now you have one that says, no, there is no breach of contract, and the other one says, yeah, there was? Isn't that a conflict between the two?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Menchaca responded, \"no, there's not [a conflict] based upon what the jury found in damages.\" Ultimately, the trial court side-stepped the issue by disregarding the jury's answer to Question 1 and entered judgment for Menchaca based on the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   USAA asserts that the trial court erred by disregarding the jury's answer to Question 1. We unanimously agree. But a majority of the Court concludes that the answer to Question 1 creates an irreconcilable and fatal conflict with the answers to Questions 2 and 3. And a plurality concludes that a judgment based on a fatal conflict does not constitute fundamental error, so parties must preserve the error\n   by objecting to the conflict before the trial court discharges the jury. Because the error was not preserved in this case, we cannot reverse the trial court's judgment on that ground. Nevertheless, in light of the parties' obvious confusion regarding our precedent and the clarifications we provide today, the plurality agrees that we should reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial in the interest of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Disregarding Question 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   After both parties argued that the jury's answers did not create a conflict, the trial court decided to disregard Question 1 because it was \"poorly worded\" and \"incomprehensible.\" Specifically, the court explained that Question 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-84\">\n   says, \"Breach of contract,\" but it doesn't say what kind of breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   It doesn't even explain breach of contract. It doesn't even give a definition for breach of contract. There's all kinds of other things that should have been put in there about what's material breach, definition of material breach. The question fails altogether. It shouldn't have been submitted in the first place. If you remember correctly, I didn't want that question submitted. But it was insisted upon by the plaintiffs, so they've got to reap what they sow. But I think that I can easily ignore question number one as being incomprehensible to a layman and that it has no effect. I can go with what I wanted to go with in the first place which was question number two, damage question, then attorney's fees. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to ignore question number one entirely because I think it was poorly worded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision to disregard Question 1 but for different reasons. First, the court concluded it was impossible to know why the jury answered \"No\" to the question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203804602\">\n    2014 WL 3804602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the court of appeals' view, the jury could have answered \"No\" because it mistakenly believed that USAA could only \"fail to comply with the terms of the insurance policy\" if it failed to pay the amount that USAA\n   <em>\n    subjectively\n   </em>\n   believed it had to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203804602\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, it concluded that the jury's \"No\" answer to Question 1 did not \"definitively establish that there was no coverage\" because USAA agreed that the policy provided coverage for Menchaca's losses and that the amount of the losses did not exceed the policy's deductible.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203804602\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the court concluded that the jury's finding in answer to Question 2 that USAA violated the statute rendered its answer to Question 1 immaterial because Question 3 \"instructed the jury to award the same damages regardless of which theory of liability was adopted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203804602\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We conclude that the trial court erred by disregarding the jury's answer to Question 1. \"A trial court may disregard a jury finding only if it is unsupported by evidence ... or if the issue is immaterial.\"\n   <em>\n    Spencer v.

Contrary to the court of appeals' analysis, the fact that the court cannot determine the reasons for a jury's answer does not permit the court to disregard that answer.

Although USAA did not dispute that the policy provided \"coverage\" for the\n   <em>\n    types\n   </em>\n   of losses Menchaca suffered, it provided evidence that the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of her loss was less than the policy's deductible, and that evidence supports the jury's failure to find that USAA \"failed to comply\" with its obligations under the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Second, Question 1 was not immaterial.

Contrary to the trial court's conclusion, that a question is defective does not render the jury's answer immaterial.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10124060\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/406/191/#p194\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (concluding that, \"while [a question] was defective, it was not immaterial.\"). Question 1 was material because Menchaca sued USAA for breach of the insurance policy as well as for statutory violations, and she sought to recover on either claim. The jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3 did not render its \"No\" answer to Question 1 immaterial because Menchaca chose to use Question 1 as the basis for prevailing on her breach-of-contract claim. We therefore conclude that the court of appeals erred by affirming the trial court's decision to disregard the jury's answer to Question 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Effect of Questions 2 and 3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   USAA insists that, in light of our agreement that the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's answer Question 1, we must reverse and render judgment in USAA's favor. It argues, correctly, that Menchaca effectively cannot recover policy benefits if USAA did not breach the policy. It also points out, correctly, that Menchaca did not secure that finding in Question 1. But USAA ignores-or at least misconstrues-the effect of the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3, in which the jury found that USAA's Insurance Code violation caused Menchaca damages of $11,350, representing the difference \"between the amount USAA should have paid Gail Menchaca for her Hurricane Ike damages and the amount that was actually paid.\" This award, USAA agrees, constitutes an award of \"policy benefits.\" The jury's finding that USAA's statutory violation resulted in Menchaca's loss of $11,350 in policy benefits that USAA \"should have paid\" necessarily constitutes a finding that Menchaca was entitled to receive those benefits under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   USAA argues that we cannot read the jury's answer to Question 3 as a finding that Menchaca was entitled to policy benefits because Question 3 was \"merely a damages question.\" In fact, however, Question 3 was a causation-and-damages question, requiring the jury to determine the amount of Menchaca's loss \"that resulted from\"\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   USAA's contractual breach\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   its statutory violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury\n   failed to find a contractual breach, but it did find a statutory violation. Thus, the jury's answer to Question 3 can only constitute a finding that USAA's statutory violation caused Menchaca to lose policy benefits that USAA \"should have paid.\" The trial court agreed on this as well. When it disregarded Question 1, it determined that Question 2 and Question 3 together contained all the elements of Menchaca's Insurance-Code-violation claim:\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   (1) USAA violated the insurance code, (2) that violation caused Menchaca to lose policy benefits she otherwise would have been entitled to, and (3) the benefits she \"should have\" received were $11,350.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   This holding does not \"suggest[ ] an exception to the no-recovery rule,\" as the Dissent proposes.\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 526 ( GREEN , J., dissenting).

If Question 3 did not contain that finding, there no conflict would exist.

Nor do we agree that it could have independently constituted a finding that the insured in\n   <em>\n    Casta\u00f1eda\n   </em>\n   was entitled to policy benefits. Although the\n   <em>\n    Casta\u00f1eda\n   </em>\n   charge defined \"loss of benefits\" to mean benefits \"due under the policy,\" the charge in that case asked the jury to determine the amount that would compensate the insured for the damages, if any, resulting from\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the insured's \"loss of credit reputation\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the \"loss of benefits ... due under the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casta\u00f1eda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10006196\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/914/273/#p281\">\n    914 S.W.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, by contrast, Question 3 instructed the jury to determine only the amount of benefits USAA \"should have paid ...

Here, by contrast, the jury's finding in answer to Question 3 of an amount that USAA \"should have paid\" cannot be attributed to anything other than USAA's obligation under the policy to pay that amount to Menchaca.

We might, for example, speculate that the jury awarded $11,350 as the amount the jury believed USAA \"should have paid\" Menchaca as a matter of equity or charity, rather than as a policy obligation. But any such effort would require mere speculation and an assumption that the jury ignored the questions and instructions the trial court provided. The trial court asked the jury to determine the amount of damages Menchaca incurred as a result of USAA's contractual breach or statutory violation and instructed the jury to determine that amount based on the difference \"between the amount USAA should have paid Gail Menchaca for her Hurricane Ike damages and the amount that was actually paid.\" As both parties agree, the amount the jury awarded represents the amount of benefits the jury determined USAA \"should have paid\" to Menchaca under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   When an irreconcilable conflict involves one jury answer that would require a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and another that would require a judgment in favor of the defendant, the conflict is fatal.\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Furniture Mfg.

Amicus for USAA\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   argues that the fatal conflict \"should preclude any recovery\" by Menchaca. Although USAA does not agree that the jury's answers fatally conflict, it argues that if they do conflict, it was Menchaca's burden to object and she waived the error by failing to do so before the trial court dismissed the jury. We disagree. In the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3, Menchaca obtained all of the findings necessary to recover on her statutory-violation claim, and USAA is the party who must rely on the conflicting answer to Question 1 to prevent Menchaca from recovering based on the answers to Questions 2 and 3.

As a result, the trial court discharged the jury without giving it the opportunity to resolve its conflicting answers. The trial court then attempted to resolve the conflict by disregarding the jury's failure to find a breach of contract. USAA properly preserved its argument that the court erred in disregarding that answer, and we have agreed with USAA that the trial court erred. We have disagreed, however, with USAA's argument that Menchaca's failure to prevail on her contract claim automatically negates the findings she obtained on her statutory claim.

In light of the parties' obvious and understandable confusion over our relevant precedent and the effect of that confusion on their arguments in this case, as well as our clarification of the requirements to preserve error based on conflicting jury answers, we conclude that a remand is necessary here in the interest of justice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    USAA has steadfastly maintained that Menchaca cannot recover policy benefits for a statutory violation unless she also obtains a finding that USAA \"breached\" the insurance policy or that USAA's statutory violation caused an injury independent of her right to benefits. At trial, USAA objected to the charge's failure to condition Question 2 on a \"Yes\" finding to Question 1 and objected to the submission of Question 3 on the ground that \"Texas courts have held that extra[-]contractual damages need to be independent from policy damages.\" After the jury returned its verdict, USAA argued that it should prevail because \"the jury found 'NO' breach of contract\" and awarded only policy benefits. After the trial court entered its judgment, USAA argued in its motion for new trial that Menchaca cannot recover in the absence of a finding of breach because she did not seek damages \"separate and apart from those sought under the breach of contract theory.\" Although we have clarified today that a plaintiff does not have to prevail on a separate breach-of-contract claim to recover policy benefits for a statutory violation, the confusing nature of our precedent precludes us from faulting USAA for the position it has maintained throughout this litigation. Moreover, although USAA failed to preserve any objection based on the jury's conflicting answers, Menchaca agreed with USAA that the answers did not conflict, and neither the parties nor the trial court had the benefit of the guidance we have provided today regarding the preservation of such error. Under these circumstances, we conclude that justice requires that we reverse and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    For the reasons explained, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial in the interest of justice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Chief Justice Hecht filed a concurring opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Justice Blacklock concurs in the judgment without opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Justice Green filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Guzman and Justice Brown joined as to Parts I, II, and IV, and a plurality opinion as to Part III, in which Chief Justice Hecht, Justice Guzman, and Justice Brown joined.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Justice Johnson did not participate in the decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Chief Justice Hecht, concurring in the judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    I join Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, and III-C of JUSTICE BOYD 's plurality opinion and\n    Part III of JUSTICE GREEN 's opinion, also a plurality. I join in the Court's judgment remanding the case to the trial court for a new trial, but for reasons different from those expressed in JUSTICE BOYD 's opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    USAA and Menchaca have both argued, each consistently throughout, in the trial court, the court of appeals, and now this Court, that the jury answers in the verdict do not conflict. The Court unanimously disagrees. JUSTICE BOYD would hold that the trial court cannot render judgment on fatally conflicting jury answers, and I agree. The trial court erred in rendering judgment for Menchaca. But JUSTICE BOYD would also hold that the error is not reversible unless the appellant objected in the trial court. Since USAA was the appellant and did not object in the trial court, JUSTICE BOYD concludes that it is not entitled to reversal. But USAA could not object, consistent with its position that the jury answers do not conflict. Menchaca took the same position, and had the trial court picked USAA to win, she, too, could not complain on appeal because she, like USAA, could not have objected. Thus, in JUSTICE BOYD 's view, if neither side thinks jury answers conflict, and an appellate court later disagrees, the party for whom the trial court erroneously rendered judgment wins. I disagree that an objection was necessary in this situation for the reasons given by JUSTICE GREEN in Part III of his dissent. In my view, because USAA and Menchaca each insists on rendition of a favorable judgment, and judgment cannot be rendered for either based on the conflicting answers in the jury verdict, the case must be retried. I do not agree with JUSTICE BOYD that the parties' confusion about the law requires a retrial in the interest of justice. Rather, a retrial is the only way to correct the trial court's error given the parties' erroneous positions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    JUSTICE GREEN would render judgment for USAA because Menchaca, as plaintiff, had the burden of obtaining findings to support a judgment in her favor and failed to do so. I disagree. Menchaca obtained the findings she needed. The jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3-that USAA underpaid her $11,350 in policy benefits because it did not reasonably investigate her claim-supported a judgment in her favor. But the jury's answers to those questions conflicted with its answer to Question 1. The answers to Questions 2 and 3 establish that USAA failed to comply with its policy, yet the jury refused to make that finding in answer to Question 1. Menchaca cannot prevail because the jury answers were conflicting, not because they were insufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Accordingly, I join in the Court's judgment remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    JUSTICE GREEN, joined by JUSTICE GUZMAN and JUSTICE BROWN as to Parts I, II, and IV, dissenting, and joined by CHIEF JUSTICE HECHT, JUSTICE GUZMAN, and JUSTICE BROWN as to Part III, delivering a plurality opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    The Court's opinion outlines five rules governing the relationship between contractual and statutory claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    545 S.W.3d at ----. Under those five rules, I would hold that USAA Texas Lloyds Company is entitled to judgment in its favor because the plaintiff, Gail Menchaca, failed to prove that USAA was contractually obligated to pay benefits under the homeowners policy-a requisite showing to recover policy benefits for a violation of the Texas Insurance Code.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9994496\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/879/10/#p17\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at ----.

As the Court's opinion explains, to recover for that statutory violation,\n    Menchaca was required to prove either (1) she suffered damages independent of the loss of policy benefits, or (2) the statutory violation caused her to lose policy benefits to which she was entitled.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at ----.

Rule 295 does not mandate that conflicts not resolved through further deliberations are waived; the rule simply mandates written instructions in the event that the court decides to have the jury deliberate further to reform the verdict. Rule 295 does not prohibit a court from exercising another option, however: If the plaintiff insisted on submitting its claims in a way that cannot support the plaintiff's claim for recovery in light of the jury's answers, nobody objects to the jury's answers, and both parties insist there is no conflict, the trial court may enter judgment for the defendant without running afoul of the rule.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    If the trial court opts not to direct reformation of the verdict, as Rule 295 allows, but instead enters judgment, an option JUSTICE BOYD does not recognize, JUSTICE BOYD believes that Rule 295 prohibits an appellate court from disturbing that judgment absent an objection to conflicting jury answers. 545 S.W.3d at ----.

In that context, as soon as the jury returns its verdict, both the nature of the objection and the party who must object become clear. The same cannot be said in the case of conflicting jury answers, where the jury has answered all necessary and material questions, each party reasonably believes the verdict supports a judgment, neither party believes it would benefit from additional jury deliberations, and \"the complaining party\" cannot be ascertained until after the trial court enters its judgment, sometimes days or weeks later.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burbage v.

It defies reason to hold that we cannot review the trial court's judgment because USAA, which did not yet know that it would be the party complaining of the judgment, failed to object when the conflict issue had already been raised in the trial court and the court rejected further jury deliberations to reform the judgment.

JUSTICE BOYD relies primarily on a single sentence in a 1962 case: \"The entry of judgment by a trial court on conflicting findings does not constitute fundamental error.\"\n    <em>\n     Murphree\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10171290,2263629\" index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/357/744/\">\n     357 S.W.2d at 749\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But the Court in\n    <em>\n     Murphree\n    </em>\n    never applied that sentence to the facts of the case, and the Court certainly never held that only an objection before jury dismissal would allow an appellate court to consider whether a judgment based on conflicting findings can stand. In fact, the opinion suggests that \"assignment of error contained in [a] motion for new trial sufficient to bring this question to the trial court's attention\" might have avoided a waiver problem.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10171290,2263629\" index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/357/744/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10171290,2263629\" index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/357/744/\">\n     at 748-49\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This Court later explained our\n    <em>\n     Murphree\n    </em>\n    ruling, but again we did not hold that only an objection before jury dismissal would preserve error as to conflicting answers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     St. Louis Sw.

Rather, we explained that \"[a]ssuming, without deciding, that there was an irreconcilable conflict in the jury answers, it was necessary to file a motion for new trial assigning as error the entry of judgment on conflicting jury findings\" when no motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or to disregard special issue findings had been filed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12063941\" index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/424/896/#p898\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (explaining\n    <em>\n     Murphree\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10171290,2263629\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/357/744/\">\n     357 S.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    744 ). Thus, to the extent that preservation is required under\n    <em>\n     Murphree\n    </em>\n    , this Court has recognized other mechanisms by which the conflict complaint can be preserved for appeal, including a motion to disregard specific findings, motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and motion for new trial alleging erroneous entry of judgment based on entry of conflicting jury findings. Although I do not believe our preservation requirements prevent us from ruling in USAA's favor or even from considering the issue of conflicting jury answers in this case, I do believe that USAA's post-verdict motions were sufficient \"to bring this question [of conflicting answers] to the trial court's attention\" and thus preserved error.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Murphree\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10171290,2263629\" index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/357/744/\">\n     357 S.W.2d at 748\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    While JUSTICE BOYD provides a thorough discussion of the evolution of our fundamental-error doctrine, 545 S.W.3d at ----, it is not relevant to this case. The \"discredited doctrine\" is relevant only when a party challenges on appeal an alleged error that it did not preserve in the trial court, requiring us to decide whether our narrow fundamental-error doctrine permits appellate review of the unpreserved complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re B.L.D.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096781\" index=\"446\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/340/#p350\">\n     113 S.W.3d 340\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 350 (Tex. 2003) (\"Historically, we have used the term 'fundamental error' to describe situations in which an appellate court may review error that was neither raised in the trial court nor assigned on appeal.\") (citing\n    <em>\n     McCauley v.

The judgment in this case was not based on conflicting answers-the trial court eliminated any conflict when it decided to disregard Question 1, before it entered judgment based on the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3. This Court is the first to consider the answers to all three jury questions together, and the parties maintain their no-conflict position. This simply is not a case in which a party raises an issue on appeal but failed to preserve it in the trial court. We should not resolve this case by misapplying preservation rules, getting distracted by the fundamental-error doctrine, or ignoring the realities of the trial proceeding. Nor should we hold a defendant to a preservation standard that forces it to \"forfeit a winning hand\" or \"ask the trial court to fix an error that would, as here, ultimately result in a judgment in its favor.\"\n    <em>\n     United Scaffolding, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410203\" index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/463/#p480\">\n     537 S.W.3d at 481\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    As in\n    <em>\n     Little Rock Furniture\n    </em>\n    , the trial court here practically invited the parties to object before the jury was dismissed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10208633,2332187\" index=\"450\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/222/985/\">\n     222 S.W.2d at 987-88\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
