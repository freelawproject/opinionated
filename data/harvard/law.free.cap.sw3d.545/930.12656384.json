Ms. Sheehan argues that the trial court erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence from which the arresting officer could have had probable cause to believe that she was driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
