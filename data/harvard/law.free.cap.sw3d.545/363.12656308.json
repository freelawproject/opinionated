J.M. argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the District because sovereign immunity is inapplicable because the injury was caused by a dangerous condition of property under section 537.600.1(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Further, J.M. argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of DeMarco because he was not entitled to protection under the official immunity doctrine as his actions were ministerial rather than discretionary. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   J.M. attended Boy's Club for the academic year of 2014-2015. Boy's Club is an afterschool program for 5th and 6th grade boys at Prairie View Elementary, a school within the District. Boy's Club is sponsored and led by Prairie View Elementary gym teacher, Felton Bishop (\"Bishop\"). Bishop is assisted by DeMarco, a volunteer for the District. DeMarco was under the supervision of Bishop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the last day of Boy's Club for the academic year, the boys were going to play softball. Prior to playing, Bishop and DeMarco gathered the boys into the gym, and Bishop explained how to play the game and the safety rules the boys were to follow. This included a mandate that any person playing the catcher position was required to wear the facemask and chest protector provided by the District. The boys were also instructed to drop the bat after a hit instead of throwing it, as the flying bats were a danger to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the instruction, the boys were split into two groups, half with Bishop and half\n   with DeMarco on an adjacent field. J.M. was playing on the field supervised by DeMarco. When it was J.M.'s turn to play catcher, he first tried on one facemask, which was too small for his face. J.M. then tried on another facemask, which was too big for his face. J.M. attempted unsuccessfully to tighten the larger facemask so that he could use it. J.M. took the facemask to DeMarco to have it tightened. DeMarco was also unable to adjust the facemask to make it fit J.M. DeMarco instructed J.M. to play catcher without the facemask but stand further back, closer to the fence behind the plate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the first play after J.M. began playing catcher, the batter hit the ball and threw the bat behind him which struck J.M. in the face. The force of the bat broke J.M.'s nose in two places, requiring surgical intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.M. brought negligence claims against the District and DeMarco. The District and DeMarco filed a joint answer. The District and DeMarco then filed separate motions for summary judgment. The District argued that J.M.'s negligence claim against it was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. DeMarco argued J.M.'s negligence claim against him was barred by the doctrines of official immunity and the public duty doctrine. The trial court granted summary judgment for both Defendants. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court makes its decision to grant summary judgment based on the pleadings, record submitted, and the law; therefore, this Court need not defer to the trial court's determination and reviews the grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ITT Commercial Fin.

J.M.'s first point on appeal argues that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of the District because the District's sovereign immunity was waived based upon the dangerous condition of property exception. J.M.'s second point on appeal argues that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of DeMarco because DeMarco was not entitled to official immunity because, under these facts, allowing J.M. to play without wearing the protective mask was a ministerial duty rather than a discretionary decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Point One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Point One, J.M. argues that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of the District because the District's sovereign immunity was waived under section 537.600.1(2), also known as the dangerous condition of property exception. J.M. argues that the area behind the batter on the softball field constituted a dangerous condition of property because bats and balls can strike people in that area of the field. J.M. further argues that whether the dangerous condition of property was a proximate cause of J.M.'s injury is a factual question to be determined by a jury making summary judgment inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"A public entity is generally protected by sovereign immunity against lawsuits without the public entity's consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodgers v.

The allegation is that the facemask was not the correct size to properly fit J.M. and that this made the area of the softball field where he was playing dangerous.

Here, DeMarco properly asserted the affirmative defense of official immunity. DeMarco admitted J.M.'s allegation in the amended petition that he was a volunteer for the District. DeMarco asserted he was acting in the scope and course of his duties for the District. DeMarco also asserted that in carrying out any duties he owed, he exercised his professional expertise and judgment. DeMarco's allegations in the responsive pleading as a whole constitute a short and plain statement of the facts properly pleading the defense of official immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   J.M. then argues that, even if DeMarco properly pled his affirmative defense of official immunity, DeMarco is not entitled to the protection afforded by the doctrine because he was not afforded the discretion to instruct J.M. to play catcher without a facemask. J.M. argues that DeMarco was present when Bishop, his supervisor, informed everyone involved that any person playing catcher was required to wear a facemask and other protective gear provided by the District. Therefore, DeMarco had no discretion to allow the players to play catcher without the proper protective gear, including the facemask and DeMarco's decisions regarding the wearing of face protection were ministerial. Further, J.M. argues DeMarco was not afforded the discretion to instruct J.M. to play catcher without a facemask because doing so violated school board policy. J.M. argues that the school board policy, coupled with the direct instructions from Bishop, created a ministerial duty to require children to wear the provided safety gear and DeMarco violated that duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The judicially-created doctrine of official immunity \"is intended to provide protection for individual government actors who, despite limited resources and imperfect information, must exercise judgment in the performance of their duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Southers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8360265\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/263/603/#p610\">\n    263 S.W.3d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Its goal is also to permit public employees to make judgments affecting public safety and welfare without concern about possible personal liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8360265\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/263/603/#p610\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Official immunity protects public officials from liability for alleged acts of ordinary negligence committed during the course of their official duties for the performance of discretionary acts.\n   <em>\n    Woods v.
