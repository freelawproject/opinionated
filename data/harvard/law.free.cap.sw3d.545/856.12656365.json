The contract governed Diaz and Weir's purchase of a used 2013 Kia Optima from Head Motor Company in Columbia. The Credit Union filed its lawsuit after repossessing and selling the car through a private auction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Diaz and Weir counterclaimed, alleging that the Credit Union had failed to send them the pre-sale and post-disposition notices required by Missouri statutes. Following a brief bench trial, the circuit court entered judgment for the Credit Union. It awarded the Credit Union total damages of $11,600.19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Diaz and Weir appeal. Because we conclude that the Credit Union failed to comply with the Missouri statutes specifying\n   the pre- and post-sale notices to which Diaz and Weir were entitled, we reverse the circuit court's judgment, and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings on Diaz and Weir's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 12, 2015, Diaz and Weir jointly purchased a used 2013 Kia Optima automobile from Head Motor Company in Columbia. As part of the transaction they signed a Retail Installment Sale Contract, which identified them as the Buyers, and Head Motor Company as the \"Seller-Creditor.\" Under the contract, Diaz and Weir were to make 78 monthly payments of $447.80 for the vehicle, in addition to their $400.00 cash down payment, and a trade-in allowance of $1,500.00 they were given by Head Motor. With fees and interest, the contract listed the Total Sale Price for the vehicle to be $36,828.40. The Credit Union financed the purchase of the vehicle, and Head Motor Company assigned its rights under the Retail Installment Sale Contract to the Credit Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Diaz and Weir made their initial monthly payment on the contract on April 18, 2015. When it did not receive the next monthly payment, the Credit Union sent Diaz and Weir a First Notice of Right to Cure Default on June 11, 2015. The notice advised Diaz and Weir that, if they made their regular monthly payment of $447.80 by July 1, 2015, the contract would continue without penalty. Diaz and Weir made a second $447.80 payment on June 25, 2015. They made no further payments on the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 13, 2015, the Credit Union sent Diaz and Weir a Second Notice of Right to Cure Default, which was largely similar to the first notice. The second notice included the following information:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-16\"><strong>SECOND NOTICE OF RIGHT TO CURE DEFAULT</strong> <strong>Account Information:</strong> <strong>Account Number</strong> <strong>*******607-0010</strong> <strong>Payoff Amount</strong> <strong>$30,920.92</strong> <strong>Loan Amount</strong> <strong>$30,719.73</strong> <strong>Payoff as of</strong> <strong>07/13/2015</strong> <strong>Date of Loan</strong> <strong>03/20/2015</strong> <strong>Past Due Amount</strong> <strong>$489.05</strong> <strong>Payment Amount</strong> <strong>$447.80</strong> <strong>Last Day for Payment</strong> <strong>08/02/2015</strong> <strong>Frequency</strong> <strong>Monthly</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Below this information, the notice stated: \"You are late in making your payment(s). If you pay the Current Due Amount (above) by the Last Day for Payment (above), you may continue with the contract as though you were not late.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because Diaz and Weir failed to cure the second default, the Credit Union repossessed their vehicle on September 7, 2015. The following day, the Credit Union sent Diaz and Weir a written notice of its intent to sell the collateral, and on October 9, 2015, it sold the car for $19,500.00 at a private auction. On October 14, 2015, the Credit Union notified Diaz and Weir of the sale, and advised them that they remained liable for a deficiency balance of $11,833.49 on the Retail Installment Sale Contract. The October 14 notice also advised Diaz and Weir that \"interest will continue to accrue on that balance at a rate of $1.27 per day until the loan is paid in full.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 3, 2015, the Credit Union filed its petition in the circuit court to recover the deficiency balance. Although the circuit court initially entered a default judgment against Diaz and Weir, it later granted their motion to set the default aside. Diaz and Weir then filed their answer and a counterclaim, which alleged that the Credit Union had failed to provide them with the pre- and post-sale notices\n   required by statute. Diaz and Weir sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorney's fees, on their counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 2, 2016, the circuit court held a bench trial on the parties' respective claims. On December 8, 2016, the court entered a judgment for the Credit Union. On its affirmative claim, the circuit court awarded the Credit Union the total amount of $11,600.19: $8,991.08 in unpaid principal; $510.51 in accrued interest at the contract rate; and $2,098.60 in attorney's fees and costs. The judgment ordered that Diaz and Weir take nothing on their counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Diaz and Weir appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In this bench-tried case, \"the decree or judgment of the trial court will be sustained by the appellate court unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, unless it is against the weight of the evidence, unless it erroneously declares the law, or unless it erroneously applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

App. E.D. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As the Credit Union points out, the Missouri cases announcing the strict compliance, \"no notice-no deficiency\" rule have involved the pre-sale notices required by Missouri's Uniform Commercial Code. Those pre-sale notices inform a borrower of the lender's intention to sell collateral, and of the manner in which the lender intends to dispose of the collateral. The Credit Union argues that this same strict compliance rule should not be applied to the post-default right-to-cure notice at issue here. We disagree. First, just like the pre-sale notices involved in prior cases, the right-to-cure notice at issue here is part of the process by which a lender enforces its rights against collateral following a payment default by a borrower; this process may ultimately result in a deficiency which the lender seeks to collect through litigation. Under \u00a7 408.555.1, the lender cannot take any action to accelerate a loan, or enforce against collateral, until the right-to-cure notice has been given, and the cure period has run. Because a right-to-cure notice is a statutory pre-condition to a lender obtaining a deficiency judgment-a judgment which is inconsistent with common-law principles-\u00a7 408.554 is one of the \"relevant statutes\" with which a lender must strictly comply.\n   <em>\n    Gateway Aviation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9953723\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/577/860/#p863\">\n    577 S.W.2d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, the right-to-cure notice has the same consumer-protective purpose as a pre-sale notice, and the requirement of a right-to-cure notice should accordingly be enforced as rigorously as the requirement for pre-sale notice. The official comments\n   to \u00a7 5.110 of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code (1974), on which \u00a7 408.554 is based, make clear that the purpose of the right-to-cure notice is \"to give the consumer enough information to understand his predicament and to encourage him to take appropriate steps to alleviate it\"; it \"gives the average consumer the opportunity to rehabilitate his account, bring a billing error to the attention of or present a breach of warranty claim to the creditor, or negotiate a refinancing or deferral arrangement that may be required by a change in his financial circumstances.\" 7 Pt. III UNIFORM LAWS ANNOTATED at 237, 238 (2002). Similarly,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [t]he purpose of statutory [pre-sale] notice is to apprise a debtor of the details of a sale so that the debtor may take whatever action he deems necessary to protect his interest. Proper notice provides the debtor the opportunity to: (1) discharge the debt and reclaim the collateral, (2) find another purchaser, or (3) verify that the sale is conducted in a commercially reasonable manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    States Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319808\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/339/591/#p596\">\n    339 S.W.3d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Because both pre-sale and right-to-cure notices are intended to allow consumers to avoid repossession and sale of their property, or otherwise mitigate the financial consequences of a loan default, the provisions should be enforced in the same fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, courts in at least two other states with similar statutes have held that a lender must strictly comply with the statutory requirement of a right-to-cure notice before accelerating a loan or repossessing collateral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank v.

To be \"conspicuous,\" the information must be \"obvious to the eye or mind,\" \"plainly visible,\" and \"manifest.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INT'L DICTIONARY at 485 (unabridged ed. 1993). The Credit Union's right-to-cure notice listed a \"Loan Amount,\" a \"Payment Amount,\" a \"Payoff Amount,\" and a \"Past Due Amount.\" It then advised Diaz and Weir that they were \"late in making [their] payment(s),\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   and that they could cure the default by \"pay[ing] the Current Due Amount (above)\" by August 2, 2015. Given that the phrase \"Current Due Amount\" is capitalized, it would appear to be a defined term, used in a precise or technical manner. The notice also stated that the \"Current Due Amount\" was listed \"above.\" Yet the text above this statement does not report a \"Current Due Amount.\" The Credit Union's Collections Manager testified that the \"Current Due Amount\" Diaz and Weir were required to pay to cure the default on their loan was the \"Past Due Amount\" listed in the second right-to-cure notice. Given that \"past\" and \"current\" are virtually antonyms, however,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   it would not be obvious to a lay consumer that the \"Past Due Amount\" and the \"Current Due Amount\" were intended to mean the same thing. Notably, the \"safe harbor\" form provided in \u00a7 408.554.2 uses the unambiguous term \"Amount Now Due,\" twice, to refer to the sum which a borrower must pay to cure a default. Although the Credit Union's right-to-sue notice largely followed the \"safe harbor\" form, it inexplicably chose to substitute two different terms for the phrase \"Amount Now Due.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Credit Union's second right-to-cure notice was ambiguous and confusing concerning the amount Diaz and Weir were required to pay to cure their default, and it therefore failed to strictly comply with the requirements of \u00a7 408.554.2. Because the Credit Union failed to strictly comply with a relevant statute, it forfeited its right to a deficiency judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Point I is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In their second Point, Diaz and Weir claim that the Credit Union's post-sale notice violated \u00a7 400.9-616, because it failed to provide an adequate explanation of the deficiency balance for which they remained liable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Uniform Commercial Code adopted in Missouri \"reflects the view that, in every consumer-goods transaction, the debtor or obligor is entitled to know the amount of a surplus or deficiency and the basis upon which the surplus or deficiency was calculated.\" \u00a7 400.9-616, comment 2. Accordingly, \u00a7 400.9-616(b) provides that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [i]n a consumer-goods transaction in which the debtor is entitled to a surplus or a consumer obligor is liable for a deficiency under section 400.9-615, the secured party shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (1) Send an explanation to the debtor or consumer obligor, as applicable, after the disposition and:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (A) Before or when the secured party accounts to the debtor and pays any surplus or first makes written demand on the consumer obligor after the disposition for payment of the deficiency; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (B) Within fourteen days after receipt of a request; or\n   (2) In the case of a consumer obligor who is liable for a deficiency, within fourteen days after receipt of a request, send to the consumer obligor a record waiving the secured party's right to a deficiency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The statute also specifies the contents of the \"explanation\" which a borrower must provide.

We agree. Apart from calculating the\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   amount of the deficiency for which Diaz and Weir were liable, the October 14, 2015 deficiency notice made reference to only a single circumstances which would alter the deficiency balance in the future: the accrual of post-notice interest at the rate of $1.27 per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At trial, the Credit Union's Collection Manager testified to multiple post-deficiency-notice charges and refunds which substantially altered the amount of the deficiency the Credit Union was seeking to recover from Diaz and Weir. Most significantly, the Credit Union's witness testified that the deficiency balance was reduced by a \"GAP\" or \"GAAP\" refund of $733.85,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and an extended warranty rebate of $2,193.56; on the other hand, the deficiency was increased by a $75.00 detail fee, and by $2,091.77 in attorney's fees. Yet even though \u00a7 400.9-616(a)(1)(C) requires a deficiency notice to \"[s]tate[ ], if applicable, that future debits, credits, charges, ... interest, rebates, and expenses may affect the amount of the surplus or deficiency,\" the deficiency notice makes\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   reference to the possibility that the deficiency would be altered by future charges or refunds-other than $1.27 in daily interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Section 400.9-616(d) provides that \"[a] particular phrasing of the [post-sale] explanation is not required. An explanation complying substantially with the requirements of subsection (a) is sufficient, even if it includes minor errors that are not seriously misleading.\" The Credit Union's deficiency notice did not \"substantially comply\" with the statutory requirements, and the failure to mention the prospect of future charges and refunds, totaling thousands of dollars, is not merely a \"minor error.\" The later refunds reduced the deficiency balance stated in deficiency notice by almost 25%, while the post-notice charges added more than 18% to the claimed deficiency. These are significant alterations to the deficiency balance stated in the October 14, 2015 letter. Under \u00a7 400.9-616(a)(1)(C), the Credit Union was required to alert Diaz and Weir to the prospect that the deficiency would be altered by future charges and refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Under \u00a7 408.556.1, \"[i]n any action brought by a lender against a borrower arising from default, the petition shall allege ... facts sufficient to show compliance\n   with the provisions of sections 400.9-601 to 400.9-629, RSMo.\" In this case, the Credit Union could not show such compliance, because of the defects in its post-sale deficiency notice. The circuit court erred by awarding the Credit Union a deficiency judgment in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Point II is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In their third Point, Diaz and Weir ask this Court to reverse the circuit court's entry of judgment against them on their counterclaim. Given our reversal of the circuit court's finding that the Credit Union had complied with its statutory notification obligations, we likewise reverse the circuit court's grant of judgment to the Credit Union on Diaz and Weir's counterclaim, and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings on the counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In their fourth Point, Diaz and Werner argue that the circuit court erred in admitting the Retail Installment Sale Contract into evidence, because the Credit Union failed to lay a proper foundation for the contract's admission as a business record. Given our dispositions of Points I and II, it is unnecessary for us to address this claim of evidentiary error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Because the Credit Union failed to comply with its statutory notice obligations, we reverse the judgment entered in the Credit Union's favor, and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings on Diaz and Weir's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   All concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, statutory citations refer to the 2016 edition of the Revised Statutes of Missouri.

Because Diaz and Weir may be entitled to different or additional relief depending on whether the post-sale notice is deficient, we address their second Point, despite our ruling in their favor on Point I.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The nature of this refund is not further explained in the trial testimony or exhibits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
