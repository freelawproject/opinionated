Phon was under the age of eighteen at the time of the murders. He ultimately entered a guilty plea before the Warren Circuit Court and a jury was empaneled for a sentencing hearing. After a full opportunity to present evidence, the jury recommended that Phon be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (\"LWOP\"). The Warren Circuit Court sentenced Phon accordingly. Phon now appeals the denial of his third Rule of Criminal Procedure (RCr) 11.42 motion and his second Rule of Civil Procedure (CR) 60.02 motion. For the foregoing reasons, this Court affirms in part and reverses in part the opinion of the Court of\n   Appeals and remands to the Warren Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Phon, a member of a gang, entered the home of Khamphao Phromratsamy and Manyavanh Boonprasert in August 1996. At the direction of the gang leader, Phon killed Khamphao and Manyavanh, execution style. He also shot their twelve-year-old daughter in the head but she miraculously survived. Phon claimed that the then twenty-six-year-old leader of the gang had instructed him to execute the victims and he complied in fear of retribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Phon and the five other gang members were charged and indicted in 1996, when Phon was sixteen years old.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Phon was indicted on two counts of murder; assault, first degree; robbery, first degree; and burglary, first degree. The Commonwealth noticed Phon of its intent to seek the death penalty in his case. In order to assist Phon in escaping this harshest penalty, Phon's attorney recommended that he enter a guilty plea and they present a case of mitigation to a jury for sentencing. Due to the recently-passed 1998 House Bill 455 in Kentucky, the sentence of LWOP was a new statutory punishment. Phon consented that the sentence be available to the jury as an option.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commonwealth still sought the death penalty before the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Phon presented a robust case of mitigation evidence to the jury. His family members and experts testified about: Phon's upbringing in a politically hostile and tyrannical country; his family's refuge in Thailand; how three of Phon's brothers had died of starvation during their time of refuge; the deplorable and inhumane conditions in the refugee camp; the tragic death of Phon's younger brother after they had reached the United States; and Phon's IQ of 74 and the effect it had on his judgment. After hearing all the evidence, the jury was given several options for sentencing: death, LWOP, life without the possibility of parole for 25 years (LWOP 25), life imprisonment, or twenty years or more. The jury, after finding the presence of an aggravator at the time of the murders, recommended that Phon be sentenced to LWOP, which was subsequently imposed by the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Phon filed his first RCr 11.42 motion before his formal sentencing, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to explain the inclusion of LWOP as an available penalty and the failure to make a timely appeal, among other corollary arguments. The trial court denied Phon relief and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the trial court's decision was well-supported and Phon had failed to establish his claim.\n   <em>\n    Phon v.

Bell County Coal Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8364370\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/238/644/#p647\">\n    238 S.W.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 (Ky. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. PHON'S CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS MUST FAIL.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Phon's argument to this Court encompasses several interrelated Constitutional claims, both pursuant to the United States Constitution and the Kentucky Constitution. He claims, first, that LWOP is an unconstitutional sentence for all juveniles, even when the sentencing procedure is discretionary rather than mandatory. Phon next contends that if discretionary LWOP sentencing for juveniles is constitutionally permissible, there must be specific findings that the juvenile in question is \"permanently incorrigible\" for the sentence to be found constitutionally proportionate to the crime. And last, Phon argues that his sentence is prohibited by Kentucky's Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the Court of Appeals' opinion in part and hold that LWOP for juveniles is not constitutionally prohibited when the sentencing procedures comply with the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Specifically, there must be an adequate opportunity for the judge or jury sentencing the offender to consider the offender's youth and background to determine whether LWOP is appropriate, given the circumstances of the crime. We hold that there is no specific fact-finding required before imposing LWOP in these cases and Phon's sentence was not unconstitutionally disproportionate to his crime. Additionally, we hold that the Kentucky Constitution does not prohibit juveniles from being sentenced to LWOP under a discretionary, thorough sentencing procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Eighth Amendment of the Federal Constitution does not prevent the discretionary imposition of LWOP as to juveniles.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Phon first argues that his sentence is already prohibited by the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, pursuant to precedent from the United States Supreme Court. Relevant to his argument are two integral cases:\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Louisiana.\n   </em>\n   Based on the language of those cases, however, we hold that the United States Supreme Court has limited its absolute prohibition to\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   LWOP sentences for juveniles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    a)\n    <em>\n     Miller v.

In contrast to these mandatory schemes, Phon had an extensive sentencing hearing. He presented multiple witnesses to present a case of mitigation. His attorneys expressed the\n   limits of his judgment due to his younger age. His family members explained his harsh upbringing. All of these factors were presented to the jury. That jury had an opportunity to consider his age and his \"youthful\" characteristics. The Constitution guarantees an opportunity for the sentencer to\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   these characteristics; it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   require that the sentencer accept those characteristics as worthy of mitigating an LWOP sentence. As such, Phon's sentencing did not violate the Eighth Amendment of the federal Constitution as interpreted under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2. This court is unwilling to extend the protections of the Eighth Amendment beyond existing precedent.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As we have concluded that the Supreme Court's precedent does not hold that discretionary LWOP sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment, we must now determine whether the protections of the Eighth Amendment should be extended to ban such sentences under all circumstances. In many ways, we acknowledge that this discussion is highly theoretical as applied in Kentucky. As both the parties in this case recognize, only two prisoners are serving LWOP sentences in Kentucky for crimes committed as juveniles. Phon is one of those offenders. This Court has recognized that the legislature's statutes have limited the harshest sentence for capital offenses committed while the offender is a juvenile to LWOP 25.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS 640.040 ;\n   <em>\n    Shepherd v.

LWOP is not a permissible sentence for such offenders like Phon under our statutory scheme. However, that statutory scheme is always subject to change. As such, it is still important, both for the instant case and for the constitutional precedent of this Court, to understand whether such a sentence is even constitutionally permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"The Eighth Amendment, in only three words, imposes the constitutional limitation upon punishments: they cannot be 'cruel and unusual.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rhodes v.

Phon was at least sixteen years old, if not seventeen years old as the Commonwealth argued, at the time of the offense. He was over eighteen years of age by the time he was sentenced by a jury. The facts in the\n   <em>\n    Workman\n   </em>\n   case, while deplorable and inhumane, left a live victim. Here Phon not only took the lives of two innocent victims, but left a child victim, a witness to her own parents' execution. The cases are distinguishable and lead to us to the conclusion that a juvenile LWOP sentence is, at times, constitutionally permissible. Once again, while we hold to the logic of\n   <em>\n    Workman\n   </em>\n   for that particular case, we are unwilling to say that the issuance of an LWOP sentence is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional given the seriousness of the crime.

In his latest RCr 11.42 and CR 60.02 motion to the circuit court, Phon argued that KRS 640.040(1) limits available punishments for capital crimes committed by juveniles to LWOP 25. He also argued he did not expressly waive his statutory protections under the juvenile code to allow LWOP as a potential sentence. The circuit court denied the motions and held KRS 640.040(1) was a permissive listing of sentences rather than a limitation to LWOP 25. When Phon appealed to the Court of Appeals, he cited to this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Shepherd v.

Although the focus for so many collateral attacks is the defendant's timely or untimely action, with an illegal sentence, the focus is instead on the judiciary's involvement. For this doctrinal reason, the timeliness issue is not one of rewarding a defendant for an appeal that is lacking in form or punctuality. Instead, it is about preventing the judiciary from overstepping its bounds and legislating through inaction or, in the trial court's case, action. When a trial court sentences a defendant outside lawful confines, it has overstepped into the arena of legislative action. When an appellate court chooses not to correct that unlawful order, even if it is not brought to the attention of the Court until many years later, it becomes complicit in that breach of the confines of the judiciary power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The General Assembly has decided LWOP is an inappropriate sentence for juveniles. Under our ruling in\n   <em>\n    Shepherd,\n   </em>\n   this Court has acknowledged that statutory directive. That legislative statement was the same at the time of Phon's sentence. Thus, to override the legislative directive and impose an unlawful sentence would violate the separation of powers doctrine. This the Court cannot do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The question arises as to what is the effect of the original unlawful sentence and what must be done to correct it.

This case is one of great import and we understand the need for finality for both the victims left behind and the defendant. Thus, we carefully measure our response\n   and holding here today. We hold that LWOP for juveniles does not always offend the federal or Kentucky constitutions, so long as it comports with a discretionary scheme and the defendant has a meaningful opportunity for the jury to consider mitigating evidence. We hold that Phon's sentencing was constitutionally permissible. However, under our more recent rulings regarding penalties allowable under the juvenile code, we hold that Phon's sentence was statutorily prohibited. As such, we must remand for the trial court to impose the lawful sentence of LWOP 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Cunningham, Hughes, Keller, Venters and Wright, JJ., and Kline and Thacker, S.JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Thacker, S.J. concurs by separate opinion, which Kline, S.J. joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Minton, C.J. and VanMeter, J., not sitting.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    There is some dispute as to whether Phon was sixteen or seventeen years old at the time of the crimes.

In this case, that means asking whether a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for a 16-year-old who murdered a mother and father and attempted to murder their twelve-year-old-daughter involves methods of punishment that had been considered \"cruel and unusual\" in the United States in 1791 or in Kentucky in 1891.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Framed in this light, the constitutional\n   issues raised by Phon are easily dispensed with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   To instead follow the current majority of the U.S. Supreme Court in presuming to discern and apply \"evolving standards of decency\" or \"a moral consensus\" in cases such as this is, in my view, a mistake-regardless of the result.
