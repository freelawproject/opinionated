J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOO\">The action is brought to recover the purchase price of a car load of lumber shipped by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to the defendant. The receipt of the lumber is confessed, and the price agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>to be paid therefor. A question raised as to the exact amount of lumber delivered is not material to the controversy, as it will hereafter appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The main contention arises over the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for damages sustained by the failure of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to furnish two other car loads of lumber according to a prior contract. These two car loads had been ordered early in 1905. While the original contract was oral, it was afterwards reaffirmed in the letters sufficiently to avoid the defense of the statute of frauds. Upon this contract the plaintiff\u2019s assignor made default, by failing to deliver the cars according to its terms. It is claimed in plaintiff\u2019s behalf that this default was waived by the correspondence of December <em>22 </em>and 26, 1905, between the parties; that the time to deliver the said lumber was extended by stipulation, so as to wipe out any cause of action which the defendant might have had against plaintiff\u2019s assignor prior to that time. Upon this assumption it is claimed that the defendant\u2019s default in failing to pay for the car load of lumber furnished at Syracuse, and for which this suit is brought, relieved the plaintiff\u2019s assignor from the performance of its contract to deliver the two cars under the original contract as thus modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">At the time of these letters referred to, plaintiff\u2019s assignor was in default, and was liable to the defendant for the damage that had been suffered by the defendant by reason of that default. If the letters of December 22d and 26th can be deemed to be a waiver of the default, a fair interpretation must construe that waiver as conditional upon the subsequent execution of the contract and delivery of the cars in pursuance therewith. It has always been adjudicated that a plea of an accord without satisfaction is no bar to an action for damages. Under this principle of law the unexecuted agreement of plaintiff\u2019s assignor to furnish four cars by his letter of December 22d cannot operate as a satisfaction of the defendant\u2019s claim for damage for the default of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor in failing to furnish the two cars under the prior contract. Upon the final refusal of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to furnish those two cars, defendant, therefore, had a cause of action for damages for the breach of the original contract, which was properly counterclaimed in this action against the price of the car of lumber actually delivered. We have considered the other questions raised by the appeal, and find no cause for the reversal of the judgment and order. Judgment and order should, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.
