The answer admits the payment of $45 to the plaintiffs, and denies all the other allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">The plaintiffs proved that they sold a piano to one \u201cHerman Keller,\u201d and that \u201cHerman Keller\u201d had given a chattel mortgage upon the piano. They also proved that the piano was delivered to \u201cHerman Keller.\u201d The court below dismissed the complaint, upon the ground that the \u201cHerman Keller\u201d to whom the piano was sold was not identified as Herman Keller, the defendant. We think that this ruling was unduly strict. The identity of name of the defendant and the person to whom the piano was sold, and who executed a mortgage upon it, together with identity of residence, which was shown, and the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>that the defendant in his- answer admitted that he had paid $45 on account to the plaintiffs, presumptively established the identity of the defendant. The plaintiffs proved a prima facie case, and it was error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
