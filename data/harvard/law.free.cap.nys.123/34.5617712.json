The complaint alleges that the defendant sold and delivered the cattle for $2,402.51, but does not allege that the sale was for cash, or that the. defendant ever received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the proceeds of the sale. Although the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute- a cause of action, no motion to dismiss the complaint on this ground was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The evidence offered was that of an interested witness and was not clear or free from contradiction. The only evidence of a conversion consisted of an alleged admission made by the defendant to the plaintiff. Even if we assume that the proof coming from an interested witness established a prima facie case, it was error to direct a verdict for the plaintiff, in view of the defendant\u2019s request to go to the jury upon the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
