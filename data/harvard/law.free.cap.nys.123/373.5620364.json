Under the agreement the plaintiff was to feed the horse. The horse was stolen. The relation existing between the plaintiff and the defendant was that of bailor and bailee for mutual benefit. The defendant\u2019s duty as bailee merely required him to exercise ordinary care, and .he was not liable for the loss of the horse, in the absence of proof that the loss was occasioned by his negligence or wrongful act.
