The issue thus joined was adjourned for trial. Upon the day set for trial the defendant defaulted, and the plaintiff gave testimony in support of his cause of action, and was awarded a judgment for the sum of $439.33 damages, $2 costs, and $15 \u201callowance,\u201d which was taxed by the clerk. The plaintiff thereafter moved for a review of taxation, claiming that he was entitled to the sum of $30 costs, instead of $15. This motion was denied, and the plaintiff appeals from the judgment as rendered, and asks that the same be modified by granting him an allowance of $30 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">Section 332, subd. 2, of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, c. 580) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-12\">\u201cWhere after- the trial of an issue of fact raised by appearance and answer of defendant, plaintiff recovers judgment for * * * four hundred dollars \u2022or over, thirty dollars\u201d as costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Subdivision 3 of the same section declares that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-14\">\u201cWlhere upon nonappearance or failure of the defendant to answer plaintiff recovers judgment for * * * four hundred dollars or over, fifteen dollars\u201d as costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">The plaintiff herein under the foregoing provisions was clearly entitled to $30 costs.
