The subscribing witnesses died before the testator, and therefore it was sought to establish the will under section 2620 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by \u201cproof of the handwriting of the testator, and of the subscribing witnesses, and also of such other circumstances, as would be sufficient to prove the will upon the trial of an action.\u201d After a hearing upon the petition, the learned surrogate found that the instrument was signed by the testator, at the end thereof, in the presence of James Howard and George M. Fleischer, the subscribing witnesses thereto, and was also signed at the end thereof by the said James Howard and George M. Fleischer; that the said Howard and Fleischer died before the testator; that the body of the said .instrument, and the name Eliza Battanchon subscribed thereto, are in the genuine handwriting of the deceased; that the names James Howard and George M. Fleischer, subscribed thereto, are in the genuine handwriting of said James Howard and George M. Fleischer; and thereupon concluded that the instrument was properly executed, and is genuine and valid as a will of real and personal property and in conformity with the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-15\">The evidence is sufficient to justify the findings of fact, but I think that the facts do not justify the conclusion of law because there was not sufficient proof of \u201csuch other circumstances.\u201d The fact that the will is a holograph does not except it from the terms of the statutory requirements of execution. Although there is less strictness in the case of a holographic will, it must appear that there was some sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>stantial compliance with the prescribed formalities of publication. Matter of Turell, 166 N. Y. 330, 336, 59 N. E. 910; Matter of Beckett, 103 N. Y. 167, 174, 8 N. E. 506; Matter of Moore, 109 App. Div. 762, 765, 96 N. Y. Supp. 729, affirmed 187 N. Y. 573, 80 N. E. 1114. This relaxation is permitted because the holographic character of an instrument shows that a testator understood the character and contents of it; and hence \u201cthe primary and principal purpose\u201d of publication \u201cis nearly secured.\u201d Matter of Beckett, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">The question under section 2620 of the Code is whether upon the whole evidence a jury might infer such compliance. Matter of Briggs, 47 App. Div. 47, 50, 62 N. Y. Supp. 294. There is no full and formal attestation clause. After the subscription by the testator there is written, \u201cSworn and described before me this 5th day of June, 1900, G. M. Fleischer, Notary Public, County of Richmond. In presence of G. M. Fleischer, James Howard,\u201d and the notarial seal is attached. It appears that the notary public was a dealer in furniture. It may be that \u201cdescribed\u201d was intended for \u201csubscribed,\u201d but, if not,, that word does not fulfill the' requirements of a formal attestation clause. It is true that such a clause was not essential. And G. M. Fleischer and James Howard must be regarded as subscribing witnesses, for the legend \u201cIn the presence of\u201d is a statement of function of such a witness. Prof. Wigmore, in his work on Evidence, writes that \u201cthe statement of attestation need not be expressly written in full. The placing of the signature implies an assertion of execution.\u201d Sections 1509 and 1512. See, too, Losee v. Losee, 2 Hill, 612, and Ela v. Edwards, 16 Gray (Mass.) 91; Eliot v. Eliot, 10 Allen (Mass.) 357. But the absence of a full and formal attestation clause makes against the proponent. In Jackson v. Jackson, 39 N. Y. 159, the court, per Woodruff, J., say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-6\">\u201cAs a memorandum of what occurred, and as a means of securing the at tention of the witnesses to the fact that all required formalities have been observed, it is very desirable that it should be full and precise in its details. Sometimes, when the witnesses are dead, it may be of great importance as presumptive evidence of due execution. But the attestation clause is no part of the will, and is not required as a part of its due execution by any law. Chaffee v. Baptist Miss. Ass\u2019n, 10 Paige, 85 [40 Am. Dec. 225]; Leaycraft v. Simmons, 3 Bradf. Sur. 35; Jackson v. Christman, 4 Wend. 282.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">See, too, Matter of Cottrell, 95 N. Y. 329; Rider v. Legg, 51 Barb. 260; Everitt v. Everitt, 41 Barb. 385; Matter of Briggs, supra. In Matter of Abel, 136 App. Div. 788, 121 N. Y. Supp. 452, we have said, per Carr, J., that the existence of such a clause is a circumstance that permits a very strong inference of execution, and our courts in cases-somewhat similar to this at bar have laid stress upon the existence thereof. In Matter of Hesdra, 119 N. Y. 617, 23 N. E. 557, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-8\">\u201cThis section received a practical construction in Brown v. Clark, 77 N. Y. 369, Matter of Pepoon, 91 N. Y. 255, and Matter of Cottrell, 95 N. Y. 329, and was held to mean, in accordance with prior decisions cited, that the proof of circumstances bearing upon the question of the authenticity of the will in connection with a regular attestation clause duly executed were, if sufficient to satisfy the court of its genuineness, all that was required to sustain the probate of a will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>See, too, authorities, supra; Brown v. Clark, 77 N. Y. 369; Matter of Pepoon, 91 N. Y. 255; Matter of Kellum, 52 N. Y. 517. Outside of the proof of the handwritings, the' only further proof is that the testator, in her home, and in the absence of her husband, conversed with her friend Perrand \u201cwith reference to a will,\u201d but the time is not told, the details of the conversation are not given, and it does not appear that the will referred to was that of the testator. The sole devisee and legatee is the husband of the testator, and, in the event of his decease, the mother of the testator, while it does not appear that the testator had any other natural objects for her provision nearer than her sisters. These circumstances make .for the proponents. Matter of Hesdra, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">\u25a0 To affirm this order, we must, hold that a jury would be warranted in finding the publication of a holographic will without a formal attestation clause, when the handwriting of the testator and of the subscribing witness was established, and there was proof that the testator at some time in the absence of the sole devisee and legatee spoke to a friend with reference to a will, and the inference could be drawn that the will made a natural and reasonable disposition of the testa- \u2022 tor\u2019s estate. Examination of other judgments in this state wherein similar questions arose and were disposed of fails to show any case where so informal a document upon such paucity of proof was held to be established under this statute or similar statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">The order is reversed, with costs, and a new hearing is ordered before the surrogate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
