The answer is a general denial, and pleads that the defendant had a lien for $44 upon the goods. The plaintiffs sold to one Adler certain household furniture, which Adler stored with the defendant, who was engaged in the storage warehouse business. Adler paid the storage charges up to October 6, 1907. The plaintiffs demanded the goods of the defendant on November 7, 1908. The plaintiffs originally sold the goods to Adler subject to a chattel mortgage which gave them the right to possession upon any default upon the part of Adler.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The defenda\u00f1t claims a lien upon the goods by virtue of subdivision <em>\u201cb\u201d </em>of section 113 of the general business law (Laws 1909, c. <em>25 </em>[Consol. Laws, c. 20]). This statute provides that a warehouseman's lien may be enforced \u201cagainst all goods belonging to others which have been deposited at any time, by the person who is liable as debtor for the claims in regard to which the lien is asserted, if such person had been so intrusted with the possession of the goods that a pledge of the same by him at the time of the deposit to one who took the goods in good faith for value would have been valid.\u201d Adler, who deposited the goods with the defendant, was not such a person as is included within the provisions of the statute giving to warehousemen a lien upon goods deposited with them. Adler\u2019s possession of the goods was not such that a pledge of them by him would have been valid, even if the pledgee took the goods in good faith for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">The goods were subject to a mortgage, and under the mortgage the title to the goods was in the plaintiffs. Baumann v. Post, 12 N. Y. Supp. 213; Hazlett v. Hamilton Storage &amp; Warehouse Co., 47 Misc. Rep. 660, 94 N. Y. Supp. 580; Leadbetter v. Leadbetter, 125 N. Y. 290, 26 N. E. 265, 21 Am. St. Rep. 738. The filing of the mortgage was constructive notice to the defendant that the title to the goods was in the plaintiffs. Baumann v. Post, supra. Adler had no power to subject the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the goods to a prior lien by any contract which he made with the defendant, and the statute upon which the defendant relies gives him no lien as against the claim of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment should be reversed; and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
