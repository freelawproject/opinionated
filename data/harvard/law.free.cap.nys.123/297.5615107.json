The statute relating to mechanics\u2019 liens defines the words \u201cmaterialman\u201d and \u201ccontractor.\u201d If we transpose the order in which these definitions appear therein, it may assist in understanding it. The term materialman \u201cmeans any person <em>other than a contractor </em>who furnishes material\u201d for the improvement of real property. This would indicate that a person who furnishes material may, under certain circumstances, be a contractor. The term contractor \u201cmeans a person who. enters into a contract with the owner of real property for the improvement thereof.\u201d Therefore, if the. person who furnishes material also agrees with the owner of real property to use that particular material in the erection of - any structure upon it, he ceases to be simply'a materialman, and becomes a contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">We do riot claim that this exhaustively points out the difference between these two classes, but it is sufficient for the purposes of this case. De Long and the Brooklyn Builders\u2019 Supply Company were therefore materialmen, and Robins was a contractor. As De Long\u2019s lien was prior in point of time to that of the Brooklyn Builders\u2019 Supply Company, he is entitled to the surplus money as against it; and because he is a materialman, and not a contractor, he has a preference over Robins, notwithstanding Robins\u2019 lien was prior in point of time to his.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b334-17\">THOMAS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axl\">(dissenting). Egan, owner, for the purpose of improving his premises by building thereon five houses, made a contract in writing with defendant Robins to furnish and to install the plumbing material. In priority of time this is concededly the first lien. De Long submitted a written proposal, accepted by Egan, \u201cto furnish you material enumerated below, for the five two-story brick houses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>being erected by you on the north side of Forty-First street east of Fourteenth avenue, Brooklyn, according to plans.\u201d Thereupon follow descriptions of materials, identified by names, sizes, and to a large extent adaptation and proposed locations, and a gross sum in payment is stipulated; and then is added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201cWe will not ask you to make separate payments for each house, but as the work progresses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The proposal was submitted after necessary examination of the plans, but not the specifications. The Brooklyn Builders\u2019 Supply Company furnished brick, lath, and similar materials, by sending same from day to day at quoted prices. The plans were not consulted by it. The referee and court decided that Robins\u2019 lien was deferred to the others, as he was a contractor, and that De Long\u2019s lien was preferred to that of the Supply Company, as it was not based on a contract for the improvement of the property, and was prior in time to that of the Supply Company, whose status was otherwise similar to it. Robins and the Supply Company appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The essential question is whether De Long entered into a contract for the improvement of the property. If he did, his lien is subject to the lien of the Supply Company. The question involves a critical study of an obscure statute. Why does Robins\u2019 lien rest on contract for improvement, and De Long\u2019s not? The similarities and dissimilarities may be traced. Both are in the form of written proposals accepted. Both stipulate for furnishing enumerated materials for specified houses. Both describe the materials in part, identify them by names and sizes, and to some extent state or indicate their location in the house. Both agreements provide for payment as the work progresses. The De Long contract in addition provides for \u201cpayments to be made per house as follows.\u201d Both vendors were informed by the plans. The single mentionable dissimilarity is that Robins agreed to install his material. Therefore the inquiry is narrowed to this: Does such a contract for supplying, without installing, materials for houses, leave De Long merely a preferred materialman, or does it reduce his lien to the priority of a mere contractor?</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The lien law (section 56, c. 38, Laws 1909 [Consol. Laws, c. 33]) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201cWhen a laborer or a material man shall perform labor or furnish materials for an improvement of real property for which he is entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien, the amount due to him shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of such property under any judgment rendered pursuant to this article, in the order of priority of his lien, before any part of such proceeds is paid to a contractor or a subcontractor.\u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">To understand better this section, the statutory definitions of \u201ccontractor,\u201d \u201cmaterial man,\u201d and \u201cimprovement\u201d must be in mind. The lien law (section 2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201cContractor. The term \u2018contractor,\u2019 when used in this chapter, means a person who enters into a contract with the owner of real property for the improvement thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201cMaterial man. The term \u2018material man,\u2019 when used in this chapter, means any person, other than a contractor, who furnished material for such improvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u201cThe word \u2018improvement\u2019 when so used includes the erection, alteration or repair of any structure, upon, connected with or beneath the surface of any real property and any work done upon such property, or materials furnished for its permanent improvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">So it is learned that a contractor is \u201ca person who enters into a contract with the owner of real property for the improvement thereof.\u201d Improvement in legal meaning equals also \u201cmaterials furnished for its permanent improvement.\u201d Therefore a person \u201cwho enters into a contract with the owner of real property\u201d for furnishing materials for its perznanent improvement is a contractor under the statute. By such definition De Long was a contractor. It cannot be'that labor supplied is the essential of the contz-act; for, as seen, \u201cerection, alteration or repair of any structure upon * * * and any work done upon such property\u201d is an improvement, \u201cor materials furnished for it's permanent improvement\u201d is such improvement. Why exclude the words as to materials, expressly disjoined by \u201cor\u201d from words that describe acts that involve labor alone, or labor joined to furnishing materials? A. may contract to erect, alter, or repair a structure, furnishing or not furnishing the material, or to do any work thereon, or to furnish materials therefor, and in either case he contracts for the improvement thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Of course, if what De Long furnished was not for the improvement of the property, he would have no lien, and when he specifically contracts to furnish the material for the houses he becomes a contractor. He looked-over the plans. He contracted in effect to sell to the owner for the erection of the houses material needed therefor, of specified description, \u201call for the sum of\u201d $540. It is not a case of giving prices, as did the Supply Company, and leaving the owner to take when he wills, and in such quantities as he wills, or not at all if he so wills, but an absolute undertaking to furnish materials for specified houses \u201cbeing erected,\u201d at a stated sum to be paid \u201cas the work progresses.\u201d Every person who agrees to work on a building, or to furnish material to be used in such building, makes a contract for the work or material. But he does not necessarily undertake the improvement of the building in whole or in part. He does not assume the burden of furnishing the material for its construction. He may aid indefinitely. Here De Long definitely undertakes t'o aid specified buildings by definite terms specifically related to the erection of the houses, and his payments are measured in time by the progress of the building, to which progress he has agreed to contribute. .The work in a measure depends upon his promised participation in it\u2019. Certainly he could not by his default defeat such progress and still demand absolute payment. He conditioned his payment by its interdependence with the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The preferred class is dissociated from such relation and resultant responsibility. In Herrmann &amp; Grace v. City of New York, 130 App. Div. 531, 114 N. Y. Supp. 1107, the American Radiator Company was .considered a materialman, as it furnished radiators to a company that had contracted to furnish and install radiators. Hedden Construction Company v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., 62 Misc. Rep. 129, 114 N. Y. Supp. 1103, presents the case of a company selling lumber to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>contractor. The company knew the destination of the material, and probably upon whose contract it was supplied. In neither case was there any privity with the building undertaking or with the owner. The order of liens is as follows: First, the Brooklyn Builders\u2019 Supply Company; second, defendant George Robins; third, Albert W. De Long.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The order of September 14, 1909, should be affirmed; the order of October 6, 1909, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the Brooklyn Builders\u2019 Supply Company against the respondent; and the moneys directed to be applied first to payment of lien of the Brooklyn Builders\u2019 Supply Company, and the balance to apply on the lien of George Robins.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
