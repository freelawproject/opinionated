A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>motion was subsequently made to restore the case to the calendar, which motion having been denied, the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Appellate Division in the Second Department, in Phillips v. Tietjen, 108 App. Div. 9, 95 N. Y. Supp. 469, held, upon a review of the cases, that the court had no power, of its own motion and under such circumstances, to change the place of trial of a transitory action. This was followed in the same department by Schober v. Fifth Avenue Coach Co., 110 App. Div. 921, 96 N. Y. Supp. 1145. In this department we have applied the same rule to actions in the Municipal Court (Matter of North American Mercantile Agency Co., 124 App. Div. 657, 109 N. Y. Supp. 165), where we granted a mandamus to compel the clerk of a Municipal Court to issue a summons from said court, which had been refused upon the ground that the defendant did not reside in the district. This was followed in the Matter of Nitchie, 125 App. Div. 378, 109 N. Y. Supp. 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Supreme Court is a court of general jurisdiction, extending over the whole state. In transitory actions parties have a right to lay the venue in any county and there have the issues disposed of, if they so desire. The privilege of removal, which is given to the defendant, may be waived, and if so waived the court of- its own motion may not refuse to try the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and motion to restore to the trial calendar granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
