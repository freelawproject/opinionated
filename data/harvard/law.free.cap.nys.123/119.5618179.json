The action was commenced on June 23, 1909. The defendant pleads the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">The plaintiff contends that a payment of $12, made in November, 1905, was sufficient to take any of the items included in the account out of the statute of limitations. The trial judge apparently adopted this view. This was error. This was not a mutual, open, and current account, provided for by section 386 of the Code of Civil Procedure. There was no evidence of reciprocal demands^ between the parties. There must be items on both sides, other than cash payments. Lowenthal v. Resnick, 110 N. Y. Supp. 1045; Elwood v. Hughes, 109 N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Y. Supp. 25. Therefore the items of plaintiff\u2019s claim prior to June 23, 1903, must be excluded from plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\">Several small items were delivered to the American Express Company, to be transported to the defendant. The defendant contends that this is not a good delivery. Where there is no agreement as to the delivery, whether the delivery to a common carrier is sufficient becomes <em>a </em>question of fact, and the judge below decided that fact in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">There are no other exceptions that require consideration. The judge of the Municipal Court, sitting without a jury, has determined the issues in favor of the plaintiff, and the evidence was sufficient to sustain his 'finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The judgment should be modified, by deducting therefrom the sum of $57.25, with interest on $24.50 from October 20, 1902, on $25.25 from January 19, 1903, and on $7.50 from June 9, 1903, making a total of $81.45, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to either party as against the other. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
