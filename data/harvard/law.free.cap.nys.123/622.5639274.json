It is true that the mortgage provides that a receiver may be appointed, without regard to the value of the premises, \u201con five days\u2019 notice to the party of the first part, her heirs or assigns\u201d; but it does not appear that such notice has been given. The case is much like Jarmulowsky v. Rosenbloom, 125 App. Div. 542, 109 N. Y. Supp. 968, wherein a similar order was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-17\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with leave to renew upon further papers. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
