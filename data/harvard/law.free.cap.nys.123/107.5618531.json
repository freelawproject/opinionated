As the present plaintiff, who was' defendant in replevin, was not indemnified against damages suffered, expenses incurred for counsel cannot be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In addition to this vital point, the only claim of the defendant in replevin against the plaintiff therein would be for the return of the chattel or its value. In the case at bar, however, the defendant in replevin has undertaken to assign to the plaintiff at bar \u201call my right, title, and interest in and to a certain undertaking in replevin, * * * together with full right to institute any and all actions for the recovery of damages by me sustained under said undertaking -in replevin to the extent of $250.\u201d The cause of action cannot be split up in this manner, and recovery had in an action, unless all claimants are joined therein. McLean v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 56 Misc. Rep. 623, 107 N. Y. Supp. 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
