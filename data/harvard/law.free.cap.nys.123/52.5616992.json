The defendant Williams pleaded that he was induced to make the check through false representations made by the defendant Falk. The learned court below excluded evidence tending to establish that the check was given as a result of false representations. The exclusion of this evidence was error, as was also the act of the court in directing a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, who was the only witness in support of her improbable claim. Engle v.
