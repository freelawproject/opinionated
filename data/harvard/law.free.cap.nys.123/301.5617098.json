J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALyq\">No question of fact is in dispute. The judgment, recovered by a servant against his employer, is for personal injuries; and it violates the primary principle of the law of negligence that a recovery may not be had against the master for injury occasioned by a fellow servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-20\">The plaintiff at the time he was hurt was sweeping the defendant\u2019s dock under a bridge connecting two of the defendant\u2019s buildings. The bridge is 15 or 16 feet high. At the time another of the defendant\u2019s employes was wheeling a barrow loaded with iron cogwheels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>over the bridge from one building to the other, and he negligently-permitted one of the wheels to fall from the barrow, striking the plaintiff and inflicting the injuries complained of. The learned counsel for the plaintiff seeks to support the judgment by the statement in his brief that the person wheeling the barrow \u201cwas in the employ of the defendant, in its machine shop in the upper floors within the building, while the plaintiff was performing manual labor as a sweeper on the docks of the defendant, and they were therefore not fellow servants.\u201d They were fellow servants.
