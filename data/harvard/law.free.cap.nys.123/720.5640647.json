Malone was the original owner of the fee of a portion of the premises involved in this controversy, and he claims an interest in the award upon the ground that his title, as owner of the fee, is superior to that of the claimant, Rourke, who claims under a certain tax deed from Edward Wemple, Comptroller of the State of New York, to Lelia E. Marsh, dated November 2, 1888, and recorded July 17, 1890, and by the said Lelia E. Marsh and husband to Lillian V. Kerrin, now Lillian V. Rourke. The real controversy depends upon the validity of this tax deed. It is conceded that the premises in question were occupied in 1884, and that this occupation continued from that time down to the date when the city of New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>acquired the land in 1902; that no written notice under the tax law was served upon any of the persons in possession after the grantees under the tax deeds acquired title, and for these reasons the learned justice presiding at Special Term held that the claimant, Rourlce, never gained any absolute title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">On this appeal the claimant, Rourlce, urges that the evidence in this case establishes that the persons who occupied the premises from 1884 to 1902 were tenants at will, Under the definitions set forth in Larned v. Hudson, 60 N. Y. 102, and Wissel v. Ott, 34 App. Div. 159, 54 N. Y. Supp. 605, and that such persons, being such tenants at will, were not such occupants of the premises as were contemplated by the ^provisions of chapter 427 of the Laws of 1855. Section 68 of the chapter cited provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\u201cWhenever any lot or separate tract of land sold for taxes by the comptroller, and conveyed as hereinbefore provided, shall, at the time of the expiration of the two years given for the redemption thereof, or any .part thereof, be in the actual occupancy of any person, the grantee to whom the same shall have 'been conveyed, or the person claiming under him, shall serve a written notice on the person occupying such land, within two years from the expiration of said time to redeem,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The position of the appellant seems to be that the persons who were occupying this land as tenants at will of the grantee were not entitled to the written notice, because that would in effect be the grantee serving notice on himself. The difficulty with this proposition is that it ignores the statute. The statute says that, if any part of the premises \u201cbe in the actual occupancy of any person,\u201d the grantee must give the written notice to such occupant in order to perfect his title. It does not make any exception of tenants at will, or of any other class of occupants; the mere fact that there are occupants of the premises calls for notice to them, and without such notice there can be no validity to the tax deed. People v. Ladew, 189 N. Y. 355, 82 N. E. 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">A tenancy at will is an estate in land (section, 30, Real Property Law, Consol. Laws, c. 50), and such an estate entitles the holder of it to at least 30 days\u2019 notice to remove from the same (section 228, Real Property Law). Such an estate has value to its holder. He has an interest in the premises, which cannot be taken away from him, even by the owner, without written notice; and we see no reason for holding that the act of 1855, with its amendments, did not contemplate a notice to tenants at will, as well as to any other kind of tenants or occupants of lands sold for taxes. This defect arising from the failure to give the notice required by the statute inures to the benefit of any person interested in the land (Lucas v. McEnerna, 19 Hun, 14), and the owner of the fee, whose title is attempted to be taken from him, is certainly entitled to urge a defect in the title of the claimant Rourlce. We are clearly of the opinion that as between these claimants the order is proper, and that it should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">The state of New York, through its counsel, has intervened in a brief, and urges that it has some interest in this controversy, in that it held title to the premises under subsequent tax deeds, and conveyed the same to the claimant, Rourke, without divesting itself of the right to the damages awarded in the original proceeding; the title, it is claimed, being in the state at the time the city of New York took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>premises. There is, however, the same difficulty here which prevailed in the case of the claimant, Rourke: The lands were concetiedly occupied at the times when these subsequent tax deeds were made, and there is nothing in the record to show that the notices required by law were ever given to the occupants. The alleged title in the state of New York is, therefore, no better than that which the claimant, Rourke, asserted, and it would appear to have no interest whatever in this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
