The verdict of a jury in determining disputed issues of fact intelligently should not be disturbed. The verdict of $183.07 in this case, however, is inexplicable on any possible hypothesis in regard to the evidence, or on any valid mathematical ground. Under these circumstances, the conclusion is inevitable that it must have been reached by some arbitrary computation, rather than by intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-16\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant-to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
