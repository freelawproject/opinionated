Where a demurrer is interposed and disallowed the court must grant leave to plead, or if the court deems it well founded it must permit the pleading to be amended, and if the party fail so to amend the defective pleading must be disregarded. Section 145 of the 'Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, c. 580)-. I'he ruling of the court upon the demurrer may be considered on an appeal from the judgment. The difficulty in the way of the appellant in. this case is that when his demurrer was disallowed he did not plead over, and therefore the court took an inquest, so that this appeal does not lie, because it is from a default judgment. Goldman v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 129 App. Div. 657,114 N. Y. Supp. 182. I think that the remedy of this\u2018appellant is found in section 253 of the Municipal Court act, for an appeal lies from an order made or denied thereunder, save that no appeal lies in the first instance from an order opening a default and vacating a judgment entered thereon. Section 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">I think that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The return shows that the pleadings were oral, and that the plaintiff complained of the defendant as follows: \u201cGoods sold and delivered.\u201d While the Municipal Court act permits an oral or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>written complaint (section' 145), the requirement of section 149 is in terms applicable to either kind of pleading. _ That section requires that the complaint must state in a plain and direct manner the facts constituting the1 cause of action. A., complaining of B. thus, \u201cGoods sold and delivered,\u201d manifestly does not state the fact's constituting his cause of action. The mere fact that A. has sold and delivered goods-to B. does not afford A. a right of action against B. The cause of action arises when B. has not performed on his part\u2014when there is a breach of the contract by him. Tracy v. Tracy, 59 Hun, at page 6, <em>12 </em>N. Y. Supp. 665. There must have been some wrong on the part\u2019 of B.\u2014some refusal or neglect of his obligation in the premises to A. \u201cA party must recover, not only by his proof, but upon his allegations. The facts stated must constitute a cause of action, and they must be in evidence. It is not enough that they stand upon proof, unless that proof is preceded by statement.\u201d Clark v. Post, 113 N. Y., at page 27, 20 N. E. 576. \u201cEvery fact which the plaintiff must prove to enable him to maintain his suit, and which the defendant has a right to controvert in his answer, must be distinctly averred or stated.\u201d Allen v. Patterson, 7 N. Y., at page 478, 57 Am. Dec. 542. There can be no question that a demurrer may be pleaded to an oral complaint; for section 145 specifies demurrer as among the pleadings that may be written or oral. Section 158 permits in express terms a demurrer to the complaint, and subdivision 2 of section 145 requires a written demurrer when the complaint is written, thus in effect recognizing that a demurrer lies t'o an oral complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The appeal is dismissed, with costs. All concur, except that RICH,, J., votes that the dismissal be without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
