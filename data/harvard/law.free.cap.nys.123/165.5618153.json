The defendant claims, however, that the trial justice found in his favor on the counterclaim, and offs\u00e9t the judgment on the counterclaim against the sum allowed to plaintiff on his cause of action. We need not consider whether in any event a judgment for defendant on the counterclaim could be sustained, because the return fails to show such a judgment, and we cannot go beyond the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs ' to appellant to abide the event.
