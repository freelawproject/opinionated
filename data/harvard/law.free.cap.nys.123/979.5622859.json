It appears from the affidavit of defendant\u2019s counsel that he was not notified until the afternoon of December 27th, that the case had been set down for trial on the 28th, and that it was impossible for him to then properly prepare for trial on the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>day. The affidavit of merits discloses a good defense, if established, and the defendant has evidently acted in good faith throughout. The motion to open the default should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
