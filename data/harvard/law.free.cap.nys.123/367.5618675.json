This was manifest error. The record was relevant under the pleadings, and if the record showed that the same issues were litigated in that proceeding it was a bar to this proceeding, unless the landlord could show that the condition of the premises had since changed and that the actual eviction from a part of the premises had ceased. The landlord\u2019s contention that, because the former proceeding was for installments of rent due for August and this for rent from October 15th to November 1st, therefore the cause of action is not the same', is not sound. The cause of action in both proceedings was the default in payment of an installment of the rent reserved in a written lease. The former adjudication was that the rent reserved under this lease was suspended by reason of an actual eviction from a part of the premises. Hamilton v. Graybill, 18 Misc. Rep. 521, 43 N. Y. Supp. 1079. So long as this partial eviction continued the final order of the court in the former proceeding was a bar to the further litigation of the issues determined therein. Having come to the conclusion that the order appealed from should be reversed for the foregoing reason, we have not examined, nor do we express any opinion upon, any other phase of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The final order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
