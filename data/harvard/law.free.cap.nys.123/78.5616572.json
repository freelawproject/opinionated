The defendant pleaded as a counterclaim that payment was made on behalf of the plaintiff to creditors of the latter in excess of the amount of the note, and demanded judgment for $127, the alleged amount of the payments^ in excess of the amount of the note. The defendant, who had resting upon him the burden of proof, testified that such payments were made with the consent of the plaintiff and her husband. This testimony was directly contradicted by the plaintiff and her husband. The only question submitted to the jury was this issue of fact. No exception was taken to the charge of the court, and the only question of importance presented by. this appeal is whether effect is to be given to a stipulation, which was signed by the attorneys fof the defendant, but which the record does not show was formally offered in evidence and marked as an exhibit in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In corroboration of his claim the defendant attempted to prove by creditors of the plaintiff the debts which were due them which he had paid. This testimony was objected to, on the ground that it was contrary to the stipulation of the defendant, and the record shows that the stipulation was handed to the court. This stipulation, which was signed by the attorneys for the defendant, provides that the defendant will not prove or attempt to prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">\"That any indebtedness existed, in favor of the various persons to whom said payments were made, against the plaintiff, or the nature of such indebtedness, or, if any indebtedness existed, how the same was created, or that a cause of action existed of any nature or description in favor of the said persons to whom payments were made against the plaintiff in this action.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">After some discussion as to whether the testimony offered should be received, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">\u201cThat is the very thing you stipulated you would not attempt to prove on this trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">To this remark the defendant\u2019s counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">\u201cAll right; if that is objected to, I will leave that out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Defendant\u2019s counsel then called another witness, and, after asking him his name, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-12\">\u201cI will say this, your honor: That all our witnesses will similarly testify to the fact that those were goods sold by them and delivered to the place of business of Fannie Guziek, and that the amount in question as set forth in the bill of particulars was paid by Ressler for these goods, and that the amount in question represents goods sold to Fannie Guziek. If your, honor-is going to make the same ruling, why I might just as well save the trouble of calling these different people. However, I will make the offer of this proof, and, in view of the stipulation, I presume your honor will hold that we are not permitted to prove that.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">The court indicated that it would so rule, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">It is now very earnestly urged that the learned court below erred in giving effect to this stipulation. It is true that the record does not show that it was formally offered in evidence and. marked as an exhibit. It does appear, however, that it was handed to the court, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>it was considered by the court, and that no objection was made to its consideration. Indeed, the counsel for the defendant seemed to recognize that it was properly before the court, and it was treated by him as if it had been formally marked in evid\u00e9nce. When the evidence he offered was first objected to as contrary to the stipulation, he treated the stipulation as binding upon defendant when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">\u25a0 \u201cAll right; if that is objected to, I will leave that out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Later he recognized that as the stipulation was before the court, and as the court had ruled that effect should be given it, it would be useless to offer other evidence which was contrary to its terms. His own statement, made after his offer of proof, that, \u201cin view of the stipulation, I presume your honor will hold that we are not permitted to prove that,\u201d shows conclusively that the case was tried upon the theory that the stipulation was before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">While the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the ruling refusing the proof that was offered, it is significant that neither before nor after this ruling did counsel for the defendant even question the propriety of receiving the stipulation, or claim that it was not properly before the court. In view of the attitude of the court and counsel for both parties toward this stipulation, we think it would be stretching technicality to the border of absurdity to reverse this judgment solely because, the stenographer did not mark this stipulation as an exhibit in the case. In fact, it was such an exhibit, and was so treated by all concerned in the trial. The stipulation in the record is sufficiently identified as the stipulation referred to in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
