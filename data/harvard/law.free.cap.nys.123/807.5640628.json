At .the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to produce evidence to sustain a cause of action. The plaintiff appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-19\">The plaintiff, in support of his cause of action, introduced in evidence without qualification a notice to stop payment on the plaintiff\u2019s check. This notice was a printed form, filled in by the plaintiff, and was dated on the 1st day of November, the same date which appears upon the check, though it is claimed that the check was written and delivered on the 31st day of October, 1909. This blank, which is about the size of an ordinary check, had the following\u2018words printed upon it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-20\">\u201cIn receiving the above stop payment notice, it is agreed that this bank will use all due diligence, but will not be held liable in any event.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-21\">But, in addition to these words, there was a written memorandum, evidently by the bank officers, saying, \u201cReceived Nov. 5, \u201909,\u201d and on the upper left-hand corner there was a like memorandum, \u201cPd, report by M. Bank mth 4,\u201d and the indorsement on the check, which is likewise in evidence without objection or limitation, shows that the check was paid by the Metropolitan Bank on the 3d day of November, which would be in harmony with the memorandum that it was reported on the 4th of the month by the M. Bank. It thus appears from the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence that, while the stop payment notice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>dated Nov. 1, it was not received by the Public Bank until the 5th of that month, while the payment was made by way of the Metropolitan Bank on the 4th. The rule is that, if a party uses books of account or other papers against his adversary, he makes them evidence for him on the same subject. They are like any declaration or admission by writing or orally. If part is used, the whole relating to the same matter is admissible (Pendleton v. Weed, 17 N. Y. 72, 76; Dewey v. Hotchkiss, 30 N. Y. 497, 501), and, being in the case, they must be given force. Passing over the disclaimer of responsibility on the part of the bank, which was a part of the stop payment notice, as well as one of the regulations printed in the defendant\u2019s pass book delivered to the plaintiff, there was evidence in the case to establish that the notice was not given to the bank until the 5th day of November, 1909, at least one day after its payment by the defendant, and this, of course, justified a dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
