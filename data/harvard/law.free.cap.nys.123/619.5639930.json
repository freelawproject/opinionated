Gleason from an. order denying her motion that the commissioners of estimate and assessment appointed in this proceeding be authorized to ascertain and determine the compensation which should be made to her by reason of the discontinuance and closing of Kingsbridge Road between Prospect Avenue and Southern Boulevard.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">It appears that on November 2, 1895, the commissioner of street improvement of the Twenty-Third and Twenty-Fourth wards of the city of New York caused to be filed certain legally adopted and approved maps showing the lines and grades of streets and avenues, which maps were thereafter in all respects ratified, confirmed, and approved by chapter 712 of the Laws of 1896. Upon these maps Kingsbridge Road, from Prospect Avenue to Southern Boulevard, was shown as-discontinued. The Southern Boulevard, an old and traveled street, was \u00e9ontinued. On said November 2, 1895, the appellant was the-owner of a piece or parcel of land fronting on said Kingsbridge Road. Being the owner of the lot at the time the street was legally dosed, she was entitled to such damage as might result to her property in consequence of such closing, providing she took the necessary steps to-assert her claim. This she failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">Section 5, c. 1006, Laws 1895, providing for the ascertainment of damages suffered by reason of the closing of streets, requires that a person claiming to have been damaged must within six years after the filing of a map closing a street present to the chief financial officer or comptroller of the city a written statement or claim for compensation,, failing which he is \u201cforever barred from claiming compensation for such closing or discontinuance.\u201d The appellant did not file such a claim within six years, and is therefore barred to now claim compensation. Matter of the Mayor, etc., Walton Ave., 131 App. Div. 714, 116 N. Y. Supp. 471, affirmed 90 N. E. 59. Some time after the closing of the street appellant conveyed the property to one Dowd, and he, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>those claiming under him, did file claims within the statutory period. The appellant, however, cannot take any advantage from these claims, for they were not asserted in her right, but in antagonism to any claim by her. Nor can she now claim to ratify them, and thus gain an advantage from them, because those who filed them did not do <em>so </em>as her agents or in her behalf. It is not apparent how any one claiming under appellant by a deed subsequent to the closing of the street can successfully assert a claim to damages done to the property while in appellant\u2019s ownership; but that question, although argued on some of the briefs, is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the respondent the city of New York. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
