Upon subsequent delivery of the casks to plaintiff, they were found practically empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">On the trial plaintiff called its secretary, who testified to the market value of the cognac as $8 per gallon and the wine as $6 per gallon. On cross-examination defendant\u2019s counsel asked witness a number of\u2019 questions as t'o the prices paid by plaintiff for the articles in question, when purchased some 3% years previous to the time of trial. These questions were excluded, and an exception taken by defendant. \u201cWhere, in an action to recover damages for-the conversion of property, the plaintiff attempts to establish the value of the property converted by his own mere opinion, it is competent to show on cross-examination the price actually paid for the property converted on two business sales made prior to the commencement of the action. For the purpose of proving that the plaintiff in his testimony has overestimated the value of the property, it is competent to show the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>of other articles included in the same purchase, as a test of the estimated value of the property converted.\u201d Wells v. Kelsey, 37 N. Y. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">It is claimed by plaintiff that evidence of the cost of the property in-question is inadmissible, because the purchase was made at too remote-a date. In view of the fact that the property had remained in storage,, where it could not seriously alter in quality, and that plaintiff\u2019s witness testified that there was no material change in the value of such merchandise from the time of the purchase to the time of the alleged conversion, I am of the opinion that the time of purchase was not too-remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Defendant also sought by proper questions on cross-examination to impeach plaintiff\u2019s witness by showing that', subsequent to the storage of the goods with defendant, the witness had sworn to a value of 70 cents per gallon for the cognac, as compared with a valuation of $8-per gallon as testified to on the trial. These questions were excluded,, and an exception taken. The exclusion of the evidence was erroneous and, in view of the fact that plaintiff\u2019s only witness as to value based \"his estimate of value upon prices charged by plaintiff to the wholesale trade, after payment of duty, bottling, labeling, and packing in cases, and that there was no evidence that such merchandise was dealt in by any other importers than the plaintiff in this city, the effect of such ruling was to practically permit plaintiff, or plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9,. to fix his own values on the merchandise, and to exclude all inquiry as to the accuracy of such valuation. While the evidence of cost price would not be conclusive as against the plaintiff, it at least would be some evidence of the value of the articles in question. See Hoffman v. Conner, 76 N. Y. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to value appears also to have been based on an entirely erroneous theory. Plaintiff was entitled to have the goods-returned to it in the condition in which they were stored with defendant, in barrels; and, if a conversion was proven, the plaintiff would be-entitled to recover the market value of the goods in the form in which they were stored with defendant, not the value of such goods after payment of duty, bottling, labeling, and packing in cases. That this method of valuation was erroneous is proven by the fact that plaintiff\u2019s witness stated that for the cognac, which he estimated to be-worth $8 per gallon, \u201cit is $5 per gallon in the bonded warehouse, not figuring on the duty.\u201d There was not sufficient evidence in the case-as to the market value of the goods in the form in which they were-left with defendant to form the basis of a verdict in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">For the reasons above given, the judgment should be reversed, and' a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event... All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
