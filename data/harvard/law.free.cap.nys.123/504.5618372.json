The action is for damages for false arrest and imprisonment. The defendant is one of the coroners of the city of New York, and the arrest of which plaintiff complains was upon a warrant issued by defendant, as coroner, as the result of an investigation conducted by him as to the probable cause of the death of one Alice C. D. Kinnan.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">A coroner is, in certain classes of cases, a magistrate, with power to hold examinations, issue warrants, and commit or discharge a person suspected of crime (People v. Jackson, 191 N. Y. 293-297, 84 N. E. 65, 15 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1173), and the Code of Criminal Procedure, in force when plaintiff was arrested, provided when and under what circumstances it was the duty of a coroner to issue such a warrant. Being an officer of limited and restricted jurisdiction, it was proper for defendant to specifically plead, both in justification and in mitigation of damages, the facts leading up to the issue of the warrant, and which defendant considers that it will be necessary to prove in order to establish the validity of the warrant and the right of the defendant to issue it. This the defendant has attempted to do in the portions of the answer which have been stricken out. The order appealed from strikes out in toto three separate defenses of the character above described. Practically the only ground on which it is sought to sustain this order is that the matters stricken out are insufficient as defenses. This is wholly untenable. An order to strike out as redundant is not a substitute or alternative for a demurrer, and it is too well settled to justify further discussion here that an entire defense, even though it be insufficient in law, cannot be stricken out as irrelevant, redundant, or scandalous. Stroock Plush Co. v. Talcott, 129 App. Div. 14-18, 113 N. Y. Supp. 214; Tierney v. Helvetia-Swiss Fire Ins. Co., 129 App. Div. 694, 114 N. Y. Supp. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">The fifth separate defense, being a plea in mitigation of damages, is ordered to be made more definite and certain \u201cby being properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>defined and entitled\u201d; the apparent objection to it being that it is termed\" \u201ca fifth and further answer,\u201d instead of \u201cdefense.\u201d This was a perfectly obvious clerical error, which could by no possibility prejudice or mislead the plaintiff, and constituted too trivial a defect in the pleading to justify an appeal to the court to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The order contains an unusual and quite unauthorized direction as to costs. The defendant is \u201cpermitted\u201d to serve an amended answer, omitting the matter stricken out by the order appealed from, and to pay plaintiff\u2019s taxable costs to date, and in default of so doing the whole answer is stricken out. While permissive in form, tnis provision is coercive in effect, and amounts to the imposition upon plaintiff of all the costs of the action as costs upon the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
