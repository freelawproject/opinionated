Action upon the claim was brought originally by Vanderveer, as agent of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company of London, against this defendant, who demurred that the plaintiff had not legal capacity to sue. The demurrer was sustained, and the plaintiff was permitted to amend his complaint upon payment of costs. The amendment made was to strike out the name of Vanderveer as agent of this plaintiff, so that the compa\u00f1y itself appeared as plaintiff. And a complaint changed mutatis mutandis was served. A motion was thereupon made to dismiss the complaint because no summons was served with it, as this was substantially a new action. We think that the defendant\u2019s contention is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-17\">We are inclined to the view that a summons in the Municipal Court may be amended. Section 20, Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580), and section 723, Code Civ. Proc. But the situation is that there is but a summons entitled in one action and a complaint without a summons in another action, which has gone to the judgment under review. The law in this case is that the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, the present plaintiff, is not the same p\u00e9rson as Edward B. Vanderveer as agent of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company of London, for the demurrer that Vanderveer had not legal capacity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>.\u25a0sue was sustained. A new party can be added only by amendment of the summons. Walkenshaw v. Perzel, 32 How. Prac. 310; Follower v. Laughlin, 12 Abb. Prac. 105; Baylies on Code Pleading and Practice, 486. While it is true that a mistake in suing a defendant in a representative capacity may be corrected by omitting the words descriptive thereof (Boyd v. U. S. Mortgage &amp; Trust Co., 187 N. Y. 262, 79 N. E. 999, 9 L. R. A. [N. S.] 399, 116 Am. St. Rep. 599), the rule seems different in the case of a plaintiff who when he \u201cbrings an action has the knowledge in himself as to the capacity in which he .should sue.\u201d Bowen v. Ph\u0153nix Bridge Co., 134 App. Div. 22, 118 N. Y. Supp. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed and new trial ordered, with \u25a0costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
