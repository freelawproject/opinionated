The interest directed to be sold is the judgr ment debtor\u2019s interest in and to the remainder of two separate trusts, created by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">The appellant contends that one of the \"remainders is contingent, and therefore not the subject of sale. We are cited to no statute or rule of law which prevents the sale of a remainder interest, whether vested or contingent, and the statute expressly provides that an expectant estate is descendible, devisable, and alienable, in the same manner as an estate in possession. Section 59 of the real property law (chapter 50 of the Consolidated Laws). It is unnecessary, therefore, to pass upon the question argued by the appellant. Whatever interest the judgment debtor has will be acquired by the purchaser at the sale. That may be an expectancy, which will never ripen into an estate in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
