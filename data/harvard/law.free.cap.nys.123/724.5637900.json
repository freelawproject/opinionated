Defendant admitted that he had taken the dogs into the street with him, and that when he discovered that they had not followed him home he followed them up, to find them worrying, the cat. The defendant seems to have done all that a humane person could do under the circumstances to save animal life. But the undisputed evidence is that he took his dogs into the- street unmuzzled and unleashed, and that the dogs caught sight of the cat and pursued it, even into plaintiff\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-20\">The judgment/against the defendant for the value of the cat should \u2022 be affirmed, for the defendant had taken his dogs into the public street of the city of New York, unmuzzled and not led, against a city ordinance that was read in evidence, and therefore there was evidence of his negligence, shown by his violation of the ordinance. And, moreover, the dogs, thus let loose in the.public street, had chased the cat into the premises of the plaintiff, where they killed it. Under such conditions, proof of scienter was not essential.

The dogs were unlawfully in the place where the injury was done, and the liability arises from that circumstance. Decker v. Gammon, 44 Me. 322, 69 Am. Dec. 99; Van Leuven v. Lyke, 1 N. Y. 515, 49 Am. Dec. 346<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The judgment for pl\u00e1intiff on the first trial was reversed, and a new trial was ordered, costs to abide the event. This disposition was authorized by Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580) \u00a7 345. When plaintiff prevailed upon the new trial, she was entitled to tax the costs of the appeal (Davis v. Reflex Camera Co., 114 App. Div. 814, 100 N. Y. Supp. 172), and those costs were properly the sum of $30.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
