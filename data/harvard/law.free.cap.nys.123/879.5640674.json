The defendant broke its contract. The display was not held. The crowd that had collected melted away, and the plaintiff could not distribute its special edition printed in Hungarian to the crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">The trial justice correctly charged the jury that, regardless of the amount of the consideration paid by the plaintiff for the defendant\u2019s undertaking, it is entitled to recover all damages resulting from its \"breach within the contemplation of the parties. The items of damage shown on the trial fall into three classes\u2014the cost of preparing and -advertising the display amounted to $161; the cost of preparing the special edition was $235.80; the loss on advertising contracts was $300, or a total of $696.80. As far as this record shows, the plaintiff \u25a0claims that a clever .advertising scheme has been rendered abortive by the defendant\u2019s breach of contract. Accurate proof of the value \u25a0of the advertising which it would have derived if the scheme had not failed is impossible, but, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, proof of the expenses of the plaintiff in preparing and advertising the display and preparing the special edition was properly admitted and these expenses form a proper element of damages.' The loss of profit on the contracts for advertising to be inserted in the special cedition was not a proper element of damages. These contracts were dependent upon the display and the special edition. The cost of preparation was necessary to procure these contracts, and the price of these contracts would, if received, have reduced this cost to the plaintiff. The plaintiff on proper proof would be entitled to damages for the value of the display as an advertising scheme and also to the profits on the special edition, but it would not be entitled to the costs incurred in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>preparation of the display and the special edition and to the profits of the edition without deducting the cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff stipulates to reduce the judgment to the sum of $398.80 and costs, and, if so reduced, the judgment should be affirmed, without costs upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">GIEGERICH, J., concurs. GOEF, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
