So far as it is sought to compel the inclusion of photographic copies of certain checks, no good reason is shown why their reproduction in that form will be of any more value in the determination of the appeal than copies made in the usual manner. It is obvious, however, upon examination of the case as now made up, that testimony and exhibits have been omitted which are essential to a proper review of the judgment. The following proposed amendments are therefore allowed: Nos. 12, 29, 31, 135, 139, 206, 335, 339, 365, 378, 380, 382, 387, 388, 395, 396, 401, 402, 405, 414, 420, 426, 433, 434, 435, 438, .439, so much of 445 as shows that the purchase and sale book for October 13, 1902, was deemed to be called to the attention of the court, 446, 449, 450, 456, 457, 465, 466, 470, 471, 523, 524, 528, 531, ' 537, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 568%, 572, 577, 581, 751, 753, 834, 836 to 847, inclusive, 856, 857, 866, 868, 870, 872, 873, 874, 878, 882, and so much of 879 as calls for the printing, in full of the following ledger accounts: Albert Ulmann; B. &amp; O. acct.; Albert Ulmann, Regular; R. Ulmann; William M. Fleitman, Special; A. W. Sulzbacher; A. W. Sulzbacher, Special; C. J. Ludman; William Sulzbacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellant, and the motion for a resettlement of the plaintiff\u2019s proposed case on appeal granted, to the extent heretofore indicated, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
