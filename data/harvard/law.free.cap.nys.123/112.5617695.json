For this he received a loan of $50 in the form of her check, dated October 20, 1909. He cashed the check in -company with one Seiff, a loan broker, who received $12 commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-20\">Plaintiff testifies that he bought the note for $50, about December 5th, 6th, or 7th. The defense is usury. Plaintiff claims to have met Minnie Hoffman quite casually at the bank, and to have then bought the note. He admits that he had had some previous business with Seiff, the broker. At the conclusion of the testimony, namely, of the rebuttal (there being no entry in the minutes, either that both sides rested, \u25a0or that plaintiff finally rested), plaintiff asked to be allowed a nonsuit. The judge.refused this, on the theory that the case, under section 248 of the Municipal Court act (Daws 1902, c. 580), had already been \u201csubmitted\u201d to him, and thereupon gave judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-21\">If the refusal to allow the nonsuit was correct, the judge was warranted in believing that the plaintiff was not an innocent holder for value, but was in connivance with Minnie Hoffman and Seiff, thus making the note usurious. The authorities do not define the word \u201csubmitted,\u201d so far as it may refer to a judge sitting without a jury. One case, at least, indicates that it means after the judge has reserved his decision and taken the case under advisement; the court significantly adding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>that while the case \u201cis under advisement\u201d the judge should not consult with either of the parties. Hess v. Beekman, 11 Johns. 457. See, also, Gillilan v. Spratt, 3 Daly, 440; Peters v. Diossy, 3 E. D. Smith, 115; Elwell v. McQueen, 10 Wend. 520, 521; 14 Cyc. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In view of the condition of the record at bar, it cannot fairly be said, under any interpretation, that the \u201caction has been finally submitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Therefore the judgment is reversed, with costs of the appeal to the plaintiff, and the complaint dismissed, without prejudice to a new action, with $5 costs to defendant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
