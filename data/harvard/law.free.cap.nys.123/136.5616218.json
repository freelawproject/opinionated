Y. Supp. 132. This action is to recover penalties for the operation of five cars under the Eighth Avenue Railroad Company\u2019s franchise, which was conferred by a grant reserving to the common council the right to fix a license fee for each car and obligating incorporators of the railway company to pay the same. With respect to the operation by this defendant of cars under the Eighth Avenue franchise, it was recently held by this court (City of New York v. N. Y. City Ry. Co., 126 App. Div. 42, 110 N. Y. Supp. 913) that the defendant was liable for the license fees prescribed by the ordinance enacted pursuant to the reservation contained in the grant, and the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on our opinion (193 N. Y. 679, 87 N. E. 1117).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">It follows, therefore, on the authority of the opinion in action No. 1, that the determination of the Appellate Term and the judgment of the Municipal Court should be reversed, with costs to the appellant, and the complaint should be\" dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
