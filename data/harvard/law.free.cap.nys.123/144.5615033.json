The adjuster on behalf of plaintiff notified defendant thereof immediately. Formal proof of loss was filed November 3, 1909. Two-thirds of the claim was for goods totally destroyed, and one-third for partial damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-26\">D\u00e9fendant did not demand an appraisal until in a letter dated December 24, but postmarked December 27, 1909; i. e., 55 days after proof of loss, and 72 days after the fire. Plaintiff refused to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>upon an appraisal. Defendant\u2019s chief adjuster called at the premises within a week after the fire, saw everything, and had a full talk with plaintiff, who stated that the goods totally destroyed had been thrown out; and the adjuster noticed their absence. An assistant adjuster paid a similar visit during the same period. They both told plaintiff that his claim was excessive. Plaintiff\u2019s adjuster testified that defendant\u2019s \u201closs clerk\u201d had told him that there would be \u201cnothing doing\u201d until the claim was very much reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Defendant introduced in evidence, over plaintiff\u2019s valid objection, an anonymous postal card, received by it two days after the fire, intimating that there was something suspicious about it. Plaintiff gave proof of the \u201csound\u201d and \"damaged value\u201d of the goods destroyed. At the close of the whole case, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint (evidently intended to be equivalent to the direction of a verdict in favor of the defendant), and remarked to plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">\u201cNow go back, and take your appraisal, and get your damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The policy provides, in substance, that the loss is payable within 60 days after proof of loss is filed, unless an appraisal be had in the meantime, in which event it becomes payable within 60 days after the determination of the appraisers. While it is true that it might be said that under the strict terms of these provisions the insurer may wait 59 days before demanding an appraisal, and need not then pay the loss until 60 days after the' determination of the appraisers, that would scarcely be a fair interpretation of the contract unless in exceptional circumstances. The truer construction would seem to be that the insurer \u201chas a reasonable period, depending upon the facts of the particular case,\u201d to demand an appraisal. Chainless Cycle Co. v. Security Ins. Co., 169 N. Y. 304, 310, 62 N. E. 392. When, as in \u2018the case at bar, the substantial facts are not in dispute, reasonableness of time is a matter for the court to determine. Wright v. Bank of Metropolis, 110 N. Y. 237, 249, 18 N. E. 79, 1 L. R. A. 289, 6 Am. St. Rep. 356; Hedges v. H. R. R. Co., 49 N. Y. 223, 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Under the circumstances of the case at bar, the company\u2019s delay was palpably unreasonable, and should have been so held by the court. At the very least the plaintiff was entitled to the submission to the jury of all the facts, under proper instructions from the court, in order to determine whether the defendant had not waived its right to have an appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u201cEither party, however, has a right to require an appraisal, when there is a disagreement as to the amount of loss. Silver v. Western Assurance Co., 164 N. Y. 381, 58 N. E. 284. That right is not indefinite as to time, but must bo exercised within a reasonable period, depending upon the facts of the particular case. Neither party can so use the right as to take undue advantage of the other, but both must act in good faith. Uhrig v. Williamsburgh City Fire Ins. Co., 101 N. Y. 362, 4 N. E. 745; Bishop v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 130 N. Y. 488, 29 N. E. 844. It is not a weapon of attack, but of defense, and a party who intends to use it must give reasonable notice of such intention; for its omission to do so will be evidence of waiver, more or less conclusive according to the circumstances. * * * It was in the power of the defendant to waive an appraisal, either expressly, or by not making a seasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>demand therefor; and the main question that we are called upon to decide is whether there was any evidence to warrant the jury in finding a waiver.\u201d Chainless Cycle Co. v. Security Ins. Co. of New Haven, 169 N. Y. 304, 311, 312, 62 N. E. 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">It was also a question for the jury whether the demand for an appraisal was made in good faith; because, if not, that would either be a circumstance bearing on the alleged waiver, or it would in itself absolve the plaintiff from his obligation to enter upon an appraisal. Uhrig v. Williamsburgh City F. Ins. Co., 101 N. Y. 362, 366, 4 N. E. 745; Bishop v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 130 N. Y. 488, 494, 29 N. E. 844; Chainless Cycle Co. v. Security Ins. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
