Reversed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>The appellants Strong, Carlisle, and Turney were judgment creditors of the Binghamton Hydraulic Power Company, and recovered judgments, and also Seymour and Whitlock, composing the firm of Seymour &amp; Whitlock, were like judgment creditors of the power company, and were restrained by the temporary injunction, and the interlocutory decree makes that temporary injunction permanent. The interlocutory judgment makes provision for the plaintiffs\u2019 daim, and for the costs and disbursements, and for an additional allowance, should one thereafter be granted. It also contains provisions protecting and providing for the payment of the other creditors, including these appellants. The interlocutory judgment that was entered upon the report of the referee, to hear and determine, appointed Hon. W. B. Edwards referee, to take proof of claims of creditors who had not already proved their claims. The referee died November 23, 1893.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b673-5\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

Y. Supp. 652), and have, according to the views expressed in our opinion, reached the conclusion that the order should be reversed in that case, we think the same views should be applied to the appeal in this case, and that the portions of the order appealed from should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The portions of the order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
