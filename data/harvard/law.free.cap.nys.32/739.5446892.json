J.):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-11\">\u201cThe plaintiff was employed as surveyor by the proper officers of the city, to make the necessary maps which were required in two proceedings for the opening of Railroad avenue and Barbey street. His compensation was fixed by the ordinances of the city. In other words, the plaintiff did not agree to do his work on a speculative or contingent fee. If the contention of the counsel for the city is correct, no competent surveyor would perform such work for the city, for he would be compelled to take the chances of the receipt of compensation for his services. The plaintiff performed his work and delivered his maps to the corporation counsel. Subsequently the common council passed resolutions which rescinded their prior action. I am of opinion that the power is in that body so to do, under the general welfare clause of the charter, and for the reason that the title of the city in the new street does not vest until the confirmation of the assessment for the improvement. Laws 1888, p. 1085, tit 19, \u00a7 31. The original proceedings may be defective or without jurisdiction, or it may appear that the common council made a mistake in their determination of the necessity of opening the street. Section 6 of title 19 of the charter in no way prevents a recovery in these actions. The latter clause of the section was originally passed in 1859 (chapter 213, \u00a7 6), and has been construed by the court of appeals in Sage v. City of Brooklyn, 89 N. Y. 189, 201. Chief Judge Andrews there said: \u2018If, however, it is construed as relating simply to the expense of regulating streets, to which it was confined in the original act from which it was taken (chapter 213, Laws 1859), or is intended only to declare the general principle that the expense of street openings shall be a local and not a general charge, it is not subject to criticism.\u2019 Section 12 of title 19 has no application to the cases before me, for the reason that no report can ever be confirmed. That section would seem only to require that the expenses should be taxed by the supreme court, in order to protect the property owners against excessive or illegal charges for searcher\u2019s or surveyor\u2019s fees. The plaintiff only seeks to recover his fees as fixed by the ordinances. Judgment for plaintiff on demurrer in each case, with leave to defendant to answer on the usual terms.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b755-12\">Argued before VAN WYCK and OSBORNE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b755-13\">Albert G.

The contention of appellant is that the city is specially exempted from all liability for any expense incurred in opening streets (Id. \u00a7 6), and that plaintiff must look to the lien of the assessment for such expenses upon the property benefited by the new street (Id. \u00a7 1). It was the manifest intention of the legislature to declare, in these provisions, that the city shall not be primarily liable for any of the expenses incurred for the opening of streets, provided the city pursued the proceedings to completion in duly laying and collecting the assessments therefor. When the city accepts such work after employment, it cannot avoid liability to such surveyor by an appeal to section 6, if it has, by affirmative action, rescinded and discontinued the proceedings, and in this way prevented the possibility of levying and collecting an assessment for such expenses upon the property to be benefited by such street opening. This view seems to us to be fully sustained by the authorities. Payne v. City of Brooklyn, 52 Hun, 390, 5 N. Y. Supp. 281; Weston v. City of Syracuse (Sup.) 31 N. Y. Supp. 186; Reilly v. City of Albany, 112 N. Y. 30-42, 19 N. E. 508; Sage v. City of Brooklyn, 89 N. Y. 189; McCormack v. City of Brooklyn, 108 N. Y. 49, 14 N. E. 808; Donnelly v. City of Brooklyn, 121 N. Y. 9, 24 N.
