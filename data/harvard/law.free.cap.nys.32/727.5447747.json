By one of the agreements defendant agreed to supply an electric current on the premises, which plaintiff agreed to use subject to certain terms, one of which was that defendant should be released from all claims of damages resulting from the electric current, when the wiring and equipments should be approved by the New York Board of Underwriters. The other agreement provided that defendant should wire the premises according to certain specifications. Neither agreement referred to the other. <em>Held, </em>that the subject-matter and terms of the agreements being different, and neither referring to the other, the answer was insufficient in not showing that they should be read as one instrument.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b743-6\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b743-7\">Action by Yellott D.

The agreements bear the same date, but neither of them contain any reference to the other. The contention of the demurrant is that the defendant so unskillfully and negligently did the work called for by the contract marked \u2018Exhibit B\u201d that the premises were set on fire, and completely destroyed, together with the stock then belonging to Joseph Ryan, and that the eighth provision, quoted above as a part of the terms printed on the back of Exhibit A, cannot avail the defendant, because it is an entirely different contract. The ground on which the special term based its decision overruling the demurrer was that the writings Exhibits A and B constitute parts of one transaction, and should therefore be read and construed together as forming parts of one agreement. But this position is confronted with a difficulty which does not seem to have been brought to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>attention of the special term. The subject-matter and terms of the contracts being different, and neither containing any reference to the other, it was necessary that the answer should contain allegations requiring an inference that the agreements should berread and construed together as one instrument. This the pleader did not do. On the contrary, the only inference presumable from the language employed is that there were two distinct agreements, instead of two separate writings constituting one agreement. The demurrer to the counterclaims set up in the seventh paragraph of the answer was, we think, rightly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">So much of the interlocutory judgment as overrules the demurrer to the paragraph designated \u201cFirst\u201d should be reversed, and in all other respects it should be affirmed, with leave to the defendant to amend its answer within 20 days, on payment of the costs of the action; neither party to have costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
