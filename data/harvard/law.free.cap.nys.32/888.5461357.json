The affidavit states that issue had been joined in the action by the service of an answer by the Albany Bank, but it does not state the nature of the defense. It states that the attorneys had been informed that the mortgage was not a bona fide mortgage; that it was not given for a valuable consideration, but</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>made for the purpose of enabling some of the stockholders of the real-estate association to obtain title to the mortgaged property by foreclosure proceedings upon a claim not in existence; but it does not state that such facts were known to the attorney making the affidavit, nor does it state the source of the information. Such an affidavit is fatally defective. Hale v. Rogers, 22 Hun, 21; In re Bronson, 78 Hun, 351, 29 N. Y. Supp. 112.
