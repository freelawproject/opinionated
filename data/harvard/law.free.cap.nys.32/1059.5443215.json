Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1075-12\">This is an action upon a policy insuring the plaintiff against loss and damage by fire on his lease of a building. It provided as follows: \u201cIt is a condition of this insurance that, in case of such destruction by fire of the above-named premises that the lease held by the assured shall be by its terms and in fact canceled, this company shall be liable to pay an amount not exceeding the sum hereby insured.\u201d The lease provided: \u201cAnd it is further agreed between the parties to these presents that, in case the building or buildings erected on these premises hereby leased shall be partially damaged by fire, the same shall be repaired as speedily as possible, at the expense of the party of the first part; that, in case the damages shall be so extensive as to render the building untenantable, the rent shall cease until such time as the building shall be put in complete repair; but, in case of the total destruction of the premises by fire or otherwise, the rent shall be paid up to the time of such destruction, and then and from thenceforth this lease shall come to an end.\u201d The building was six stories in height in front, and five in the rear, with an iron front, and side and rear walls of brick. It was occupied by plaintiff as a furniture store and warehouse. There was some decoration on the walls and ceiling of the first and second floors, where furniture was exhibited, and above that the brick walls were tinted. The plaintiff testified: \u201cIt was used for warerooms up to the fifth and sixth stories, where we had our upholstery department and furnishing rooms; otherwise it was entirely open; there were no divisions.\u201d On November 23, 1892, while the above lease and policy of insurance were in operation, a fire occurred, which caused damage. The roof was entirely gone, the d\u00e9bris therefrom having fallen right down to the foundations. The front wall, constructed of iron, was somewhat heated, and \u201cthat would burn off the bolts' and whatever would attach the iron together.\u201d The ornamental top and cornice were taken down by the firemen. The connecting arches on the fifth and sixth stories were badly damaged. The woodwork, sashes, and glass were gone throughout. The east and west walls both had very large openings in them in the upper parts,\u2014 large enough, as described by one of the witnesses, \u201cto drive a horse and wagon through.\u201d The bricks were badly burned and blackened; the mortar was out in a good many places, and there were many loose bricks, and the surface of others had been burned, taking the face off so that it exposed the interior of the brick. The rear wall was in a worse condition than the side walls. The lintels and sills were broken and scaled off, and the wall itself out of plumb. The entire interior of the building, which consisted, as stated,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1076-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>of six floors, was gone down to the cellar, and there is no Question but that the interior of the building was wholly destroyed. Immediately after the fire plaintiff surrendered his lease and demanded his insurance, which was refused upon the ground, mainly, that there was not a total destruction of the premises.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1076-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

On the other hand, the defendant contended that because the building was worth a large sum, and a considerably smaller sum was expended in restoration, it was not liable because there was not total destruction; and again upon this appeal the defendant insists that the contract of insurance was enforceable only in the event of the \u201ctotal destruction\u201d of the premises, and that upon the evidence no total destruction, within the meaning of the policy, was shown; that the only destruction was to the roof and the interior woodwork; that the foundations and the brick walls at the side and rear remained in place and were in fact used without rebuilding; that the iron front was used, with repairs only at the top; and that as to the lintels and sills only about one-half were replaced. In addition to this summary of the extent of the loss, the strongest showing made by defendant was that the building was restored and put in complete repair at a cost of about one-third of the sound value of the building at the time of the fire. If this last proposition had been so conclusively established as to make it a question of law, it would be difficult to evade the conclusion that the weight of evidence was against the verdict, which, in effect, found that there was a total destruction of the building. But while there can be no question as to what it cost to repair, because the repairs were made and the money paid, there is room for different inferences as to what was the sound value of the building prior to the fire. Three of the four witnesses examined on the part of the defendant did not see the building until after the fire, and the fourth testified that he did not estimate the total value of the building before the fire; and, as to their knowledge of the value of the material destroyed, their testimony in this respect was to some extent weakened upon cross-examination by the fact that as to some of these witnesses they were not speaking of their own knowledge, but based their estimate upon information received from subcontractors and iron men; and against the estimates thus furnished, as to the sound value of the building before the fire as compared with what it cost to restore it, we have other witnesses for the defendant who furnish us a statement of the injury done to the building. They stated that it was necessary, to put on a new roof; to remove the whole interior of the building, with hardly an exception; that the reconstruction began at the ground, and ran up to the roof. The evidence, therefore, proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>that all that was left consisted of the foundation and four standing walls, the latter being more or less injured, according to the version of all the witnesses. Upon the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, we think the court correctly ruled in denying it; but on the ease as it stood when all the evidence was in, upon the defendant\u2019s motion to direct a verdict, a more serious question was presented. As the evidence then stood, was there presented a question of law or one of fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">The appellant insists that the evidence was not open to debatable presumptions or doubtful inferences; that the plaintiff had not made out a case for the enforcement of his contract, and the court should have held as matter of law that there was no total destruction; that all that was shown was untenantability; and that there was no warrant for submitting the question of total destruction as one of fact, under the circumstances of this case, to the jury. On the other hand, the plaintiff insists that it was a question of fact, upon the evidence, as to whether the building, as a building, had ceased to exist by reason of the fire; that, while the standing walls or a structure remained, this is not a \u201cbuilding,\u201d in the ordinary \"acceptation of that term; that within the intent of the lease and of the policy,' when there was a destruction, not of the structure, but of the building as a building, then the loss was one covered by the policy. \u201cActual \u2018total loss,\u2019 as applicable to a building, means, not that its materials were utterly destroyed, but that the building, though part of it remains standing, has lost its identity and specific character as a building, and instead has become a broken mass, or cannot longer properly be designated as a \u2018building.\u2019 Absolute extinction is not meant. \u2018Wholly destroyed\u2019 may be an equivalent expression.\u201d And. Law Dict. 639. \u201cA \u2018total loss\u2019 does not mean an absolute extinction, but only a destruction of a thing in the character in which it is insured. If a building ceases by fire to be such, losing its identity and character as a building, the whole sum insured is due, although the materials may not have been absolutely destroyed.\u201d May, Ins. \u00a7 421a. \u201cA loss is \u2018total,\u2019 within the meaning of the term, when the identity and specific character of the thing insured is destroyed, although there is not an absolute extinction of all its parts.\u201d Wood, Ins. \u00a7 107. \u201cA burned building is a \u2018total loss\u2019 when it ceases for all practical purposes to be a building, although some of its component .elements remain.\u201d Bid. Ins. \u00a7 1375. While we are referred to no decision of our court of appeals, we have, by way of illustration and argument from other states, the cases of Williams v. Insurance Co., 54 Cal. 450, and Huck v. Insurance Co., 127 Mass. 306, in the former of which the court approved a charge to the jury which was in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-6\">\u201cA \u2018total loss\u2019 does not mean an absolute extinction. The question is not whether all the parts and materials composing the building are absolutely or physically destroyed, but whether, after the fire, the thing insured still exists as a building. Although you may find the fact that after the fire a large portion of the four walls was left standing, and some of the ironwork still attached thereto, still, if you find that the fact is that the building has lost its identity and specific character as a building, you may find that the property was totally destroyed, within the meaning of the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>And in the latter case (Huck v. Insurance Co.) Gray, C. J., says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-5\">\u201cOf the building forming the eastern half of the block, the roof and the whole interior, with all the floors and divisions thereof, had fallen, and nothing remained standing but the outer walls and the elevator, constituting a mere shell or ruin, and not a standing building, in any proper sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">While it will be conceded that after the fire there was left a structure, the question is whether such structure constituted a building. Upon the evidence we do not think the court erred in refusing to determine this as a question of law. There was sufficient to go to the jury upon the question of whether the building \u201chad lost its identity and specific character as a building.\u201d If it had, then there was a total destruction, within the meaning and intent of the parties and the policy. It is true there was no evidence to show that there was a total destruction of the component parts and material that made up the building; but there was evidence tending to show a total destruction of the building as a building, and it was this that was the subject-matter of the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">In regard to rulings upon evidence, the defendant, on cross-examination of one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, asked him if the building was totally destroyed, as understood in building. A like question\" was put to one of defendant\u2019s witnesses. The objection to these, calling, as they did, for a conclusion, was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">The only other question arises upon assigned errors in the charge of the court to the jury. Defendant requested the court to charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-9\">\u201cThere is not sufficient evidence as to the value of plaintiff\u2019s lease, as there is no evidence of the estimated cost of repairs which the plaintiff expressly covenanted to make during his term, or of the annual water charges which he agreed to pay, and the jury cannot find a verdict for substantial damages against the defendant\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">This was asked also in another form, whereby the court was requested to charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-11\">\u201cFrom the amount which the plaintiff might save annually in rent under his lease must be deducted the payments which the plaintiff would be required to make under- his lease, and there is no proof as to what such payments would be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-12\">By the terms of the lease, the plaintiff was only obliged to make such repairs as he might deem necessary, and, the evidence showing that the building was in good tenantable condition at the time of the fire, it would be the purest speculation and conjecture to estimate upon what might be the possible, or even probable, repairs that the plaintiff might think necessary to make in the future. It is true that, in addition to this, the lease required the plaintiff to pay the water rates imposed upon the premises, and the amount of these should have been given. But, considering the uses to which the premises were put, we have some knowledge, as the jury undoubtedly possessed, of what the charges fori water rates on such premises would be; and the only evidence as to the value of the lease being that offered by the plaintiff, from which it could be inferred that the unexpired portion of the lease was worth over $30,000, upon which there was an insurance of but $20,000, the fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>ure to present for consideration the amount of water taxes as a proper deduction in estimating the value of the lease cannot have resulted in any injury to th\u00e9 defendant, and, being such a small matter, it should not be available to reverse the judgment, if otherwise right \u201cDe minimis non curat lex.\u201d Upon the main question, as to whether there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury upon the question of total destruction, we think that the learned trial judge was right in submitting it to the jury, and their verdict upon the facts should not be disturbed. Judgment and order accordingly affirmed, with costs. All concur. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
