This plaintiff was then asked, on his direct examination, by his own counsel: ( \u201cWhat, in your opinion, is a fair and reasonable price for the services you rendered?\u201d and to which defendant objected, and his objection was properly sustained. This plaintiff\u2019s unqualified testimony was that the price had been fixed by express agreement, and he had so declared in his complaint, and such inquiry was not made pertinent either by plaintiff\u2019s pleading or proof, and, if such inquiry was pertinent under his pleading, it was precluded by bis proof; defendant came unprepared to meet such an issue; the question was too general, for it permitted of an answer that the price was greater than the one agreed upon and fixed by plaintiffs\u2019 proof and pleading, and no preliminary proof had been given of the witness\u2019 qualification to answer such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 other exceptions are to rulings upon questions asked by their adversary, and to which they objected, but failed to present the grounds of their objection, and are unavailing for purposes of review, as shown by the record in this case. Kuhn v. Novelty Co., 9 Misc. Rep. 54, 29 N. Y. Supp. 73; Myers v. Cohn (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 23 N. Y. Supp. 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The case was properly submitted to the jury, and no exception taken to the judge\u2019s charge. The evidence is sufficient to justify the jury in finding, as they did, that the plaintiffs did not perform any services for the defendant. The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
