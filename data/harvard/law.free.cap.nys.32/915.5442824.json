The question of contributory negligence was correctly disposed of in the same way. The rule laid down in Fenton v. Railroad Co., 126 N. Y. 625, 26 N. E. 967, and Dorman v. Railroad Co., 117 N. Y. 655, 23 N. E. 162, does not help the defendant in the motion for a nonsuit, for in those cases the plaintiff and the driver of the horse car both knew that the plaintiff could cross the car track in safety, and had a right to so assume until it was negatived by the plaintiff\u2019s unexpectedly falling down, when it was too late tolprevent a collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-3\">The exception at folio 282 to the refusal of the court to charge that, if \u201cthe plaintiff emerged from the rear of the Fulton street car when the front of the Third avenue car was within fifteen feet of her, the defendant cannot be held liable because the motorman did not stop the car before the plaintiff was injured,\u201d is not well taken, for he virtually says he had reason to expect some one would emerge from behind that car when it stopped, and that it was his duty to reduce the car to complete control to avoid injuring such person; that he saw it stop when he was 30 feet away, and at once he slowed-up, and his platform companion said he saw her at the rear of the Fulton street car, about to start across the street, when his car was a short block away, and called the motorman\u2019s attention to her danger; and the testimony further shows that the car, at its then speed, could be stopped within 5 feet. The exception at folio 283 is not well taken, for it would have excluded from the consideration of the jury the circumstances that the motorman knew that passengers were expected to emerge from behind the car stopping to let them off at street crossings, and that it was his duty to slow down, to give them a chance to cross over-in front of him, and that in this case he did slow down for such purpose, but neglected to do so sufficiently to save her.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">We do not think the other exceptions require any special notice, and this leaves for our consideration the contention of defendant that the damages, assessed at the sum of $23,000, are so excessive that the jury must have been unduly influenced by prejudice or sympathy. Before the accident, the plaintiff was a healthy and robust married woman, in the prime of life. Now, she has but one leg, one of them having been amputated below the knee, the stump of which has never been completely healed, and is easily inflamed; her arm has an enlargement, which interferes with its ready and full use; her hearing has been impaired, and she endured great suffering and pain. The contrast of her prior with her present condition certainly discloses a great and sad change, for which we do not think the sum awarded does more than compensate her; therefore the verdict herein cannot be disturbed on such ground. The judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
