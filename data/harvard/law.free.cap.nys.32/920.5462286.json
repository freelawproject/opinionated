The answer was a general denial. On the trial it appeared that the present copartnership was not formed until after the making of the contract sued on, and that at the time of making the contract the copartnership consisted of the defendant Charles P. Rogers and one Whitcomb. The case was tried by the court without a jury. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the complaint as against all the defendants except Charles P. Rogers, and at the close of the case he moved for judgment against the defendant Charles P. Rogers, both of which motions were denied by the trial justice, who dismissed the complaint as against all the defendants, to which ruling the plaintiff duly excepted. It was not denied by the defendant Charles P. Rogers that he signed the contract with the plaintiff. He simply denied that the other defendants were his copartners at the time of making the contract. Upon the evidence, the defendant' Charles P. Rogers was, in any event, liable upon the contract. It has been repeatedly held that under section 1205 of the Code a separate judgment was authorized where a separate liability of some of the defendants was established at the trial, although the. cause of action, as alleged in the complaint, was joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>only. Owen v. Connor (City Ct. N. Y.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 352; Stedeker v. Bernard, 102 N. Y. 327, 6 N. E. 791. It follows that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><em>VAN </em>WYCK, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">EHRLICH, C. J. (dissenting). I think that all there is to this action has been disposed of by the trial judge in conformity with the decisions of the general term on the former appeals. These decisions must be taken as establishing the law of the case so far as this court is concerned. 28 N. Y. Supp. 521. I find no error, and judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
