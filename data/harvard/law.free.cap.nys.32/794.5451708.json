This form of denial is expressly authorized by section 500 of the Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is in the exact language of section 149 of the Old Code. In Bank v. O\u2019Rorke, 6 Hun, 18, the answer stated \u201cthat defendant has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of any of the allegations in said complaint contained,\u201d and the order of special term directing judgment for plaintiff, on the ground that this answer was frivolous, was reversed. This case is cited and followed in Bank v. Inman, 51 Hun, 97, 5 N. Y. Supp. 457, where the answer simply contained a \u201cdenial of any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations of the complaint,\u201d and in which Follett, J., says: \u201cA denial of knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an allegation is authorized by section 500 of the Code.\u201d This case is affirmed in 115 N. Y. 650, 21 N. E. 1118, on opinion of the general term. The order herein appealed from, and which directed judgment for plaintiff on the answer as frivolous, must be reversed, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-16\"> Code Civ.
