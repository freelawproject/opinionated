The statement that \u201cno application had been made to any other company for insurance\u201d was admittedly false, and that, being a material statement and untrue under the terms of the defendant\u2019s policy of insurance, vitiated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">It is true that the defendant could waive the forfeiture, but there is nothing in the appeal record which would justify us in saying that there was such a waiver. The provision of the policy concerning waiver of any \u00f3f its terms reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">\u201cNo waiver shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing, signed by the president or vice president and secretary or assistant secretary of the association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Certainly, the waiver claimed by the plaintiff was not in accordance with the provision just mentioned; but she claims that one Donovan, a solicitor for the defendant, knew that another application had been made by the assured to the Mutual Beserve Fund, and rejected; that also one Lord, who was in defendant\u2019s employ as superintendent of agencies, had such knowledge. What his duties and powers were, does not appear. But he appears not to have the power of waiving any of the terms of defendant\u2019s policy. He had no official position in defendant\u2019s company, was merely an agent working for commissions, and could not make a contract for defendant, or waive any of the terms of a contract made by it. Donovan\u2019s position in defendant\u2019s company was much lower and less powerful even than the one held by Lord; and he, so far as the answers made in the assured\u2019s .application are concerned, was the agent of the assured, and not defendant\u2019s agent, and he certainly had no right to waive any of the terms of defendant\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Besides, the alleged waiver, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, was made before the policy was issued. How the terms of a proposed contract can be waived before it is made is something we cannot understand. Perhaps, if persons in defendant\u2019s employ who had the power to wmive defendant\u2019s contracts, or some \u25a0 of the terms thereof, had the knowledge that plaintiff claims Donovan and Lord possessed, viz. \u201cthe rejection of the insured by the Mutual Beserve Fund,\u201d then defendant might be estopped from insisting upon the forfeiture; but that is not the case here, for, as pointed out by us, neither Donovan nor Lord had the power or authority sufficient to create an estoppel or waiver against defendant\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Although, as claimed by appellant\u2019s counsel, this may be a hard case against his client, as a matter of morals, yet we must, for the reasons herein given, affirm the judgment, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">EHBLICH, C. J., concurs. EEWBUBGEB, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
