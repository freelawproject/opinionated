The testator bequeathed .one-fourth of his estate to said James Blakley in trust for the following purposes: (1) To pay the aforesaid judgment; (2) the remainder of the fourth to be invested, and the income therefrom paid to Wood Gibson, Jr., during his life. The executor received from said estate moneys properly applicable to the payment of the judgment, to an amount more than sufficient to pay the same, but the judgment has never been canceled of record. June 25, 18881 James Blakley died, leaving the defendant, his son, Ms only heir and next of Mn, who was duly appointed the administrator of his said estate.

Presumptively the judgment has long since ceased to be a lien on the real estate, or even an enforceable claim against the judgment debtor personally, and a good cause_ of action is set out as against the defendant in his representative capacity. It is insisted that facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant individually are not set forth in the complaint. In considering this question, it must be borne in mind that this action is not against, devisees or legatees, nor is it against one of several next of kin, or of one of several heirs, and many of the facts which are necessary to be alleged in such cases are not necessary to be in this action. In so far as this is a personal action, it is against a sole heir and next of kin, who has received the whole estate of his ancestor, subject to the liability to pay the debts of the ancestor in so far as the defendant has received sufficient assets, and sufficient facts are alleged to constitute a cause of action against the defendant individually. An action may be maintained against a defendant to recover against him personally and as an administrator, in case he is liable in both capacities. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1815. It does not appear on the fade of the complaint that there is a defect of parties defendant. It is not alleged that an administrator with the will annexed or a testamentary trustee for the estate of Wood Gibson, Sr., has been appointed, and, for aught it appears, the estate may have been settled and the trust terminated.
