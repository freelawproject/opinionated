Name: United Electric Light &amp; Power Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-18\">\u201cDate-. Wm. H. Browne, Geni. Mgr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-19\">\u201cAddress: 15 Beekman St., Vanderbilt Bldg.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-20\">The circumstances which led to the execution of this contract are involved in dispute, and there were presented to the trial justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>for Ms determination certain questions of fact in relation thereto, .arising out of the following propositions, viz.: In the first place, the plaintiff claims that the same inured to the benefit of his assignor by reason of an agreement alleged to have been made between said hotel association and plaintiff\u2019s assignor, whereby the latter agreed to publish said memorial volume, and as compensation for such work it (plaintiff\u2019s assignor) was to receive all moneys paid on contracts for the insertion of advertisements in such volume; .and, secondly, the defendant charges that the above contract was procured by false and fraudulent representations, made by an agent \u2022of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to the defendant\u2019s general manager. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence upon the first-mentioned subject consists chiefly \u25a0of conversations which plaintiff testified he had on behalf of Ms assignor with certain members of the executive committee of the hotel association individually, \u201cnot as a body,\u201d the substance of which was that they thought favorably of the witness\u2019 plan to publish the proceedings at the banquet. And in this connection \"he further testified: \u201cQ. \"Who was to pay for it? A. That was more between Mr. Fanning and Mr. Merrifield. He understood that the advertising would pay for it.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to .these matters is contradicted by that of Mr. Simeon Ford, who was :a member of the executive committee of the association at the time of the transaction, and who subsequently became the secretary of the association, and Mr. E. L. Merrifield, the president of the association, both of whom testified that neither the executive committee nor the association made any arrangement with plaintiff\u2019s assignor for the publication of the memorial volume. Plaintiff lays great stress upon the fact that Mr. William J. Fanning, the secretary of the association, gave to the representative of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor a paper writing, bearing date October 6, 1893, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\">\u201cThe Lawrence Publishing Company is authorized to prepare and publish a report of the fifteenth annual banquet of the above association, to be held in January, 1894, and we cheerfully commend said company to all persons interested in this subject as the only persons authorized by said association to report the proceedings of said banquet, and secure advertisement for the same.'\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">And also upon the fact that Mr. Merrifield, the president of the association, gave to the representative of plaintiff\u2019s assignor a paper writing, of which the following is a copy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cContinental Hotel. E. L. Merrifield, Proprietor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cWednesday, 11/9, 1893.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\u201cThe bearer is authorized to solicit advertisements for the Memorial Volume \u2022of the Hotel Association of New York City. Any favors or courtesies shown him will be duly appreciated. E. L. Merrifield.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">These letters, however, are of no possible advantage to the plaintiff, as neither of the officers in question had, under the constitution .and by-laws of the association, any power or authority to bind the association; that power being alone vested in the executive committee, consisting of five members, which, according to the constitution, has \u201cgeneral supervision of the affairs and property of the .association.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Merrifield\u2019s testimony shows that the .association had not entered into any arrangement with the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tiff\u2019s assignor, and that he acted individually, and not for the association, when he signed the letter. He testified, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cThey called to see me in regard to getting up this work, and wanted the sanction of the hotel association. I told them I had no authority to give any sanction, that they would have to see the executive committee, and, if the executive committee approved of it, that would be a different thing; and 1 thought it was a good thing, and something that would please the hotel men, but I gave no authority at all in the matter. * * * They came to me, and wanted a letter in regard to getting advertisements. I said I would give a letter, which might aid them in getting advertisements, which I did, and signed it with my own name individually. I did not mix the hotel people with it, as I had no authority to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">After careful consideration of all the evidence upon this branch of the case, we are satisfied that the trial justice's determination of the facts in regard thereto was amply justified. The evidence in regard to the second subject amply sustains the charge that the contract signed by the defendant was procured by fraud. William H. Browne, the general manager of the defendant, testified that he was induced to sign the contract upon the representation made by a representative of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor that he represented the Hotel Men\u2019s Association, and only them, and that the money was to go to them, to be used to pay their expenses in connection with the banquet. He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201cHe presented a blank form of order. I said, \u2018In order to make this without question, I propose to write on the order that it is for the Hotel Men\u2019s Association.\u2019 He said: T haven\u2019t any objection. It is for them and them only.\u2019 I wrote the order, filled it out, and wrote, \u2018To the Hotel Association of the City of New York.\u2019 I gave it to him. He distinctly said no other party was represented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">He also testified that subsequently, upon hearing that the Hotel Men\u2019s Association had nothing to do with the matter, he refused to have anything to do with it. It is significant that the person who is named as having made the alleged fraudulent representations was not called to the witness stand to deny them. We think that the decision of the trial justice as to the facts was in all respects correct, and we see no reason for disturbing it, in the absence of the elements which are requisite to review such determination (Lynes v. Hickey, 4 Misc. Rep. 522, 24 N. Y. Supp. 731; Weiss v. Strauss [Com. Pl. N. Y.] 14 N. Y. Supp. 776); and that therefore the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
