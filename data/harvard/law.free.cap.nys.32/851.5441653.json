On the 16th of February, 1893, Louis Cohen, as surviving administrator, had a judicial settlement of his accounts in the surrogate\u2019s court, and he was allowed for commissions 8141.59; for moneys disbursed in settling the estate, 8393.40; total, 8534.99. There was left for final distribution among the next of kin 83,840.45, one-third of which \u201481,280.15\u2014was distributed to Louis Cohen and Charles Mayer, as administrators of Margaret Mayer, 81,280.15 to Ellen Convannon, and 81,280.15 to Mary Ryan, the next of kin of the intestate. July 8, 1892, Margaret Mayer died intestate, leaving Charles Mayer, her husband, and Charles Mayer, Jr., their infant son, her only heirs and next of kin. September 30, 1892, letters of administration were granted to Charles Mayer, Sr., and Louis Cohen, on her estate, which amounted to 81,636.35. October 12, 1893, the administrators of Margaret Mayer filed a petition for the judicial settlement of their accounts, and on the same day a citation was issued, returnable October 31, 1893, which was duly served October 21, 1893, on Charles Mayer, Jr., an infant of the age of 11 years. November 3, 1893, Luis James Phelps was duly appointed by the surrogate\u2019s court the special guardian of said infant in said proceedings. On the final accounting Cohen presented the following account against the estate of Margaret Mayer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-14\">\u201cNew York, February 11, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-15\">Administrators of Estate of Margaret Mayer, Dec\u2019d, To Louis Cohen, Coun-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-16\">sellor at Law, 176 Broadway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-17\">To professional services rendered in the matter of Bridget</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-18\">Neary, deceased, as per special contract.....................81,200</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-19\">Or.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-20\">By costs, disbursements, commissions &amp; disbursements in estate of Bridget Neary ....... ................................... 534 99</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-21\">Balance ................................................. 8 665 01</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-22\">\u201cI hereby approve of the foregoing bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-23\"><em>\u201cN. </em>Y., Feb. 11th, 1893.

To support the claim, Cohen called Charles Mayer, who testified: \u201cBy Mr. Cohen: I knew Margaret Mayer. She was related to me. She was my wife. She died July 8, 1892. She left no will. I knew Bridget Neary in her lifetime. She was related to my wife,\u2014her cousin. Bridget Neary died February 8, 1892. She left no last will and testament. I recollect of my wife\u2019s calling at Mr. Cohen\u2019s residence, and consulting with him concerning the affairs of 'the estate of Bridget Neary. It was on a Sunday, immediately after the death of Mrs. Neary, and before she was buried. I recollect what that conversation was. It was an agreement of $1,200 that Mr. Cohen was to receive out of the estate of Bridget Neary for services he was to render for that estate. There was something said in reference to the disbursements connected with the estate. Mr. Cohen was to attend to all claims. Mr. Cohen was to receive $1,200 for his services connected with that estate. Q. Do you know whether your wife paid the $1,200 in her lifetime? A. No, sir. Q. Do you know what amount of money, if any, was paid on account of the agreement? A. None at all. There was something paid in the shape of costs and disbursements,\u2014over $500.\u201d No other evidence was given tending to support the claim, and the surrogate\u2019s court refused to find, as a matter of fact, that the claim was established. Afterwards the claimant moved for a rehearing, to enable him to produce additional evidence in support of the claim. In the affidavit upon which the motion was founded he testified: \u201cI called the matter to the attention of Mr. Sigmund Feuchtwanger, an attorney and counsellor at law, and in the course of said conversation had concerning the disposition made by the surrogate concerning said claim, he called my attention to the fact of his having heard the conversation between the above-named intestate and myself concerning the special contract which is the subject-matter of my said claim, and that he is ready and willing to corroborate and substantiate the testimony given by the husband of the above-named intestate which he has read; and the reason that his testimony has not been heretofore offered was\u2014First, upon the ground heretofore stated, that I was misled by the form of the objection raised by the special guardian; and, second, that I did not recollect the occurrence of his being present at the time that the original contract entered into between the above-named intestate and myself was consummated.\u201d The surrogate\u2019s court refused to grant a rehearing, and from the order denying the application Cohen individually and the administrators appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b868-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

It has long been the rule in this state that a motion for a new trial because of newly-discovered evidence must be founded on the affidavits of the newly-discovered witnesses, unless it is shown that they cannot be obtained. Adams v. Bush, 1 Abb. Dec. 7; 2 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 104; Denn v. Morrell, 1 Hall, 382; Roberts v. Bank (Sup.) 14 N. Y. Supp. 432; In re Collins, 6 Dem. Sur. 286; Gould v. Moore, 40 N. Y. Super. Ct. Rep. 387; Garvey v. Horse &amp; Cattle Show, 3 Misc. Rep. 352, 22 N. Y. Supp. 929; Denny v. Blumenthal, 8 Misc. Rep. 544, 28 N. Y. Supp. 744; Baylies, New Trials &amp; App. 526; 2 Rumsey, Prac. 414. The affidavit of Mr. Feuchtwanger was not produced, nor was its absence explained,</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">2. Apart from this, had Feuchtwanger\u2019s affidavit been presented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>stating that \u201che would corroborate and substantiate the testimony\u201d given by Charles Mayer, it would have been insufficient. Such an affidavit must disclose the facts the witness will testify to.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">3. A contract made by an attorney with an heir or next of kin, by which he is to receive for his services a large share of his client\u2019s interest in an estate, is always regarded with suspicion; and, if the attorney seeks to enforce it, the burden is on him to show that the contract was fair and just, and that his client acted under standingly, and with full knowledge of all the facts connected with the transaction. Ford v. Harrington, 16 N. Y. 285; Evans v. Ellis, 5 Denio, 640; Haight v. Moore, 37 N. Y. Super. Ct. Rep. 161; Mason v. Ring, 3 Abb. Dec. 210. It appears from the record that the share of Mrs. Mayer in the estate of Miss Neary exceeded but by a few dollars the amount which the claimant alleges she contracted to pay for his services in securing that interest. The claimant presented no evidence before the surrogate that his services in the settlement of the Neary estate were worth the sum of $1,200, or any sum beyond the allowance made to him by the surrogate on the settlement of that estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">4. The evidence of Charles Mayer is insufficient to create a personal liability against Mrs. Mayer. Her agreement was that Mr. Cohen was to receive $1,200 out of the estate of Bridget Neary for the services he was to render for that estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The order should be affirmed, with costs against the appellants personally. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
