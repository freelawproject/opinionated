Y., against James M. Waterbury and others, to compel defendants to deliver to plaintiffs, their successors in office, books, papers, and property pertaining to the office. The application was denied, and plaintiffs appeal. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">The opinion of Mr. Justice GrAYNOR at special term is as follows: Section 3 of article 10 of the constitution of this state provides that, \u201cwhen the duration of any office is not provided for by this constitution, it may be declared by law, and if not so declared such office shall be held during the pleasure of the authority making the appointment.\u201d This relates not only to offices existing at the time of its enactment, but also to offices created since. People v. Comptroller, 20 Wend. 595. But it relates only to cases where the appointment is continuous, and not to cases where the power of appointment is exhausted when once exercised. Bergen v. Powell, 94 N. Y. 591. In other words, and more plainly speaking, it does not apply to cases where the tenure of office is fixed by the statute. In the present case the statute (chapter 453, Laws 1889) fixes the tenure of office. Section 1 authorizes the supervisor to appoint five commissioners, who shall be a body corporate, and known as the \u201cCommissioners of Improvement.\u201d Section 3 provides that, whenever a vacancy shall occur through death, resignation, or refusal to act, the remaining commissioners shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy, and, in default of their so doing, the supervisor shall fill it. It is therefore obvious that the statute has provided for the creation of a body corporate by the appointment of five persons by the supervisor, and for its perpetuity by the filling of vacancies. The duration of the office of the commissioners is \u201cprovided\u201d for in this scheme of the statute. The statute makes the tenure unlimited. It creates a body corporate, with the attribute of perpetual succession by means of its own members filling vacancies. It cannot therefore be said that the statute does not provide for the duration of the office. Chapter 302 of the Laws of 1859 presents an instance of the appointing officer\u2019s power being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>exhausted by making the appointments. People v. Woodruff, 32 N. Y. 361. The provision in section 3 that \u201cthe said officers shall hold their respective offices for one year\u201d refers to the officers of the body corporate provided for in the preceding sentence,\u2014the president, treasurer, and secretary. It is also fatal to this application that the supervisor has never removed the three remaining members of the body corporate, if he had the power. It is aside from the case, but it should be considered whether the body - has the power, to act while a vacancy exists. People v. Nostrand, 46 N. Y. 375. The motion is denied, without costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b406-5\">Argued before DYKMAN, PRATT, and CULLEN, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-6\">Seward Baker, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-7\">Martin J.
