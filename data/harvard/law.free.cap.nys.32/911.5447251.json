Ho request to postpone was made by the appellant in order that he might make an application to the judge who tried the case, but the appeal was argued, and, after its decision by the general term, this application is renewed. We think it is apparent that, for the reason stated upon the previous application, it must now be denied. Motion defied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
