The only defense attempted to be made on the trial was that this note was a renewal of a prior note given by the defendant to plaintiff, without consideration; consequently the note in suit was without consideration. The original note was given as a compromise of three acceptances drawn January 15,1885, by Tanner &amp; Faxon on the Fishkill Manufacturing Company for $12,200, and which purported to be accepted by said corporation. The three bills were accepted in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-16\">\u201cAccepted; payable at 166 Fulton street, New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-17\">\u201cFishkill Mfg. Go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-18\">\u201cSidney J. Everett, Treasurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-19\">Everett was not the treasurer of the Fishkill Manufacturing Company, but the secretary, and, under the by-laws, he had no authority to bind the company by commercial paper; and upon the trial he testified that he was not authorized by the trustees or by any one to accept the three bills above mentioned, amounting to $12,200. The acceptances became the property of the plaintiff, went to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>test, and the plaintiff threatened to bring actions on them, against the drawers and acceptor. The defendant was the treasurer of the Fishkill Manufacturing Company, and, after considerable negotiation, he gave a note, of which the note in suit is a renewal, and received from the plaintiff the three acceptances, upon the agreement that the apparent liability of the manufacturing company was discharged. The compromise of a doubtful claim is a good consideration for a contract, and the release by the plaintiff of its clainls against the manufacturing company was a good consideration for the note given by the defendant White v. Hoyt, 73 N. Y. 505; Wahl v. Barnum, 116 N. Y. 87, 22 N. E. 280; Bank v. Parker, 130 N. Y. 415, 29 N. E. 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
