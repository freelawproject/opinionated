The United States assessed against the various states twenty million of dollars, of which Pennsylvania assumed the payment of $1,946,719.33, and was entitled to a deduction of fifteen per centum for prompt payment. She claimed to have advanced the whole sum in the pay and equipment of the troops, but from the evidence it would seem that the vouchers taken were not so formal as required by the laws of Congress and the rules of the treasury department, and were generally suspended or disallowed. It seems, from the testimony of Col. McMichael, to have been well undei\u2019Stood at the department at Washington that the state had in point of fact paid her quota and was entitled to the fifteen per cent., but no entries were made to that effect on the books of the treasury, or settlements closed by the proper officers. The national government also lent the state $606,000 in the year 1862, either in repayment or to enable her 1\u00a1o equip her troops, raise more, or meet loans. Pennsylvania also claimed to have advanced sums from time to time which were to be repaid by the United States. Col. McMichael says that all was well understood by the then secretary of the treasury, but it would seem that at and after that time some difficulty arose, and it is said that our state was urged to make payment of her arrears, leaving out the suspended or disallowed vouchers. At this time an entirely new set of men filled the treasury department, and the former arrangement seems to have been misunderstood or disregarded. On the 22d day of March 1867, a joint resolution was passed authorizing the appointment of a special agent to collect disallowed or \u2019suspended claims against the United States, and on the same day G-eo. 0. Evans was appointed such agent. Prior to this time, to wit, on the 27th of July 1861, an Act of Congress had been passed authorizing payments by the secretary of the treasury to the governors of states or their authorized agents, the costs, charges and expenses incurred by the states in enrolling, subsisting, clothing, equipping, &amp;c., troops employed in aiding to suppress the rebellion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-8\">\u201c The authority issued from the governor to Mr. Evans in due form, appointing him a special agent to collect the disallowed and suspended claims from the United States, and on the same day Mr. Evans signed an agreement to collect all such money, so far as in his power, and to pay over the same forthwith to the state trea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>surer, <em>less the commission </em>allowed, and to make annual reports to the state treasurer of the amounts collected, and the sources from which derived; at the same time he gave bond in ten thousand dollars for the faithful performance of his duty. Neither the bond nor agreement were required by law, but were taken by the governor for the greater caution. Under this appointment several collections were made and paid into the treasury of very considerable sums, of which you will have statements, and all of the suspended and disallowed claims were finally settled at the accounting department of the United States, amounting in all to perhaps some two million of dollars. At an after time, to wit, on the 30th of March 1870, on the solicitation and advice of the governor, the auditor-gen eral placed in the hands of Mr. Evans, the vouchers, showing claims by this state against the federal government to a very large amount. These sums will be laid before you. The auditor-general had contemplated settling these claims himself,but on looking into the subject, it became very clear that it must be done by an agent of the governor, and it was believed that there was little time to lose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">\u201c [The auditor-general, therefore, gave them over to Mr. Evans, under an agreement that he was to have a compensation of ten per cent, for their collection, such being his construction of the resolution of March 22d 1867. It was further agreed that Evans should be paid travelling expenses, printing, stationery, clerk-hire, &amp;c., for preparing the claims for settlement, and if nothing was realized, no compensation to be allowed.] The governor on the 13th of April addressed a letter to the secretary of the treasury, showing that he had appointed Mr. Evans his duly authorized agent to settle these claims. This was ultimately done by him to the satisfaction of the state department, so far as shown. We have no doubt of the power of the governor to make the appointment of the special agent, under the resolution of the legislature, and we also think that the auditor-general could employ an agent when necessary, and for the interest of the state, by virtue of his office. He most clearly could have done it in the present case with the sanction of the governor, who had full power to do it by himself under the statute. We do not believe, that either the governor or the auditor-general had power to bind the state to make compensation beyond the amount fixed by law, and the actual sum to be paid must be determined by the court and jury. In the course of these various settlements, there came into the hands of the defendant the following sums: On the 1st day of May 1867, $78,516.89; on the 28th October 1868, $105,651.46; and on the 27th of August 1870, $138,846.09, making in all, $321,014.44. Of this, Mr. Evans claimed for percentage $291,046.91, and paid into the treasury $29,967.53, and it is to recover the above-stated balance of $291,046.91, that this suit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>brought. The Commonwealth claims that the defendant is not entitled to any percentage whatever, that he has forfeited all title thereto, by failing to pay over the money which came into xhis hands, or to render an account thereof to the proper department. He says, and so testifies, that the governor was made acquainted from time to time with all his doings, and that the same was not made public, lost their course of settlement might be defeated, and the interest of the state jeopardized. He has fully explained to you his reason for that course, and it is for you to judge of their truth and plausibility.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">\u201c [We state to you, as a rule of law, that if an agent or attorney collects a sum of money and fails to give his principal notice thereof, or to pay it over in a reasonable time, but fraudulently converts the same to his own use, he can recover nothing for his collections. If, in the present case, the defendant fraudulently set up a claim for fees to which he was not entitled, with a view of retaining the money, or for any other purpose, he can recover nothing.] Such we understand to be the rule of Balsbaugh <em>v. </em>Frazer, 7 Harris 99, and of several other cases. If, on the other hand, he honestly and fairly claimed the money in his hands as compensation for collections and settling the accounts between the state and the United States, although you might think that he claimed too much, yet you are not on that account to declare the whole compensation forfeited, but will fix the amount fairly due, allow that, and render your verdict against him for the residue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">\u201c The character of this case was well calculated to raise a difficulty as to the compensation. It was doubtful if the agent should be paid his percentage merely for the money collected, or on all claims settled and allowed. Whether on the large expenditures of 1861, the vouchers for which had long been on file, but rejected and disallowed, or merely for what came into his hands in the form of cash, and was paid into the treasury, and whether it should also embrace the vouchers and claims handed over by the auditor-general. If business-men might, on the wording of this resolution, honestly differ as to whether the percentage should be paid on the whole or only a part, it might seem extremely harsh to forfeit the whole compensation. But for intentional fraud practised the forfeiture will be enforced. That is one of the first questions for you to decide. It is contended, however, on the part of the state, that the agent was obliged by law to pay the whole of the money into the treasury, and then look to the accounting department for an allowance of his percentage. Such is not the law in the ordinary case of principal and agent, or attorney and client, and we can see no good reason for a different rule here. The resolution of the legislature contemplates that the agent shall be <em>\u2018 </em>paid out of his collection.\u2019 The agreement of Mr. Evans, made contemporaneously with his appointment, binds him to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>into the treasury the money collected, \u2018 less the commission allowed,\u2019 which shows what was understood by both parties. Had the money been paid into the treasury, and a large sum be determined by the department to be due the agent for collections, it could not be paid over, but must be reported to the next legislature for a special appropriation. We instruct you that the agent was not bound to pay the percentage due him into the state treasury, but should have paid over all, less that sum. In stating his account, Mr. Evans claimed ten per centum on all of the government claims which passed through his hands, and paid into the treasury $29,967.53, which he admitted to be due. For the defendant it is contended that the law gives ten per cent, on all that was either collected or settled and allowed; that when a sum is named, as here, not' exceeding t$n per cent., the whole can be claimed ; that the party to receive has a right to so construe the words as to give him the whole allowance, and that such has been the uniform usage under laws so worded. There is no proof before us of any custom, although we may well suppose that the receiver' generally got all that was in his power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">.\u201cWe must therefore put a construction upon the words of the statute. If the legislature had intended to give ten per centum for the service, it would have said so. When the words used are, <em>\u2018not- exceeding ten per </em>cent.,\u2019 it shows that less may be paid and considered a sufficient allowance. The true sum must first be fixed, ordinarily by the accounting department, and ultimately by a court and jury. You must decide what is a fair allowance, not exceeding ten per cent. You will take into consideration that if nothing was recovered, nothing could be paid, and when men labor on such a contingency they are generally allowed more in case of success than when they are to receive compensation, even if unsuccessful. The testimony is to that effect in the present case. Mr. Evans says he would not have undertaken on that contingency for a less sum, and one other witness fixes the same amount. Taking it for granted that the joint resolution intended to allow a percentage on <em>dll </em>money collected from the federal government and paid into the state treasury on disallowed or suspended claims, does it prove that the same sum is to be retained for merely making a settlement of mutual demands which balance each other, and where little, if anything, is paid by either party ? We do not so construe the resolution. The evidence shows that a large expenditure took place by the state' for the benefit of the nation, and the justice of remuneration was acknowledged. The whole account was most carefully made out and presented at the United States treasury, but the vouchers were so irregular as to lead to their rejection and disallowance. The resolution recites that, by carefully supplying deficient testimony, many of the sums can be collected. The testimony of Mr. Evans shows that no new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>or additional proof was procured, or new vouchers obtained; but, by taking up the accounts as prepared by Colonel McMichael, and carefully explaining them to the auditor and controller of the treasury, the whole was ultimately allowed and settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">\u201c [Mr. Evans states that he spent some twenty days in completing this arrangement, having the whole sum set off against the claims of the United States, and all finally settled on the books of the department. For this service we do not consider that Mr. Evans is entitled to receive the percentage mentioned in the resolution. His labor is very different from that bestowed on the other claims, and his responsibility falls greatly short of that arising from receiving and paying over large sums of money. The services do not come within the words or intention of the resolution. Yet for this valuable service Mr. Evans is not to go unrequited, although perhaps not entitled to ten per cent, on nearly two millions of dollars, or at least considerably over one million, he should be paid liberally. You can allow him a reasonable percentage or a lumped sum. Pay him well according to his skill, labor and success, but we cannot believe that for such services he is entitled to over one hundred thousand dollars as claimed. His remuneration is a question for you.] Take into consideration the evidence of Col. McMichael that at one time the account of the state was all allowed ; then- that it was found rejected on the books, and payment demanded of the alleged indebtedness of this state, at which the then Governor Curtin expressed great surprise that it was persisted in, and the account never finally settled and closed until effected through the instrumentality of Mr. Evans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">\u201c We come next to consider the claims placed in the hands of Mr. Evans by the auditor-general under the solicitation, of the governor, and pursuant to his appointment. The vouchers General Hartranft thinks were reasonably correct in form, but not set forth in any regular account; were filed away in pigeon-holes and received and arranged by Mr. Evans. They amount, according to our estimate, to some $815,589.33. The whole of this claim was settled and allowed. For this service it is pretty clear that the auditor-general expected the agent would be paid not exceeding ten per cent., but as much less as that officer might deem right. The claim did not come before him for allowance, but is now before you in a common-law action. You must fix the amount and can say that it shall be three, five or ten per cent., as you may think just and reasonable. We do not consider that in making this settlement Evans was the agent of the auditor-general alone (for as such he would not have been recognised at Washington) but of the governor also. He makes his settlement in the latter capacity, and claims pay under the resolution of the legislature as a special agent. Allow what you consider right under all of the circumstances. There is one demand for percentage .amounting to over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>$60,000, the justice of which we are .unable to perceive. It is said to be claimed on account of the $606,000 lent to the state by the United States. That money was not collected for, but was due by Pennsylvania to the United States; as such it was not collected but paid. True, there may have been a set-off against it in the indebtedness due to the state; but if so, that was settled in some of the claims already referred to, either by an offset against the. vouchers from the auditor-general\u2019s office or some of the large expenditures of 1861. Both of these we have already directed you to settle. In the form spoken of, this is indisputable; it may be demanded as making up the sums already recited ; is not claimed in that form and was mentioned incidentally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">\u201c The defendant avers that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, because in the first count of his <em>narr. </em>it sets forth that the defendant collected the money for the Commonwealth in his professional employment, as attorney in fact, and agent of the Commonwealth. In the second count, for so much money had and received by the said defendant as a public officer, and in the third, that he is indebted on an account stated. We are of the opinion that there is no evidence of an account stated between the parties which would support the third count, and that the defendant is not a public officer as averred in the second count. We have heretofore decided, and now instruct you, that the authority issued by the governor to Mr. Evans did not make him a public officer. He was merely a <em>special agent. </em>We had occasion to examine into that subject very carefully some time in the latter part of 1871, and delivered an elaborate opinion, to which we still adhere, but shall not now consume our time or your patience in discussing it again. Your verdict cannot be in favor of the state on either of these counts. The first count we consider substantially supported, so far as relates to the receipt of the money as an agent, but whether in his \u2018 professional employment\u2019 or merely as a \u2018 <em>special agent\u2019 </em>for the particular service, must be determined by you. The act abolishing imprisonment for debt excludes from relief persons receiving money as \u2018 officers, or for any misconduct or neglect in office, or in any professional employment.\u2019 It is contended by the defendant that he was not engaged in any professional employment, and therefore should not be declared against in that capacity, as it would subject him to imprisonment for any sum found against him. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel contend that the money was received by the defendant in his professional employment, as an attorney in fact, and agent of the Commonwealth. That he received it as an agent of the state is very clear. There are certain professions which are undoubtedly covered by the words of the statute \u2014 that of attorney at law \u2014 neither of the others, designated as learned professions, perhaps come within the statute, as. they have little to do with collecting money for others. We are inclined to think that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>may be other \u2018 professional employment.\u2019 Aman may be a professional claim agent, having a license for their collection. He may be a professional agent for procuring patents or pensions, follow either as a business, and would probably come within the Act of Assembly. In the present case the defendant states that he never was employed in settling up claims before or since; that he merely acted as a special agent, under the power of attorney issued by the governor, and that it was not his professional employment. Whether he is subject to imprisonment for failing to pay over money received in <em>a.fiduciary capacity </em>is not to be determined at present. If the question had to be decided by the court whether this money was collected by the defendant in his professional employment as an agent, and we came to the conclusion that it was not, we would direct an amendment of the <em>narr., </em>by striking out the averment. We would correct the declaration to correspond with the evidence. But in our opinion it is a question for a jury. You can find the fact specially, and we will put your verdict in form. There is certainly little if any evidence tending to show that the defendant was a professional agent, or followed the general business of acting as an attorney in fact, as is the case with many persons who act as general land agents, and hold themselves out to the world as such. Every question can be fully met by a special verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">\u201c If you find that a sum of money is due to the state by the defendant, it will bear interest from the time it was received, and should have been paid into the treasury.

It is clear that it is not all public debtors who are within the exception of the Act of 1842, nor all parties, who, under the Act of March 30th 1811, 6 Sm. L. 225, are bound to account to the auditor-general. But we are of the opinion that all persons who, by authority of law,, are intrusted with the receipt of public moneys, through whose hands money due to the public, or belonging to it, passes on its way to the public treasury, must be so considered, by whatever name or title they may be designated in the laAv authorizing their appointment, and Avhether the service be special or general, transient or permanent. It is quite unnecessary to discuss the authorities Avhich have been cited upon this point. None of them bear any resemblance to this case, except, perhaps, The United States <em>v. </em>Maurice, 2 Brock. 96, and that, Ave think, sustains the conclusion at Avhich we have arrived. It Avas there held, that an agent for fortifications, appointed under the army regulations, which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>received the sanction of Congress, was a public officer from whom the government had a right to exact an official bond with sureties, and that such bond was therefore a valid obligation. The appointment there as here was for an indefinite period. Nor does it seem to us to distinguish this case from that, that this appointment was to collect a single claim, or rather a set of claims against a particular debtor. No one can doubt that collectors of public taxes are within the letter of the exception of the Act of 1842. Suppose a special tax laid for a temporary purpose, is it susceptible of any more doubt that a person appointed by authority of law to collect such tax \u2014 call him special collector or special agent \u2014 would be equally within the exception, and moneys collected by him be \u201cmoneys collected by a public officer?\u201d Can it make any difference that a person is commissioned by the governor as a general agent to collect all claims of the Commonwealth, or as a special agent to collect only one particular claim? We think not. Mr. Evans was appointed by virtue of a joint resolution of the legislature, approved March 22d 1867, Pamph. L. 1848, by which it was provided that the governor be and is hereby authorized to appoint a special agent to collect the disallowed and suspended claims of the state against the United States. Under this resolution the governor appointed Mr. Evans, and very properly issued and delivered to him a commission under the great seal of the state. This commission is in the usual form of an official commission. In like manner he required of him to give bonds with two sureties. The bond is to the Commonwealth, and is conditioned that \u201c the above bounden George 0. Evans, special agent as aforesaid, shall faithfully perform his official duties under said joint resolution.\u201d It is an official bond. It is true that it does not appear that he took the oath required of all officers, executive and judicial, by the eighth article of the Constitution, but it does not follow that he was not bound to take such oath in order to render his qualification complete: Riddle <em>v. </em>Bedford County, 7 S. &amp; R. 386. He certainly had official duties under the joint resolution, as his bond acknowledged, which, when he accepted the position, he was bound to perform with fidelity. It is not a case of service rendered to the Commonwealth under a contract. The joint resolution did not empower the governor to make any contract, and as the learned judge rightly decided upon an offer of evidence, he had no authority outside of the resolution to do so. Even if the fact were that Evans did enter into a contract or contracts with the governor and auditor-general, it did not change his character and responsibility as an officer. \u201c If,\u201d says Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, \u201cit may be converted into a contract, it must be a contract to perform the duties of the office of agent, and such an office must exist with ascertained duties, or there is no standard by which the extent of the condition can be measured.\u201d 2 Brock. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>103. A contract to perforin the duties of an office is implied on the part of every person who accepts it: 3 Bl. Com. 165. We think, therefore, that the moneys collected by Evans were moneys collected by a public officer within the exception of the Act of 1842, and the learned judge below ought so to have instructed the jury, and not that the defendant was entitled to a verdict in his favor on the second count of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">There was a further error in the charge upon the subject of the compensation of Evans for his services in the matter of the claims placed.in his hands for collection by Auditor-General Hartranft. The jury were directed, \u201cyou must fix the amount, and can say that it shall be three, five or ten per cent, as you may think just and reasonable.\u201d He had before rightly directed the jury that the defendant could not be allowed more than ten per cent, on the amount actually collected by virtue of his appointment under the joint resolution. He does not in this case limit the commission to the amount actually collected. But' we think it clear from the letters of Governor Geary to Auditor-General Hartranft, dated March 29th 1870, and from the paper signed by the latter, dated March 30th 1870, that the vouchers for these claims were handed over to Evans as the special agent, under the joint resolution requiring the auditor-general to-furnish him with these vouchers. Governor Geary names and describes him as \u201c special agent of the state under the joint resolution of the legislature of March 22d 1867,\u201d and Auditor-General Hartranft carefully stipulates that his compensation for these services shall be \u201c out of the commission of ten per cent, allowed by the joint resolution that is, as we think it must be, reasonably construed; the services rendered in the matter of these claims shall be considered in determining the rate of commission to be fixed under the joint resolution, and not in the whole to exceed the maximum of that commission,- since it is to be paid out of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">One other point remains to be considered upon the subject of the forfeiture by Evans of his right to any commission. The learned judge undoubtedly laid down the rule correctly as between private principal and agent. But that was not the relation between the Commonwealth and Mr. Evans. Admittihg even that he was not a public officer, it cannot be questioned that he was an agent liable to account under Act of March 30th 1811. The first section of that includes, as such, expressly, \u201c persons intrusted with the receipt, or who now or hereafter may become possessed of public money.\u201d Evans indisputably fell within this category. The fourteenth section of that act provides \u201cthat no allowance for commissions shall in any instance be made by the accounting officers, in case of refusal or neglect to furnish accounts.\u201d It cannot, with any show of reason, be maintained that this provision applies only to the accounting officers. It is a rule of forfeiture, applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ble in all cases between the state and her agents, who are bound to account, and is to be applied whether the question arises upon an appeal from a settlement or in a common law action, if the Commonwealth chose to resort to that remedy. The legislature has laid down a very simple and just rule \u2014 essential to the safety of the state \u2014 and which can never work injustice to her honest agents. She ought in no case to be compelled to pay double or treble commissions for the collection of her claims \u2014 first to the original agent, and then to the agent or attorney employed to collect of that agent, and so on, as it may be, until the whole claim is exhausted in commissions. The simple rule laid down, and which she has an undoubted right to lay down, is to furnish accounts. She says to her agents, report the amount you have collected \u2014 make whatever offsets you may thing yourself entitled to; the accounting officers will then have the means of making a settlement with you, and if you are dissatisfied with their decision you can appeal. Evans was bound, under the Act of 1811, to account promptly\u2014 at least within a reasonable time, and besides, it was a part of the condition of his official bond that he would \u201c make semi-annual reports to the state treasurer of the amounts collected, and of the sources from which derived.\u201d It is not pretended that he made any reports or furnished any accounts within any reasonable time or within the time named in his bond. He received from the United States, May 1st 1867, $78,516.39; October 27th 1868, $105,651.46, and August 20th 1870, $136,846.09. He furnished no accounts whatever until July 21st 1871. He said on his examination as a witness in court: \u201cI reported to the governor how I was succeeding in my collections. I did not report in writing, because it was not considered expedient, and against the interest of the state. The state had a large balance unsettled, and if reported and got into the newspapers would damage our claims. The governor requested that no public report should be made for the good of the state to facilitate the claims.\u201d Governor Geary was not alive at the time of the trial to meet this allegation. It is too clear for argument that the governor had no power to release the agent from one of the plainest of his duties, as well as the condition of his official bond, upon any such notion of expediency. The attention of the learned judge does not appear to have been distinctly called to the provision of the fourteenth section of the Act of 1811, and if this was the only .question in the cause we might hesitate to reverse upon it. It is, however, necessarily involved in the answer to the defendant\u2019s fourth point, which forms the subject of the sixth assignment of error by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
