The plaintiff averred that, having made the contract with the defendants, he obtained from the owner of the lot the privilege of using it as appertenant to the malt-house for a small, rent for a long time from July 1st 1872. The plaintiff averred his readiness to perform his part of the coritract and pay the $1500, which he tendered on the 1st of July 1872; but the defendants refused to perform their part of the contract and deliver the malt-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-13\">\u25a0 The lot on which the malt-house was erected belonged to Edward Schenley and wife.

J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-15\">The plaintiff testified that, in July 1871, he bought the malt-house from Mr. Watson, one of the partners, for $1500, to be delivered in July 1872. The defendants \u201cbought the malt-house the same day I bought it from them at constable\u2019s sale. * * * It was sold for rent at constable\u2019s sale. The contract was partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>made before the sale. Mr. Watson came to me and wanted to know how much I would give for it. I told him I did not know. * * * Then he asked me if I would rent it to him if I bought it. I told him I would. Then he asked me what I would rent it to him for. I told him I did not know; I would see how much 1 could buy it for; I would have to have an interest that would pay me.- That did not appear to be satisfactory to him. After a while he came back to me, and said if they bought it their firm only wanted to run it one season, and at the expiration of that season, he would deliver it to me at whatever price he would pay for it. The sale went on. The first; bid was $600. I bid $1200, and they bid $1500. I think there was no bid between theirs and mine. * * * Mr. Watson\u2019s proposition was to deliver the malt-house to me at whatever price they paid for it at the end of that season. I did not bid any further than $1200, with the understanding that I would get it at the end of the year. They bid it in. He said they only wanted to run it one season, and would deliver it to me in July 1872. * * * In the month of April 1872, I was at Mr. White\u2019s office, * * * and Mr. Watson drove up and told me he wanted to see me. We went into Mr. White\u2019s office, taking Mr. White in along with us. He asked me if I intended to take that malt-house on the 1st of July. I told him certainly. He says, \u2018 I will be ready to. deliver it to you on the 1st of July.\u2019 Said I, \u2018 On the price you paid for it?\u2019 He said,' \u201cYes,\u2019 and said he, \u2018I -want John White, Jr., to be a witness.\u2019 * * * Then, on the 1st of July, I went to Mr. Watson\u2019s office, and took with me $1500 IJ. S. money to' pay for the malt-house. He said he could not take the money. I asked him the reason \u2014 I told him I had called to pay for the malt-house; whether the price and time was not right. He said, \u2018 Yes, sir, it is all right; but my partners will not let me deliver it to you.\u2019 Said I, \u2018Mr. Watson, give me a receipt for this money, and I will attend to your partners.\u2019 Said I, \u2018I am not a school-boy.\u2019 He said he could not do it. That is all the satisfaction I got. He made no objection as to the money or-the amount. * * * I saw the owners of the ground on which this malt-house is built, prior to the sale of this malt-house. I had the privilege of retaining the malt-house on the ground where it stood. When I bought the malt-house it was to remain there; it' was to be used where it is. * * * This malt-house was sold in 1871, on the premises. There were -several persons there beside myself \u2014 Mr. Watson, Liddell, Rhodes, Galloway and Shell were there. I bought the malt-house that day from Mr. Watson; the constable announced what he had to sell; he said he had a malt-house seiked as the property of Garrard to be sold for rent. The terms would be cash, and it would be sold to the highest bidder. He did not say it was real estate. He said he sold that malt-house. That is all I heard him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>say about it. I bid $1200 that day on the malt-house \u2014 he had a paper there and read it; he did not say it was on a landlord\u2019s warrant; he said he sold this property for rent. I did not hear the constable say anything about selling a lease with the malt-house. I did not pay much attention to him, because I had found out all about it before from Mr. Schenley\u2019s agent. He said it had about three years to run, but I might have it ten years if I wanted it. It was on the morning of the sale that I learned this. He did not show me the lease at that time. * * * When I bid on it I was bidding on a malt-honse that I could let stand on that lease ten years if I wanted. I was bidding on it with the knowledge that it was on a leased property from Schenley to somebody else.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">\u201c I did not see a landlord\u2019s warrant. * * * I had some talk with Mr. Watson prior to the sale. He said he would let me have the malt-house on the 1st day of July 1872, at whatever price he paid for it. I believed him. * * * This was not over half an hour before the sale.' My understanding with Mr. Watson was that if I bought it I was to lease it to him at a fair compensation. If he bought it, he was to sell it to me at what he bought it for. * * * There was nothing said about the price after the sale. He fixed the amount before the sale. After the sale he gave me a friendly tap and said, \u2018Now I will give you this next July.\u2019 * * * When I was bidding I knew I was buying a malt-house with the privilege of leaving it there or taking it away. I knew I could have it ten years if I wished it. I knew I was bidding on a malt-house and lease that had three years to run. I bought from Mr. Watson whatever they bought. He only agreed to give me the malt-house. I did not know anything about their lease. I bought all that they bought for $1500.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">John White testified: \u201cMr. Darlington and Mr. Watson had a conversation in my office in April or the beginning of May, in regard to this malt-house. They asked me to be a witness that Mr. Darlington would take this malt-house on the 1st of July; that he would give it to him at what it' cost, $1500. Darlington agreed to take the house, and'Watson agreed to let him have the house; that was agreed on. I think Mr. Watson asked me to witness; they both asked me to witness it. There was no difficulty or dispute between them as to the bargain. I understood it perfectly, and they seemed to understand it; it was in April or May 1872. I understood it to he that Garrard malt-house down on Penn street.' * * * There was something said about their having made a bargain about the matter before. They said they had been talking about this malt-house before, and now they had agreed to deliver it, and Darlington had agreed to take it. Mr. Watson spoke about building another malt-house; he said he wanted it understood that day whether Darlington would take this malt-house on the 1st of July, so that he would know-what to do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>For\u2019 defendant, John B. Sarber testified : \u201c I was a constable in 1871; I had a landlord\u2019s warrant from the Schenley estate given to me by Mr. Torrence against the property of William H. Garrard. I sold the malt-house that day. It was on leased ground belonging to the Schenley estate I presume. I sold on that day a malt-house for $1500, belonging to Wm. II. Garrard. I never saw that paper from that day to this. The landlord\u2019s warrant was issued by Schenley against Garrard. Henry B. Hatch is the agent of the estate. I sold it on the premises. * * * I levied on the malt-house. I did not see the lease. I acted under the direction of Schenley\u2019s agent, Mr. Hatch. They directed me to sell the improvements that were on the ground,' and that is what I sold. I did not sell any lease; at least I may have stated that the lease had so long to run, but it was the improvements on the ground that I sold.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">Francis Torrence testified: \u201c I have been acting as the agent of Mr. Schenley. This malt-house was sold under my direction. We always directed the constable to sell the improvements, with the understanding at the same time that the lease would be continued to the purchaser. That is the way we always instruct the constable to sell improvements, telling him at the same time that the lease would be continued. I cannot say particularly in this instance, but it has been done in all our cases of that kind.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AY4\">* * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">Robert Watson testified: * * * \u201cI had no conversation with Mr. Darlington before the sale, only to bid good-morning to him and to ask him if he was going to buy a malt-house. He said he was. Said I, \u2018You will have to pay for it.\u2019 Robert Liddell bid the property in. I had a conversation with Darlington after the sale. * * * After the sale was over, Darlington came running across to me, a little excited, and said, \u2018 You fellows has too much money for me. I do not want to buy a malt-house for that price. I did. not want it for a year any way.\u2019 I said, \u2018 If you do not want it for a year that puts another shape on the matter. We are talking of building another malt-house up at the other place, and I have no doubt you could get it at the end of a year if Spencer, McKay &amp; Co. builds another one; they do not want to haul malt two miles up there.\u2019 Well, he said he would like to have it at the end of the year. * * * I recollect of having a conversation with him at White\u2019s office, on Penn street. I was at White\u2019s, and Darlington came up along the street and\u2019stopped his horse and came into White\u2019s; him and us generally bought hops there. I says to Darlington, \u2018Now Darlington, Mr. White is here and I think we are going to build, and if we build, I would like to know if you are going to take that house, or if we will take it down and haul it up to build the new house with.\u2019 \u2018 I am going to take the house,\u2019 said he. \u2018 Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018 I think it would be better for us to let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>you have the house than to haul up the bricks, because I would rather have the money to buy new materials than to bother with the old materials.\u2019 I told him if we would build he would get the house. I told him that emphatically, different times. * * * I remember the constable stating the terms of the sale. He put up that house for sale with a lease to run, he said, from that day about four and one-half years. * * * It was the understanding at the time we bought the malt-house at the constable\u2019s sale; and it is the understanding yet that he is to take the house whenever it suits us to give it to him; it was always my understanding. That was the bargain in the presence of Mr. White. I wanted to know if Darlington was still of the same mind about taking the house if we would build, or would we pull the house down and take the material up there. That was the understanding of him and me too, that he was to take the house whenever it suited us to build. That condition was put in at the time Mr. White was appealed to.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-7\">The defendant\u2019s points which were refused were as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-8\">1. If the evidence in the case shows that defendants, in the month of July, a. d. 1871, purchased at the constable\u2019s sale the malt-house and lease of the premises on which it was erected, the lease running for five years from April 1st 1871, and on the same day agreed to sell the same premises to the plaintiff, and to deliver the possession thereof on the 1st day of July, A. D. 1872, that would be a parol sale within the Statute of Frauds, and the plaintiff cannot recover the value of his bargain, or the difference between what the malt-house and lease were worth at the time of the breach on the 1st day of July 1872, and what he was to pay for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-9\">2. If at the time of the alleged purchase by plaintiff from defendants, he, the plaintiff, knew he was purchasing a leasehold premises, he was bound to inquire the time the lease had to run, and if the unexpired term had more than three years to run from the time he was to receive the possession of the premises, then the law visits him with notice of that fact, and his purchase is a parol purchase under the Statute of Frauds, and he is not entitled to recover the difference between the value of the premises at the time of either the making or breach of said contract of purchase and what he was to pay for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-10\">3. If the jury believe that the defendants sold the plaintiff a malt-house only, and the plaintiff at the time of the sale knew that the malt-house stood on leasehold premises, and was erected and held under the leasehold title, he, the plaintiff, was bound to inquire the term and terms of the lease, and if it had an unexpired term of over three years from the time he was to get possession, then he cannot recover the difference between what it was worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and what he was to give at the time of the breach of contract to deliver it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">4. If the alleged contract was for the sale of a leasehold having over three years to run from the breach of contract, with the right to remove a malt-house thereon (which belonged to the leasehold premises) at any time within the term, then the plaintiff cannot recover the difference between what the premises were worth and what he was to give, but only such loss or expenses suffered by him up to the time of the breach of the alleged contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $700.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-8\">The defendants took out a writ of error, and assigned the refusal of their points for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-9\"><em>Bruce </em>and <em>Wegley, </em>for plaintiffs in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai8\">The damages for breach of a parol contract for the sale of land is not to be measured by the value of the land, and a lease for more than three years is governed by the same rule: Harris <em>v. </em>Harris, 20 P.

It was stipulated that it might be removed at the end of the term, and was made subject to distress and sale by the lessors for rent in arrear. This action was instituted by the plaintiff below to recover damages for the non-performance~of a contract by the defendant to sell and deliver to him the' malt-house. It is true that the declaration as originally filed in both counts set out an agreement for the sale of certain leasehold premises and malt-house, but an additional \u2022 count was filed as an amendment, which declared upon a contract for the sale of a malt-house, with the privilege merely of using and occupying the lot of ground upon which it was erected. If there was any contract of sale at all absolute in its terms \u2014 a question submitted to the jury and found by them in favor of the plaintiff below \u2014 it -was a contract by the defendants to sell what had been distrained upon for rent, and was to be sold by the constable in virtue of his warrant to distrain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>This was the testimony of Darlington the plaintiff, and was abundantly confirmed by the witness White, who related an interview between the plaintiff and Watson, one of the defendants, after the sale. In that conversation nothing but tne malt-house was mentioned. The lessors had no authority to distrain upon the term, and they had not done so. Mr. Armstrong, the receiver of Garrard\u2019s estate, says indeed, \u201c I think I gave Mr. Hatch (who was an agent of the Schenleys) directions to sell it by a landlord\u2019s warrant.\u201d There was no evidence that Hatch acted upon such directions. Without the sanction of the lessors it amounted to nothing. What would have been the effect upon the contract between the parties had the term been sold, it is not necessary to determine. The evidence was direct and abundant that nothing was sold by the constable but the malt-house. So the constable, called by the defendants, expressly testified. \u201c I sold the malt-house that day. * * * I levied on the malt-house : I did not see the lease. I acted under the direction of Schenley\u2019s agent, Mr. Hatch; they directed me to sell the improvements that were on the ground, and that is what I sold; I did not sell any lease; at least I may have stated that the lease had so long to run, but it was the improvements that were on the ground that I sold.\u201d Mr. Liddell, one of the defendants, examined on their behalf, and Mr. Ray, another of their witnesses, both present at the sale, speak of the sale as of the malt-house, and say nothing of any sale of the lease. Mr. Darlington, the plaintiff, fully confirmed the constable\u2019s statement. \u201c The constable announced what he had to sell; he said he had a malt-house seized as the property of Garrard to be sold for rent; the terms would be cash, and it would be sold to the highest bidder. He did not say it was real estate, he said he sold that malt-house; that is all I heard him say about it.\u201d Mr. Darlington stated that before the sale he had an understanding with the agent of the lessors that they would continue the lease to him if he bought, and extend it for ten years if he wished. He testified therefore: \u201c When I was bidding, I knew I was buying a malt-house with the privilege of leasing it there or taking it away. I knew I could have it ten years if I wished it. I knew I was bidding on a malt-house and lease that had three years to run. I bought from Mr. Watson whatever they bought. He only agreed to give me the malt-house. I did not know anything about their lease.\u201d An understanding that the landlord would continue the lease was a very different thing from a sale of the term. If there was any evidence to contradict all this, it was a mere <em>scintilla. </em>Mr. Watson, one of the defendants, said : \u201cHe (the constable) put up that house for sale, with a lease to run, he said, about four and one-half years. He said he did not know the exact month or day, but it was about that time; then he said after that that it had four years to run from the next April after it was bought.\u201d Properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>considered there was nothing in this inconsistent with what the constable had testified. He admitted that he may have stated that the lease had so long to run. It was information very proper to give to the bidders. If they could arrange with the lessors and lessees, they need not remove the malt-house, but occupy it on the premises. On this state of the testimony there was no sufficient evidence to submit to the jury that anything was actually sold at the sale except what the constable had power to sell for rent. It is plain that the receipt of the constable and the assignment by Armstrong of the lease after the sale were entirely unavailing to change this result. Even if Armstrong had power to sell and assign the term, his assignment could not affect the contract of sale between the plaintiff and defendants, which we have seen related only to the malt-house. The same remark is applicable to the constable\u2019s receipt. It was not a receipt for the purchase-money, hut for the rent and costs as bailiff of the landlord. It recited that the lease and premises had been sold. It is clear that ho had no authority to give such a receipt. Instead of paying the whole bid to the .constable, it appears that the defendants paid the balance, after deducting the rent and costs, to Armstrong, taking from him a transfer of the lease in which the amount of this balance is stated as the consideration. Armstrong was entitled to that amount from the constable if nothing but the malt-house was sold. So far as the lessors were concerned, this assignment of the lease was ineffectual to transfer it; at least it was in their power to avoid it, because it wanted the written sanction by them which the lease made necessary, and declared that in case of a transfer without such written sanction the lease and improvements should be forfeited. Whether they did afterwards sanction it does not appear, and is unimportant. That which was sold by the constable, and was the subject-matter of the contract of sale between the plaintiff and defendants below, was the malt-house, and the malt-house alone. No evidence was given of the value of the term apart from the malt-house. The truth is, as is apparent from the whole evidence, that the ground was let for its full rent, and the term independent of the improvements was therefore worthless, and it did not enter into any person\u2019s mind as of any importance as an element in the sale. It was known that the purchaser might remove the malt-house, or if he wished to occupy the premises the landlord would continue the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In this view of the case the plaintiff in error has no just ground to complain of the refusal of the learned judge below to affirm his points as requested, and this refusal is all that is assigned for error. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider what would be the effect of the Statute of Frauds in the case of a parol agreement for the sale of a term of more than three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
