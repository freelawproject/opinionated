The whole of the real and personal property of the testator was sold and converted into money by his executors, the widow\u2019s part or share set apart for her and paid over, and the account of the executors confirmed absolutely, the 8th day of January, A. D. 1871, by which it appeared that there was a balance of nineteen thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars in their hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-10\">The widow being still living, John Ingham, one of the legateesjor himself and as agent of the othiFlegatees7presented' a petition to. the__Qrphans\u2019. .Court, setting out the will and the other facts as above stated, and prayed for the appointment of an auditor \u201c to make distribution of said estate to and among the legatees named in said last will,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-11\">The ex&amp;cntDra,by their answers resisted the application, for the reasons, that the Jegacies did not vest on the death of the testator, but were contingent, and that the will provided that the estate1 should not be divided till one year after the widow\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-12\">~ATfte'r argument, the court (Pearson, P. J.) delivered the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-13\"><em>\u201c </em>On the 15th day of May 1852, Henry Backenstose executed his last will, which was admitted to probate on the 3d day of January 1864, he having died shortly before this time. The will is extremely contradictory, and hard to be understood; and what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>adds to the difficulty, his widow, to whom the estate was bequeathed for life, declined taking under the will, and claimed her distributive share under the intestate laws. The testator, amongst other things, directs that within one year after the death of his widow, all of his land shall be sold by his executors, and the money remaining in their hands, after all expenditures, shall be divided into ten equal shares, which he distributes among ten persons named, one of whom now petitions this court to have distribution made according to the terms of the will. This is resisted by the executors, on the ground that they cannot legally do so, the time therefor not having arrived \u2014 the widow being in full life. It is contended that the legacies are not vested, but contingent; and that the contingency on which they were to be paid has not yet happened. This depends on the effect of the widow\u2019s renunciation. Although the devises and bequests for the use of the widow are somewhat contradictory, yet we can readily collect from the whole wording of the instrument that she was the main object of the testator\u2019s care and bounty, and that the division of the estate was postponed solely for her benefit. Such being the case when she declined receiving the gift as intended, what was the effect on the other beneficiarios ? This question is answered in terms by the decision of the Supreme Court in Brown and Sterrett\u2019s Appeal, 8 Casey 62, where it is held that when lands are given to a widow for life, and after her death the executors were directed to sell and divide the estate, as the sale was postponed for her benefit, she had the power to waive this advantage, and did so by electing to take under the intestate laws, whereupon her life estate became extinct, and it was the duty of the executors to make sale immediately. Such was the course pursued here, as the executors proceeded to \u25a0sell that portion of the real estate expressly reserved to the wife, \u00aen her renunciation under the will. Again, it is held in Styer <em>v. </em>Ereas, 3 Harris 339 (see p. 342), that although it is a general .principle that the power to sell on the happening of a certain event \u2022cannot well be executed before it has transpired, yet there arc exceptions. Where an event turns up which the testator had not \u2022contemplated, a court is compelled to inquire how he would have \u2022provided for it had it been foreseen \u2014 in short, to suppose an indention for him when he had none. In that case the sale was sanctioned, although the event had not occurred. The principles of this case are virtually recognised in Styer\u2019s Appeal, 9 Harris 86. And where the power to the executors was to sell on the death of the widow, and she joined in making the sale, it was held good. The intention of the testator is to govern, and the postponement having been introduced for the benefit of the widow, she \u25a0could waive it, and the executors could sell before the contingency happened. No one could complain, as no one was injured thereby. \u2022Hast <em>n. </em>Porter, 1 Harris 533. The judge considers that had it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>not been for the desire to provide for his wife, he would have ordered the whole estate to be immediately sold for the purpose of. distribution. The same principle has been repeatedly recognised where property was demised to a trustee for the use of a married woman during the lifetime of her husband. It was held in one case, Koenig\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 352, that the trust ceased on the divorce of the wife, as the object of the trust was to protect the property against the husband. It matters not what may be the duration of an estate given to a trustee by will. It continues no longer than the thing sought to be secured by the trust demands: Id. 355; Ilill on Trustees 339 <em>et seq. </em>In the case under consideration the executors-were trustees of this property. The real estate was directed to be sold by them, which is the same in legal effect, under the 13th section of the Act of 24th of February 1834, as if it had been devised to them to be sold. The widow\u2019s renunciation under the will had the same legal effect as her natural death. The \u00e9xecutors could at once make sale, and distribution among the devisees under the will would immediately follow; all reason for suspending the same 'having ceased. It was all intended for the benefit of the widow, who waived it by her own act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">\u201c Another question of no small moment and of no inconsiderable difficulty arises under the sixth division of this will, whether the legacies therein given are vested or contingent ? According to our understanding of the law of the- case, the question does not arise at present, and possibly never may, as the devisees therein named may have all been living at the time the widow renounced, or even at present. \u2022 We have no sufficient statement of the situation of those devisees, either in the petition'dr answers. That all will be made apparent by the report of the auditor appointed to make distribution, and if the point arises in the report, it must be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\"><em>\u201c </em>If these bequests were contingent, to vest on the death of the widow, yet, from what we have already said, her renunciation had the same effect in determining the contingency as her death. It would not be pretended that, had she died when she renounced, any legatee answering the description in the will, then in full life, would not have taken under it. We should know the precise situation of every one claiming \"an interest before entering on that subject. It must be borne in mind that this will was made in 1852, nearly twenty years ago, and the situation of the devisees may have been greatly changed since that time. Who died and who survived we do not know. Some may have passed off during the fourteen years that the testator lived, and thus the legacies may have lapsed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\"><em>\u201c </em>One thing we do know \u2014 that John Ingham, the petitioner and one of the legatees, is in full life, and demands distribution, so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>to enable Mm to obtain Ms share under the will, and as to him the legacy is vested as fully as if the widow were dead, though he may not be able to obtain his whole share until after that event.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">The court decreed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\">\u201c That the executors must make distribution of the funds in their hands, and J. W. Ebur, Esq., is appointed an auditor to ascertain the situation of each legatee at the time of the testator\u2019s death; also at the time the widow renounced under the will, and at the present time; also the amount of money in the hands of the executors for distribution under the will; the sum held by each, how received, and whether they are jointly liable for the whole or each for his aliquot part ? The auditor will report all of the facts, and also a scheme of distribution among the legatees, and report at his earliest convenience.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\">The auditor, on the 17th of March 1873, reported a scheme of distribution, and found that all the legacies were vested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-9\">The executors filed the following exceptions:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-10\">\u201c 1.
