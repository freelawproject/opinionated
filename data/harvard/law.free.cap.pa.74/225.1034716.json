At that date the defendant\u2019s property, against which the municipal claim in this case was filed, was in said borough, and abutted upon Bank lane, now River avenue, a street of said borough', running along the bank of the Allegheny river. On said date an Act of Assembly, relative to said borough, was approved. On the 12th day of March 1867, an Act of Assembly relative to the' annexation of the borough of Manchester to Allegheny City, was approved. On the 3d day of February 1868, the councils of said borough, by resolution, authorized the burgess to advertise for proposals for grading and paving said Bank lane, and on the 10th day of February following, the contract for grading and paving said Bank lane was awarded to P. F. Howley &amp; Co., and the burgess was, by resolution, authorized to enter into an agreement therefor with said Howley &amp; Co., which was accordingly done. On said date the said councils passed a resolution consenting to the extension of the boundary line of Allegheny City, as provided by Act of 12th March 1867. No ordinance authorizing the grading and paving of said Bank lane was ever adopted by the councils of said borough, nor was any work done thereon prior to the 11th day of June 1868. On the 18th day \u25a0of March 1868, an Act of Assembly, entitled \u201cAn Act annexing a portion of Duquesne borough to Allegheny City,\u201d was approved. On the 11th day of June 1868, the councils of the \u25a0city of Allegheny adopted \u201cAn ordinance relating to certain contracts made by the late borough of Duquesne,\u201d and on the 23d day of July proximo, adopted another ordinance authorizing wooden curbing on Bank lane. The new contract authorized by ordinance of the 11th day of June 1868, was duly entered into. Bank lane was graded and paved, and a proper curbing placed on the river side for its protection; and said curbing was necessary for the proper support and protection of the street. An assessment was made under the laws of the city of Allegheny for said work against defendant\u2019s property. Said assessment included his proportion of the cost of said curbing, amounting to $171.57. Defendant has paid all his assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ment, except said.sum of $171.57, which he refuses to pay.

What the effect of such an extension would be upon existing contracts of the borough of Duquesne, as to the grading and paving of streets, is not a question here, because the contract of the borough with P. F. Howley &amp; Co. for the grading and paving of Bank lane, was rescinded by the parties, and a new contract entered into, under and by virtue of an ordinance of the city of Allegheny of June 11th 1868. The case stated finds expressly that such new contract was duly entered into. It is very plain that the grading and paving under this ordinance was subject to the Acts of Assembly in existence as to Allegheny City, and according to those acts \u201cthe city councils of the city of Allegheny shall have power by ordinance to grade and pave any street, lane or alley, or any parts thereof, within the corporate limits thereof, and shall have power to levy and collect a special tax for defraying the costs and expenses of the same by an equal assessment on the feet front bounding and abutting as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">The property-owners were no parties to the original contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of Ilowley &amp; Co. with Duquesne borough, and their consent was not necessary to its rescission : Marshall <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 9 P. E. Smith 455. If the laws relating to the city of Allegheny had required, as did those relating to the borough of Duquesne, the petition of a majority of the lot-holders before a street could be graded and paved, there would have been some reason for the contention that there could not be a new contract without a new petition, and that under the old petition the street could not be graded and paved, except subject to the condition that \u201csaid councils shall make or cause to be made, at the proper cost of the said borough, a good and permanent protection of the same on the south orAiver side of Bank lane.\u201d But as to Allegheny City no such petition is required. It is agreed by the case stated that the curbing in question was necessary for the proper support and protection of the street, and was therefore a proper part of the charge for paving, for which the defendant was liable: Schenley <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 12 Casey 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Judgment reversed; and now, judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant for the sum of $171.57, with interest from the 1st of January 1871.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
