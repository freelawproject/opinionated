Walker and Samuel Walker, partners, &amp;c. Arbitrators, under a rule of reference taken out by the plaintiff, found an award for $354.20 in his favor. The defendants entered an appeal, and according to the record, the costs were <em>\u201c </em>Paid prothonotary by defendants by draft.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-11\">On a rule to show cause on the application of the plaintiff, the court (Livingston, P.

The payment of the taxed costs is therefore indispensable to the perfection and validity of the appeal. But the prothonotary has no right to accept anything but money or cash in payment of costs ; and, therefore, no valid appeal can be taken from an award of arbitrators if the costs are paid by note, check or draft, or in anything but actual cash: Ellisen <em>v. </em>Buckley, 6 Wright 281; Carr <em>v. </em>McGovern, 16 P. F. Smith 457; Richter <em>v. </em>Cummings, not yet reported. And the reason given for this in Ellison <em>v. </em>Buckley, <em>supra, </em>is that each suit should terminate all its own, and not be the cause of other litigation, by the substitution of notes and credits for actual cash. It is time that it was understood that there can be no valid appeal unless the costs are actually paid in money.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-17\">Order striking off the appeal affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
