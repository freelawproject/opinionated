Judge Pearson, amongst other things, charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-11\">* * * \u201cWe come now to a much more difficult and important branch of this case: had the debt due to John Field by Daniel Williams ceased to be a lien on his land at the time of the sale ? If it had, the sheriff\u2019s deed confers no title. Prior to the 19th of April 1794, the lands of decedents were, to all intents and purposes, considered chattels for the payment of debts, and the lien thereof was indefinite as to time and extent, but embraced all the real estate of the decedent within the Commonwealth. On that day an act was passed limiting the lien as to time, but not as to extent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The statute requires that a demand shall be made, or an action for the recovery of the debt be commenced, and duly prosecuted against the executor or administrator, within the period of seven years from the death of the debtor ; or where the debt is not payable, a copy filed in the office of the prothonotary of the county where the lands lie, within that time. This act, with a slight alteration, was re-enacted on the 4th of April 1797. The original law was in force when Daniel Williams made his will, and therefore his debts came within its provisions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">\u201c Was the proceeding of John Field,' against the executors of Daniel Williams, in time to keep up <em>the </em>lien given by law against the estates of decedents ? * * * Everything connected with the case was a nullity, and when a regular judgment was obtained, the lien on the land was gone twice over. We considered on the former trial that the claim against the land was kept alive by the provisions of Daniel Williams\u2019s will,buttbe Supreme Court decided that this debt was not brought against the estate, \u2018 in due and lawful time,\u2019 and therefore could not be paid. That decision is conclusive on us, and our instruction is binding on you. We therefore say, that Field\u2019s judgment was not a lien on this land, consequently the plaintiffs have no title, and cannot recover. Their whole title depends on the judgment, and the sheriff\u2019s deed under it. * * * We consider that every question of any moment connected with this title, wras settled by the Supreme Court on the former trial. On the faith of that decision, the land passed through many hands, at very high prices, and purchasers should feel that they could rely on the decisions of our court of the last resort, either in buying or improving. <em>Stare decisis </em>is a very important principle in regard to land titles, and one to \u25a0which the good of the country requires that we should yield, whether it coincides with our original opinions or otherwise.\u201d * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">The verdict was for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">The plaintiffs took a writ of error and assigned the charge for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-10\"><em>F.

The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin county was reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded. When the cause had been remitted and was again ordered for trial in that court March 23d 1863, the plaintiffs suffered a nonsuit. The defendants then sold their interest to others, and it was finally vested in the Summit Branch Railroad Company. Six years after the nonsuit in the first ejectment, the present suit was commenced. The main question in that controversy, and the decision of which we are now asked to reconsider, arose upon the construction of the will of Daniel Williams. The determination cast no doubt whatever upon the principle so well settled in Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry, 8 Watts 504, and other cases which have followed in its wake, that when executors are directed by will to sell land for the payment of debts, a trust is created, and the limitation of the lien of debts upon the land of a decedent under the Acts of Assembly has no application. On the contrary that principle was distinctly recognised and re-affirmed, but the decision was rested on the peculiar phraseology of the will. It was held that the clause which directed that the proceeds of the sale should be appropriated to pay all just demands brought to the executors \u201cin due and lawful time,\u201d distinguished this case from all others, and constituted it an exception. \u201c Surely,\u201d said Mr. Chief Justice Lowrie, \u201c this clause is sufficient to show that the testator did not intend to supplant the temporary charge of the law by a permanent one of Ms own creation, for he refers to the \u2018 lawful time;\u2019 and moreover that is not mere formal language. He may not have known or thought of any special legal limitation, but his language shows that he was willing to trust to the law for a proper one. He dedicated his land for his debts just as the law dedicated it. We think, therefore, that the devise does not reject but retains the limitation in the Act of 1794 (repeated in 1797), and that this debt had ceased to be a lien or charge on the land at the time of the first effective process for its recovery, and consequently that the sale under the judgment passed no title to the purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">If there is any case to which the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>should be sternly applied, this is that case. Even if convinced that the former determination was clearly wrong, no court ought ever to overrule its own decision upon the very same title upon the faith of which purchasers have invested their money; more especially ought this rule to be adhered to when the decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>founded upon the construction of the words of a will, and forms no precedent except in a question arising upon a will in precisely the same language. If any counsel desirous of securing the legal limitation of the lien of debts, but at the same time of ordering a sale and creating a trust, should have followed the precise words of the will of Daniel Williams to accomplish the intention of the testator, his client, he would have had the best reason in the world to believe that he was safe. In every point of view it would be palpable injustice not only to the purchasers now before us, but to the profession and the public, to reconsider and overrule the former decision of the court. We affirm this judgment, on the authority of Buehler\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Buffington.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
