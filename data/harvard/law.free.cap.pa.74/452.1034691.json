Smith, guardian of Nancy J. Smith and others, minor children of Eliza A. Smith (formerly Yance), deceased. The question in the case was the construction of the residuary clause of the will of Samuel Harris, deceased, viz.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-13\">\u201cI give and bequeath unto my brother, William Harris, and sister, Anna Yance\u2019s heirs, the balance of my goods and chattels and credits and lands, equally, except Rev. John A. Yance, he must have all that he owes me at this time over and above the said heirs of William Harris and Anna Yance\u2019s heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-14\">At the making of the will William Harris and Anna Yance were both dead; William Harris left three children, Cynthia Murphy, Sarah B. Hope and Charlotte Hood; Anna Yance left six children, Rev. John A. Yance, William Yance, Nancy Yance, Lydia McClimond, Eliza A. Smith and Jane Gardner. Mrs. Smith afterwards died, leaving four minor children, of whom William J. Smith, the petitioner, is guardian. Jane Gardner also afterwards died leaving five children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-15\">The petition prayed for partition of the real estate into equal purparts amongst all the nephews and nieces of the testator. The daughters of William Harris answered the petition, averring that they were together entitled to one-half the real estate, and the children (and their descendants) of Anna Yance were together entitled only to one-half.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-16\">The Orphans\u2019 Court decreed that the real estate should be partitioned, \u201c giving to .the heirs of William Harris, deceased, the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>equal half thereof, and to the heirs of Anna Vance, deceased, the one equal half thereof according to the will of Samuel Harris, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">Smith, the guardian, and the other heirs of Anna Vance appealed to the Supreme Court, and assigned the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-7\"><em>J. McMichael </em>(with whom were <em>B. B. B. B. Kurtz), </em>for appellants. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajlb\">Under the intestate laws the nephews and nieces of the testator would take <em>per capita: </em>Miller\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 387; Krout\u2019s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith 380; and assuming that the construction here is doubtful the presumption is that the testator intended to leave the land to be distributed according to the intestate laws: Witmer <em>v. </em>Ebersole, 5 Barr 458; Bender\u2019s Appeal, 3 Grant 210.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-8\"><em>Bana Long, </em>for appellees. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQH\">The Statutes of Distribution fix who are intended by \u201cheirs\u201d of the brother and sister, but nothing more: McNeilledge <em>v. </em>Galbraith, 8 S. &amp; R. 45. The \u201cheirs \u201d were to take in classes: Miller\u2019s Appeal, 11 Casey 323; Minter\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 111; Gring\u2019s Appeal, 7 Casey 292; Risk\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. F.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered, January 5th 1874, by</p>\n<author id=\"b453-10\">Sharswood, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">The cases cited in the opinion of the learned court below undoubtedly sustain the position that as a principle of construction wheret\u00f3 a testator gives to his next of kin in classes, leaving it doubtful in what proportions they are to take, he will be presumed to have had the familiar rule of the Statute of Distributions in his mind, and the several classes will take not <em>per capita </em>but <em>per stirpes. </em>But all artificial rules of this kind must yield to the intention of the testator, whether expressed or implied. A comparison of Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 3 Barr 304; Witmer <em>v. </em>Ebersole, 5 Id. 458; and Risk\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. F. Smith 269, will evince this very clearly. Now whatever might have been the case had this residuary bequest been \u201c unto my brother William Harris and sister Anna Vance\u2019s heirs, the balance of my goods and chattels and credits and lands equally,\u201d we think the exception which follows indicates unmistakably that the testator had not in his mind two classes of legatees. \u201c Except Rev. John A. Vance, he must have all that he owes me at this time over and above the said heirs of William Harris and Anna Vance\u2019s heirs.\u201d Now the Rev. John, A. Vance, being one of the children of Anna Vance, stood in that class, and had the testator regarded these next of kin in. two classes, it is most reasonable to presume that the preference given to him would have been over the other heirs of that class, and not as it is over both classes. The exception seems to give a construction to the word \u201cequally \u201d immediately preceding, \u201c equally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>except Rev. John A. Yance,\u201d so as to preclude the interpretation which may be considered as sanctioned by Risk\u2019s Appeal, \u2014 that equally was to be applied only to the members of each class.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Decree reversed at the costs of the appellee, and record remitted to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Lawrence county, that a decree may be there entered conformably to this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
