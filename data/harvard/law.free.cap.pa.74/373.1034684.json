Hays and a large number .of other persons (naming them) of his intention to file the petition; and that Hays was the owner in fee simple of the land marked off for the landing. The petition then set out the courses and distances of the proposed road, and the names of landholders through whose lands it would pass. It described also the ground surveyed for the landing, viz.: beginning on the Monongahela river, thence westwardly 80 feet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>thence southwardly about 1200 feet, eastwardly 80 feet, northwardly 400 feet to the terminus of the railroad, and along the river and over Hays\u2019s land, northwardly 800 feet to the beginning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">The prayer was for viewers to view the route for the railroad, and also the premises described for the wharf and landing, and make report of their proceedings, &amp;c.

Briggs for public and private purposes,\u201d and assessed damages for the several landholders, amongst others to James H. Hays for the construction, &amp;c., of the road through his land at $5182.68. The viewers reported that they had \u201cmarked off a wharf of sufficient capacity to accommodate the trade of said railroad,\u201d viz.: beginning at the river, thence down the same northwardly 600 feet, thence westwardly 80 feet, thence southwardly 600 feet, thence eastwardly 80'feet to the beginning, the same having a front of 600 feet on said Monongahela river, and extending back, preserving the same width from same river 80 feet, being the upper half of lot of land marked on the map, &amp;c., of 1200 feet by 80 feet.\u201d They assessed the damages to be paid to Hays for this land at $30,750. They further reported that no part of this land was necessary for- the use of Hays, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-8\">Hays appealed from the report of the viewers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-9\">Briggs filed no exceptions, nor did he appeal from the report of the viewers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-10\">Upon this appeal othe court directed an issue, in which Hays should-be plaintiff and Briggs defendant. In the issue the plaintiff made the following averments:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-11\">1. That his damage by the railroad would be $20,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-12\">2. And by taking the wharf $150,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-13\">3. That plaintiff and not the defendant had the exclusive right to the location for a railroad described in said petition, because he, the said plaintiff, says, that being the owner of lands containing coal, lime-stone, &amp;c., situate within three miles of the Monongahela river, he surveyed, defined on the ground and adopted finally, the said location for the route of a railroad which he intended, and still intends, to construct from his said coal-lands to the said river, for the purpose of transporting over the same his said coal; and that said location was made by him in manner aforesaid, and for the purpose aforesaid, before said defendant had surveyed, marked and adopted finally said location as the .route of the proposed road, wherefore said plaintiff says that he, the said defendant, ought not to have or maintain the said proceeding for a lateral railroad as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-14\">4. That said land of plaintiff lying between the Pittsburg, Virginia and Charleston Railroad and the river aforesaid, is not the subject of appropriation by a stranger to the purpose of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>lateral railroad under the several Acts of Assembly, because he says said acts do not authorize the construction of such a railroad across any one of the series of public highways mentioned therein, in order to reach a more distant terminus, wherefore said plaintiff says said defendant is not entitled to construct said proposed railroad over said area of ground, or to have or maintain his said proceeding to that end.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-6\">5. That said viewers marked off and allowed to said defendant for a wharf or landing, a larger area than is necessary for that purpose, and more extensive than the Act of Assembly authorized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-7\">6. That the said wharf or landing as aforesaid is necessary to the plaintiff for his own uses or purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-8\">7. That the said wharf or landing as aforesaid is not necessary and useful to the defendant for public or private purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-9\">8. That the lateral railroad mentioned and set forth in said petition is not necessary and useful for-public or private purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-10\">9. That the petitioner, Thos. W.- Briggs, is not the owner of the coal and coal-mines mentioned and set forth as belonging to him in his aforesaid petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-11\">The defendant denied that the land mentioned in the first paragraph of the issue was of the value of $20,000. He denied all the -averments in the paragraphs from 2 to 8 inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-12\">He averred that he was the owner of the property set forth in the 9th paragraph.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-13\">\u25a0 The issue was tried March 12th 1873, before Kirkpatrick, J. On the trial Briggs, the defendant, by leave of the court, and under objection and exception, amended his petition as to the extent of the landing on the Monongahela river as follow's :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-14\">\u201c He disclaims any desire to take or appropriate, in this case, the following described portion of the landing or wharf mentioned or set out in his said petition, namely, beginning on the said river at the western or lower end of said, landing, as in his said petition named and marked on his plan attached thereto; thence running, &amp;c., * * * and thence down said river 367 feet to the place of beginning. But as to the residue of said wharf or landing (excluding the portion last described, viz.: 367 feet in length and 80 feet in width), he claims in this case to take and appropriate the same for the uses and purposes of his said proposed lateral railroad.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-15\">The testimony in the c\u00e1se was very, voluminous, the great proportion of it bearing on the necessity for the road and landing\u2014 and the necessity of Hays for the landing \u201cfor his own uses and purposes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-16\">On the question as to the amount of damages, Briggs, the defendant, offered to prove by A. D. Smith, \u201c that in 1859 he sold to James H. Hays a portion of river-landing on the south side of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Monongahela, on Pool No. 1, close to the landing or wharf proposed to be acquired by said Briggs, the price at which it was sold, and that since said sale the said landing, so sold to Hays has increased in value from that time until the time of filing the petition in this case, the rate of increase in value, from year to year, of said landing, what the cash value of the proposed landing was at the time of the filing of said petition, to be followed by evidence as to the increase generally of landings on Pool No. 1, for some years prior to the filing of said petition, to show the value of the proposed landing at the time said .Briggs sought to acquire it by the filing of his petition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-6\">The evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, admitted by the court and a bill of exceptions was sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-7\">The witness testified as to the matters inquired of in the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-8\">The defendant called Alexander Love, and, after preliminary inquiries, proposed to ask him: \u201c whether he has a landing in Pool No. 2, on the Monongahela river, one-half mile below Elizabeth, when he obtained the same, and the price paid for it; and, further, what the landing proposed to be taken by Thomas W. Briggs is fairly worth in the market, as compared with that of the witness.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-9\">The plaintiff objected to the offer, it was admitted by the court and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-10\">The witness testified that he had a right of way granted for a lateral railroad, and stated also the amount of damages he had to pay under an assessment by viewers. The landing ;was about fifteen miles from the landing claimed by Briggs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-11\">The defendant called Joseph Walton, who owned the uppermost coal works on Pool No. 2, about seventeen miles above the landing in controversy, and proposed to ask him, \u201c what he paid for the 1800 feet of landing alluded to in his evidence, at the head of Pool No. 2, and relatively what the fair market value of the river-landing proposed to be taken by said Briggs is worth as compared with it and other river landings near said Briggs\u2019s proposed landing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-12\">The plaintiff objected to the offer, it was admitted by the court and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-13\">The witness testified as to the matters inquired of in the offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-14\">The plaintiff called P. C. Devlin, who, having testified much at large as to the questions raised by the issues, was asked by plaintiff \u201c what the 300 acres of coal he has just spoken of belonging to James H. Hays, which should be taken out by his railroad down Beck\u2019s run, are worth, in connection with the landing which the defendant proposes to appropriate, and what they would be worth if the landing was taken from Hays.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-15\">The offer was objected to by the defendant, rejected by the court and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Plaintiff offered \u201cthe report of tbe .viewers, so far as tbe same relates to the area of ground allotted to said Briggs as a wharf or landing, at the terminus of his proposed road in connection therewith, for the purpose of showing how much ground was actually allotted by the viewers for the purpose aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">The defendant objected to the offer, it was rejected by the court and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-7\">The following are points of the plaintiff with their answers:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-8\">2. Inasmuch as the uncontradicted evidence in the cause shows that the proposed lateral railroad is intersected between the terminal points thereof, where it traverses the land of said Hays, a few hundred yards from the Monongahela river, by the Pittsburg, Virginia and Charleston Railway; that said railway was located finally over said land in the fall of 1869, the lettings made, and the work of construction begun in June 1871, and is now and has been for six months past in active running operation from its terminus on the Pan Handle road eastwardly along the valley of the Monongahela for the distance of ten miles, the said Briggs has no authority under the lateral railroad law, to construct or operate said proposed road over the land of said Hays intermediate said public railway and said river, or to appropriate any portion thereof for a wharf or landing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-9\">Answer: \u201c This point is declined. The mere fact of the intersection of the proposed lateral railroad by the Pittsburg, Virginia and Charleston Railway, as suggested by the point, would not of itself take away the authority of the petitioner to construct his lateral railroad over the lands of J. H. Hays, between the said Pittsburg, Virginia and Charleston Railway and the Monongahela river, nor would it of itself prevent his appropriation of a portion of the same for a wharf or landing providing he has the authority otherwise so to do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-10\">3. The proposed lateral road being intersected or cut in manner aforesaid, between its terminal points, the continuity of it is thereby destroyed, and the said petitioner has failed in his case, both in resp.ect to road and landing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-11\">4. The viewers alone, and not the court and jury, have the' power to mark off a wharf or landing to be allotted to a petitioner for a lateral railroad; and the report of the viewers marking off a wharf or landing in this case, not having been put in evidence, the subject of a wharf or landing is not before the jury, and they hav\u00e9 no power to render a verdict in relation to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-12\">These points were declined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-13\">5. The Acts of Assembly relating to the acquisition of wharves or landings, do not authorize the taking of private prbperty for harbors, either in connection with, or independently of a lateral railroad; and if the said Acts of Assembly do authorize such appropriation of private property, they- are, both in the view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the Constitution of the United States, and of the state of Pennsylvania, void and of none effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">Answer: \u201c Affirmed with the qualification to the 6th point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">6. All the ground the Acts of Assembly authorized to be taken for a wharf or landing is just so much as shall be reasonably necessary for loading or unloading such craft as usually navigate the water on which the lateral railroad terminates, and no more: they do not authorize the taking of ground for harbors for either empty or loaded craft.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-8\">Answer : \u201c We cannot say that we are prepared to affirm, and so must decline this point as it is presented. We consider it too broad. We are however of opinion, and so instruct you, that the amount of ground which may be taken for a wharf or landing, under the provisions of the Act of Assembly, is such and so much as will be of sufficient capacity to accommodate the trade of the lateral railroad, so much and no more than is reasonably necessary to a proper, fair and legitimate use, occupation and exercise of the privileges and benefits of the road so created. Less than this we think would defeat the clearest purposes and intention of the statute, and more especially that portion of its provisions which the wharf and landing feature of the act was intended to subserve; whilst a greater allowance would be a clear infringement of the right of private property and in manifest derogation of a fair add proper interpretation of the letter and spirit of the law, and should receive no encouragement by the verdict of the jury. These limitations we beg the jury to apply to our affirmation of the last or fifth point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-9\">7. The burden of showing the necessity for said proposed road is on the petitioner, and as there is no evidence in the cause showing any necessity, general or special, for extending the same over and beyond the Pittsburg, Virginia and Charleston Railway to said river, the case has failed in respect to that portion of said road, and also in respect to the wharf or landing, and the court will so instruct the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-10\">Answer: \u201cWe have already in our general charge affirmed the proposition of law claimed in this point, and do so now that the' burden of showing the necessity for the proposed road is on the petitioner. This proposition and this portion of the point cannot be gainsaid. But we decline, as further requested, to instruct you that there is no evidence in the cause showing any necessity general or special for extending the proposed lateral railroad over and beyond the Pittsburg, Virginia and Charleston Railway to the Monongahela river. This we leave as a question of fact exclusively to the jury to be by them determined from all the evidence in the cause, again repeating that the burden of showing this fact, as also the fact of the necessity of the road, rests with and is by the law wholly put upon the petitioner.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>17. The p\u00e1per filed by Thomas W. Briggs, purporting to be a disclaimer of his right to take the lower portion of said proposed landing, is in legal effect a discontinuance of the entire proceedings'as respects both road and landing, and if not of both, of the landing at least.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">Answer: \u201c This point is declined.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">The court in the charge, amongst other things, said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">* .* * <em>\u201c </em>[It will be observed the words of the statute are <em>\u2018 </em>uses and purposesthus, as it would seem to me, suggesting a something in the present and also in the future. A <em>use </em>of a thing-signifies and means the acting, handling or employing in any manner, and for any purpose, but especially for a profitable purpose, thus implying the <em>immediate </em>or <em>present </em>occupation or enjoyment of anything. A <em>purpose </em>means and implies intention, design; that which a person sets before himself as an object <em>to be </em>reached or accomplished, the end or aim to 'tfhich the view is directed in any plan, measure or exertion. Thus implying something contemplated or to be done <em>in the future. </em>Now has the owner of this wharf or landing satisfied you that it is so necessary for him, for his own fair, proper and legitimate uses and purposes ? that is, not only for his <em>present </em>or immediate uses, but also for his <em>future </em>designs, plans or purposes ? We are of the opinion, and so instruct you, that he is entitled under the statute to the benefit of both of these terms in their largest and most comprehensive sense. We think the statute so intended.] If he has, as we have already told you, this ends all other or future\u201econtroversy about the wharf or landing, and it has no other or further part nor lot in your deliberations in regard to it. We express no opinion, but leave it wholly to the jury, by whom, and by whom only, it is to be determined. But it may be, as claimed by the petitioner Briggs, that the owner has wholly failed in so satisfying you. If he has, then other and important questions present themselves. [The first question naturally to be considered by you,- then, will be (assuming that you have found that the land is not necessary to the owner, and that the petitioner Briggs is entitled-to one), how much of a landing shall be allotted to him ? ShalHt be the whole, as claimed \u2014that is twelve hundred feet, less the three hundred and sixty-seven feet disclaimed by him in front of Williamsburg, which would leave eight hundred and thirty-three feet \u2014 or shall it be any other distance less than this, and if so, how much less. This also is a question wholly for the jury, in the light of <em>all </em>the evidence bearing upon it. They are not limited, and may allot such and so much as they may deem just and right to a proper and reasonable use, occupation and enjoyment of the lateral railroad, in and of which, and to the fair, reasonable and proper enjoyment and use of which the wharf or landing was and is intended. This we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>have said in answer to one of defendant\u2019s points, and so say here and now as our instructions to you in this regard, should be the rule and measure by which you should allot and set apart the wharf or landing to the petitioner, in case you come to the conclusion from all the evidence that he is fairly and justly entitled to one.]\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">The jury found a special verdict, answering the several issues categorically, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">1 and 2. They found that Hays, the plaintiff, owned the land proposed to be taken for the railroad and for the wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">3. They found for Briggs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">4.

The viewers allowed Mr. Briggs a strip of ground on the margin of the Monongahela river, six hundred feet long by eighty feet wide, for a wharf or landing. To this allowance Briggs filed no exceptions involving the extent of the area, so far as we have discovered. Hays, however, took an appeal principally on the ground disclosed by the issue formed upon his appeal, that the viewers laid off too large an area, that he himself needed the ground for his own uses and purposes, and that it was not necessary to Briggs for public or private purposes. In his petition Briggs had claimed twelve hundred feet on the river, and on the trial asked to amend by disclaiming three hundred and sixty-seven feet in length, and claiming to appropriate the remainder, eight hundred and thirty-three feet. On the trial the court permitted Briggs to claim, and the jury to find, this remainder, the verdict returning it as eight hundred and thirty-five feet and 29-100 front on the river, and eighty feet back from the same. In this there was error. The appeal under the Act of 17th November 1871, 2 Bright. Dig. 1241, pi. 148, was confined to the assessment of damages, the necessity of the wharf or landing to the applicant, and the necessity of the owner of the ground to retain it for his own uses and purposes; and if the last be found the wharf or landing shall not be taken from him. The viewers, under the Act of 24th April 1843, 2 Bright. Dig. 1239, pi. 139, must go upon the ground, view it and mark off the portion of land to be allotted as a wharf or landing, and'fiK the compensation to the owner. The case of Horner <em>v. </em>Roberts\u2019s Lateral Railroad, 1 Wright 333, held, that the appeal extended to the question of compensation only, and not to location, or necessity. This defect in the law was remedied by the Act of 1871, so far as to extend the appeal to the questions of necessity to the applicant and necessity to the owner; but not to, embrace that of location, which was left where it stood before, under the Act of 1843. The argument that this leaves the petitioner without remedy when the viewers allow him too little or no ground for his wharf or landing, is unfounded. The report of the viewers is subjected to the approval of the court, and this confers the right of exception upon either party. It is on this right of exception Judge Strong relies in basing the right of appeal in Horner <em>v. </em>Roberts\u2019s Road, a right given beyond the privilege of exception, as the means of having the question of compensation tried by a jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>If Mr. Briggs thought the six hundred feet laid off to him by the viewers were too little for his necessity, he could have filed exceptions, and if successful the court would have award\u00e9d a new view. Possibly he also might have appealed, but as to this we give no opinion. But when Hays appealed on the ground that the viewers had allowed more ground to Briggs than his necessity required for his actual railroad, the issue was confined to the six hundred feet laid off. This issue involved the necessity of the whole and every part of it, and the jury might have allowed him less, but could not allow him more, upon this issue. What might have been proper in case both parties had appealed, we do not say.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The question of a harbor for boats, is also important. The plaintiff\u2019s fifth and sixth points asked a direct instruction against the right to take ground for a harbor, distinct from the land necessary for the wharf or landing. To this request no answer in distinct terms was given, but the court declined the points as too broad. The latter part of the fifth point presented only an alternative in case the answer was adverse to the former point. The sixth point presented the question squarely that the petitioner was not entitled to take ground for a harbor for either empty or loaded craft. The purpose of a wharf or landing for loading and unloading boats engaged in the coal trade, is different from that of a harbor or place to lay up boats empty or laden. This is especially true of the coal business on the Monongahela, in view of the magnitude of the barges used and the length of time often required to keep them in harbor before a boating stage of water arrives to take them out, and to carry them down the Ohio. It appears that often before such a stage or .flood occurs, these coal-barges and coal-boats are collected in large fleets and lie moored along the shore or in the river. Now, clearly the privilege of a wharf or landing to load these boats with coal from the mines was not intended to confer a right to harbor them all along the lands of others, to wait the coming freshets. The error of the court was not so much in what was said, as in what was left unsaid, when specially called to state to the; jury the difference between a right to take land for wharfage or landing, and land for harborage.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The position of Mr. Hays\u2019s counsel that the lateral railroad could not pass over the Virginia and Charleston Railway to reach the slackwater navigation of the Monongahela cannot be sustained. There is nothing in the language of the law necessarily requiring such an interpretation, and certainly nothing in the reason of the thing to'demand it. In going to the slackwater navigation the very words of the law are fulfilled, while the nature of the coal trade, its great magnitude and its market all demand a water transportation, and these require a reasonable interpretation of the law to make it beneficial and to accomplish its true intent in aid of trade. The question of crossing at grade, or how the crossing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>shall be effected, concerns different parties. The point we decide is that the lateral railroad may pass beyond a carrying railroad to reach a canal or slackwater navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We discover no real error in the definition the court gave to the words in the act \u2014 \u201c his own uses and purposes.\u201d The intention of the Act of 1871 was to protect the owner of the ground in the enjoyment of it, when he himself needed it. It is only when his uses and purposes do not require it to be retained, that another is permitted to divert it to his use. The owner of ground on the margin of a river, necessary for the loading of coal from his own immediately adjacent coal-lands, ought not to be deprived of its use, merely because he has not yet constructed his wharves and his railroad to them; if it be manifest that this is the very purpose for which he seeks to retain it. If it be necessary to bring his own products to market when he opens his mines, clearly he should not be deprived of his right to the enjoyment of his own property in a reasonable time and manner. He may not, perhaps, like the dog in the manger, keep others at bay, and yet intend to make no use of the thing itself. But if it be a bond fide intended use, the law should not be so construed as to trench upon his right to enjoy his own reasonably in his own way and at his own time. The want of capital, encumbrances and many other circumstances may compel him to defer present improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In regard to the exceptions to the offers of evidence relating to the damages, we think in. some of them the court opened the door to a wider range than the law permits. The rule laid down in East Penn. R. R. <em>v. </em>Heister, 4 Wright 53, and followed in Pittsburg, Virginia and Charleston Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Rose, at this term, <em>antea </em>362, is the value as estimated by witnesses in view of its location, productiveness or other uses not speculative, or as denoted by the market value or selling price of lands in the neighborhood ; and this selling price I understand to be the general selling price, and not that of a particular sale. It will not do to fix the market value by special, and it may be exceptional cases. Of such a test Thompson, J., said in Heister\u2019s case, it will not do, for, if allowed, such special instance adduced on one side must be permitted to be assailed, and its merits investigated on the other ; and thus, there would be as many branching issues as instances, which, if numerous, would prolong the contest interminably. Such testimony does not disclose the public and general estimate. The offer to prove, by A. D. Smith, a sale in 1859, was incompetent, not only because of its repugnance to the rule as to special instances, but by reason of its long antecedent time, and the necessity of filling up the gap in time, by evidence to bring it down to the proper date. The proposed testimony of Alexander Love was objectionable as evidence of a special instance, and also because it was the case of an appraisement by viewers involving all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the circumstances of that case, and the benefits to be set off. The testimony of Joseph Walton was incompetent for similar reasons. The testimony of P. L. Devlin, so far as it bore on the question of the value of the three hundred acres as a measure of damages, was not competent; but as it had also a' bearing on the question of the necessity of James II. Hays to retain the landing for the benefit of his adjacent three hundred acres, it may have had some relevancy. In regard to the distances of the different landings from the <em>locus in </em>quo, we do not say they were too far off to assist the witnesses in forming their judgment of the general market value of grounds in the neighborhood for such uses. Wharves' and landings are confined to the river shore, and the business along the Monongahela is similar to that of Mr. Briggs. A witness estimating the general market value of such lands in the neighborhood may be permitted to range further from the lands in question than in a ease of ordinary neighborhood value of farms or lots. But his range of thought in estimating a general market value is a very different thing from his being permitted to testify to special instances of sales at any distance, near or remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
