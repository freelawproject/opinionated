Foster, late of Harris township, deceased, and William Foster, of said township, in his own right, respectfully represents: That the said Robert M. Foster and William Foster, on the 23d day of October, A. d. 1861, -executed their bond and mortgage to William H. Wapples and Daniel Brantigam, executors of the last will and testament of John Porter, late of Northumberland county, Pa., deceased, in the penal sum of seventeen thousand six hundred and fifty-four dollars, conditioned for the payment of the sum of eight thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven dollars, on the 23d day of October 1871, with interest thereon semi-annually to the ruling elders of the First Presbyterian Church in the borough of Northumberland, by them to be appropriated according to the intent, terms and directions of the last will and testament of the said decedent, reference, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">\u201c That your petitioners have paid the interest on said mortgage, in full, up to October 23d 1871, leaving*due from your petitioners the principal sum of eight thousand eight hundred and twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>seven dollars, with interest from October 23d 1871, to December 5th 1871, which is sixty-one dollars and seventy-nine cents, making the whole amount due from your petitioners, principal and interest, the sum of eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars and seventy-nine cents. That there has a dispute arisen between Wm. H. Wapples, the surviving executor of the said John Porter, deceased, and the ruling elders of the Presbyterian Church of Northumberland, as to whom this said money or fund rightfully and legally belongs, and to whom the same should be paid, and written notices have been served on your petitioners by the said Wm. H. Wapples and the said ruling elders as aforesaid, both claiming this money, and the said Wm. H. Wapples, surviving executor of John Porter, deceased, has instituted a suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Centre county, to No. \u2014, November T. 1871, against your petitioners for the recovery of the amount due on said bond. As your petitioners do not know, in view of these facts, who is entitled to receive the money and to whom the same should be legally paid, would ask leave of the court to pay the aforesaid sum of eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars and seventy-nine cents, the amount due on said bond and mortgage, into court, and that said court will order and direct the recorder of mortgages in and for Centre county, to enter satisfaction on said mortgage, and also to direct the prothonotary of Centre county, to discontinue the aforesaid suit against your petitioners and to make such further disposition in the premises as your Honors shall deem fit and proper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">The executor, Wapples, protested against the application, for reasons set out in a paper filed by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">On this petition the court on the 22d of January 1872 granted a rule upon William H.

The said security to consist of a bond and a mortgage drawn in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>name of and payable to \u2018 The First Presbyterian Church of Northumberland,\u2019 Pennsylvania, the interest on said sum so invested to be payable semi-annually to the ruling elders of the said <em>\u2018 </em>First Presbyterian Church\u2019 and their suec\u00e9ssors in office for ever, to be by them appropriated according to the terms and direction contained in the last will and testament of John Porter, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">The executor, Wap pies, appealed to the Supreme Court and assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">1. Allowing the amount of the mortgage to be paid into court and ordering satisfaction to be entered on the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-8\">2.

L. 871,1 Br. Purd. 481, pi. 118. The surviving executor was trustee of the fund and entitled to it: Tyson\u2019s Appeal, 3 Barr 363. The jurisdiction over the fund was in-the courts of Northumberland county: Brown\u2019s Appeal, 2 Jones 333.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-11\">There was no paper-book or argument on the other side. <em>J. M. Orvis </em>and <em>J. A. Beaver </em>were of counsel with the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b103-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered, July 2d 1873, by</p>\n<author id=\"ANWH\">Mercur, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A9d\">We see no error in permitting the mortgagors to pay into court the amount due upon the mortgage, and in ordering satisfaction to be entered upon the mortgage. The sum paid was the full amount claimed by the appellant, and he was in no wise prejudiced by its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">When, however, the court went further; when, against \u2022 the protest of the mortgagee, the court ordered the money to be invested in the name, and for the benefit of a third party, it exceeded its powers. It had no such jurisdiction over the trustee, nor over the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">The appellant was the surviving executor and trustee under the will of John Porter, at the time of the execution of said will, and at the death of the testator, he and the executors were residents of the county of Northumberland. The church for whose use and benefit the fund was devised, then was and still is in the same county. The will was proved in said county, and letters testamentary thereon were granted by the register thereof. The Orphans\u2019 Court of Northumberland county thereby acquired jurisdiction of their accounts. The executors were made trustees <em>ratione officii </em>and not <em>nominativa. </em>It was a trust annexed to the office of executor, which they accepted by taking letters testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>mentary, and are bound as executors to fulfil. They are amenable to the Orphans\u2019 Court as' executors for the non-performance of that, as well as of other trusts imposed by the will: Innes\u2019 Estate, 4 Whart. 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The 15th section of the Act of 14th June 1836, Purd. Dig. 1417, pi. 15, which gives to the Courts of Common Pleas jurisdiction in cases of trust therein mentioned, not only restricts its exercise to \u201cthe Court of Common Pleas of the county in which any such trustee shall have resided at the commencement of the trust,\u201d but it further provides, \u201cthat nothing therein Contained shall extend to trusts created by will or vested in executors or administrators, either by the words of the will, or by the provisions or operations of law, whenever such executors or administrators are by the existing laws amenable to the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In Wheatly <em>v. </em>Badger, 7 Barr 459, it was held, that where the will constitutes the executor a trustee, by <em>name, </em>and not <em>virtute officii, </em>the Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction over the trust. But in Brown\u2019s Appeal, 2 Jones 333, that decision was overruled, and .it was held, that although the trustees are appointed <em>nominatim, </em>yet the Orphans\u2019 Court had concurrent jurisdiction with the Common Pleas in cases of testamentary trusts; that the object of the statute of 14th June 1836, was to <em>give </em>power to the Common Pleas, and not <em>to take </em>it from the Orphans\u2019 Court. It gives to the Common Pleas concurrent jurisdiction, except in cases where, by the proviso, jurisdiction is saved exclusively to the Orphans\u2019 Court: Seibert\u2019s Appeal, 7 Harris 53. Where the testamentary trust is given to the executors <em>virtute officii, </em>jurisdiction is exclusively in the Orphans\u2019 Court: Innes\u2019 Estate, <em>supra; </em>Brown\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra; </em>Seibert\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>Since the last of these decisions was made, the first section of the Act of 7th April 1859, Purd. Dig. 1423, pl. 54, has given to the Orphans\u2019 Courts of the several counties of this Commonwealth, full power and authority in all eases of trust derived under or created by any last will and testament, whether vested in executors or trustees, to dismiss such trustees from office, when there has been waste or mismanagement in the administration of said trust, or whenever the trustees shall fail or neglect to pay over the principal or income of the trust funds according to their duty under their several trusts, or fail to comply with any order of said courts in relation to said trusts; and shall further have power to make all orders for the securities and moneys belonging to said trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The will of John Porter directs, \u201c that my executors hereafter mentioned shall dispose of and sell all of the aforesaid bank stock;\u201d and \u201c when disposed of, sold by, my executors, they shall loan the proceeds,\u201d and that \u201cmy executors shall have written out the bond and mortgage.\u201d Thus, every act which the testator directed to be performed for the purpose of passing this fund over to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ruling elders for the use and benefit.of the church, was to be per formed by the executors <em>virtute officii. </em>Hence, it follows, that even the Court of Common Pleas of Northumberland county, where the executor resided, had no jurisdiction over this trust fund, and still less authority is there for the Court of Common Pleas of Centre county assuming its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The learned judge, therefore, erred in taking the funds out of the control of the appellant, and directing their investment. The rights of the several claimants to this fund must be-settled in and through the Orphans\u2019 Court of Northumberland county. There the appellant must settle his stewardship. To enable him to do this the fund must be restored to him. This disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to consider the other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">This cause came on for hearing on an appeal from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre county, and was argued by counsel at Harrisburg, and now, July 2d 1873, on mature consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the said order of the Common Pleas, permitting the ruling elders of the First Presby- , terian Church of Northumberland, to take the said sum of $8971.75 out of court, and( directing'its investment, be reversed and set aside, and that the rule granted to said elders be dismissed at their costs. And it is further ordered that the said trust fund be paid over to the appellant, and the costs of this appeal be paid.out'of the same; and the cause is remanded to the said Common Pleas with directions to carry this decree into execution.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-6\">Sharswood and Williams, JJ., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
