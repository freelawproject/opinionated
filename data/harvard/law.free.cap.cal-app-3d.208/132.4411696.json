Code, \u00a7 211). In addition, it was found that defendant personally used a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, 1203.06, subd. (a)(1)). It was further found that defendant had suffered three prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a) and that he had previously served a prior prison term within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b). He was sentenced to state prison for the high base term of five years plus a two-year enhancement for the use allegation. He was also sentenced to an additional five years on each of the three serious felony convictions (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (a)) plus one year for the prior prison term (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Issue Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The sole issue presented on this appeal, as framed by the defendant\u2019s brief, is whether the \u201cimposition of two five-year enhancements for two [of the three] prior convictions, which could have been brought and tried together in a single proceeding, violated [his] right to equal protection.\u201d He also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was ordered to be considered concurrently with the present appeal. In his petition he raises the same issue as on the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Of the two prior serious felonies at issue here, the first was a robbery, with a gun, of a supermarket in Torrance on August 16, 1983. A complaint was issued on August 18, 1983. On September 30, 1983, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to state prison for six years. The second was a robbery, with a gun, of a supermarket in Van Nuys on August 14, 1983. A complaint was issued on October 25, 1983,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on November 7, 1983, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to state prison for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">At sentencing in the present case, the court imposed an additional five-year term for each of these two prior convictions pursuant to Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That section mandates that any person convicted of a \u201cserious felony\u201d must receive a consecutive five-year enhancement \u201cfor each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Defendant contends that section 667, subdivision (a) violates the equal protection clauses of the federal and state Constitutions because it punishes for prior serious felony convictions differently depending upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>whether the priors were consolidated into one proceeding or were \u201cbrought and tried separately.\u201d He argues that two defendants with identical prior felony convictions can receive different punishments under section 667, subdivision (a), not because of any difference in culpability, but simply because \u201cthe prosecutor in one case has chosen to try the defendant\u2019s priors separately while the prosecutor in the other has chosen to try them together\u201d in one information. Defendant asserts that he is in that class of serious felony recidivists whose prior convictions could have been, but were not, brought and tried together in a single proceeding; that both of his 1983 prior convictions were for the same offense and both occurred in Los Angeles County only two days apart. Consequently, he argues, they \u201ccould have been\u201d brought and tried together in a single proceeding under the permissive joinder statute, Penal Code section 954.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We initially note that it is only by resort to gross speculation that it can be concluded that defendant\u2019s 1983 charges \u201ccould have been\u201d consolidated for trial had the prosecutor so elected. Defendant\u2019s crimes were committed in different jurisdictions in Los Angeles County and the cases were filed in two different Los Angeles County Judicial Districts, South Bay and Los Angeles (Van Nuys Branch Court). The complaint for the August 16, 1983, robbery was issued on August 18, 1983. The complaint for the August 14, 1983, robbery was not issued until October 25, 1983, almost one month after defendant was sentenced for the August 16th robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">There is nothing in the record that shows the filing deputy in the South Bay Judicial District was aware that defendant had committed another robbery in another judicial district two days before the August 16th robbery. Moreover, the second complaint (for the Van Nuys robbery) was not issued until after the defendant had already been sentenced on the first complaint, and there is no showing as to why the second complaint was filed a month after the victim identified the defendant in a photo lineup. In addition, and most importantly, it does not appear that a motion to consolidate the two cases was made by the defendant\u2019s attorney at any time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>we cannot determine that a decision was ever made, or even considered, on the question of the consolidation of these two crimes for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It is true that future punishments may differ as to two defendants depending on whether earlier offenses had been consolidated or tried separately. However, whether such crimes are consolidated for trial is not totally dependent upon prosecutorial discretion. Defendant may, if he so desires, make a motion for consolidation and, under Penal Code section 954, it is in the court\u2019s discretion as to whether to order the different offenses be tried together.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Unless joinder is prohibited or severance is permitted for good cause, joinder of two or more offenses is required if they are related and the prosecution is or should be aware of such fact. Offenses are related where the same act or course of conduct plays a significant part in each. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 654, 954; <em>Kellett </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 822, 827 [48 Cal.Rptr. 366, 409 P.2d 206]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tirado </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 341, 354 [198 Cal.Rptr. 682].)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Where the offenses are not related, then the question of joinder becomes a matter of judicial discretion. However, as to the timing of the filing of unrelated charges, prosecutorial discretion is basic to the framework of the California criminal justice system. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tirado, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d at pp. 352-353; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 335, 344-345 [228 Cal.Rptr. 87].) This discretion, though recognized by statute in California, is founded upon constitutional principles of separation of powers and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 406, 408-411 [215 Cal.Rptr. 203],* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court held there was no equal protection violation by vesting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the prosecution the discretionary authority to charge a prior serious felony under either Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b) (one-year enhancement) or Penal Code section 667 (five-year enhancement). The court stated: \u201cThe crime-charging power is vested in the public prosecutor by Government Code section 26501. \u2018Prosecutors have a great deal of discretion in this crime-charging function. Charging discretion takes three basic forms: (1) evidentiary sufficiency\u2014a determination of whether the evidence warrants prosecution; (2) charge selection\u2014a determination of the appropriate charge or charges; and (3) discretion not to prosecute\u2014a determination of whether there is an alternative to formal criminal prosecution.\u2019 (Knapp, Prosecutorial Discretion (Cont.Ed.Bar 1979) \u00a7 11, p. 5.)\u201d An unbroken line of cases in California has recognized the district attorney\u2019s discretionary power in the crime-charging function and its insulation from control by the courts. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.3d at p. 344.) Consequently, as a matter of pleading, the district attorney can allege what he chooses at the time he chooses, subject only to the compulsory joinder rules under <em>Kellett </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 822, 826-827.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Batchelder </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 114, 125 [60 L.Ed.2d 755, 766, 99 S.Ct. 2198], the court held that when a prosecutor makes a charging determination, which determination may have been influenced by the penalties available upon conviction, that fact alone does not give rise to a violation of the equal protection clause. \u201cJust as a defendant has no constitutional right to elect which of two applicable federal statutes shall be the basis of his indictment and prosecution, neither is he entitled to choose the penalty scheme under which he will be sentenced. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Nor does Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a), by restricting a five-year enhancement to only those charges \u201cbrought and tried separately,\u201d deny equal protection to defendant.  \u201cThe first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more <em>similarly situated </em>groups in an unequal manner. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 530 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549]; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 797, 801 [204 Cal.Rptr. 234].) \u201cThe equal protection clause does not assure defendant of the same treatment as all other felons; it assures him only . . . that he will receive like treatment with all other persons similarly situated. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Enriquez </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 221, 229 [137 Cal.Rptr. 171, 561 P.2d 261, 3 A.L.R.4th 73].)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201cNeither the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States nor the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 7; art. IV, \u00a7 16) precludes legislative classification with respect to persons who are different. [Citation]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 802.) What is required is that similarly situated persons with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law, receive like treatment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a) creates two separate classes of serious felony recidivists: those whose prior serious felonies were brought and tried separately and those whose prior serious felonies were consolidated into one proceeding. In each group all persons are treated equally. Defendant, however, argues that a third class of offenders should be created, namely, \u201cthat class of serious felony recidivists whose prior convictions <em>could have been, </em>but were not, brought and tried together in a single proceeding.\u201d He asserts that the statute discriminates between his group of \u201ccould-have-beens\u201d and the group that did in fact have their prior serious felonies consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">However, defendant has chosen a class that is incapable of being determined with any accuracy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In order for a trial court to find that a defendant would fall into the class of \u201ccould-have-beens,\u201d the court must first determine how the trial court in the prior cases (cases concluded years before) would have exercised its discretion. As noted above, consolidation is not automatic and the court has wide discretion in making this determination. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 170-171 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480].) Furthermore, in most instances, as in the present case, there would be no factual basis in the record <em>on </em>which to speculate that defendant would have been successful had he moved to consolidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Clearly, Penal Code section 667 does not establish classifications which treat similarly situated groups in disparate ways. Defendant is in one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>classes of felons\u2014recidivist serious offenders whose prior felonies were brought and tried separately\u2014and he is treated the same as all others in that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the statute satisfies a strict scrutiny standard of equal protection review. The state has a compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in preventing and punishing recidivism. Its focus on \u201cserious\u201d felonies furthers that interest, and the limitation of Penal Code section 667 to only those cases which were brought and tried separately does not result in a denial of equal protection. As noted in <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 471, 486-487 [25 L.Ed.2d 491, 503, 90 S.Ct. 1153], \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause does not require that a State must choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all. [Citation.]\u201d (Accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 944, 950 [217 Cal.Rptr. 616].)  \u201cThe Legislature is not bound, in order to adopt a constitutionally valid statute, to extend it to all cases which might possibly be reached, but is free to recognize degrees of harm and to confine its regulation to those classes of cases in which the need is deemed to be the most evident.\u201d <em>(Board of Education </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 829, 833 [48 Cal.Rptr. 481, 409 P.2d 481]; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>at p. 950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Since there is no equal protection violation, the court properly imposed the enhancements under Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The judgment is affirmed; the petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Klein, P.

The prosecution is not required to elect between the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading, but the defendant may be convicted of any number of the offenses charged, and each offense of which the defendant is convicted must be stated in the verdict or the finding of the court; provided, that the court in which a case is triable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion order that the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading be tried separately or divided into two or more groups and each of said groups tried separately. An acquittal of one or more counts shall not be deemed an acquittal of any other count.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">It should be emphasized that a defendant is always the person in the best position to call this particular problem to the attention of his attorney and the court since he is obviously the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>one with full knowledge of all of the crimes with which he was or could be charged. However, we are also aware that it is the accused who usually resists consolidation of multiple criminal charges in order to avoid any potential prejudicial connection between crimes and to negate the possibility that in a consolidated trial the spillover effect from one charge might alter the outcome on some other charge. Thus, the defendant in the present case may have consciously chosen not to bring the August 14th crime to anyone\u2019s attention. This is particularly likely here since the record shows the complaint for the August 14th robbery had not yet been issued at the time he pleaded guilty to the August 16th robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b149-15\">In <em>Wallace, </em>pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain, defendant entered a plea of guilty to voluntary manslaughter, and as part of his sentence, received a five-year enhancement under Penal Code section 667 for a previous conviction of a serious felony. Defendant appealed, contending that section 667 violated his right to equal protection. He argued that because of the overlap between section 667.5, subdivision (b) and section 667, different punishment can result for persons similarly situated in that a person in defendant\u2019s situation would receive an enhancement of only one year if the prior robbery conviction is charged under section 667.5, subdivision (b), but would receive an enhancement of five years if the same prior is charged under section 667.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In <em>Wallace, </em>the court observed that the equal protection clauses in the federal and state Constitutions preclude \u201cintentional and purposeful\u201d invidious discrimination in the enforcement of penal laws. However, no such claim is made in the present case and there is nothing in this record that would support such a claim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d at p. 411.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Although not argued in his briefs, the following assertions were made at oral argument: (1) that the purpose of section 667 was to impose harsher sentences on \u201crecidivists\u201d; (2) that defendant was not truly a \u201crecidivist\u201d at the time of his second prior since there was not an intervening punishment between his first prior and his second prior; and (3) that although the language \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d seems to be clear, there must have been a \u201cdraftsman\u2019s oversight\u201d because this language results in unequal treatment of defendants identically situated in terms of the number of priors. However, as discussed <em>ante, </em>section 667 does not treat similarly situated groups in disparate ways. The language of the statute is quite clear: A five-year enhancement will be imposed \u201cfor each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separately.\u201d It does not require intervening punishment between the commitments of the priors, and it specifically states in subdivision (b): \u201cThere is no requirement of prior incarceration or commitment for this section to apply.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the result of this language is not absurd. If the enhancement were only to be imposed if there had been an intervening prison term, it would have been so worded. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5 wherein the punishment for prison terms for new offenses is enhanced because of prior prison terms.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
