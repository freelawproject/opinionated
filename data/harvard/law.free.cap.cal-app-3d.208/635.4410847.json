Cervisi, Muriel Bartholomew, and other part-time, hourly employees of real party in interest San Francisco Community College District sought unemployment benefits for the period between fall and spring semesters when none of the respondents were working. Appellant Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board determined that the applicants were ineligible for benefits. In separate actions, Cervisi and Bartholomew obtained writs of administrative mandate to compel the board to set aside its decisions. The board appeals, contending that the respondents had reasonable assurances of employment precluding eligibility for unemployment benefits. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In the fall of 1983, respondents Gisele R. Cervisi and others<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were employed as part-time, hourly instructors by real party San Francisco Community College District. At the end of the semester, they applied for unemployment benefits for the period between fall and spring semesters. The Employment Development Department approved some requests for benefits and denied others. Those whose requests were denied appealed the decision to appellant Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. Hearings were conducted before an administrative law judge, who ruled that none of the instructors were eligible for benefits. The judge held that although \u201cclasses might have been subject to cancellation for lack of funds and/or enrollment, the evidence indicates that the general experience was that the claimants had continued in employment for several ensuing semesters.\u201d This was found to constitute a \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of continued employment precluding eligibility for benefits. The board affirmed the administrative law judge\u2019s decision. Cervisi petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) An alternative writ was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In the fall of 1984, respondent Muriel Bartholomew and other part-time, hourly instructors in the district applied for similar unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They were found ineligible to receive benefits. As Cervisi had done, Bartholomew petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate. Again, an alternative writ was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The trial court considered the two petitions together. After hearing, the petitions were granted. The trial court issued a statement of decision and the requested writs. The separate appeals were consolidated by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The trial court used the independent judgment test to determine whether the board\u2019s decision was proper. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c).) As such, we review the trial court\u2019s findings, rather than the agency\u2019s decision, to determine whether those factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143, fn. 10 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]; <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 301, 308 [196 P.2d 20]; see Cal. Administrative Mandamus (Cont.Ed.Bar 1966) \u00a7\u00a7 15.24-15.26.) As with ordinary civil appeals, this court must construe all conflicting evidence and make all inferences in favor of the trial court decision. <em>(Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>at p. 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">III. Late Appeal<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">IV. Reasonable Assurance</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Addressing the merits of the appeal, the board argues that all respondents received a \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of employment within the meaning of Unemployment Insurance Code section 1253.3<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and applicable case law. It contends that the trial court erred by its contrary findings. Finally, the board contends that the trial court considered incompetent and irrelevant evidence when reaching its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Based on undisputed facts, the trial court found that the clear language of the statute compelled issuance of the writ. It distinguished prior case law and held that the notices of potential assignment were \u201ccontingent on adequate enrollment, funding, and the approval of the District\u2019s Board of Governors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The unambiguous language of section 1253.3 and substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings. (See <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 674, 682 [206 Cal.Rptr. 788]; <em>Russ </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 834, 847 [178 Cal.Rptr. 421].) Under the statute, an assignment that is contingent on enrollment, funding, or program changes is not a \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of employment. (\u00a7 1253.3, subd. (g).) The administrative record provides sufficient evidence that the assignments given to these hourly instructors depended on their ability to attract a sufficient number of students to justify offering the classes. In fact, the standard faculty assignment form states that \u201cemployment is contingent upon . . . adequate class enrollment.\u201d The record also establishes that district enrollment had dropped. A contingent assignment is not a \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of continued employment within the meaning of section 1253.3; therefore, the trial court properly issued the writ requiring the respondents to be paid unemployment benefits for the period between the fall and spring semesters.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The judgments are affirmed. The board shall pay all costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Anderson, P. J., and Poch\u00e9, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Katherine C. Chung, Stephen W.

(b); see Stats. 1983, ch. 60, \u00a7 2, pp. 139-140.) The statute defined \u201creasonable assurance\u201d to include \u201can offer of employment or assignment made by the educational institution, provided that the offer or assignment is not contingent on enrollment, funding, or program changes.\u201d (\u00a7 1253.3, subd.
