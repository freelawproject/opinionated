We hold it to be the line of the low-water mark along the river\u2019s northerly shore as it was in 1792.</p>\n<p id=\"AkV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>I \u2014 I</p>\n<p id=\"AUV\">In July 1986, Illinois sought leave to file a bill of complaint against Kentucky, invoking this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction to resolve a disagreement about the location of the common boundary of the two States. See U. S. Const., Art. Ill, \u00a72. Illinois asked the Court to declare \u201cthe boundary line ... to be the low-water mark on the northerly shore of the Ohio River as it existed in 1792,\u201d Report of Special Master 1-2, and to enjoin Kentucky \u201cfrom disturbing in any manner the State of Illinois or its citizens from the peaceful use, and enjoyment of all land, water and jurisdiction within the boundaries of Illinois as established by the Court,\u201d id., at 2. We granted leave to file the bill of complaint, 479 U. S. 879 (1986), and appointed the Honorable Robert Van Pelt as Special Master.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AhE\">In its answer to the complaint, Kentucky denied that the boundary was the 1792 line and claimed it to be the river\u2019s northerly low-water mark \u201cas it exists from time to time.\u201d The answer raised the \u201caffirmative defenses\u201d of acquiescence and laches, and invoked certain \u201cprinciples of riparian boundaries.\u201d Report of Special Master 2.</p>\n<p id=\"AxQ\">The parties spent the next three years in discovery and, after submitting evidence to the Special Master in January 1990, were granted additional time to develop the evidentiary record on Kentucky\u2019s claim of prescription and acquiescence. After receiving this evidence in April 1990, the Special Master submitted a report to this Court, which was ordered filed. 498 U. S. 803 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"Aut\">The Special Master recommended that we (1) determine the boundary between Illinois and Kentucky to be the \u201clow-water mark on the northerly side of the Ohio River as it existed in the year 1792\u201d; (2) find that the record fails to \u201csup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>port the Commonwealth of Kentucky\u2019s affirmative defenses\u201d; (3) find that the construction of dams on the Ohio River has caused \u201cthe present low-water mark on the Illinois side of the river [to be] farther north than it was in 1792\u201d; and (4) order the two States\u2019 common boundary to be determined, \u201cas nearly as [the 1792 line] can now be ascertained, . . . either (a) by agreement of the parties, (b) by joint survey agreed upon by both parties, or (c) in the absence of such an agreement or survey, [by the Court] after hearings conducted by the Special Master and the submission by him to the Court of proposed findings and conclusions.\u201d Report of Special Master 48-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Kentucky has filed exceptions to the Special Master\u2019s report. While Kentucky challenges many of the factual findings, its primary dispute is with the conclusion that Kentucky has failed to prove its claim, styled as an affirmative defense, that under the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence the boundary is the low-water mark as it may be from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">We agree in large measure with the Special Master\u2019s report. The threshold issue presented in this case was resolved in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>444 U. S. 335 (1980), in which we held that Kentucky\u2019s boundary with Ohio was the northerly low-water mark of the Ohio River as it was in 1792. We based that holding on the history of Virginia\u2019s 1784 cession to the United States of the lands \u201cnorthwest of the river Ohio\u201d and Kentucky\u2019s succession to Virginia\u2019s northwest boundary upon reaching statehood in 1792. <em>Id., </em>at 337-338. We relied on the prior opinion in <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>136 U. S. 479, 518-519 (1890), in which Justice Field, for a unanimous Court, reviewed this history and held that Kentucky\u2019s boundary with Indiana followed the low-water mark on the northerly shore of the Ohio River \u201cwhen Kentucky became a State.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The same history and precedent that sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>plied the general rule for determining the boundary separating Kentucky from its neighboring States of Ohio and Indiana on the Ohio River also govern the determination of Kentucky\u2019s historical boundary on that river with Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Kentucky has, indeed, conceded that \u201cif this case were before the Court simply as a <em>matter of law, Ohio </em>v. <em>Kentucky . </em>. . would be controlling precedent.\u201d Exceptions of Commonwealth of Kentucky 9 (emphasis in original). Kentucky\u2019s exceptions assume, rather, that the case does not turn on the issue of law decided in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>but on the \u201cfactual issue of acquiescence which Kentucky has raised as an affirmative defense on the question of its boundary with Illinois.\u201d Exceptions of Commonwealth of Kentucky 9-10. Kentucky contends that it has long asserted, and Illinois has acquiesced in the assertion, that the common boundary of the two States is the low-water mark of the Ohio River, not as it was in 1792, but as it may be from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Although Kentucky has styled its acquiescence claim an affirmative defense, this \u201cdefense,\u201d if successfully proved, would not only counter Illinois\u2019 boundary claim but also establish Kentucky\u2019s own position. To do this on a theory of prescription and acquiescence, Kentucky would need to show by a preponderance of the evidence, first, a long and continuous possession of, and assertion of sovereignty over, the territory delimited by the transient low-water mark. Longstanding \u201c[possession and dominion are essential elements of a claim of sovereignty by prescription and acquiescence.\u201d <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>497 U. S. 376, 389 (1990). Kentucky would then have the burden to prove Illinois\u2019 long acquiescence in those acts of possession and jurisdiction. As we stated in <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>272 U. S. 21, 47 (1926), there is a \u201cgeneral principle of public law\u201d that, as between States, a \u201clong acquiescence in the possession of territory under a claim of right and in the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it, is conclusive of the rightful authority.\u201d See also <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>South Carolina, supra, </em>at 389 (\u201c[L]ong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>acquiescence in the practical location of an interstate boundary, and possession in accordance therewith, often has been used as an aid in resolving boundary disputes\u201d between States).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The record developed before the Special Master in this case fails to support Kentucky\u2019s claim of sovereignty by prescription and acquiescence. After a thorough review of the voluminous evidence presented by both States, the Special Master concluded that Kentucky had proved neither long and continuous action in support-of its claim to a boundary at the northerly low-water mark as it might be from time to time, nor Illinois\u2019 acquiescence in that claim. While Kentucky\u2019s many exceptions to the extensive factual findings on these issues do not merit discussion <em>seriatim, </em>an examination of a few will indicate the evidentiary support generally for the Special Master\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The Special Master first assessed the evidence bearing on Kentucky\u2019s exercise of dominion. According to Kentucky\u2019s view of the boundary, for example, any permanent structure extending out over the water from the river\u2019s northern bank would be within Kentucky\u2019s territory and subject to its taxing power, one of the primary indicia of sovereignty. The record in this case, however, shows that Kentucky has imposed a property tax on only 3 of the 15 structures that extend out, into, or over the water from the Illinois shoreline. Of the three affected taxpayers, one who received a Kentucky tax bill for property extending south into the river was also taxed on the same structure by Illinois, and another paid the Kentucky bill only under protest, \u201cclaiming that the property [taxed was] within the State of Illinois.\u201d Report of Special Master 37. The remaining 12 structures extending south into the river from Illinois have never been taxed by Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Kentucky advanced what it took to be a stronger claim to having exercised exclusive taxing jurisdiction right up to the transient low-water mark by offering evidence of its ad valo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>rem taxation of barges and other watercraft traveling on the river. But this evidence simply fails to speak directly to the boundary issue in this case. Vessels traveling the river usually follow a sailing line charted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers which, for most of the stretch in question, is either close to the center of the river or near the Kentucky shore. Illinois does not dispute that the sailing line, like most of the river, is within the boundary and jurisdiction of Kentucky. <em>Id., </em>at 38. The territory in question, rather, is thought to be a comparatively narrow sliver of the Ohio along its northerly shore, where barges and watercraft would rarely venture. As to the sliver, Kentucky\u2019s acts of taxation have been, at best, equivocal, and the Special Master was accordingly correct when he observed that the fact of Kentucky\u2019s taxation of barges \u201ctraveling on the Ohio River within the acknowledged jurisdiction of Kentucky, does not support Kentucky\u2019s claim of exclusive jurisdiction of the entire breadth of the river.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">This evidence of Kentucky's failure to engage in consistent and unequivocal acts of occupation and dominion does not stand alone, however, for we are concerned not only with what its officers have done, but with what they have said, as well. And what they have said has, in several instances, supported Illinois\u2019 claim. The Legislative Research Commission of the Kentucky General Assembly and the Attorney General of Kentucky have each taken the position in the recent past that Kentucky\u2019s northern border is the 1792 low-water mark. An Information Bulletin issued by the Legislative Research Commission in December 1972 states that \u201c\u2018Kentucky\u2019s North and Western boundary, to-wit, the low-water mark on the North shore of the Ohio River as of 1792 has been recognized as the boundary based upon the fact that Kentucky was created from what was then Virginia.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 15. An earlier opinion by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney General issued in 1963 asserted that the \u201c\u2018law, of course is that the boundary line between the states of Indiana and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Kentucky is the low-water [mark] on the north shore of the Ohio as it existed when Kentucky became a state in 1792.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 12. These statements came to our attention in Kentucky\u2019s last boundary case in this Court, where we found it \u201cof no little interest\u201d in deciding <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>444 U. S., at 340-341, that these \u201cKentucky sources themselves, in recent years, have made reference to the 1792 low-water mark as the boundary.\u201d It is hardly of less interest this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Just as this representative evidence fails to indicate any longstanding exercise of occupation and dominion of the disputed area by Kentucky, the record is equally unsupportive of the claim of Illinois\u2019 acquiescence. It is true that the Illinois Constitution of 1818 described the State\u2019s boundary with Kentucky on the Ohio River simply as following \u201calong its north-western shore,\u201d Ill. Const., Preamble (1818), and the same description was employed in the State Constitutions of 1848 and 1870, see Ill. Const., Art. I (1848), Ill. Const., Art. I (1870). But these are verbatim recitations of the congressional language describing Illinois\u2019 boundary in the State\u2019s Enabling Act of April 18, 1818, ch. 67, 3 Stat. 428, and the Special Master correctly reasoned that \u201c[w]hat Congress intended to be the southern boundary of Illinois, was the same southern boundary granted the states of Ohio and Indiana when they were formed. . . . Illinois, like Ohio and Indiana, was created from the territory ceded by Virginia to the United States. ...\u201d Report of Special Master 28. Although the current version of the Illinois Constitution, adopted in 1970, omits any description of the State\u2019s boundaries, the 1870 Constitution\u2019s language remained the reference point in the most recent Illinois case dealing with the State\u2019s river' boundary that has come to our attention. See <em>People ex rel. Scott </em>v. <em>Dravo Corp., </em>10 Ill. App. 3d 944, 944-945, 295 N. E. 2d 284, 285 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 951 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The courts of Illinois, indeed, for some time took an even less hospitable view of Kentucky\u2019s interests than the Illinois Constitution did. In <em>Joyce-Watkins Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>325 Ill. 378, 381, 156 N. E. 346, 348 (1927), the State Supreme Court adopted a theory that would have ratchetted the boundary line forever southward toward the deepest point of the river, by holding the boundary to be the low-water mark on the northerly shore of the river at the \u201cpoint to which the water receded at its lowest stage.\u201d This description of the boundary was followed by Illinois courts until at least 1973, see <em>People ex rel. Scott </em>v. <em>Dravo Corp., supra, </em>and while it plainly conflicts with our decisions in <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>136 U. S. 479 (1890), and <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>its use over nearly 50 years shows that Illinois did not acquiesce in any claim by Kentucky to a low-water mark that might edge northward over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Such was the force of the evidence adduced, and such was its failure to support Kentucky\u2019s claim of prescription and acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Kentucky\u2019s other affirmative defenses are likewise unavailing. The Special Master correctly observed that the laches defense is generally inapplicable against a State. See <em>Block </em>v. <em>North Dakota ex rel. Bd. of Univ. and School Lands, </em>461 U. S. 273, 294 (1983) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (collecting authorities); <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>304 U. S. 126, 132-133 (1938); cf. <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Board of Harbor Comm\u2019rs, </em>18 Wall. 57, 70 (1873) (statutes of limitations generally not applicable to State). Although the law governing interstate boundary disputes takes account of the broad policy disfavoring the untimely assertion of rights that underlies the defense of laches and statutes of limitations, it does so through the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence, see generally <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>South Carolina, supra, </em>which Kentucky has failed to satisfy.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Kentucky\u2019s affirmative defenses based on the \u201cprinciples of riparian boundaries, including accretion, erosion and avulsion,\u201d require no extended consideration, for Kentucky concedes that these would affect the ultimate boundary determination only if it prevailed on the issues of prescription and acquiescence. Exceptions of Commonwealth of Kentucky 48-49 (\u201cIt is Kentucky\u2019s position that if it prevails on its affirmative defense of acquiescence, then the well-recognized principles of accretion, erosion and avulsion would obviously apply to a current shoreline boundary as it may change from time to time\u201d). We have previously held as much, concluding that \u201cthe well-recognized and accepted rules of accretion and avulsion attendant upon a wandering river\u201d have no application to Kentucky\u2019s Ohio River boundary because of the \u201chistorical factors\u201d stemming from the cession by Virginia of the land northwest of the river to the United States. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Kentucky\u2019s final exception to the Special Master\u2019s report goes to the finding in Part III.C. that construction of dams on the river has permanently raised its level above that of 1792, consequently placing the present low-water mark on the Illinois side farther north than it was in 1792. Kentucky calls any question about the relative locations of the 1792 line and today\u2019s low-water mark premature, and we agree. Indeed, the Special Master himself suggested that this issue might, if necessary, \u201cbe determined at a later date,\u201d Report of Special Master 47, after he had made further recommendations to resolve any disputes the parties may have about the exact location of the 1792 line.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The exception of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to Part III.C. and Recommendation (3) of the report of the Special Master, as to the effect of modern dams on the level of the Ohio River, is sustained. Kentucky\u2019s other exceptions are overruled. The report, save for Part III.C. and Recommendation (3), is adopted, and the case is remanded to the Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Master for such further proceedings as may be necessary to prepare and submit an appropriate decree for adoption by the Court, locating the 1792 line.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AiWm\">In June 1988, we appointed a new Special Master, Matthew J.
