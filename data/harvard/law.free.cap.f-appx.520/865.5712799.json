Verdieu and Alexis each argue that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain their convictions for this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-24\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b889-25\">On June 22, 2011, Verdieu rented a Chevrolet Traverse sport utility vehicle from Enterprise Car Rental in West Palm Beach, Florida. Two days later, on June 24, Verdieu and Alexis drove the Traverse to the Edison Mall in Fort Myers where Alexis had arranged to purchase 3,000 oxy-codone pills for $10,500 from a confidential informant (Cl) cooperating with the Drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Enforcement Administration (DEA). DEA agents and local law enforcement officers were waiting for Verdieu and Alexis at the mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">After parking the Traverse in the mall parking lot, Verdieu and Alexis entered the mall, where Alexis met the Cl in the food court. When Alexis failed to persuade the Cl to conduct the drug sale in the parking lot, Alexis and Verdieu returned to the Traverse so that Alexis could retrieve the cash. Verdieu then remained in the car while Alexis went back to the food court to finish the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">At the food court Alexis and the Cl prepared to exchange \u201ca big wad of cash\u201d for a bag of pills. The transaction was interrupted when Alexis \u201creceived a phone call from someone ... and abruptly got up and ... left.\u201d Alexis returned to the Traverse, where Verdieu was waiting in the driver\u2019s seat, and got in the front passenger side.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">At this point DEA agents moved in and arrested the pair. As agents were handcuffing Verdieu, one asked him if he had any guns. Verdieu responded that he had one in the back seat of the Traverse, in a laptop computer bag. Although the agents did not find the gun in the back seat or the laptop bag, they found a fully loaded .88 caliber semi-automatic pistol between the driver\u2019s seat and the front passenger seat, in the Traverse\u2019s open center console. The firearm was located alongside a partially unwrapped sandwich, an open bottle of water, a camera case, a phone charger, and a CD. The gun was positioned in such a way that it could be easily withdrawn from the Traverse\u2019s console by either the driver or the front passenger. The agents also found $10,500 in Verdieu\u2019s pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Verdieu and Alexis were each charged with conspiring to possess and distribute oxycodone, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and carrying a firearm in relation to, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of, a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae and 2. Alexis pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge, but proceeded to trial on the gun charge; Verdieu proceeded to trial on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">At trial, following the government\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendants each moved for judgments of acquittal on their respective firearm charge, arguing that the government failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that the pistol was more than \u201ccoincidentally\u201d present in the Traverse. The district court denied the motion and the jury convicted each defendant of all counts. On its special verdict form, the jury indicated that it found Verdieu and Alexis guilty of violating \u00a7 924(c) both because the pair carried a firearm in relation to their attempt to purchase oxyco-done, and because they possessed a firearm in furtherance of their attempt to purchase oxycodone. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">On appeal, Verdieu and Alexis each argue that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdicts on their firearm convictions because the government failed to \u201cshow some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a District Court\u2019s denial of judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the Government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Capers, </em>708 F.3d 1286, 1296 (11th Cir.2013). \u201cA jury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned if any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>sonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>931 F.2d 761, 762 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cThe evidence need not be inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis except guilt, and the jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391 (11th Cir.1989). But \u201c[w]hen the government relies on circumstantial evidence, reasonable inferences, not mere speculation, must support the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>528 F.3d 811, 814 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Section 924(c) states, in pertinent part, \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such ... drug trafficking crime,\u201d be subject to enhanced penalties enumerated in the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). \u201cThus, the enhanced penalties are triggered in one of two ways: under the \u2018during and in relation to ... uses or carries\u2019 prong, or under the \u2018in furtherance of ... possesses\u2019 prong.\u201d <em>United States v. Haile, </em>685 F.3d 1211, 1217 (11th Cir.2012) (quoting \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1723, 185 L.Ed.2d 785 (2013) <em>&amp; </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1724, 185 L.Ed.2d 785 (2013). Because our <em>de novo </em>review satisfies us that the evidence was sufficient to convict Verdieu and Alexis under the \u201cin furtherance of ... possesses\u201d prong, we do not consider whether it was also sufficient to convict them under the \u201cduring and in relation to ... uses or carries\u201d prong. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">To prove that a defendant possessed a firearm \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a drug trafficking crime, \u201cthe prosecution [must] establish that the firearm helped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2002). This requires \u201ca showing of some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253 (quotation marks omitted). To determine whether such a \u201cnexus\u201d exists, we consider a non-exclusive list of factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-11\">the type of drug activity that is being conducted, accessibility of the firearm, the type of the weapon, whether the weapon is stolen, the status of the possession (legitimate or illegal), whether the gun is loaded, proximity to the drugs or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-12\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">Verdieu and Alexis argue that the government failed to prove a nexus between the gun found in the center console and the oxycodone deal because \u201cmere presence of a firearm at the time of the underlying federal crime is insufficient to support a [\u00a7 ] 924(c) conviction.\u201d While we certainly agree that as a matter of law proof of \u201cmere presence of a firearm in an area where a criminal act occurs\u201d is not sufficient to prove a violation of \u00a7 924(c), <em>Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1252 (quotation marks omitted), here the evidence went beyond proof of \u201cmere presence.\u201d Specifically, the loaded .38 caliber semiautomatic pistol was found in the rented Traverse\u2019s center console, within inches of where Ver-dieu and Alexis were sitting at the time of their arrests, readily accessible to each. Verdieu, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, was found with $10,500 in his pocket, the precise amount negotiated for the 3,000 oxyco-done pills that Alexis intended to purchase from the Cl. Alexis, sitting in the passenger seat, had repeatedly attempted to persuade the Cl to leave the food court and to conduct the drug transaction outside, where Verdieu and the pistol were waiting. The jury heard testimony that when DEA agents arrested the pair, the center console was open and the firearm was located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>next to a partially unwrapped sandwich and an opened bottle of water. And although Verdieu lawfully purchased the firearm in September 2010, the jury also learned that Verdieu\u2019s concealed weapon permit was expired at the time of purchase, and at the time of this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In sum, this evidence is sufficient to establish a nexus between the pistol and the drug transaction because a reasonable jury could conclude that Alexis intended to lure the Cl to the parking lot, where Ver-dieu was waiting with the gun. In turn, the evidence is sufficient to prove that Verdieu and Alexis possessed the pistol in furtherance of their conspiracy to possess and distribute oxycodone. <em>See Haile, </em>685 F.3d at 1219-20; <em>Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1253. On this record, the district court properly rejected their motions for judgment of acquittal, and we will not reverse their \u00a7 924(c) convictions here.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">For these reasons, Verdieu\u2019s and Alexis\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) convictions are</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
