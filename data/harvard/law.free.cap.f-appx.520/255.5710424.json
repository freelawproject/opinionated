Ramon, has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Melgar-Guardado has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is granted, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Although Melgar-Guardado\u2019s appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues, counsel\u2019s work in this appeal was of little assistance to this court in determining that such was the case. Here, counsel initially filed his motion to withdraw and brief, unaccompanied by any written confirmation of Mel-gar-Guardado\u2019s decision to forego an appeal of his guilty plea, which was essential to addressing whether the appeal presented any arguable issues. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>483 F.3d 289, 291 (5th Cir.2007). In a supplemental <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel acknowledged that, notwithstanding this court\u2019s order of May 4, 2012, he had neither obtained written confirmation from Melgar-Guardado, as outlined in <em>Garcia, </em>nor had he submitted a rearraignment transcript or addressed the validity of the guilty plea. On November 5, 2012, in ordering a revised supplemental brief, this court again directed counsel to, inter alia, review the <em>Anders </em>checklist posted on this court\u2019s website in preparing his brief, to confirm whether Melgar-Guardado had been removed from the United States, and to address the effect, if any, that such removal had on the instant appeal. A sanction warning also issued. Despite the latter order, in his revised supplemental brief, counsel merely recites legal boilerplate, and he restates the plea colloquy without any corresponding citations to legal authority. He also entirely neglects to discuss the effect of Melgar-Guardado\u2019s removal on the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">Accordingly, Ramon is ordered to show cause, within 15 days from the date of this opinion, why this court should not order that he not receive payment for services rendered and expenses incurred in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 223 (5th Cir.1999) (imposing sanction for pursuing appeal on sentencing issues contrary to a waiver-of-appeal provision in defendant\u2019s plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED; COUNSEL ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
