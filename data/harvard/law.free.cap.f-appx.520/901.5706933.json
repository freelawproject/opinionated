Mr. Gonzalez challenges the district court\u2019s decision to apply a three-level role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) based on a finding that he was a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d in the conspiracy. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">A company identifying itself as \u201cLaRolle Transport, Inc.\u201d responded to a solicitation posted on the Internet by a shipment broker to pick up approximately 129,000 pounds of copper wire from Georgia, valued at $457,114.60, and deliver it to Indiana. At the direction of Henry and Jacinto Diaz, three men \u2014 Mr. Gonzalez, Anthony Foubelo, and Jesus Ramirez\u2014 each driving a separate truck and purporting to represent LaRolle Transport, picked up the copper wire and transported it to Miami, Florida, instead of its intended destination. According to the Probation Office, Mr. Gonzalez \u201cdirected the actions of Foubelo and Ramirez and was a manager and/or supervisor within the conspiracy.\u201d Presentence Investigation Report \u00b6 21. Mr. Gonzalez objected to the proposed aggravating role enhancement and the district court heard relevant testimony at a joint sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">The Sentencing Guidelines authorize a three-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). The government must prove the existence of a leadership role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993). We review a district court\u2019s role determination for clear error. <em>See United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1200 (11th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1253 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">To qualify for this enhancement, the defendant \u201cmust have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There \u201cmust be evidence that the defendant exerted some control, influence or decision-making authority over another participant in the criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir.2009). In determining the defendant\u2019s role, \u201cfactors the court should consider include (1) the exercise of decision making authority, (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, (3) the recruitment of accomplices, (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n.4 (enumeration added). There is no requirement that all of the considerations have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>be present in any one case. <em>See Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Mr. Gonzalez does not dispute that his criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Rather, he asserts that the district court clearly erred in applying the three-level enhancement because the government failed to meet its burden to show that he exercised control, influence, or decision-making authority over his co-defendants. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Foubelo testified about Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s role in the conspiracy to transport stolen goods. Mr. Foubelo stated that he had received instructions from Jacinto \u201cPachi\u201d Diaz that Mr. Gonzalez was in charge; \u201c[Mr. Diaz] just told me to follow [Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s] instructions and that I should do whatever he told me.\u201d Transcript of Sentencing Proceedings at 22 [D.E. 183]. <em>See also id. </em>at 26 (\u201c[Mr. Diaz] said we should follow all the instructions that [Mr. Gonzalez] gave us, that he was very experienced in this sort of thing.\u201d). Mr. Diaz also told Mr. Foubelo to obtain cash from Mr. Gonzalez to purchase gasoline when refueling the trucks. Mr. Foubelo was not privy to the shipment pick-up address; Mr. Gonzalez knew the address and Messrs. Foubelo and Ramirez were instructed to follow Mr. Gonzalez en route to Georgia. They spoke to Mr. Gonzalez via radio during the trip, \u201cas we were new at this, [Mr. Gonzalez] was trying to keep us relaxed so we wouldn\u2019t get frightened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. In addition, Mr. Gonzalez possessed the fake magnetic signs which were placed on the sides of all of the trucks during the theft, and taught Mr. Foubelo how to affix them. Mr. Foubelo also stated that \u201c[Mr. Gonzalez] told us to do exactly the same as he was doing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The district court credited Mr. Foubelo\u2019s testimony regarding Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s role in the conspiracy, and found that Mr. Gonzalez directed Messrs. Foubelo and Ramirez. We find no clear error in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Mr. Gonzalez also contends that he was merely carrying out the instructions of the Diazes as a member of a team and not as a manager or supervisor. We have held, however, that a defendant\u2019s subordinate role to another conspirator does not necessarily absolve him of a supervisory role. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>933 F.2d 1541, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1991). <em>Cf. </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n.4 (\u201cThere can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy.\u201d). Here, Mr. Gonzalez had the authority to make decisions in choosing the route to drive while other drivers followed him and directed the actions of others so that the operation would be successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Mr. Gonzalez was a manager or supervisor under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">.
