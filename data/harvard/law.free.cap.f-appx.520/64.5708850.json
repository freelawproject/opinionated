Pierce raised claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), Title II, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Pierce was previously incarcerated at State Correctional Institute Smithfield, but after developing health problems Pierce was transferred to SCI-Laurel Highlands for medical care in July 2011. Pierce claimed that while at SCI-Laurel Highlands he received inadequate physical therapy, was improperly discharged from the physical therapy program, was not provided necessary medical aids, and did not receive proper treatment for abdominal and gastrointestinal illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-17\">The Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that the complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim. The Magistrate Judge concluded that Pierce did not set forth a violation of either the Eighth Amendment or the ADA and that he failed to show that the non-medical personnel had any personal involvement; the Magistrate Judge granted Pierce leave to amend his complaint as to the defendants who were medical personnel, but he did not do so. Pierce filed objections to the report and recommendation in which he further set forth the basis and argument in support of his claims. On September 24, 2012, the District Court adopted the report and recommendation and dismissed Pierce\u2019s federal claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pierce timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-19\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is plenary, and \u201cwe must accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Nami v. Fauver, </em>82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir.1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A2X\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">We will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s September 24, 2012 order dismissing Pierce\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AFe\">The District Court properly dismissed Pierce\u2019s claim that Defendants deprived him of medical care and therapy in violation of the Eighth Amendment. For the delay or denial of medical care to rise to a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, a prisoner must demonstrate \u201c(1) that defendants were deliberately indifferent to [his] medical needs and (2) that those needs were serious.\u201d <em>Rouse v. Plan</em>tier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir.1999). Deliberate indifference requires proof that the official \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Natale v. Camden Cnty. Corr. Facility, </em>318 F.3d 575, 582 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). We have found deliberate indifference where a prison official: \u201c(1) knows of a prisoner\u2019s need for medical treatment but intentionally refuses to provide it; (2) delays necessary medical treatment based on a non-medical reason; or (3) prevents a prisoner from receiving needed or recommended treatment.\u201d <em>Rouse, </em>182 F.3d at 197. Deference is given to prison medical authorities in the diagnosis and treatment of patients, and courts \u201cdisavow any attempt to second-guess the propriety or adequacy of a particular course of treatment ... (which) remains a question of sound professional judgment.\u201d <em>Inmates of Allegheny Cnty. Jail v. Pierce, </em>612 F.2d 754, 762 (3d Cir.1979) (quoting <em>Bowring v. Godwin, </em>551 F.2d 44, 48 (4th Cir.1977)). Allegations of negligent treatment or medical malpractice do not trigger constitutional protections. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"Ary4\">Pierce\u2019s complaint failed to allege that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. First, Pierce\u2019s allegation that his physical therapy was delayed or denied does not establish deliberate indifference. Pierce was in physical therapy from August 2011 to November 2011 when he was discharged due to a lack of progress. Pierce was readmitted to the physical therapy program in January 2012 and continued until March 2012 when he was discharged because it was determined he could continue the physical therapy exercises on his own. Pierce\u2019s disagreement with the method of physical therapy he received is not sufficient to establish a constitutional claim. <em>See Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, </em>834 F.2d 326, 346 (3d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"AZ83\">Second, Pierce\u2019s allegation that he was limited to using a regular wheelchair with cushion modifications instead of his preferred choice, a \u201cgeri-chair,\u201d does not establish deliberate indifference. Pierce alleged that the wheelchair he was provided aggravated his condition, despite the added cushioning and protective boot provided for his left foot. However, SCI-Laurel Highlands personnel concluded that because Pierce was able to propel and reposition himself in his wheel chair he was not a candidate for a geri-chair. Again, Pierce\u2019s disagreement with his treatment does not establish a constitutional claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1uE\">Pierce\u2019s final allegations of a constitutional violation related to the treatment he received for abdominal and gastrointestinal illness also failed to establish deliberate indifference. Pierce complained that he was not given x-rays of his abdomen to identify the source of his discomfort. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>However, as treatment for his abdominal and gastrointestinal problems, Pierce was given regular enemas, provided with suppositories, treated with Gas X, treated for hemorrhoids, examined by Defendant Sala-meh, and assessed by a specialist. Pierce alleged that the specialist stated x-rays could diagnose his abdominal pain and that in June 2012 when he finally received x-rays they revealed an impacted colon and infections. Although denial or delay of reasonable requests for medical treatment can constitute deliberate indifference, <em>see id. </em>at 346-47, Pierce did not allege that he was denied or delayed treatment for his gastrointestinal problems; rather, he alleged that he was denied his preferred method of treatment, which, in light of the treatment he was receiving, does not establish deliberate indifference. <em>See id. </em>at 346 (\u201c[M]ere allegations of malpractice do not raise issues of constitutional import.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Finally, Pierce\u2019s claim that Defendants violated the ADA was properly dismissed. To establish a violation of Title II of the ADA, an inmate must allege that: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of some public entity\u2019s services, programs, or activities, and (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of his disability. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Pierce\u2019s complaint asserted that Defendants violated the ADA and failed to allege any facts that demonstrated that the alleged inadequate or improper medical care he received was because of a disability. Consequently, dismissal of this claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">For the foregoing reasons and because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Pierce\u2019s complaint. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-14\">. The District Court dismissed any potential state-law negligence claim without prejudice to allow Pierce to file a complaint in state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
