After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-20\">In April 2011, Lewis sued several officials employed by the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF). He alleged that DCF violated his rights under the United States and Florida Constitutions by returning him to his mother\u2019s custody and by failing to provide him with necessary services when he \u201caged out\u201d of the system at 23 years old. A magistrate judge prepared a report and recommendation (R &amp; R) recommending that Lewis\u2019s suit be dismissed because it was \u201cduplica-tive of [a] prior case\u201d he filed. The district court adopted the R &amp; R and dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is Lewis\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of an action filed <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>taking the allegations in the complaint as true and construing the pleadings liberally. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). We may affirm a dismissal \u201con any ground that finds support in the record,\u201d even if the district court did not rely on it. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.2004). Our review is confined to the plaintiffs complaint and its attached exhibits. <em>See Alvarez v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>679 F.3d 1257, 1259 (11th Cir.2012); <em>see also Alba, </em>517 F.3d at 1252 (noting that the same standards govern Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss and <em>sua sponte </em>dismissals for failure to state a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Lewis\u2019s section 1983 claim is subject to Florida\u2019s four-year personal-injury statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Van Poyck v. McCollum, </em>646 F.3d 865, 867 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cThe statute of limitations on a section 1983 claim begins to run when the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The statute of limitations will not bar an otherwise untimely claim, however, when a plaintiff \u201cuntimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">An exhibit attached to Lewis\u2019s amended complaint indicated that he was born on July 9, 1982. Lewis\u2019s complaint alleged that DCF last violated his rights by failing to provide him services when he turned 23 on July 9, 2005. Hence, his claim accrued, at the latest, on that date. <em>See Van Poyck, </em>646 F.3d at 867. Therefore, the statute of limitations ran on Lewis\u2019s claim in July 2009. <em>See id. </em>Yet he did not file this lawsuit until April 2011, nearly two years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">Lewis argues that his suit is not untimely because he was not aware that he had a claim until speaking with a prison law clerk. Lewis\u2019s lack of awareness of his claim, however, is not the sort of extraordinary circumstance necessary to overcome the statute of limitations. <em>Jackson v. Astrue, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1356 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Ijgnorance of the law does not, on its own, satisfy the constricted \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 test.\u201d). Lewis\u2019s suit is therefore barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lewis\u2019s suit is</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\">. Neither the district court nor the R &amp; R cited any authority for dismissing a claim <em>sua sponte </em>as \"duplicative.\u201d And although the record is unclear, it does not appear that preclusion would have barred Lewis\u2019s suit, at least when the R &amp; R was filed. Nevertheless, as explained more fully below, because the record contains an alternative basis on which to affirm, we need not decide if the district court had authority to dismiss Lewis\u2019s case for this reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-14\">. Lewis argues that the appropriate statute of limitations is Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(1), which provides a 20-year statute of limitations for \"[a]n action on a judgment or decree of a court of record in this state.\" Because this case is not such an action, his argument fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
