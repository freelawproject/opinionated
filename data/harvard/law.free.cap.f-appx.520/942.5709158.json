After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A3U\">A. Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">In 2002, Jones was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, fifty grams or more of crack cocaine and 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), 841(b)(l)(A)(ii)(II), (iii) and (B)(vii), and 846. The charged conspiracy involved multiple participants who communicated with each other via text messages. Prior to trial, the district court granted Jones\u2019s motion to suppress the electronic records of the text messages because they were obtained without a warrant. At trial, however, the district court permitted one of Jones\u2019s co-conspirators to testify about the contents of the text messages he sent and received through his pager. After the jury found Jones guilty of the drug conspiracy, the district court sentenced Jones to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">On direct appeal, Jones challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>the admission of his co-conspirator\u2019s testimony about the text messages. This Court affirmed Jones\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 954 (11th Cir.2005). The Court concluded, among other things, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the co-conspirator\u2019s testimony because Jones did not have an expectation of privacy in the text messages. <em>Id. </em>at 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-16\">B. Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2255 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b967-17\">In 2006, Jones filed his first motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion raised several challenges based on the text message evidence, including that: (1) Jones\u2019s conviction based on the unlawfully obtained text messages violated his due process rights; (2) the district court violated Jones\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>by admitting text message evidence at trial after granting Jones\u2019s motion to suppress; (3) the grand jury illegally indicted him based on the unlawfully obtained text messages; and (4) Jones\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to dismiss his indictment or to prevent the admission of the text message evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The district court concluded that the first two \u00a7 2255 claims were procedurally barred because they already had been raised on direct appeal and the third claim was procedurally barred because Jones could have, but did not, raise it on direct appeal. The district court denied the fourth claim on the merits, concluding Jones had not shown that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or that it prejudiced Jones because this Court had concluded on direct appeal that the evidence about the text messages was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">C. Jones\u2019s \u00a7 3582 Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">In 2008, the district court reduced Jones\u2019s sentence from 300 months to 243 months, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, this Court affirmed Jones\u2019s modified sentence, rejecting Jones\u2019s contention that the district court should have given him a greater reduction. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>324 Fed.Appx. 794 (11th Cir.2009). In 2011, the district court denied Jones\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, based on Amendment 750, and this Court affirmed. <em>See United States v. Jones, 486 </em>Fed.Appx. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">D. Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2241 Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">In 2011, Jones also filed this \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the validity of his conviction and sentence. Specifically, Jones claimed (1) that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the charged drug conspiracy because the government had unlawfully obtained the text message evidence used to indict and convict him;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of his mandatory minimum ten-year sentence in light of the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d), which amended the mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Jones admitted that he had already filed one \u00a7 2255 motion, but argued that he should be allowed to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255 was inadequate and ineffective to challenge the legality of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">The district court dismissed Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court found that: (1) Jones\u2019s petition challenged the validity of his sentence and was barred as a successive \u00a7 2255 petition; and (2) Jones had not shown that the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 applied and, therefore, could not seek relief under \u00a7 2241. Jones appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). When, as here, the federal prisoner previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he is barred from filing second and successive motions unless his claims rely upon the existence of newly discovered evidence or a new rule of retroactively applicable constitutional law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">On appeal, Jones concedes that he cannot meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255(h) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>pursue his claims in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Further, Jones did not seek this Court\u2019s authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (requiring an applicant to first apply for and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court); <em>In re Blackshire, </em>98 F.3d 1293, 1293 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Under limited circumstances, however, a provision of \u00a7 2255, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d permits a federal prisoner to challenge the legality of his detention in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Under the savings clause, a federal prisoner can bring a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the statute does not define \u201cinadequate and ineffective,\u201d we do know that the restriction against second and successive \u00a7 2255 motions in \u00a7 2255(h), standing alone, does not render \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). Thus, a prisoner cannot circumvent the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion merely by filing a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">In this particular case, we need not discuss or decide what kind of claim would be covered by the savings clause because the types of claims Jones makes here so clearly do not open the portal to the savings clause\u2019s limited jurisdiction. For example, with respect to his conviction claim, Jones does not identify any retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, much less one that establishes that Jones was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Jones argues that <em>United States v. Jones, </em>565 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 945, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012), rendered him actually innocent, but this is not correct. In <em>Jones, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the government\u2019s installation and use of a GPS device on a suspect\u2019s vehicle constituted a search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Jones, </em>565 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 949. The <em>Jones </em>decision does not help Jones here for several reasons. First, although Jones characterizes his challenge to his conviction as an \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim, in fact Jones\u2019s conviction claim\u2014 that he was wrongly charged and then convicted based on unlawfully obtained text message evidence \u2014 is one of legal, rather than factual, innocence. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3 (citing <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), which explained that actual innocence means \u201cmeans factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">Second, Jones raised the text messages issues in both his direct appeal and his first \u00a7 2255 motion. Third, <em>Jones </em>deals with the admissibility of evidence and does not establish that Jones was convicted of a non-existent crime or is factually innocent of the charged drug conspiracy. Fourth, in any event, <em>Jones </em>was not made retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">As to his FSA sentencing claim, Jones challenges the length of his sentence, but does not claim it exceeded his statutory maximum. Instead, Jones cites <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). In <em>Dorsey, </em>the Supreme Court held that the FSA applied to a very narrow class of offenders who had committed their offenses before the FSA\u2019s August 3, 2010 effective date, but who were sentenced after that date. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2326. However, nothing in <em>Dorsey </em>indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>the FSA applies to defendants, like Jones, who committed their offenses and were sentenced prior to the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 <em>F.3d </em>374, 377 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Jones also argues that the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d because he already has f\u00edled his first (unsuccessful) \u00a7 2255 motion and cannot meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255(h) for filing a second \u00a7 2255 motion. This Court already rejected that argument, concluding that \u201cthe existence of the statutory bar on second and successive motions cannot mean that \u00a7 2255 is \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention within the meaning of the savings clause.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1308. Thus, the mere fact that Jones cannot pursue his claims in a second \u00a7 2255 motion does not mean they fall within the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Because Jones failed to show that \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention, the savings clause does not apply to his claims. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. For this reason, there is also no merit to Jones\u2019s argument that the district court was required by <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992), to resolve his claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-13\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-9\">. Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition also alleged that his conviction was unlawful because the jury was not given a special verdict form differentiating the three drugs he was charged with conspiring to possess. Jones does not mention this claim in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
