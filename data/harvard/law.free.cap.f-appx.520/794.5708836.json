On appeal, the government argues that the district court erred by not imposing the statutory ten-year mandatory-minimum sentence required for a violation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense. After careful review, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">We review constitutional questions and questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Griffey, </em>589 F.3d 1363,1365 n. 3 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-19\">At sentencing, a district court must normally consider various sentencing factors, including the applicable guideline range and the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) \u2014 (a)(5). However, \u201c[a] mandatory minimum sentence trumps an advisory Guideline calculation and the various factors considered by district courts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 88 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-20\">The federal statute at issue provides for a penalty of not less than ten years and not more than life imprisonment for any person whose violation of the statute (1) involved 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine and (2) occurred \u201cafter a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii)(II). A \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d is defined, <em>inter alia, </em>as \u201can offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of ... a State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 802(44). We have held that \u201cwhat constitutes a \u2018conviction\u2019 \u201d under section 841(b)(1)(B) is a question of federal sentencing law, rather than state law. <em>United States v. Mejias, </em>47 F.3d 401, 403-04 (11th Cir.1995). For federal sentencing purposes, a \u201cprior plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>with adjudication withheld in Florida state court is a \u2018conviction\u2019 that supports an enhanced sentence under section 841(b)(1)(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>To support a \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) statutory enhancement, the government must file an information notifying the defendant of the enhancement and the prior convictions upon which it is based. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). The defendant may respond that the conviction was obtained in violation of the U.S. Constitution, and bears the burden of proving the conviction\u2019s constitutional infirmity by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 851(c)(2). However, he may not \u201cchallenge the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this section which occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 851(e). We have upheld the validity of \u00a7 851(e)\u2019s limitations period. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>954 F.2d 668, 673 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that \u00a7 851(e)\u2019s limitations period was constitutional because it was \u201creasonably tailored to impose enhanced sentences on recidivists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The specific subsection of the Florida drug possession statute under which Neal was convicted makes it unlawful \u201cfor any person to be in actual or constructive possession of a controlled substance,\u201d and provides that \u201c[a]ny person who violates this provision commits a felony of the third degree.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 89S.13(6)(a). In Florida, a third-degree felony is punishable by a term of imprisonment \u201cnot exceeding 5 years.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 775.082(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Here, the district court erred in imposing a 70-month sentence rather than the 120-month mandatory minimum. To begin with, we have squarely held that a Florida state criminal proceeding in which adjudication was withheld following a plea constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) statutory enhancement. <em>Mejias, </em>47 F.3d at 404. Because Neal\u2019s conviction for cocaine possession under \u00a7 893.13(6)(a) was punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, it constituted a \u201cfelony\u201d drug offense, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44), and he was subject to the 120-month mandatory minimum in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) following the government\u2019s filing of its \u00a7 851 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">We reject Neal\u2019s remaining arguments \u2014 first, that the district court\u2019s sentence violated the mandate to avoid sentencing disparities found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As we\u2019ve made clear, the mandatory minimum trumps the advisory guidelines and the district court\u2019s obligation to consider sentencing factors under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 88. Neal\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 893.13(6)(a) also lacks merit. Among other things, Neal was statutorily barred from challenging the validity of his Florida conviction. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e); <em>Williams, </em>954 F.2d at 674. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
