On appeal, Laincy argues that the district court erred in granting the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Laincy\u2019s claim of sex discrimination in the County\u2019s failure to promote him to an appraiser and on his claims of retaliation so far as the County failed to promote him and then terminated him. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201capplying the same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). \u201c[S]um-mary judgment is appropriate if the evidence before the court shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact does not exist unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmov-ing party for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In making this determination, we \u201cmake all reasonable inferences in favor of the\u201d nonmoving party. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">First, we are unpersuaded by La-incy\u2019s argument that the district court erred in granting the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Laincy\u2019s sex discrimination claim. Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee based on sex. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). \u201cTitle VII\u2019s prohibition of discrimination \u2018because of ... sex\u2019 protects men as well as women.\u201d <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 78, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998). A plaintiff bears the burden of proving, using direct or circumstantial evidence, unlawful employment discrimination. <em>Hinson v. Clinch Cnty., Ga. Bd. of Educ., </em>231 F.3d 821, 827 (11th Cir.2000). Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), there is a three-step process to establish discrimination: first, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case; second, the defendant \u201cmust articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action\u201d; and third, the plaintiff must proffer evidence \u201csufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">To meet the requirements of the pretext step, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason was \u201ca pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., </em>408 F.3d 763, 771 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cProvided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. Rather, the plaintiff must show \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incohereneies or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons ... that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Vessels, </em>408 F.3d at 771 (quotation omitted). In the context of a promotion, where a plaintiff attempts to show pretext by arguing that he was more qualified than the selected individual, he must show, in light of those superior qualifications, that \u201cno reasonable person\u201d would have selected the other candidate rather than the plaintiff. <em>Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp. Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>In this case, the district court did not err in granting the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Laincy\u2019s sex discrimination claim. Assuming arguendo that Laincy established a prima facie case, he nonetheless did not rebut the County\u2019s proffered reason for promoting two women as appraisers rather than promoting Lain-cy. Specifically, those individuals had taken appraisal classes, and Laincy had not. Laincy has not shown that \u201cno reasonable person\u201d could have selected two candidates who had already taken the courses over Laincy, who had not done so. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">As for Laincy\u2019s argument that the two women who were promoted were afforded unfair opportunities to take appraisal classes, it is without merit. There is no evidence in the record that Laincy asked to take the courses, and thus, there is no evidence that he was denied the opportunity to do so. Moreover, unlike the individuals who took the courses and were promoted, Laincy was still in his initial probationary period with the County when he applied and was interviewed for the appraiser position. Under County policy, probationary employees were not eligible to be promoted. In short, even if Laincy asked to take the courses and had his request denied, the County did nothing improper, since Laincy was not eligible to be promoted regardless of whether he had taken appraisal classes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Nor are we persuaded by Laincy\u2019s retaliation claim. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who oppose unlawful sex discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-8(a). The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework has been used in retaliation cases in which the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence. <em>Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1307-08 (11th Cir.2009). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff may show that: (1) he engaged in a protected activity; \u201c(2) he suffered an adverse employment action\u201d; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Not every act an employee takes in opposition to discrimination is protected. <em>Butler v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>536 F.3d 1209, 1214 (11th Cir.2008). The employee must show: (1) that he had a subjective good-faith belief \u201cthat his employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices\u201d; and (2) that his belief, even if mistaken, was objectively reasonable in light of the record. <em>Id. </em>at 1213 (quotation omitted). In evaluating the objective severity of harassment, we consider factors such as: (1) the conduct\u2019s frequency; (2) the conduct\u2019s severity; (3) \u201cwhether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance\u201d; and (4) \u201cwhether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee\u2019s job performance.\u201d <em>Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Likewise, not every discriminatory comment made by a coworker constitutes an unlawful employment practice. <em>Butler, </em>536 F.3d at 1214. Rather, to establish a claim of a hostile work environment, the employee \u201cmust show that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, we have held that \u201c[a] racially derogatory remark by a co-worker, without more, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>constitute an unlawful employment practice under the opposition clause of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), and opposition to such a remark, consequently, is not statutorily protected conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). It is objectively unreasonable to believe that a coworker\u2019s single use of discriminatory language \u201cis enough to permeate the workplace with \u2018discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult\u2019 and to \u2018alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Here, the district court did not err in granting the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Laincy\u2019s retaliation claims. First, Laincy did not establish a prima facie case of retaliation because he did not show that he had engaged in protected activity. <em>See Bryant, </em>575 F.3d at 1307-08. Even if he subjectively believed that he was opposing an unlawful employment practice, his belief that his eoworker\u2019s allegedly harassing comments constituted an unlawful employment practice was not objectively reasonable. <em>See Butler, </em>536 F.3d at 1213. The record shows that Laincy\u2019s work environment was not permeated with intimidation, ridicule, or insult. <em>See id. </em>at 1214. Rather, Laincy\u2019s coworker made three innocuous comments asking him if he was dating anyone. These comments were not threatening, humiliating, or offensive, and they did not interfere with Laincy\u2019s job performance. <em>See Miller, </em>277 F.3d at 1276. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the County on Laincy\u2019s sex discrimination and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. Laincy also claims that one of the employees had not completed her probationary period when she was promoted and that she was promoted within two months of being hired, but the record refutes this unsupported assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
