He contends his motion to reopen should have been granted because: service of the Notice To Appear was legally insufficient; and there is no due-diligence requirement for pursuing reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">The BIA\u2019s denying a motion for reconsideration is reviewed \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA motion for reconsideration urges an adjudicative body to re-evaluate the record evidence only.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir.2005). To succeed on such a motion, petitioner must \u201cidentify a change in the law, a misapplication of the law, or an aspect of the case that the BIA overlooked\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">Cifuentes\u2019 contentions primarily concern the denial of his motion to reopen, not the denial of his motion for reconsideration. He did not file a separate petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissing his appeal of the denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the issues raised in Cifuentes\u2019 brief regarding the motion to reopen. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 400-01, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (period for seeking review of final removal order unaffected by petitioner\u2019s later moving for reconsideration); <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201cBIA\u2019s denial of an appeal and its denial of a motion to reconsider are two separate final orders, each of which require their own petitions for review\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-22\">Because he fails to identify any change in the law, or any error of law or fact justifying reconsideration, Cifuentes\u2019 contentions regarding reconsideration fail. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 301. Therefore, his petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denying his motion for reconsideration is denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-23\">To the extent Cifuentes challenges the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen the proceedings <em>sua sponte </em>(and the attendant refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>reconsider the same), our court lacks jurisdiction to consider his contention. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201ca reviewing court has no legal standard against which to judge an IJ\u2019s decision not to invoke its <em>sua sponte </em>authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">DISMISSED IN PART; and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
