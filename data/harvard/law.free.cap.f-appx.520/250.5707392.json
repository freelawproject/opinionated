He argues that the record does not support the court\u2019s decision to impose the statutory maximum sentence because he. had only a single violation of his supervised release and because the Sentencing Guidelines recommended only six to 12 months of incarceration. He also contends that it is plainly unreasonable to impose such a harsh sentence on a defendant who was thrust back into society without first being given an opportunity to ease the transition with the help of a halfway house. We review Townley\u2019s sentence under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The district court was authorized to impose any sentence that fell within the five-year statutory maximum for Townley\u2019s original offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The ranges set forth under the Guidelines are advisory only. <em>See United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 93 (5th Cir.1994). We have often upheld statutory-maximum revocation sentences as plainly reasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 500-01 (5th Cir.2012). With the exception of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), the district court was to consider the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) in selecting a sentence. <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843 \u2014 44. The district court thus was within its discretion in selecting a sentence based on Townley\u2019s history of violence and his inability to comply with the terms of supervised release. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B) &amp; (C). Moreover, Townley points to no authority which supports his assertion that the district court was required to consider his inability to find placement in a halfway house, nor does he attempt to connect this fact with any of the relevant sentencing considerations set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
