Smith, Texas prisoner # 368765, alleged under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that, while he was preparing a legal complaint, Deputy John Doe Rodriguez stood behind him and read its contents. Smith contended that, in doing so, Rodriguez violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The district court dismissed Smith\u2019s complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)-(iii) and 1915A(b)(l)-(2), finding, among other things, that Rodriguez was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied Smith\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Smith moves in this court for leave to proceed IFP. By doing so, he is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.Ed 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). We may dismiss the appeal if it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th CiR. R. 42.2. We review a district court\u2019s determination that a case is frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>See Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Smith\u2019s conclusory allegations \u2014 that, for example, Rodriguez \u201cshould not be granted qualified immunity\u201d because \u201che acted out of intent with malice\u201d \u2014 do not show that Rodriguez violated a clearly established constitutional right. <em>See Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 232-36, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). Smith therefore has failed to show that Rodriguez is not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Accordingly, Smith\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merits, and is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. As a result, we deny his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, and dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) also counts as a strike. Smith is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
