He contends: the illegal reentry Guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is unreasonable because it lacks an empirical basis; under the Guideline, his prior drug-trafficking conviction was used to increase his offense level and criminal-history score, resulting in double counting; the advisory Guidelines sentencing range failed to account for his mitigating personal history and characteristics; and a presumption of reasonableness should not apply to a within-Guidelines sentence imposed under \u00a7 2L1.2. He concedes this last issue is foreclosed, <em>see United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009), and raises it only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Because An-darade does not claim procedural error, we consider only the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Andarade\u2019s claiming \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because it is not empirically based is foreclosed by our court\u2019s precedent. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. Also foreclosed is his contending a sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 is greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of any double counting inherent in that Guideline. <em>See id. </em>at 529-31. Further, the record reflects the court balanced Andarade\u2019s mitigation factors against other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need for adequate deterrence and the need to protect the public from further crimes. The court stated a within-Guidelines sentence of 90 months was \u201cnot only appropriate but necessary to serve all the statutory purposes that [the court] outlined\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Andarade has failed to show his within-Guidelines sentence \u201cdoes not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, ... gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or ... represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors\u201d. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). The presumption of reasonableness will not be disturbed. <em>E.g., Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
