He does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>not challenge the newly imposed 20-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Dubose asserts \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s failure to provide any reason as to why it ordered a significantly above-Guidelines sentence in this case renders the sentence plainly unreasonable.\u201d Because Dubose did not object below to the district court\u2019s failure to give reasons for its above-guidelines sentence, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cAlthough the district court clearly erred by failing to state the reasons for imposing an above guideline sentence, [Dubose] has not met his burden of establishing that the error affected his substantial rights or that the error affected the public reputation of judicial proceedings, either here or in the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">He also asserts that, in light of the recommended guidelines range, the sentence imposed is unreasonably long. Du-bose\u2019s objection to the imposition of a non-guidelines sentence did not preserve a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence and, thus, we review for plain error. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 259-60. The guidelines range of 4 to 10 months was based solely on the highest grade violation and Dubose\u2019s underlying criminal history category. It did not take into account the number, nature, or timing of the violations of the conditions of his release. Moreover, we have routinely upheld sentences following revocation that, as here, exceed the recommended guidelines range but are within the statutory maximum. <em>See e.g., United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 792 (5th Cir.2007). Dubose\u2019s sentence to the 24-month statutory maximum does not constitute error, much less plain error. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
