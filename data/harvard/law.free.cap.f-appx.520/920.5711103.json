The district court calculated an advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, although owing to a prior state court conviction for child molestation, Cole faced a statutory minimum term of 15 years (180 months) and a statutory maximum term of 40 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). Cole requested a downward variance from the guidelines range to the statutory minimum of 180 months, which the court rejected before imposing a low-end total sentence of 188 months. Cole complains on appeal that his total sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court abused its discretion in denying his eight-month downward variance request, and the resulting total sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-22\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s request for a variance is subsumed under that review. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>560 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2009) (reviewing the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for variance).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-23\">After reviewing the record, we find no reversible error. We cannot say that Cole\u2019s 188-month total sentence is substantively unreasonable. The total sentence falls at the low end of the guidelines range and is well below the statutory maximum. The court\u2019s denial of his request for a downward variance was not a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>error in judgment, and moreover, the total sentence reflects several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the seriousness of the offense conduct, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
