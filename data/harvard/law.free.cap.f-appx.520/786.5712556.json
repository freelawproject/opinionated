After a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">According to Mr. Griffin, his sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e) is illegal because his possession of a firearm occurred in May of 1987, and at that time the maximum sentence for his \u00a7 922(g) offense was five years. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. At 4-9. As Mr. Griffin sees it, he could not have been sentenced under the enhanced penalties set forth in \u00a7 924(e) because that provision became effective on November 1, 1987, months after his \u00a7 922(g) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-20\">The former version of Rule 35(a) applies to Mr. Griffin because his \u00a7 922(g) offense took place before November 1, 1987. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>923 F.2d 1494, 1496 n. 1 (11th Cir.1991). It provides in relevant part that a \u201ccourt may correct an illegal sentence at any time[.]\u201d Under the former version of Rule 35(a), an illegal sentence includes a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum, as well as a sentence that is constitutionally invalid. <em>See Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 430, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-21\">The superseding indictment charged Mr. Griffin in Count I with a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e), and the record shows that the jury found him guilty of that charge. <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>162 Fed.Appx. 935, 936 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that Mr. Griffin was convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) and was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)). So the question is whether \u00a7 924(e), as it existed on May 19, 1987 \u2014 the date of the \u00a7 922(g) offense\u2014 permitted the district court to sentence Mr. Griffin to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-22\">The answer to that question is yes. On May 19, 1986, Congress passed the Firearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act, Pub.L. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449. One of the provisions of the Act, \u00a7 104, added a new subsection (e) to \u00a7 924 of Title 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-23\">In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>previous convictions ... for robbery or burglary, or both, such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and ... such person shall not be eligible for parole with respect to the sentence imposed under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">This amendment to \u00a7 924 became effective 180 days after enactment, or on November 19, 1986. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 110(a); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>835 F.2d 1195, 1196 (7th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>824 F.2d 21, 22 n. 2 (D.C.Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">As we said in a prior appeal by Mr. Griffin, it \u201cis undisputed that at the time of sentencing [Mr.] Griffin had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>162 Fed.Appx. at 937. Thus, \u00a7 924(e), as it existed at the time of Mr. Griffin\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) violation, authorized the district court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Because the sentence imposed was not in excess of the statutory maximum, and was not constitutionally invalid, the district court correctly denied Mr. Griffin\u2019s Rule 35(a) motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-17\">. The denial of a Rule 35(a) motion \"is reversible only when the sentence is illegal or when the trial court's refusal to reduce the sentence constitutes a gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Weaver </em>884 F.2d 549, 551 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A6g\">. Given our resolution of Mr. Griffin's Rule 35(a) claim on the merits, we need not address the government\u2019s argument that the claim is barred by the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
