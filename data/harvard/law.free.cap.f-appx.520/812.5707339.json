Cook, a federal prisoner, appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence. The district court denied Cook\u2019s motion because, as a career offender, Amendment 750 did not reduce his guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Cook argues he should be eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) resen-tencing because the sentencing court considered his unenhanced criminal history category in sentencing him below the career offender guideline range. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">A sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The 2012 Commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines expressly provides that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A). The Supreme Court has held that a Commentary provision \u201cwhich functions to interpret a guideline or explain how it is to be applied\u201d is binding as long as the Commentary does not conflict with the Constitution, a federal statute, or the guideline at issue. <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1917-18, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">In <em>Moore, </em>we addressed whether Amendment 706 authorized reductions un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>der \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for defendants who had been convicted of crack cocaine offenses, but sentenced under the career offender guidelines. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008). We explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only authorizes reductions to sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. As Amendment 706 did not lower the career offender offense levels, we concluded it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>We also explained that the Commentary to \u00a7 IB 1.10 \u201c[made] clear\u201d that a reduction was not authorized where an amendment lowered a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the offense of conviction but not the career offender sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Even after a divided Supreme Court interpreted \u00a7 3582\u2019s \u201cbased on\u201d language in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). <em>Freeman </em>did not address \u201cdefendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense but sentenced as a career offender is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">The Commission\u2019s updated Commentary restricting \u00a7 3582 eligibility squarely addresses the exception Cook proposes on appeal and completely forecloses his argument, especially since the Supreme Court has held that a Commentary provision explaining how a guideline is to be applied is binding so long as the Commentary does not conflict with the Constitution, a federal statute, or the guideline at issue. <em>See Stinson, </em>113 S.Ct. at 1917-18. The district court found that Cook was a career offender, and calculated his guideline range accordingly. The Commentary states that eligibility can be triggered only by an amendment to the guideline range calculated under \u00a7 1B1.1(a), before any variances or departures are imposed. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A). Cook, as a career offender, cannot be eligible for \u00a7 3582 relief regardless of the rationale the court may have used in imposing a below-guidelines sentence, because the career offender guidelines have not been amended. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Cook\u2019s arguments that the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 should not be followed lack merit. In <em>Melvin, </em>we affirmed that the Sentencing Commission has the authority to promulgate policy statements that affect eligibility for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009). Moreover, Cook\u2019s argument that the Commentary does not interpret a guideline provision is misplaced, since the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 explains how to calculate the relevant offense level and \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10, cmt. nn. 1-6. Finally, Cook\u2019s argument that the Commentary is inconsistent with <em>Freeman\u2019s </em>interpretation of the term \u201cbased on\u201d is analogous to the arguments we have already rejected in <em>Lawson. See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Cook\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-12\">.
