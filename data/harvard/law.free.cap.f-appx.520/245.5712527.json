As a threshold matter, Uribe argues that a presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his within-guidelines sentences on appellate review because the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not the result of empirical evidence or study. As Uribe acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Uribe also argues that his within-guidelines sentences were greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and thus were unreasonable, in part, because the illegal reentry guideline doubled-counted one of his prior convictions in determining his offense level and criminal history. We have rejected the argument that a sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 is greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of any double counting inherent in that Guideline. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Finally, Uribe argues that his guidelines ranges failed to reflect his personal history and circumstances, the benign nature of his illegal reentry offense, and the reasons he committed that offense. He further contends that the district court incorrectly weighed these factors. His arguments are unavailing. The district court, which was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d considered and rejected Uribe\u2019s arguments for sentences below his advisory guidelines ranges. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). After consideration of Uribe\u2019s arguments, the court expressly gave more weight to other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Uribe\u2019s criminal history and history of violence, and determined that sentences within the ranges were appropriate. Uribe has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness attaching to his within-guidelines sentences on appellate review. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The record reflects no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
