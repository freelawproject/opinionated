On appeal, Craig argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior Alabama conviction for unlawful possession of marijuana in the first degree qualified as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), which increased his base offense level. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Craig\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">In 2011, a federal grand jury returned an indictment, charging Craig with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and, after a jury trial, Craig was convicted of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Craig a base offense level of 20 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) because he had a prior felony conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Specifically, Craig had a prior Alabama conviction for possession of marijuana in the first degree. According to the PSI, the Alabama indictment charged Craig with unlawful possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use in violation of Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213.\u201d Based on a total offense level of 20 and a criminal history category of V, Craig\u2019s guideline range was 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">Craig filed objections to the PSI, arguing, among other things, that the PSI incorrectly characterized his prior Alabama conviction as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Guidelines. Moreover, the Alabama indictment did not state that he possessed marijuana with intent to \u201cmanufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense,\u201d as required under \u00a7 4B 1.2. Finally, Craig asserted that this case is distinguishable from prior cases in which the probation officer imposed the same offense level increase by relying on unpublished cases from this Court addressing the definition of a \u201cserious drug offense[ ]\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). In support of his objections, Craig attached the \u201ccase action summary\u201d and the indictment from his Alabama criminal proceeding. The indictment charged that Craig \u201cdid unlawfully possess marihuana for other than personal use, in violation of Section 13A-12-213 of the Alabama Criminal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-18\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court addressed Craig\u2019s objection to the guideline calculations, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>I think you made a good argument, but I think the argument is basically addressed in <em>[United States v. Goodlow, </em>389 Fed.Appx. 961 (11th Cir.2010) ]. And although that is an unpublished decision, it does rely on published decisions by the Eleventh Circuit in reaching its conclusion that possession of marijuana in the first degree for other than personal use under Alabama law is a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Thus, the district court overruled Craig\u2019s objection to the PSI\u2019s characterization of his prior marijuana offense as a controlled substance offense. Ultimately, the court adopted the guideline calculations and imposed a 70-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Fulford, </em>662 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2011). We may disregard the holding of a prior panel\u2019s opinion only if the Supreme Court, or this Court sitting <em>en banc, </em>overrules that opinion. <em>United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm under \u00a7 922(g)(1) ordinarily faces a base offense level of 14 as a \u201cprohibited person.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) &amp; comment, (n.3). The offense level increases to 20 if the defendant has at least one prior conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). Pursuant to \u00a7 4B 1.2(b), the term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d means a felony offense under federal or state law that \u201cprohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance,\u201d or possession with intent to do the same. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.2(b). Under the ACCA, the term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d means \u201can offense under [sjtate law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Under \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l), a person commits the crime of unlawful possession of marijuana in the first degree if he possesses marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">In <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292 (11th Cir.2009), a case involving the review of \u00a7 13A-12-213(a) under the ACCA, we held that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction under the statute qualified as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. 583 F.3d at 1293-96. We explained that a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is defined as a state law offense, \u201cinvolving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1294. Upon reviewing the statute, we concluded that \u201c \u00a7 13A12-213(a)(l) covers distribution offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295. Noting that the Alabama statute \u201cdoes not define the phrase \u2018for other than personal use,\u2019 \u201d we concluded that the statute \u201cnecessarily punishes possession for someone else\u2019s use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296. \u201cIn other words, [\u00a7 ] 13A-12-213 punishes the possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute to another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Research does not reveal, and Craig does not identify, a published opinion from this Court, addressing whether a conviction under \u00a7 13A-12-213 qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4B 1.2(b). However, in <em>Goodlow, </em>the unpublished decision that the district court applied to resolve Craig\u2019s objections, we relied on <em>Robinson </em>in concluding that the \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d prong of \u00a7 13A-12-213 punishes marijuana with intent to distribute and, as such, it qualified as a controlled substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>offense under \u00a7 4B1.2(b). <em>See Goodlow, </em>389 Fed.Appx. at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Because <em>Robinson </em>is binding precedent and establishes that a violation of \u00a7 13A-12-213 necessarily punishes possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, Craig cannot establish that the district court erred in characterizing his prior Alabama conviction as a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4B 1.2(b). <em>See Robinson, </em>583 F.3d at 1295-96; <em>Kaley, </em>579 F.3d at 1255. Craig\u2019s Alabama indictment charged him under the prong of \u00a7 13A-12-213 that criminalizes possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use.\u201d Although in the context of the ACCA, we held, in <em>Robinson, </em>that a conviction for possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d under \u00a7 13A-12-213 covers distribution offenses. <em>See Robinson, </em>583 F.3d at 1295. Thus, Craig\u2019s argument on appeal \u2014 that his Alabama offense was not a controlled substance offense because the indictment did not specifically allege that he possessed marijuana with intent to manufacture, import, distribute, or dispense marijuana \u2014 is unpersuasive. <em>See id. </em>Under the Guidelines, the term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d includes state felony offenses for possession with intent to distribute. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(b). As such, applying <em>Robinson </em>to the instant circumstances, the district court did not err in determining that Craig had at least one prior conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4B 1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Finally, Craig\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>631 F.3d 1187 (11th Cir.2011), is misplaced. In <em>Shannon, </em>we reviewed a Florida statute, which criminalizes, among other things, the act of <em>purchasing </em>28 grams or more of cocaine. <em>Shannon, </em>631 F.3d at 1188-89 (emphasis added). Because the district court was unable to determine the statutorily-prohibited act for which the defendant was convicted, we assumed that his conviction involved only the purchase of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 1189. In reviewing whether the prior Florida conviction qualified as a controlled substance offense, we found it significant that the definition of a controlled substance offense in \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) \u201cdoes not include the act of purchase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1188. Applying the plain language of \u00a7 4B 1.2(b), we held that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction did not qualify as a controlled substance offense because the offense involved \u201cno more than the purchase with intent to distribute,\u201d which is not an act that is covered by \u00a7 4B 1.2(b). <em>See id. </em>at 1189-90. Here, Craig\u2019s offense did not involve the act of purchasing drugs and, as such, our decision in <em>Shannon </em>is not directly applicable. Moreover, as discussed above, we have specifically addressed the Alabama statute at issue in the instant case and concluded that it covers distribution offenses, which is included in \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2019s definition of a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Craig\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
