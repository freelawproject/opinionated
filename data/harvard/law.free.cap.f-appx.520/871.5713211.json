Att\u2019y Gen., State of Fla., </em>506 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.2007) (providing that our review is limited to the issues specified in the COA). After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Jenkins\u2019 \u00a7 2254 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">Jenkins\u2019 request for federal habeas corpus relief is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (AEDPA). Under \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on claims that were denied on the merits in state court unless the state court decision was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\u201d in the state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l) \u2014 (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">The merits of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim are governed by the standard announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under <em>Strickland, </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>petitioner must show both (1) that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064. <em>Strickland </em>is not applied <em>de novo, </em>\u201cbut rather through the additional prism of AEDPA deference.\u201d <em>Lawrence v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>700 F.3d 464, 477, 480 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, \u201cthe pivotal question is whether the state court\u2019s application of the <em>Strickland </em>standard was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">With regard to the first element of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), there is no merit to Jenkins\u2019 argument that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to clearly established federal law because the state court utilized the <em>Strickland </em>standard. Jenkins argues the court should have analyzed his claim under <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), because his counsel\u2019s failure to request a self-defense instruction effectively denied him counsel at a critical stage of his trial. However, at no point during his trial was Jenkins actually or constructively denied the presence of counsel. <em>See Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1851 &amp; n. 3, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). The failure to request a jury instruction is a specific attorney error that is subject to <em>Strickland </em>\u2019s performance and prejudice components. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1851-52 (holding that the failure of an attorney to perform specific tasks was insufficient for the second <em>Cronic </em>exception and should be judged under the <em>Strickland </em>standard). Thus, the state court correctly identified the principles announced in <em>Strickland </em>as those governing the analysis of Jenkins\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">With regard to the second element of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>to the facts of Jenkins\u2019 case when it determined that Jenkins failed to establish either deficient performance or prejudice. The state court found that defense counsel\u2019s conduct was not deficient and that an instruction on the justifiable use of deadly force was inconsistent with the theory of the case because Jenkins: (1) presented an actual-innocence defense and argued that any violence was the result of his involuntary muscle reaction and that any allegations otherwise were fabrications by the officer; and (2) did not present any evidence of the affirmative defense of self-defense. This was not an unreasonable conclusion based on Florida precedent regarding jury instructions. <em>See Bertolotti v. State, </em>534 So.2d 386, 387 (Fla.1988) (holding defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction that was not warranted by the evidence); <em>Phillips v. State, </em>874 So.2d 705, 707 (Fla. 1st DCA 2004) (holding the trial court correctly denied a self-defense instruction where the defendant refused to acknowledge that he even wielded a knife).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">As for prejudice, Jenkins must show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different but for the alleged deficiency in counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2068. The state court\u2019s determination that Jenkins was not prejudiced as a result of his counsel\u2019s actions was not unreasonable because any request for an instruction on the justifiable use of deadly force would likely have been denied where no evidence of self-defense was presented. <em>See Phillips, </em>874 So.2d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-10\">.This appeal is consolidated with Jenkins\u2019 appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to quash the order dismissing his case. Jenkins was not granted a Certificate of Appealability (COA) as to the order denying his motion to quash and he has not made any argument regarding that appeal in his brief. As such, we consider his appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to quash abandoned. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\"[I]ssues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-14\">. A habeas petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b896-15\">. Jenkins does not argue that the state court's decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence, nor does he identify any facts that the state court unreasonably determined.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
