He sought short- and long-term disability benefits through a benefits plan managed by Defendant-Appellee Prudential Insurance Company of America. Prudential denied McFadden\u2019s claims. The district court granted summary judgment for Prudential. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>1. Facts and Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Alan McFadden was a sheet metal worker for Encompass Mechanical Services Southeast (\u201cEMSS\u201d). As he repaired a roof in January 2002, a helicopter flew overhead. The resulting force caused McFadden to fall onto the roof. He claimed injuries to his neck, shoulder, back, hip, and leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">McFadden applied for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits in 2002. The Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cMWCC\u201d) found that McFadden lost 5% of his \u201cwage-earning capacity\u201d due to his work injuries. The MWCC awarded him benefits in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">McFadden applied to the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) for disability benefits in 2003. The SSA found McFadden to be totally disabled, and awarded him disability benefits in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">McFadden applied for short-term disability benefits through EMSS\u2019 disability plan in 2008. The plan prohibited participants from receiving short-term disability benefits for \u201cany disabilities caused by, contributed to by, or resulting from ... <em>occupational sickness or injury.\u201d </em>The plan defined \u201coccupational sickness or injury\u201d to mean \u201can injury arising out of, or in the course of, any work for wage or profit regardless of employer, or a sickness covered, with respect to such work, by any workers\u2019 compensation law, occupational disease law or similar law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">Prudential Insurance Company of America (\u201cPrudential\u201d), which managed and underwrote the plan, denied McFadden\u2019s claim for short-term benefits. Prudential explained in a January 2009 letter that the plan language prohibited participants from recovering benefits for \u201can injury arising out of, or in the course of, any work for wage or profit,\u201d and that McFadden\u2019s injury arose out of such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">McFadden also applied for long-term disability benefits through the plan. The plan provided that a participant could receive long-term disability \u201cwhen Prudential determines\u201d that \u201cyou are unable to perform the <em>material and substantial duties </em>of your <em>regular occupation </em>due to your <em>sickness </em>or <em>injury </em>\u201d and \u201cyou have a 20% or more loss in your <em>indexed monthly earnings </em>due to that <em>sickness </em>or <em>injury.\u201d </em>The plan provided that a participant was \u201cdisabled\u201d if, after 24 months of payments, \u201cdue to the same sickness or injury, [the participant is] unable to perform the duties of any <em>gainful occupation </em>for which [the participant is] reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-18\">Prudential denied McFadden\u2019s claim for long-term benefits. Prudential explained in an April 2009 letter: that McFadden \u201cdid not fall a significant distance\u201d; that McFadden\u2019s \u201coriginal description of the events does not suggest a mechanism expected to cause ... severe pain and dysfunction\u201d; that \u201cfollow-up physicians noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>[McFadden] had a dramatic physical presentation and pain behaviors that did not match anatomic patterns of the injury and mechanism reported\u201d; and that there were unexplainable \u201cinconsistencies,\u201d including \u201cnotes reflecting [McFadden] had no strength deficit.\u201d Prudential noted that it reviewed medical record from more than twenty doctors, medical clinics, and treatment centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Prudential also rejected McFadden\u2019s administrative appeals. A Prudential appeals analyst explained that a physician who reviewed McFadden\u2019s flies found that \u201c[p]er many of the providers from 2002 to 2009, there is not significant evidence to support the claimant\u2019s pain complaints,\u201d and that \u201c[s]everal providers have specifically stated that they are not able to correlate [McFadden\u2019s] pain complaints with either his report of the mechanism of injury or MRI and EMG findings.\u201d The appeals analyst indicated that Prudential had considered the SSA\u2019s disability finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The district court granted summary judgment for Prudential. The district court found that Prudential did not abuse its discretion in denying the short-term benefits because the \u201c[short-term disability] plan did not cover on-the-job injuries.\u201d The district court found that Prudential did not abuse its discretion in denying long-term benefits because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">The administrative record shows that Prudential\u2019s decision to deny [long-term disability] benefits was supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious. McFadden\u2019s inability to work was not substantiated on the record. Within a month of the accident, one doctor noted McFadden\u2019s \u201cdramatic\u201d behavior and \u201cbizarre\u201d symptoms not rationally connected to his injuries, while another doctor found \u201cmoderate secondary gain behavior.\u201d ... Instead, the common thread weaving through the record is multiple doctors\u2019 skepticism about McFadden\u2019s symptoms and purpose in seeking medical attention, related to their concern that he was attempting to feed an addiction to narcotics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The district added that Prudential\u2019s denial of benefits was not \u201cproceduralfly] unreasonable[]\u201d because Prudential addressed the adverse SSA finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">McFadden appeals. As in district court, he proceeds <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\n<em>2. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">\u201cThis Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>592 F.3d 645, 651 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">\n<em>3. McFadden\u2019s Benefits Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">\u201cWe limit our review of the interpretation of a benefits plan under [the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) ] to the administrative record.\u201d <em>LifeCare Mgmt. Servs. LLC v. Ins. Mgmt. Adm\u2019rs Inc., </em>703 F.3d 835, 841 (5th Cir.2013). If, as the parties agree is the case here, the benefits plan gives the plan administrator \u201cdiscretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits under the plan or to interpret the plan\u2019s provisions, our standard of review is abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>394 F.3d 262, 269 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA plan administrator abuses its discretion where the decision is not based on evidence, even if disputable, that clearly supports the basis for its denial.\u201d <em>Schexnay</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>der v. Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>600 F.3d 465, 468 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the plan administrator\u2019s \u201cdecision is supported by substantial evidence and is not arbitrary or capricious, it must prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, less than a preponderance, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>394 F.3d at 273 (internal quotation marks omitted). In evaluating whether there is substantial evidence, \u201ccourts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant\u2019s physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician\u2019s evaluation.\u201d <em>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">We consider whether the plan administrator has a conflict of interest in deciding if the administrator abused its discretion. <em>See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008). A plan administrator has a conflict of interest if it \u201cboth evaluates claims for benefits and pays benefits claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 128 S.Ct. 2343. However, \u201cconflicts are but one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 128 S.Ct. 2343. \u201c[A]ny one factor will act as a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced, the degree of closeness necessary depending upon the tiebreaking factor\u2019s inherent or case-specific importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We also consider whether the plan administrator acted \u201cproeeduralfly] unreasonable!]\u201d \u2014 that is, if the administrator \u201cfail[ed] to address the Social Security Administration\u2019s finding that the claimant was \u2018totally disabled.\u2019\u201d <em>Schexnayder, </em>600 F.3d at 471 (quoting <em>Glenn v. MetLife, </em>461 F.3d 660, 669 (6th Cir.2006), <em>aff'd, Glenn, </em>554 U.S. at 105, 128 S.Ct. 2343). \u201cThis procedural unreasonableness is important in its own right and also \u2018justified] the court in giving more weight to the conflict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schexnayder, </em>600 F.3d at 471 (quoting <em>Glenn, </em>554 U.S. at 118, 128 S.Ct. 2343).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>(a) Short-Term Disability Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Here, the district court correctly found that the plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in denying McFadden\u2019s claim for short-term disability benefits because the \u201cplain meaning of the plan language,\u201d <em>Threadgill v. Prudential Sec. Grp., Inc., </em>145 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1998), forecloses McFadden\u2019s claim. The benefits plan provided that it does not cover \u201cany disabilities caused by ... <em>occupational ... injury </em>\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201can injury arising out of, or in the course of, any work for wage or profit regardless of employer.\u201d MeFadden does not dispute, and the record shows, that his injury \u2014 caused when he fell while completing a paid roofing job for his employer \u2014 arose out of, and in the course of, such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">MeFadden argues for the first time on appeal that his injuries come within the plan\u2019s exception for occupational injuries of \u201cpartners or sole proprietors who cannot be covered by workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d To the extent that MeFadden has not waived this argument, <em>see Martco Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Wellons, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 864, 877 (5th Cir.2009), his injury does not come within the exception because, as he acknowledges, he received workers\u2019 compensation for the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\"><em>(b) Long-Term Disability Benefits </em>,</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">Here, the district court correctly found that the plan administrator did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>abuse its discretion in denying McFadden\u2019s claim for long-term disability benefits because there was \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>394 F.3d at 273, to show that McFadden did not qualify for such benefits under the terms of the plan. The plan provided that McFadden could receive long-term benefits only if he was \u201cunable to perform the <em>material and substantial duties </em>of [his] <em>regular occupation </em>due to [his] <em>sickness </em>or <em>injury.\u201d </em>The plan administrator, in rejecting McFadden\u2019s disability claim, relied on medical records showing that McFadden could perform the \u201cmaterial and substantial duties\u201d of his job. For example, Dr. Anson Thaggard found during multiple examinations that McFadden \u201c[d]id not fall from any height,\u201d that McFadden exhibited \u201csome fairly bizarre symptoms that don\u2019t seem to match any specific dermatological or anatomical\u201d patterns, and that it was \u201cnot really clear why he is having that sort of pain.\u201d Dr. David Collipp found that there were no \u201cobjective signs of physical abnormality, only lack of participation,\u201d that McFadden was \u201c0 percent\u201d impaired, and that McFadden could return to \u201cMedium-Heavy to Heavy\u201d work. Dr. Robert Smith found that McFadden \u201cis taking far too much medication and should be weaned and gotten back to some kind of activity.\u201d Dr. Robert McGuire found that, as of September 2003, McFadden\u2019s herniated disc \u201chad essentially resolved [itself].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">McFadden argues that there is substantial evidence supporting his disability claim because the medical records show that, for example, he suffered a herniated disc and received pain medication for a prolonged period. He contends that the district court \u201cengaged in \u2018cherry picking\u2019 of the record and deferred to the \u2018cherry picking\u2019 of the record by Prudential.\u201d Yet under the deferential standard by which we review a plan administrator\u2019s denial, the question is not whether there is substantial evidence to support a disability claim, but whether there is substantial evidence to support the denial. <em>See Schexnayder, </em>600 F.3d at 468; <em>Ellis, </em>394 F.3d at 273. Given the findings by Drs. Thaggard, Collipp, Smith, and McGuire, discussed above, we cannot say that the record was devoid of substantial evidence to support Prudential\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">McFadden also argues that Prudential\u2019s denial conflicted with the SSA disability finding. He contends that Prudential at least should have explained why it departed from the SSA finding. However, a plan administrator only needs to \u201caddress\u201d a contrary SSA award. <em>Schexnayder, </em>600 F.3d at 471 (finding that a plan administrator\u2019s denial was proeedurally unreasonable because the administrator \u201cfailed to acknowledge an agency determination that was in direct conflict with its own determination\u201d). Prudential discussed the SSA finding in multiple phone calls with McFadden, explaining in one call that the finding did not require Prudential to award McFadden benefits. Prudential also referenced the SSA finding in its letter denying McFadden\u2019s first administrative appeal. Given that Prudential addressed the SSA finding in multiple communications with McFadden, and that a plan administrator need not \u201cgive any particular weight to ... contrary findings,\u201d <em>Schexnayder, </em>600 F.3d at 471 n. 3; <em>see Nord, </em>538 U.S. at 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, Prudential\u2019s denial was not proeedurally unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>McFadden also argues that the district court should have given more weight to Prudential\u2019s structural conflict of interest. To the extent that such a conflict exists, it only \u201cwill act as a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced.\u201d <em>Glenn, </em>554 U.S. at 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343. Given that, as discussed above, the other factors are not \u201cclosely balanced\u201d because there is substantial evidence to support Prudential\u2019s denial, the alleged conflict does not require us to find that Prudential abused its discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In sum, the district court correctly found that Prudential did not abuse its discretion in denying MeFadden\u2019s benefits claims because the plain language of the plan foreclosed MeFadden\u2019s claim for short-term benefits, and because there was substantial evidence supporting Prudential\u2019s denial of MeFadden\u2019s claim for long-term benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\n<em>i. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Prudential.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">. Prudential also discussed the SSA disability finding in at least two phone calls with McFadden. In one of the calls, a Prudential employee apparently explained to McFadden that the SSA finding \"is not what our opinion is based on.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-5\">. McFadden also argues that Prudential should have addressed his workers' compensation award. However, McFadden does not cite, nor could we find, case law that imposes a duty on a plan administrator to consider such an award. Further, the state board's finding that McFadden was <em>5% </em>disabled does not necessarily conflict with the plan adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>trator's finding that McFadden was not disabled under the terms of the plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ABy\">. McFadden appears to argue that the district court erred by not allowing him to conduct discovery on Prudential\u2019s alleged conflict of interest. As discussed above, however, even if there were a conflict in this case, it would not change the outcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b313-23\">. We also deny McFadden's claim for attorney\u2019s fees because he did not prevail in this action. <em>See LifeCare, </em>703 F.3d at 846.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
