He was deemed a career offender and sentenced within the guidelines range to 211 months in prison. Forrest argues- on appeal that the district court erred in classifying him as a career offender because he was not actually convicted of his predicate offenses. In particular, Forrest asserts that he never pleaded guilty to the charges, that the Louisiana state court found that he was not competent to stand trial on the charges, and that he was released to probation, which was subsequently revoked and then released after his stay in a mental health facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">A defendant is a career offender if he was at least 18 years old at the time of the offense, the offense is a felony crime of violence or controlled substance offense, and the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.3), the definitions in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 are used to determine what qualifies as a predicate conviction under \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">Because Forrest did not object to the career offender enhancement in the district court, we review this issue for plain error. To show plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If Forrest makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but it will do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Forrest\u2019s career offender argument fails for at least two reasons. First, because this court has not addressed whether Forrest\u2019s probation, which was imposed pursuant to former Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure article 648, and the subsequent revocation of that probation, constitutes a conviction for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1, Forrest cannot show that any error was clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d 415, 418-22 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 756 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">Second, Forrest cannot show an effect on his substantial rights because he cannot establish a reasonable probability of a lower sentence on remand. <em>See Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d at 424. In particular, the district court gave an extensive and thorough discussion of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, asserted that it would impose the same sentence regardless of any error in the guidelines calculations, and stated that Forrest\u2019s sentence was similar to that of a codefendant. In light of the foregoing, Forrest has not established plain error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>connection with the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Forrest also contends that his 211-month sentence is substantively unreasonable based on his mental incompetency and his drug addiction. The district court considered Forrest\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence, including his mental health and drug addiction problems, as well as the presentence report. The district court found noteworthy that Forrest had committed a serious drug offense that involved large quantities of various drugs, that he repeatedly engaged in drug trafficking after he was diverted from criminal prosecution, and that he avoided criminal prosecution by malingering; as such, the court determined that the public needed to be protected from him and that he was likely to recidivate. In addition, the court noted that Forrest\u2019s sentence was similar to a codefendant\u2019s sentence and also stated that his sentence should be reduced by 94 months for time served, which would result in \u201can actual sentence of 117 months.\u201d The record reflects that the district court made an individualized assessment based on the facts of Forrest\u2019s case in light of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, because the district court stated that even if it had erred in calculating the guidelines range, it would impose the same sentence, Forrest cannot establish that any error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Esca-lante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d at 424. Forrest has not shown that the district court committed error, plain or otherwise, in connection with the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
