Parker raises no issue, however, with respect to that amended judgment. <em>E.g., Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (failure to brief issues relating to judgment appealed from equivalent to not appealing at all). He instead raises claims rejected by the district court in denying his related 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. (Although the \u00a7 2255 motion was denied, it prompted the judgment\u2019s being amended.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Parker, however, has not obtained the requisite certificate of appealability (COA) authorizing an appeal of those claims. The COA requirement is jurisdictional. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On the other hand, Parker has an appeal pending (case number 12-50628) from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court denied a COA. He may seek a COA from this court for that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
