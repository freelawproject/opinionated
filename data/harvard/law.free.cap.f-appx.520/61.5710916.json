Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-19\">In August 2012, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, the National Hockey League, and the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball filed a complaint alleging that New Jersey\u2019s recent legislation concerning the legalization and regulation of wagering on certain sporting events violates the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (\u201cPASPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701 et seq. Collectively, they sought an injunction preventing the state legalizing and regulating these wagering activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-20\">On October 22, 2012, Kupersmit filed a pro se application to appear as amicus curiae and to intervene for purposes of (1) deferring any decision \u201cuntil the U.S. Congress changes the law on the reporting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>gambling income only as it relates to thoroughbred racing\u201d and (2) transferring the record from the closed case of <em>Office of the Comm\u2019r of Baseball v. Markell </em>(D.Del.1:09-cv-538). The plaintiffs and defendants both filed letters opposing Ku-persmit\u2019s request. The District Court denied Kupersmit\u2019s request, noting that he had not met the requirements for intervention under both Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a) and (b). Kupersmit then timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the denial of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion, although the standard is more rigorous for the denial of intervention as of right. <em>Brody v. Spang, </em>957 F.2d 1108, 1115 (3d Cir.1992) (\u201cWe review a denial of a motion to intervene as of right for abuse of discretion, although this review is \u2018more stringent\u2019 than the abuse of discretion review we apply to a denial of a motion for permissive intervention.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Kupersmit has failed to meet the requirements for intervention as of right. A litigant seeking to intervene pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2) must establish: \u201c(1) a timely application for leave to intervene, (2) a sufficient interest in the underlying litigation, (3) a threat that the interest will be impaired or affected by the disposition of the underlying action, and (4) that the existing parties to the action do not adequately represent the prospective interve-nor\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Treesdale, Inc., </em>419 F.3d 216, 220 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Kleissler v. United States Forest Serv., </em>157 F.3d 964, 969 (3d Cir.1998)). Each requirement \u201cmust be met to intervene as of right.\u201d <em>Mountain Top Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Dave Stabbert Master Builder, Inc., </em>72 F.3d 361, 366 (3d Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Kupersmit\u2019s application on the ground that his interest was insufficient to warrant intervention. Kupersmit sought to intervene to challenge the tax treatment of thoroughbred racing gambling income; however, this interest does not relate to the question of whether New Jersey\u2019s recent sports gambling legislation violates the PASPA. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Moreover, permissive intervention is only available when \u201can applicant\u2019s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 24(b)(1)(B). As noted above, Ku-persmit\u2019s concerns regarding the taxation of thoroughbred racing gambling income have no question of law or fact in common with the question of whether New Jersey\u2019s sports gambling legislation violates the PASPA. Furthermore, the differences between the claims are such that allowing Kupersmit to intervene would have \u201cunduly delay[ed]\u201d the adjudication of Appellants\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, no substantial question is presented and we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. We deny Kupersmit\u2019s motion for an order staying a sale of property.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">. We have previously held that \"the denial of a motion to intervene is a final, appealable order.\u201d <em>United States v. Alcan Aluminum, Inc., 25 </em>F.3d 1174, 1179 (3d Cir.1994); <em>see also McClune v. Shamah, </em>593 F.2d 482, 485 (3d Cir.1979). Conversely, \u201canyone who is involved in an action sufficiently to have a right of appeal from its final disposition does not have an immediate right of appeal from a denial or partial denial of intervention.\u201d <em>Carlough v. Amchem Prods., Inc., </em>5 F.3d 707, 712 (3d Cir.1993). Here, however, Kupersmit has no rights of participation because he is not a member of the plaintiff's group; accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review the denial of his motion to intervene. We lack appellate jurisdiction to the extent the District Court's order simply denied Kupersmit leave to act as amicus curiae. <em>Boston &amp; Providence R.R. Stockholders Dev. Grp. v. Smith, </em>333 F.2d 651, 652 (2d Cir.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-12\">. We further agree that Kupersmit has not demonstrated that a federal statute gives him an unconditional or conditional right to intervene, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and that he failed to \"state the grounds for intervention\u201d and include \"a pleading that set[] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>out the claim or defense for which intervention [was] sought,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(c). Ku-persmit leave to act as amicus curiae. <em>Boston &amp; Providence R.R. Stockholders Dev. Grp. v. Smith, </em>333 F.2d 651, 652 (2d Cir.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
