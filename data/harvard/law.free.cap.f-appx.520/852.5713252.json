She argues the court erred by (1) applying an enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and (2) calculating the loss amount based on tax refunds she never received. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">The district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement for obstruction of justice. The Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Eye attempted to obstruct the administration of justice when she attempted to flee the courtroom prior to her trial, and when she sent the trial judge a threatening letter that attempted to extort from him $600 million if he did not dismiss her case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1; <em>see also United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296, 1310 n. 12 (11th Cir.2005). Because the district court explained why Eye\u2019s conduct warranted the enhancement and described how she hindered the prosecution of her offenses, <em>see United States v. Alpert, </em>28 F.3d 1104, 1107-08 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc), the court did not err in concluding Eye \u201cconsciously acted with the purpose of obstructing justice,\u201d <em>see United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">Also, the district court did not clearly err in calculating the tax loss in this case at $1,127,559. Eye submitted claims for refunds to which she was not entitled totaling $1,127,559. According to the Sentencing Guidelines and this Court\u2019s precedent, $1,127,559 was precisely the loss amount in this case for sentencing purposes, because that is the loss Eye \u201cintended] to create when [she] falsifie[d] [her] tax returns.\u201d <em>See United States v. Clarke, </em>562 F.3d 1158, 1164 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(e)(l) (\u201cIf the offense involved tax evasion or a fraudulent or false return, statement, or other document, the tax loss is the total amount of loss that was the object of the offense (i.e., the loss that would have resulted had the offense been successfully completed).\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Tl.l(c)(4) (\u201cIf the offense involved improperly claiming a refund to which the [defendant] was not entitled, the tax loss is the amount of the claimed refund.\u201d). That Eye never received those refunds is irrelevant; she intended to cause those losses when she filed her fraudulent returns. Therefore, the district court\u2019s loss amount determination is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Clarke, </em>562 F.3d at 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>The district court\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-11\">.
