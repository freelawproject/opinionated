His motion was based on his having been detained for a competency evaluation beyond the 45 days permitted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4241(b) and 4247(b). Conlan has since been found incompetent and detained under \u00a7 4241(d) for a determination of whether treatment might restore his competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The appeal is moot because Conlan is no longer detained under the terms of \u00a7 4247(b) but under a later, unchallenged detention order. We can no longer provide relief from the expired detention even if it were unlawful under \u00a7 4247(b). <em>See United States v. Montelongo, </em>32 F.3d 565, 1994 WL 442366, at *1 (5th Cir. July 25, 1994) (dismissing as moot a claim that the defendant was unlawfully detained for a competency evaluation); <em>see also </em>5th CiR. Rule 47.5.3 (\u201cUnpublished opinions issued before January 1, 1996, are precedent.\u201d); <em>McLain v. Beto, </em>458 F.2d 503, 504 (5th Cir.1972) (pretermitting the question of whether interlocutory orders were appeal-able because the appeal was moot). Con-lan fails to show that there is a case or controversy raising issues that are \u201creal and substantial and not merely academic or speculative.\u201d <em>Troy State Univ. v. Dickey, </em>402 F.2d 515, 516 (5th Cir.1968). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT. Con-lan\u2019s motion to relieve present counsel and to appoint new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
