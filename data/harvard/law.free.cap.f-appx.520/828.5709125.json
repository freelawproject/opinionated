The deed was recorded with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>County on October 15, 2001, but while the attestation page of the security deed contained the signature of \u201can officer,\u201d it did not contain the signature of \u201cone additional witness,\u201d as required by Georgia Code \u00a7 44-14-3B. Five years later, Bennett declared bankruptcy. The Trustee contends that it can avoid the lien on the Locust Grove property because the security deed was not properly recorded due to the missing signature. The bankruptcy court granted the Trustee summary judgment on that issue, and the district court affirmed. National City appeals, arguing that the signature of one additional witness on the \u201cwaiver of borrower\u2019s rights,\u201d which was attached to, filed with, and incorporated by reference<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> into the security deed, cures the filing defect in the security deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">This case is controlled by the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s answer to our certified questions in <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Gordon, </em>\u2014 S.E.2d -, 292 Ga. 474 (Ga.2013). In that case, the Court held that a deed\u2019s incorporation of a rider that contained the attestations required by Georgia Code \u00a7 44-14-33 did not cure the deed\u2019s lack of the additional witness\u2019s signature. 292 Ga. at 477. Therefore, National City\u2019s contention that the security deed in this case was properly filed is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">National City also contends that the re-cordation of the waiver provides inquiry notice of the rest of the security deed. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Wells Fargo. </em>The Court held that the attested rider in <em>Wells Fargo </em>did not put a bona fide purchaser on inquiry notice. <em>Id. </em>at 478. The Court explained: \u201cIn this case, while the waiver identifies the lender and grantors ..., it only generically references a security deed and fails to identify or describe the property purportedly to be conveyed or encumbered by the referenced security deed. In the total absence of identification or description of the property subject to the security deed, the waiver itself would not place a bona fide purchaser on notice that he should make further inquiry.\u201d 292 Ga. at 477-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">The only question that remains for us to decide, then, is whether the waiver in this case contains a sufficient description of the property encumbered by the security deed. The waiver identifies the borrower, the lender, and the loan amount and states that the loan is \u201csecured by property located in land lot(s) 101, 2nd district, Henry County, Georgia.\u201d According to an assertion in the Trustee\u2019s brief, which National City has not disputed, land lot 101 in the 2nd District does not identify just one address; it encompasses parts of at least three neighborhoods. Accordingly, the description is \u201cmanifestly too meager, imperfect, or uncertain to serve as adequate means of identification\u201d and therefore does not provide inquiry notice of the security deed. <em>See id. </em>at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">. The district court held that the waiver was not incorporated into the security deed because the deed incorporated all \"riders\" but the waiver was not a rider. We do not address that argument because even if the waiver was properly incorporated, it does not cure the deed's filing defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
