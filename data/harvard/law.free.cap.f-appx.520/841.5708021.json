On appeal, Johnson first argues that the district court erred by departing upward from the guideline range. Second, Johnson argues that the district court exhibited bias against him by considering his family situation \u2014 his children born out of wedlock and his marital status \u2014 at sentencing, and, therefore, should have recused itself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). After thorough review, we vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">On appeal, Johnson first challenges the procedural reasonableness of the district court\u2019s upward variance. In reviewing the procedural reasonableness of a sentence, this Court ensures that the district court has committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or inadequately explaining the chosen sentence. Gall <em>v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A factual finding at sentencing is clearly erroneous when \u201calthough there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1195 (11th Cir.2011), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1066, 181 L.Ed.2d 781 (2012). The district court is not required at sentencing to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the factors individually. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). However, a district court does commit procedural error when it inadequately explains how the facts of the case operate under enunciated \u00a7 3553(a) factors to justify a variance from the guideline range. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1093-94 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">Here, we find that Johnson\u2019s sentence was based, at least in part, on clearly erroneous facts. The district court, at the very beginning of sentencing, stated that it was considering an upward variance due to the fact that Johnson had been a supplier and distributor of illegal drugs, that he had an extensive criminal history, that Johnson had a number of revocations of probation by state authorities, and that, had Johnson pled guilty or been convicted of all counts in the superseding indictment, his required term of imprisonment would have been at least ten years. The district court then permitted Johnson\u2019s counsel, the government, and Johnson himself to address the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">After hearing from all parties, the district court upwardly varied from the guideline range of 46-57 months and sentenced Johnson to a 66-month sentence. After handing down the sentence, the district court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">The Court has given the reasons, but the conduct of the defendant over a long course of time resulting in a continual, almost continual violation of law, many of the things that he is charged with and has committed are not considered in the calculation of the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-13\">Beginning at age 18, and continuing as I have already noted, is a person who has been out of control, smoking marijuana on a daily basis. <em>And it has led </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number><em>to, no doubt, a distraught and broken family, the lives of so many people, both victims and the victims by virtue of their dependency on him has been occurring a long period of time. </em>Doc. 673 at 17 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We hold that the district court relied on clearly erroneous facts when it concluded that Johnson\u2019s smoking of marijuana \u201cled to, no doubt, a distraught and broken family,\u201d and that there were \u201cvictims by virtue of their dependency on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The district court questioned Johnson regarding his three children by three different women whom he had never married. Johnson stated to both the probation officer and the court that he had provided support for his children prior to his arrest and that, at the time of the sentencing hearing, he was engaged to be married. Additionally, Johnson\u2019s attorney represented to the court that Johnson\u2019s children had visited him at prison at least seven times and that Johnson was \u201cvery responsible for\u201d his children and \u201cvery connected to them.\u201d Johnson\u2019s attorney reiterated numerous times to the court that Johnson \u201chas been taking care of his children\u201d and that she felt a sentence within the guideline range was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The PSI does not include any facts that could support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Johnson\u2019s actions had led to a \u201cdistraught and broken\u201d family. Additionally, the government did not counter any of the statements Johnson or his attorney made, and the government specifically stated that it felt that a sentence within the guideline range was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">After a thorough review of the record, we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>See Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1195. Although we cannot be sure how much the district court relied on these factual findings when sentencing Johnson, we must conclude that the district court failed to adequately explain its reasons for Johnson\u2019s sentence in a way that \u201callows for meaningful appellate review and promotes the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>See Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1093. There is simply no evidence in the record to support the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding Johnson\u2019s family or any victims resulting from their dependency on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">To the extent that the district court relied on these clearly erroneous facts in varying upward, we hold that the district court erred. Because we cannot ascertain what effect any such reliance had on the district court\u2019s decision to vary upwardly, and because the district court failed to explain that, Johnson\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Accordingly, we vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Johnson also argues that the district court judge should have recused himself from the case. Ordinarily, we review a judge\u2019s decision not to recuse himself for bias for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1227 (11th Cir.2004). Where a party fails to move for recusal in the proceedings below, however, we review for plain error. <em>Id. </em>To satisfy the plain-error standard, we must find that (1) the district court committed \u201cerror\u201d in that \u201ca legal rule was violated,\u201d (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>error was plain or \u201cobvious,\u201d and (3) the error \u201caffected substantial rights\u201d in that the error was prejudicial and not harmless. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these criteria are met, we may, in our discretion, correct the plain error if the error \u201cseriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Under \u00a7 455(a) of Title 28 of the U.S.Code, a federal judge should recuse himself where \u201chis impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). In reviewing whether a district court judge should have recused himself under \u00a7 455(a), we ask whether \u201can objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2003). Further, the alleged bias \u201cmust stem from extrajudicial sources, unless the judge\u2019s acts demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it unfairly prejudices one of the parties.\u201d <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). Where properly before the district court, historical facts unrelated to a defendant\u2019s offense are proper considerations at sentencing when they relate to a \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>453 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cage, his pri- or minimal criminal record, and his medical condition\u201d were \u201call valid considerations because they related to the \u2018history and characteristics of the defendant\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Here, the district court was not required to recuse itself. The court\u2019s consideration of the issue was not demonstrative of pervasive bias, and, therefore, Johnson cannot show that the district court\u2019s failure to recuse itself was \u201cerror,\u201d let alone plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, the district court was not required to recuse itself. However, for the reasons discussed in Part I, we vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\">. We disagree with Johnson, however, that it was inappropriate for the district court to state that Johnson had engaged in \"consistent criminal conduct\" resulting in \"continual violation of the law.\" This factual finding was not clearly erroneous in light of Johnson's admission that he used marijuana on a daily basis between his arrests in September 1999 and June 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
