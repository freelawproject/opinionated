In its motion, SEC argued the final judgment was invalid because it was based on an unenforceable settlement agreement. According to SEC, the settlement was unenforceable because its prior counsel was not authorized to enter it on SEC\u2019s behalf. The district court, however, disagreed with SEC and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that SEC\u2019s prior counsel was indeed authorized to enter the settlement. On appeal, SEC contends the district court did not apply the correct legal standard in reaching that conclusion, and therefore the court abused its discretion by denying SEC\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-21\">When determining whether an attorney was authorized to enter a settlement agreement, we look to the law of the state in which the agreement was entered. <em>Murchison v. Grand Cypress Hotel Corp., </em>13 F.3d 1483, 1485 (11th Cir.1994). Under Florida law, the settlement agreement is valid if SEC\u2019s prior counsel had \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d authority to enter it on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>SEC\u2019s behalf. <em>See Weitzman v. Bergman, </em>555 So.2d 448, 449-50 (Fla. 4th DCA 1990). Although the district court expressly adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that SEC\u2019s prior counsel had \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d authority, SEC asserts the court \u201ccould not possibly have employed\u201d that standard in denying its Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">SEC\u2019s contention is meritless. Because SEC challenges only the district court\u2019s legal standard and not its factual findings, SEC has abandoned any claim that those findings are erroneous. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that unless parties \u201cplainly and prominently\u201d raise a claim or issue on appeal it \u201cwill be considered abandoned\u201d). Accordingly, we accept as true the following facts: (1) SEC \u201cauthorized [its prior counsel] to negotiate a stipulated settlement of the instant case on behalf of\u2019 SEC, (2) SEC and its prior counsel were in \u201cfrequent\u201d communication during settlement negotiations, (3) SEC was informed of and \u201cagreed\u201d to \u201cthe terms of the proposed settlement,\u201d and (4) SEC\u2019s prior counsel \u201cdid not receive notice\u201d of SEC\u2019s \u201csecond thoughts about the stipulation\u201d until \u201cwell after the stipulation had become binding and enforceable.\u201d On those facts, the district court did not err in concluding SEC\u2019s prior counsel had \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d authority to enter the stipulated settlement at the time the agreement was executed and filed. <em>See Murchison, </em>13 F.3d at 1485-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The district court\u2019s order denying SEC\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the final judgment in this case is AFF-FIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-15\">. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1137 (11th Cir.2000). An abuse of discretion occurs if the court applies an erroneous legal standard or makes clearly erroneous findings of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 1137 n. 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
