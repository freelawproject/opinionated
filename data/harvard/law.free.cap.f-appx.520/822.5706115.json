Copeland argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the government breached the plea agreement by failing to recommend a three-level guideline reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. After review, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">A. The Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">In 2011, a federal grand jury issued a 38-count indictment against Copeland, charging him with 11 counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; 16 counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; 9 counts of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A; and 2 counts of making false claims against the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. The indictment alleged that Copeland, with the help of other co-conspirators, engaged in a prolonged tax fraud scheme by using stolen identities to file fraudulent tax returns and obtain refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">B. The Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b847-20\">In 2012, Copeland entered into a written plea agreement with the government, in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of wire fraud (Count 27), one count of aggravated identity theft (Count 36), and one count of making a false claim against the United States (Count 37). In exchange, the government agreed to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>miss the remaining counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">It is undisputed that, before entering the plea agreement, the government was aware of two pre-indictment incidents that were later used to enhance Copeland\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice. Specifically, (1) in February 2010, after the investigation into Copeland\u2019s criminal activities commenced, Copeland attempted to destroy evidence while fleeing from law enforcement officers, and, (2) in September 2011, Copeland intimidated a potential witness by striking the witness with his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Despite knowing of these incidents, the government agreed to recommend a two- or three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Specifically, the plea agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\"><em>Acceptance of Responsibility </em>\u2014 Three <em>Levels</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\"><em>At the time of sentencing, and in the event that no adverse information is received suggesting such a recommendation to be unwarranted, the United States will recommend to the Court that the defendant receive a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E 1.1(a). </em>The defendant understands that this recommendation or request is not binding on the Court, and if not accepted by the Court, the defendant will not be allowed to withdraw from the plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">Further, at the time of sentencing ... the United States agrees to file a motion pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b) for a downward adjustment of one additional level. The defendant understands that the determination as to whether the defendant has qualified for a downward adjustment of a third level for acceptance of responsibility rests solely with the [government], and the defendant agrees that the defendant cannot and will not challenge that determination, whether by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">The plea agreement also contained a separate \u201cSubstantial Assistance\u201d provision, pursuant to which Copeland agreed to \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with the government\u2019s investigation, and, in return, the government would \u201cconsider\u201d filing a motion for, <em>inter alia, </em>a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">In a paragraph entitled \u201cSentencing Information,\u201d the government reserved its right (1) to provide all relevant sentencing information to the district court and the U.S. Probation Office, and (2) \u201cto make any recommendations it deems appropriate regarding the disposition of this case, subject to any limitations set forth herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">C. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">After the district court accepted Copeland\u2019s guilty plea, a probation officer compiled the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), calculating Copeland\u2019s guideline range. The PSI calculated a total offense level of 42, which included, <em>inter alia, </em>a 2-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The PSI applied this enhancement because of the two above incidents that occurred before Copeland was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">The PSI did not apply a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction for acceptance of responsibility, given the above two incidents and because Copeland \u201cdid not truthfully admit all of his conduct and relevant conduct\u201d and did not \u201cvoluntarily assist authorities with the recovery of the fruits of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">Copeland\u2019s total offense level of 42 and his criminal history category of I yielded an initial guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment. Because the combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>statutory maximum sentences for wire fraud (Count 27) and making false claims (Count 87) totaled 25 years (300 months), the guideline range for those offenses became 300 months, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(b). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 287, 1343.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">D. Objections to the PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Copeland objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1, noting that the government had agreed to recommend a two-level reduction in the plea agreement. Copeland also objected, among other things, to the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The government did not object to the PSI or its failure to include the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. On the contrary, the government filed a sentencing memorandum affirmatively arguing that (1) the obstruction-of-justice enhancement should apply, given Copeland\u2019s two pre-indictment incidents mentioned in the PSI, and (2) the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction should not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The government acknowledged that, in the plea agreement, it had agreed to recommend a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction for acceptance of responsibility. It argued, however, that this \u201crecommendation was included in light of the fact that the plea agreement also contain[ed] provisions which would provide for a downward departure motion pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, should the defendant provide substantial assistance.\u201d In other words, the government appeared to argue that its agreement to recommend an aceeptance-of-responsibility reduction was tied to whether it also filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial-assistance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">The government further explained that, although an obstruction-of-justice enhancement usually precludes an aeceptance-of-responsibility reduction, both the enhancement and the reduction may apply in \u201cextraordinary cases.\u201d Thus, Copeland could have qualified for the \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction if he \u201cprovided full, complete, and total cooperation which supported a Section 5K1.1 motion.\u201d According to the government, because no \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was forthcoming in this case, there were no extraordinary circumstances justifying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">E. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">At the sentencing hearing, the government essentially reiterated the above argument from its sentencing memorandum, stating that Copeland could have qualified for an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1, even with the enhancement for obstruction of justice, but, given Copeland\u2019s lack of cooperation with the government, the reduction was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">The district court overruled Copeland\u2019s objection to the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, finding that the government established obstruction by a preponderance of the evidence. The district court then upheld the PSI\u2019s denial of the reduction for acceptance of responsibility. While noting that Copeland expressed remorse for his crimes, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>I don\u2019t find a lot of acknowledgment of the scope of the fraud, the complications of the fraud to the extent that other people were involved in the criminal enterprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-4\">I don\u2019t find any discussion about the disposition of the proceeds of the fraud, which is particularly troublesome to the Court, and is oftentimes I think a very good barometer of the acceptance of responsibility; and I find all those things to be absent here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The district court then adopted the PSI\u2019s guideline calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In sentencing Copeland, the district court varied downward from the applicable guideline range of 300 months and imposed a total sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 27 and 37 (wire fraud and making false claims). The district court explained that the downward variance was justified in light of the potential sentencing disparities between Copeland and other defendants involved in Copeland\u2019s tax fraud scheme. The district court also imposed a statutorily mandated 24-month consecutive sentence as to Count 36, for a total sentence of 264 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">A. Plea Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">\u201cThe government is bound by any material promises it makes to a defendant as part of a plea agreement that induces the defendant to plead guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Horsfall, 552 </em>F.3d 1275, 1281 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We analyze the plea agreement according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding on entering the plea. <em>United States v. Rewis, </em>969 F.2d 985, 988 (11th Cir.1992). If the government disputes the defendant\u2019s understanding, we use \u201cobjective standards\u201d to determine the terms of the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>An ambiguous agreement \u201cmust be read against the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1105-06 (11th.Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">B. Copeland\u2019s Plea Agreement about Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">In this case, the plea agreement stated that the government would recommend a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a) unless \u201cadverse information is received suggesting such a recommendation to be unwarranted.\u201d At sentencing, the government presented no evidence of \u201cadverse information\u201d received after the plea agreement was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">Rather, the government argued, essentially, that Copeland was not eligible for a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction because he failed to provide substantial assistance to the government such as to qualify for a downward departure motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Yet nothing in the plea agreement conditioned the recommendation for a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction on Copeland\u2019s substantial assistance to the government (as defined in \u00a7 5K1.1), and nothing in \u00a7 3E1.1 itself requires a defendant to provide substantial assistance to be eligible for a reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>government breached the plea agreement when it failed to recommend a two-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a) and affirmatively recommended denying such a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The government, however, did not breach the plea agreement by failing to file a motion for an extra one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b). The plea agreement expressly stated that the determination as to whether Copeland qualified for this additional one-level reduction \u201crests solely with the [government], and the defendant agrees that the defendant cannot and will not challenge that determination, whether by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise.\u201d Thus, Copeland cannot now challenge the government\u2019s discretionary determination about this extra one-level \u00a7 3El.l(b) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In addition, it does not matter to the breach analysis whether the district court would have actually followed the government\u2019s recommendation and granted a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971) (remanding the case due to the prosecution\u2019s breach of a plea agreement, even though the sentencing judge stated that the breach did not influence the sentence and there was no reason to doubt the judge\u2019s statement); <em>Johnson, </em>132 F.3d at 630 (stating that \u201cthe sentencing judge\u2019s acts are not important\u201d to the issue of breach because the government, <em>\u201cnot the court,\u201d </em>violated the plea agreement).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">C. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Copeland contends that the government also breached the plea agreement by advocating for an obstruction-of-justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1. We disagree. The plea agreement contained no provision prohibiting the government from recommending an enhancement for obstruction of justice. Indeed, the agreement expressly reserved the government\u2019s right \u201cto make any recommendations it deems appropriate regarding the disposition of this case, subject to any limitations set forth herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">We recognize that, according to the \u00a7 3E1.1 commentary, an obstruction-of-justice enhancement \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 4). The same commentary also provides, however, that there may be \u201cextraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 [obstruction enhancement] and 3E1.1 [acceptance reduction] may apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the fact that Copeland received an obstruction-of-justice enhancement does not automatically or necessarily prohibit him from receiving an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Moreover, the government entered the plea agreement with full knowledge of Copeland\u2019s pre-indictment conduct that was later used for the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, and cannot now be excused from fully performing its promises as to acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cIt is not the court\u2019s role to determine if the government made a wise choice in entering into the plea agreement. Instead, the court is only responsible for ensuring the terms of a plea agreement are followed.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">D. Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Given the government\u2019s breach of the plea agreement in failing to recommend a two-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a), two remedies are available for Copeland: (1) \u201cspecific performance\u201d of the agreement before a different sentencing judge, or (2) withdrawal of the guilty plea. <em>Johnson, </em>132 F.3d at 631; <em>United States v. Foster, </em>889 F.2d 1049, 1056 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201c[W]hen the government breaches an agreement, the defendant must either be resentenced by a new judge or allowed to withdraw his plea, regardless of whether the judge was influenced [by the government\u2019s breach].\u201d). Specific performance is appropriate here because \u201cno question exists that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered,\u201d and Copeland does not seek to withdraw his plea. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Accordingly, we vacate Copeland\u2019s sentence and remand for i'esentencing before a different judge, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. In calculating Copeland\u2019s guideline range, the PSI grouped together Count 27 (wire-fraud) and Count 37 (making false claims), pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.2(d). Copeland\u2019s conviction on Count 36 (aggravated identity theft) mandated a consecutive minimum sentence of two years, or 24 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). The guideline sentence for that offense was 24 months, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6, and was calculated separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b850-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government has breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b850-11\">. On appeal, the government argues that Copeland\u2019s lack of cooperation constituted the \"adverse information\" that prevented him from qualifying for the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. We reject this argument. The plea agreement dealt with cooperation in separate provisions, and nothing in the agreement conditioned the acceptance-of-responsibility recommendation on such cooperation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\">. The government argues that any breach of the plea agreement was harmless error because, even with the two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Copeland\u2019s guideline range would have been 292 to 300 months, only 8 months less than the original 300-month range for Counts 27 and 37. This argument fails. Assuming, without deciding, that a breach of the plea agreement is subject to such harmless error analysis, the error here was not harmless. As the government acknowledges, the two-level reduction under \u00a7 3El. 1(a) would have reduced Copeland\u2019s guideline range, albeit by a relatively small amount, and the district court did not say that it would have imposed the same sentence with or without the reduction. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>627 F.3d 839, 845 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that a sentencing error was not harmless because the district court \"did not state that it would impose the same sentence even if it erred in calculating the applicable advisory guideline range\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
