In an action against the owner of an automobile to recover for personal injuries the question of defendant\u2019s negligence and the contributory negligence of the plaintiff were for the jury and a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff will he sustained, where it appeared that plaintiff, after alighting from the front of a street car, which had stopped at a crossing, passed around in front of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>car and had taken about two steps beyond it when he was struck in the space between the east and west bound tracks by defendant\u2019s automobile heading in the same direction as the car; that the automobile approached at a greater than usual rate of speed at that place without sounding its horn and just before striking plaintiff changed its course, running in close to the front end of the car in an effort to pass in front of it.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b444-3\">Argued Oct. 12, 1917.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQRL\">Appeal, No. 124, Oct. T., 1917, by defendant, from judgment of O. P. Allegheny County, July T., 1916, No. 2029, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Carl Oelrich v. Edward J. Kent.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Adt\">Before Mestrezat, Potter, Stewart, Moschzisicer and Walling, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AbdE\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-4\">Trespass for personal injuries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">On the trial three witnesses testified that just before striking the plaintiff, defendant\u2019s automobile changed its course, and swerved in toward the front of the standing car in an effort to pass in front of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">Further facts appear in the following opinion by Macearlane, J., sur defendant\u2019s motion for judgment non obstante veredicto:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">Upon the motion for judgment n. o. v. the only question is the contributory negligence of the plaintiff. It is true defendant testified that his automobile did not run at a rate of more than ten miles an hour and that it stopped in five feet, and there was no opposing testimony fixing the higher rate, but there was testimony that the automobile ran twenty-five feet after it struck the plaintiff and that the speed was greater than the usual rate of \u00e1utomobiles at that place. The defendant\u2019s testimony is not conclusive for the additional reason that he is an interested Avitness and his son and another man who were said to have been in the automobile were not called. It further appeared without contradiction that a horn was not blown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-8\">The plaintiff walked across the street in front of the standing street car from which he had alighted and, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>cording to the testimony of Mrs. Bernhardy, was struck on the space between the two tracks. She said he had passed the street car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">Q. About how far did he pass it?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">A. Well, he had just started across the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">Q. Where was he in respect to the front end of the street car?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\">A. He was in the front end. That is the way he got off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-9\">Q. How many feet away from the front end was he?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-10\">A. I guess about two or three feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-11\">Q. How would you fix the point in relation to the other track, the westbound track?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-12\">A. Well, I guess he was about between the middle, you know that middle part between the two tracks. He was about there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-13\">The plaintiff testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-14\">Q. How far had you proceeded past the front of the street car when you first saw the automobile?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-15\">A. Maybe one or two steps. I can\u2019t just exactly tell, it happened so quick......</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-16\">Q. After you had passed the front end of the car and taken a step or two as you said, Avere you or were you not looking in any particular direction?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-17\">A. Why, I looked up first and when I looked down I was so close to the automobile there was no way getting out of the way at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-18\">In another place he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-19\">Then after I passed the street car, maybe a couple of steps, I observed the car coming and I couldn\u2019t get out of the way and I got struck.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-20\">The space betAveen the two tracks, called the \u201cdummy,\u201d fixes the limit of the distance to which the plaintiff had advanced. The width of this space was not given, but it was well known to the jury. Fifth avenue runs by the court house where the trial was being held and is the most prominent street in this city. The overhang of a street car occupied a portion, and two ordinary steps would carry a man over the entire space. The only wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>nesses who located the automobile with reference to the side of the street car were Miss Meyers and Mr. Kent, who both said that it ran on the street car track. Had it proceeded without deviation, it would be plain that the plaintiff had stepped past the dummy onto the westbound track. The testimony that the automobile turned to the right, towards the right-hand of the street so close that the witnesses thought it would hit the fender, with Mrs. Bernhardy\u2019s testimony, was sufficient to support the finding of the jury that the plaintiff was struck on the space between the two tracks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-4\">He was not bound to guard against the negligence of the defendant. He had a right to presume that ordinary care would be used to protect him from injury. \u201cNo one can complain of want of care in another where care is only rendered necessary by his own wrongful act\u201d: Wagner v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., <em>252 </em>Pa. 354. The plaintiff\u2019s negligence was not a clear and unavoidable inference from the undisputed facts. In Kurtz v. Tourison, 241 Pa. 425, the plaintiff was struck by an automobile as she stepped from in front of a pair of standing horses, and the case was for the jury. In Miller v. Tiedemann, 249 Pa. 234, an automobile passed a wagon proceeding in front of it and, after clearing it, swung to regain the track, running\u2019 20 to 25 miles an hour, and no warning was given and after striking the man ran about 20 feet. It was argued that he was guilty of contributory negligence in stepping in front of a moving automobile, but the testimony that the driver could not see the man he struck until he was actually upon him and the latter could not see the driver until approximately the same time carried the case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">The oral argument and the briefs were confined to the motion for judgment, but we have considered the reasons assigned upon the motion for a new trial and find them without merit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">Verdict for plaintiff for $8,500 and judgment thereon.

Union Traction Co., 192 Pa. 344.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">Where it is not clearly and plainly evidenced that plaintiff could have seen the danger, the question of his contributory negligence is for the jury: Miller v.
