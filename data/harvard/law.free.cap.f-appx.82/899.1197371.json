By moving for IFP, Norman is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Norman contends that he is entitled to proceed IFP on appeal because he is a pauper. Norman fails to challenge the reasons given for the district court\u2019s dismissal, and he does not refer to any of the claims raised in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Norman has thus abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Consequently, the appeal is wholly without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see also Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. The IFP motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">Both the district court\u2019s dismissal of Norman\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Norman is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates a third strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED; IFP MOTION DENIED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b942-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
