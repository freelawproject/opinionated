Garcia claims the district court clearly erred in refusing to grant his request for a two level reduction for being a minor participant pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Garcia contends that he \"is eligible for a minor participant reduction because he was merely a one-time drug courier even though he was the only defendant indicted in this case and was the only person involved in the transportation of this cocaine. A district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its findings of fact, for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Claiborne, </em>132 F.3d 253, 254 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1144, 118 S.Ct. 1855, 140 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-22\">Although a drug courier is not precluded from qualifying as a minor participant, <em>see United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996), a defendant \u201cmay be a courier without being substantially less culpable that the average participant\u201d. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995). The large quantity of cocaine being transported by Garcia supports the district court\u2019s determination that Garcia was not a minor participant. <em>See United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1409-10 (5th Cir.1989). And, obviously, the district court was not required to accept Garcia\u2019s account of his role in the drug trafficking scheme. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>nied, </em>495 U.S. 923, 110 S.Ct. 1957, 109 L.Ed.2d 319 (1990). Accordingly, the ruling was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">For the first time on appeal, Garcia contends that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and (b) are facially unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Garcia concedes, his contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1045, 121 S.Ct. 2015, 149 L.Ed.2d 1015 (2001). He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
