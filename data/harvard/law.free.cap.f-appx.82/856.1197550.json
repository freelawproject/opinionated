Pressley seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and to the extent that Pressley\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report were sufficient to preserve appellate review, there was no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Pressley v. Doe, </em>No. CA-02-4020 (D.S.C. July 16, 2003); <em>see also Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>687 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir.1982). Because, however, Pressley\u2019s action was dismissed upon a grant of summary judgment to the Defendants, we vacate the district court\u2019s order to the extent it assessed a strike pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
