However, the court vacated Cole\u2019s sentence on the conspiracy count and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing to a term of not more than twenty years for that offense. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Cole now appeals from the 240-month sentence the district court imposed on remand. Cole\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asserting that the district court erred in denying Cole\u2019s motion for a downward departure due to an \u201cextraordinary physical impairment.\u201d <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5H1.4 (2002). Cole was informed of his right to file a pro se brief, but has not done so. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">Prior to resentencing, Cole moved for a downward departure based on his cancer diagnosis. The district court considered the medical evidence and declined to depart. Where the sentencing court was aware of its authority to depart and simply declined to do so, we lack authority to review its decision. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990). Here, the district court was aware of its authority to depart, but concluded that a departure was not warranted in this case. We lack authority to review this decision and therefore dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Cole\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
