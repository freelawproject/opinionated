Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Davis primarily alleged that he was denied due process in a disciplinary hearing wherein he was found guilty of assault and that he was subjected to assaults by other inmates, toxic gas, and overcrowding. The district court dismissed the suit without prejudice because of Davis\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Davis argues that he did exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the assault adjudication. The district court held, and the record shows, that Davis exhausted his administrative remedies after filing the instant law suit. We conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing this claim. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Davis makes no argument that he exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his claims concerning other assaults, toxic gas, and overcrowding. Those claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, the record does not show that Davis exhausted these claims through the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 administrative process. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.10, 542.14, 542.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b970-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
