At his sentencing on June 21, 2002, the district court declined to grant Rizzuto a downward departure for bringing about a \u201cglobal disposition\u201d of the case and conserving judicial resources. Rizzuto appeals this aspect of his sentence on the ground that it was inconsistent with the sentencing of co-defendants who did receive a downward departure based on \u201cglobal disposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines is discretionary, <em>United States v. Paulino, </em>873 F.2d 23, 25 (2d Cir.1989) (per curiam), and we will disturb a decision not to depart downwardly only in the narrowest of circumstances, <em>United States v. Duverge Perez, </em>295 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Desena, </em>260 F.3d 150, 159 (2d Cir.2001). After reviewing the record and considering Rizzuto\u2019s arguments, we conclude that the inconsistency asserted by Rizzuto does not warrant such a reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
