The petition challenged his October 1988 conviction in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County, on two counts of second-degree murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court dismissed four of Fernandez\u2019s five claims on the ground that he had failed to exhaust them. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). The remaining claim\u2014 that Fernandez\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment were violated by the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings \u2014 was considered and rejected by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-18\">On appeal, Fernandez challenges three specific evidentiary rulings. The first challenge concerns his counsel\u2019s attempt to ask Miguel Tejada, one of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, whether he had ever fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>gunshots at either Fernandez or Fernandez\u2019s friend. Upon being informed that Tejada intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the trial court ruled that the defense could not inquire into this area. The second challenge concerns defense counsel\u2019s attempt to question Tejada on whether he had murdered an individual named Sting. The trial court found that defense counsel failed to articulate a good faith basis for his belief that Tejada had killed Sting, and it prohibited the inquiry. The third challenge concerns the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit defense counsel to elicit testimony suggesting that the charges against Jorge Gonzales \u2014 with whom Fernandez was originally indicted \u2014 were dismissed by the prosecution. Fernandez also takes issue with the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that they were not to speculate as to why no charges were pending against Gonzales.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">We recognize that \u201c[t]he right of cross-examination, though not absolute, is one of the most firmly established principles under Supreme Court law.\u201d <em>Cotto v. Herbert, </em>331 F.3d 217, 248 (2d Cir.2003). The Confrontation Clause is violated when a defendant is \u201cprohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed ... to expose to the jury the facts from which the jurors ... could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 680, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). In some instances, an adverse witness\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege may violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Bagby v. Kuhlman, </em>932 F.2d 131, 135 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Although we review a district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo, see Cotto, </em>331 F.3d at 229, the ability of federal courts to grant habeas relief is limited by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 <em>(codified principally at </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Under AEDPA, habeas relief on any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings may not be granted unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was either \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We cannot find that the adjudication of Fernandez\u2019s claim in New York state court proceedings offended this deferential standard. Here, the trial court appropriately limited Fernandez\u2019s cross-examination of Tejada to avoid infringing on Tejada\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination and to eliminate questions lacking a good faith basis, and also properly restricted Fernandez from asking questions of Gonzales which would have called for speculative responses. Because the adjudication of Fernandez\u2019s claim in New York state courts resulted in a decision that was neither contrary to clearly established federal law nor reflective of an unreasonable application of such law, the petition was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-11\">. The Appellate Division, First Department, affirmed Fernandez's conviction after finding that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's determination and that Fernandez's \"other claims of error [were] without merit.\u201d <em>People v. Fernandez, </em>186 A.D.2d 409, 588 N.Y.S.2d 1014 (1st Dep't 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
