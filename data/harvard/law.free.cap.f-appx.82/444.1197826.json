Brice appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He argues that he should be permitted to challenge his conviction under \u00a7 2241 despite having been denied relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Brice maintains that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d because he claims that he is actually innocent. Because we conclude that Brice failed to demonstrate his actual innocence, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">In 1993 a federal jury in South Carolina convicted Brice of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and of using or carrying a firearm in connection with a drug-trafficking offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The Fourth Circuit affirmed both convictions. In 1995 Brice unsuccessfully attacked those convictions in a motion filed in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">Later, he applied for leave to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion which the Fourth Circuit denied. That denial barred Brice from proceeding further under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-19\">Then, from his Kentucky prison, Brice filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, challenging his \u00a7 924(c) conviction. The district court dismissed the petition. Now he appeals that dismissal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-20\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b487-21\">In habeas cases, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>factual findings for clear error. <em>Clemmons v. Sowders, </em>34 F.3d 352, 354 (6th Cir.1994). Here we consider de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that Brice\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Absent extraordinary circumstances, the \u00a7 2241 petition is reserved for challenges to the execution of sentence, <em>not </em>conviction itself. <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1008, 122 S.Ct. 493, 151 L.Ed.2d 404 (2001). Though \u00a7 2255 is normally the exclusive way for federal prisoners to collaterally attack their convictions, the section includes a \u201csavings clause\u201d that permits a prisoner to petition for a \u00a7 2241 writ of habeas corpus upon a showing that relief under \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Bannerman v. Snyder, </em>325 F.3d 722, 723 (6th Cir.2003). And to show \u00a7 2255 relief \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a prisoner must demonstrate actual innocence. <em>Bannerman, </em>325 F.3d at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Brice attempts to show his actual innocence by arguing that an incorrect jury instruction permitted the jury to convict him of noncriminal conduct. Section 924(c) criminalized \u201cusing or carrying\u201d a firearm in connection with a drug-trafficking offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The trial judge instructed Brice\u2019s jury that if they found that he <em>possessed </em>the firearm- \u2014 either actually or constructively \u2014 then they could properly convict Brice under \u00a7 924(c) for \u201cusing\u201d a firearm. But after his conviction, the Supreme Court decided <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>a case that clarified the meaning of \u201cuses,\u201d holding that \u201cuses\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 924(c) means something more than mere possession. 516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). In view of that holding, the jury instruction at Brice\u2019s trial allowed the jury to convict him using an overbroad definition of \u201cuses.\u201d Brice contends that this overbroad definition in his jury instruction leads directly to the conclusion that he is actually innocent of violating \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Brice bears the burden of showing his actual innocence. <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). The <em>Bousley </em>court held that actual innocence \u201cmeans factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency\u201d and set forth the standard that: \u201cTo establish actual innocence, petitioner must demonstrate that, \u2018in light of the evidence,\u2019 \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Brice cannot meet this standard because even if, as he argues, he did not \u201cuse\u201d a firearm within the meaning of \u00a7 924(c) as later interpreted by <em>Bailey, </em>he fails to show that he is actually innocent of the alternate \u00a7 924(c) violation \u2014 \u201ccarrying.\u201d He does not contest the court\u2019s instruction to the jury on \u201ccarrying,\u201d and at trial, several witnesses testified to facts that would support his conviction for \u201ccarrying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">For example, Earl Browning testified that during the drug conspiracy, Brice and his coconspirators carried their guns concealed \u201cin [the] front of [their] britches.\u201d J.A. at 44. This testimony is particularly damning in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Bailey </em>(albeit in dicta), that \u201ca firearm can be carried without being used, e.g., when an offender keeps a gun hidden in his clothing throughout a drug transaction.\u201d 516 U.S. at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Brice fails to meet his burden of showing that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>based on evidence of his carrying a firearm in connection with a drug-trafficking offense in violation of \u00a7 924(c). <em>Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 623. Regardless of Brice\u2019s guilt of \u201cusing\u201d a firearm, he has not shown that he is actually innocent of \u201ccarrying\u201d in violation of \u00a7 924(c). <em>See Moore v. United States, </em>156 F.3d 1231 (6th Cir.l998)(unpublished)(using the same reasoning).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Nevertheless, Brice insists that his \u00a7 2241 petition merits relief on the actual innocence standard because he claims the indictment only charged possession, not carrying. The indictment read that Brice, with his co-conspirators, \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d a handgun \u201cduring and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,\u201d all in violation of \u00a7 924(c). J.A. at 50. Brice characterizes the indictment\u2019s charge of \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d \u2014 language not found in \u00a7 924(c) \u2014 as constitutionally insufficient to support a conviction for \u201ccarrying.\u201d Though the indictment did not explicitly charge Brice with \u201ccarrying,\u201d we nonetheless find it constitutionally sufficient by its reference to the Code section.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">An indictment is constitutionally sufficient if it satisfies a two-part test: first, it must set out all elements of the charged offense and give notice to the defendant of the charge faced; and second, the indictment must be \u201csufficiently specific to enable the defendant to plead double jeopardy in a subsequent proceeding, if charged with the same crime based on the same facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>981 F.2d 867, 872 (6th Cir.1992)(citing <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 763-64, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Measured against that standard, Brice\u2019s indictment passes constitutional scrutiny. In <em>Martinez, </em>we upheld as sufficient an indictment that omitted the crime\u2019s <em>mens rea </em>element but did reference the appropriate United States Code section. <em>Id. </em>We observed that the \u201ccitation to the statutes informed [the defendant] of the elements of the charged offenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Here, like in <em>Martinez, </em>the indictment\u2019s reference to the appropriate Code section cured any confusion caused by the indictment\u2019s \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d language. The indictment charged and properly notified Brice that he could be convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c) by either using or carrying the firearm in connection with a drug-trafficking offense. And by charging that Brice possessed the firearm on a specific date, and that he did so in connection with a specific drug conspiracy, the indictment specified sufficient facts to enable Brice to bring any future double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brice\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
