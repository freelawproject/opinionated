It is</p>\n<p id=\"b741-35\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed May 21, 2003, denying appellant\u2019s second motion for reconsideration, be affirmed. The district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s complaint because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>complaint did not state a claim based on federal law nor was there diversity of citizenship (because all parties were alleged to reside in the District of Columbia). The district court therefore properly denied reconsideration of the February 20, 2003 order dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
