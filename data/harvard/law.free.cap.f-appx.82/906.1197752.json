Johnson, who was formerly a Louisiana prisoner, alleged that after a release date of April 28, 2003, had been established, he was charged with a disciplinary violation and was imprisoned for 45 days beyond such date due to the forfeiture of good-time credits resulting from the disciplinary conviction. Our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action may not recover damages for \u201callegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,\u201d unless he \u201cprove[s] that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determinations, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The Supreme Court has extended <em>Heck </em>to prison disciplinary proceedings, concluding that claims for damages and declaratory relief that necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed in a disciplinary conviction are not cognizable in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 proceeding. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">Johnson\u2019s assertion that he was falsely imprisoned as a result of the prison disciplinary charge and the loss of good-time credits imposed following his disciplinary conviction, if credited, would necessarily imply that his conviction and sentence for the disciplinary case was invalid, thus affecting the duration of his confinement. Because Johnson has not shown that the disciplinary case has been overturned, he cannot maintain a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against the defendants for damages. <em>See Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 648; <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Johnson has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his action under <em>Heck. </em>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
