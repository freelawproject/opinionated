GARZA, Circuit Judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">In this appeal we review the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant \u2014 Appellant, Luis Aldo Meza\u2019s (hereinafter, \u201cMeza\u201d), motion to suppress evidence of concealed people discovered in his vehicle by United States Border Patrol agents at an immigration checkpoint. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b165-20\">Meza was indicted pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 for two counts of transporting an alien. Prior to entering his plea, Meza filed a motion to suppress evidence. Meza\u2019s motion to suppress concerned evidence obtained when a trained canine alerted Border Patrol agents of the presence of aliens concealed in Meza\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-21\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the canine\u2019s certified handler testified as to the amount and type of training the canine received. The handler testified regarding the canine\u2019s ability to detect concealed persons, which it is able to do because the canine is trained to ignore the scent of people who are visible. In addition, the handler testified that the canine had never alerted to visible people. In contradiction to this testimony, Meza\u2019s expert testified that the Border Patrol\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>standards for training and certifying canines are inadequate. He also questioned the canine\u2019s ability to alert its handler to the presence of concealed persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">After considering the witnesses\u2019 testimony, the district court denied Meza\u2019s motion to suppress. Meza then entered a guilty plea to one count of the indictment and reserved his right to challenge the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress. The second count of the indictment was dismissed upon the Government\u2019s motion. The district court sentenced Meza to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Meza filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of Meza\u2019s motion to suppress, we review questions of law de novo, and we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>302 F.3d 291, 293 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1094, 123 S.Ct. 707, 154 L.Ed.2d 643 (2002). As the district court did not enter findings of fact in denying the motion, we must review the record to determine whether any reasonable view of the evidence supports admissibility. <em>United States v. Michelletti, </em>13 F.3d 838, 841 (5th Cir.1994). We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, as the party who prevailed at the district court. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>234 F.3d 234, 239 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">At an immigration checkpoint, any vehicle may be stopped so that Border Patrol agents may determine the citizenship status of the people passing through the checkpoint. <em>United States v. Garcia-Garcia, </em>319 F.3d 726, 729 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 2264, 156 L.Ed.2d 124 (2003). However, any detention beyond the time it takes to determine citizenship, and any subsequent search of a vehicle, must be based on probable cause. <em>United States v. Portillo-Aguirre, </em>311 F.3d 647, 652 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">Meza challenges the adequacy of the canine training and certification procedures used by the Border Patrol. He asserts that no dog can reliably distinguish between the odor of hidden people and the odor of visible people. However, this court has consistently ruled that a showing of a canine\u2019s training and reliability is not required if probable cause is developed at the site of a Border Patrol stop as a result of a canine sniff of the vehicle. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>69 F.3d 27, 28 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Pena, </em>336 F.3d 431, 444 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the canine\u2019s handler testified that upon sniffing Meza\u2019s vehicle, the canine indicated that he detected the odor of concealed individuals. Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that the canine\u2019s alert was reliable as probable cause to search Meza\u2019s vehicle was reasonable. <em>United States v. Yeagin, </em>927 F.2d 798, 800 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Sanchez-Pena, </em>336 F.3d at 444, <em>Portillo-Aguirre, </em>311 F.3d at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-16\">Meza\u2019s second argument is that the indiscriminate stops of vehicles at immigration checkpoints, absent any suspicion of wrongdoing, violate the Fourth Amendment. It is, however, settled that such stops are constitutional so long as their duration does not extend beyond the time necessary to determine the citizenship status of the vehicle\u2019s occupants. <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 557-58, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>(1976); <em>Garcia-Garcia, </em>319 F.3d at 729; <em>Portillo-Aguirre, </em>311 F.3d at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-13\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
