Wynn\u2019s motion sought to reopen the judgment dismissing his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition as untimely filed. As the district court correctly determined, Wynn\u2019s self-styled Motion un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>der Rule 60(b) is, in substance, a second habeas corpus petition attacking his conviction and sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 206 (4th Cir.2003). In the absence of pre-filing authorization, the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain the petition. <em>Evans v. Smith, </em>220 F.3d 306, 325 (4th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">In accordance with <em>Winestock, </em>we also treat Wynn\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief as a request for authorization from this court to file a second habeas corpus petition. <em>See id. </em>at 208. This court may authorize a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition only if the applicant can show that his claims are based on (1) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or (2) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable fact finder would have found him guilty of the offense. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2), 2255. The applicant bears the burden of making a prima facie showing of these requirements in his application. <em>See In re Fowlkes, </em>326 F.3d 542, 543 (4th Cir.2003). Wynn failed to make the requisite showing. Thus, we deny authorization under \u00a7 2244.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">We deny Wynn\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
