Browning filed a complaint alleging excessive force by two law enforcement officials during an arrest. After a bench trial, the district court dismissed one defendant as a matter of law and the other defendant on the facts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-21\">We find the district court did not abuse its discretion denying the motion for production of transcripts at government expense. Insofar as Browning claims his counsel was ineffective, the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel does not apply in civil cases. <em>Sanchez v. United States Postal Service, </em>785 F.2d 1236, 1237 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
