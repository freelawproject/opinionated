Cox-Cruz argues that the district court committed error when it sentenced him to 120-months\u2019 imprisonment after denying his motion for a downward departure based on the low purity level of the heroin involved in his case and his offense role.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">The district court\u2019s denial of Cox-Cruz\u2019s motion was not based on the merits of his arguments regarding the downward departure, but rather on the district court\u2019s lack of authority to sentence Cox-Cruz below the 120-month minimum sentence set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). In Cox-Cruz\u2019s case, the government did not file a motion for downward departure indicating that Cox-Cruz had provided substantial assistance. The district court therefore had no authority to grant a downward departure below the statutory minimum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e); <em>see also United States v. Alvarez, </em>51 F.3d 36, 39 (5th Cir. 1995). Additionally, because Cox-Cruz had more than one criminal history point, he was ineligible for relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1), set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(1), which provides for a limitation on applicability of the statutory minimum in specified situations. The district court therefore did not commit error when it determined that it lacked authority to sentence Cox-Cruz below the statutory minimum sentence set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1019-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
