Smith, Louisiana prisoner # 1077412, has moved in this court for <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) status on appeal, thereby challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Smith\u2019s challenge to the allegedly unconstitutional revocation of his parole is not cognizable in the instant 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action because he has not demonstrated or alleged \u201cthat his conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Cronn v. Buffington, </em>150 F.3d 538, 541 (5th Cir.1998). Smith\u2019s assertion, raised for the first time on appeal, that the district court judge should have been recused due to his participation in Smith\u2019s prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 proceeding is equally frivolous. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24 (citing 5th Cm. R. 42.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of this lawsuit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) each count as a strike for purposes of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) bar. <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). We caution Smith that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
