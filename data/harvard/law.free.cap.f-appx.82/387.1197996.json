Pineda argues that a driving-while-intoxicated (DWI) sentence should not have been assigned two criminal-history points because the sentence was imposed more than 10 years prior to the commencement of the instant offense. He also argues that an evading-arrest sentence should not have been assigned any criminal-history points because evading arrest is similar to the offense of resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-23\">Pineda\u2019s DWI sentence should not have been considered in calculating his criminal-history score because it occurred more than 10 years before the instant offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) and (3). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c) and <em>United States v. Moore, </em>997 F.2d 30, 33 (5th Cir.1993), Pineda\u2019s evading-arrest sentence arguably also should not have been counted for purposes of his criminal-history score. However, because the district court could, <em>on </em>remand, impose the same 21-month sentence, Pineda fails to demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s error in calculating his criminal-history category. <em>See United States v. Leonard, </em>157 F.3d 343, 346 (5th Cir.1998). Consequently, despite Pineda\u2019s argument to the contrary, he fails to satisfy the plain-error standard of review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-24\">Pineda contends that the sentence-enhancing provisions contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Pineda concedes that his challenge to the constitutionality of <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>rule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
