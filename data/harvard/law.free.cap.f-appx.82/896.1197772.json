She contends that the district court erred by not adjusting her offense level for her minor role in the offense and, for the first time on appeal, that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Cruz concedes that her <em>Apprendi </em>contention is foreclosed by the caselaw of this court, but she seeks to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-20\">First, Cruz\u2019s sentence was based on her own activity in the offense, and the district court did not err by finding that Cruz was a critical link in the transportation of heroin into the United States. <em>See United States v. Zuniga, </em>18 F.3d 1254, 1261 (5th Cir.1994); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). Second, <em>Apprendi </em>did not render 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 facially unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 583 (5th Cir.2000). Cruz has failed to demonstrate error, plain or otherwise, regarding <em>Apprendi. See </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
