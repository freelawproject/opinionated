We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in upholding the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Mancho\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See In re: Mancho, </em>No. A72725-653 (B.I.A. Jan. 22, 2003). We note that the Attorney General has filed a motion for summary affirmance in this case. Because we find that this is not an \u201cextraordinary case\u201d warranting summary disposition, we deny the motion. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 37(f). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
