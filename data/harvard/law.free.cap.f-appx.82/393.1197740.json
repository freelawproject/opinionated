These two statutes are generally parallel in this context. <em>See Siler-Khodr v. University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, </em>261 F.3d 542, 546 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1087, 123 S.Ct. 694, 154 L.Ed.2d 631 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-24\">The district court found that Daigre, a black female, made a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing there was a similarly situated white male employee who was more highly compensated. Velocity Express then offered evidence that the white male was employed in a more highly compensated job, but was performing the same tasks as Daigre as a favor to the company. This nondiscriminatory explanation was sufficient to shift the burden back to Daigre.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-25\">Daigre could overcome the explanation by showing that it was a pretext for discrimination by presenting evidence \u201cthat permits the jury to believe that the reason was false <em>and </em>that illegal discrimination was the actual reason\u201d. <em>Nichols v. Lewis Grocer, </em>138 F.3d 563, 566 (5th Cir.1998). Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, Daigre\u2019s flat denial of the explanation offered by Velocity Express is insufficient, as a matter of law, to carry her burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should <em>not </em>be published and is <em>not </em>precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
