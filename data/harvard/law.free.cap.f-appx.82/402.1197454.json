He contends that a Texas aggravated-assault conviction used to establish his career-offender status was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d due to the facts that he was only 17 at the time of the prior felony, the crime involved only a BB gun, no one was harmed, and he received only probation. The underlying facts need not be considered because the guidelines define \u201ccrime of violence\u201d specifically to include \u201caggravated assault.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l); <em>United States v. Guerra, </em>962 F.2d 484, 485-86 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.1992) (relying on application note defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Santillana expressly declares that he is not appealing the district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward from career-offender status \u2022 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. His remaining argument on appeal is thus reduced to a meritless recharacterization of his unsuccessful first argument. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
