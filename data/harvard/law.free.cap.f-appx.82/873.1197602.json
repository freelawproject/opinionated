SMITH, Circuit Judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b916-20\">Peter Vitale sued Georgia Gulf Corporation (\u201cGeorgia Gulf\u2019) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>He appeals a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 judgment as a matter of law (\u201cj.m.1.\u201d). Georgia Gulf appeals the denial of attorney\u2019s fees. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">Georgia Gulf employed Vitale in a variety of capacities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While working as a pipefitter\u2019s helper, Vitale injured his back. Because a neurosurgeon then limited the kind of work Vitale could perform,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Vitale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>could not return to his original position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After leaving Georgia Gulf, he sued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the jury trial, Georgia Gulf successfully moved for j.m.l., then unsuccessfully sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We review a j.m.l. <em>de novo. Delano-Pyle v. Victoria County, </em>302 F.3d 567, 572 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 47, 157 L.Ed.2d 22, (2003). We review all the evidence and \u201cmust draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 149, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). \u201c[A] court may not render |j.m.l.] unless a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Weasler Eng'g, Inc., </em>258 F.3d 326, 337 (5th Cir.), <em>amended, </em>274 F.3d 881 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), forbids covered employers from discriminating \u201cagainst a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual,\u201d with regard to, among other things, \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d As one of the \u201cessential elements\u201d of his claim, Vitale must prove that he \u201cwas a qualified person with a disability at the time of the alleged discrimination, <em>Rizzo v. Children\u2019s World Learning Ctrs., Inc., </em>213 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which means a person who \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). A \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d includes \u201cjob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position,\u201d and general concessions involving training and facilities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">Vitale failed to produce evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that he was a qualified individual with a disability. Based on the testimony of his doctor and as admitted in Vitale\u2019s own brief, he could not continue, with his limitations on lifting and movement, working in his prior position. Thus, to satisfy the \u201cqualified individual\u201d requirement, Vitale needed to produce evidence of a reasonable accommodation, as defined in \u00a7 12111(9), that Georgia Gulf could have provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\">Vitale largely points to Georgia Gulf employees who testified that he could have filled other, less-demanding posts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that Georgia Gulf had moved individuals with similar disabilities into such posts. Vitale, however, produced no evidence that Georgia Gulf needed to fill a vacant position that would have accommodated his restrictions. For the accommodation ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>to be reasonable, it is clear that a position must first exist and be vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Under the ADA, an employer is not required to give what it does not have. <em>Foreman v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, </em>117 F.3d 800, 810 (5th Cir.1997). Vitale does not contest the fact that Georgia Gulf did not need to fill a vacant light duty post. Again, he merely asserts that Georgia Gulfs assignments of injured individuals to temporary light duty positions indicates that he should receive a light duty assignment of indefinite duration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Without evidence to show that he either could have performed his previous job or could have filled a <em>vacant </em>opening, Vitale is not a qualified individual with a disability, so a reasonable jury could not conclude that Georgia Gulf discriminated in violation of the ADA. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting the rule 50 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Because it obtained a j.m.l., Georgia Gulf asserts it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We review a ruling on attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>No Barriers, Inc. v. Brinker Chili\u2019s Tex., Inc., </em>262 F.3d 496, 498 (5th Cir.2001). The ADA fee-shifting provision has language similar to that of title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Consequently, the doctrines from these two provisions apply to the case at hand. <em>No Barriers, </em>262 F.3d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Although Georgia Gulf effectively cites precedent regarding the circumstances in which a court may<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> award attorney\u2019s fees, it does not provide examples of when a court <em>must </em>award fees to prevailing defendants. In contrast to prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights actions, who \u201cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust,\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Bark Enters., Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968), prevailing defendants <em>may </em>receive fees under the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">Although Vitale did not succeed on his ADA claim, the district court did not abuse its \u201csound discretion\u201d in denying attorney\u2019s fees. <em>EEOC v. Tarrant Distribs., Inc., </em>750 F.2d 1249, 1250 (5th Cir.1984) (citing Christiansburg). Although Georgia Gulfs assignments of injured employees to light duty positions do not excuse Vitale from the ADA\u2019s requirements of a \u201cqualified individual with a disability,\u201d those assignments render this suit less frivolous or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>The district court properly granted j.m.l. and denied attorney\u2019s fees. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-13\">. Vitale worked as a maintenance technician, involving a number of duties, including fire-watching, hold-watching, and pipe-fitting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b916-23\">. The neurosurgeon stated Vitale cannot lift \u201cover 10 pounds frequently or 20 pounds occasionally. He may not sit or stand over one hour without breaks. He may not stoop, crawl, climb ladders, or perform overhead work[J All these restrictions are permanent ... because of the degenerative condition of his lumbar spine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b917-10\">. Georgia Gulf maintains that Vitale\u2019s doctors never released him to work for it. Vitale contends that he pursued \"light duty\u201d positions but was repeatedly told that none was available. Adopting either contention does not affect this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b917-11\">. Vitale also sued under the Louisiana equivalent of the ADA, La. R.S. 23:303. Neither party discusses the state claims to any significant extent, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b917-17\">. <em>See also Daugherty v. City of El Paso, </em>56 F.3d 695 (5th Cir. 1995) (The ADA \"prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities, no more and no less.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b917-18\">. Georgia Gulf's Human Resources Supervisor indicated that Vitale could have filled the fire watch position or positions involving the monitoring and checking for leaks in the pipes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">. Vitale\u2019s sole authority in support of his contention that \"the creation of such a position to accommodate similarly situated employees is proof that such a position did ... exist\u201d does not support his case at all. See <em>Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, </em>174 F.3d 615, 621 n. 11 (5th Cir.1999) (\"Had [plaintiff] shown that the City treated him differently from others similarly situated by not <em>reassigning </em>him under identical conditions, his position on appeal would have been much stronger\u201d (emphasis added)). Reassignment is not equivalent to creating a new position. One district court in this circuit has held that accommodations to some employees do not require similar accommodations to all similarly-situated employees. <em>Wilburn v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>2000 WL 1772670, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17520, at *14 (N.D.Tex.2000) (stating that \"creating a light-duty position ... is not a 'reasonable' [accommodation]\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b918-14\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 (\"In any action ... commenced pursuant to this chapter, the court[,] in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fee....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b918-15\">. A prevailing defendant may not receive fees unless the plaintiff's claim \"was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\" <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
