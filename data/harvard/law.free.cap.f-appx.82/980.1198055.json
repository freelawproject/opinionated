Singh argues that the BIA erred in determining that he had not established past persecution based on his religion and political opinions, a well founded fear of future persecution, or that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he were returned to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-22\">This court will uphold the factual findings that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir. 1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). The BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion as to either Singh\u2019s INA claims or his CAT claim. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Singh\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
