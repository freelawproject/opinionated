R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">Appellant Michael Wise, a military inmate appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. His petition alleged a prison Disciplinary and Adjustment Board deprived him of \u201cgood conduct time\u201d without due process of law, and insufficient evidence supported the Board\u2019s determination he committed disciplinary infractions. Because this proceeding arises under \u00a7 2241 and Mr. Wise is a federal prisoner, he does not need a certificate of appealability. <em>See McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 810 n. 1 (10th Cir.1997). We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">Mr. Wise is serving a ten-year sentence based on his conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Based on an \u201cincident with other inmates,\u201d a Disciplinary and Adjustment Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) charged Mr. Wise with three disciplinary infractions. The Board conducted a hearing on the matter and found Mr. Wise guilty of two of the charged infractions: \u201cConduct Which Threatens\u201d and \u201cOut of Place.\u201d Among other sanctions, the Board imposed a forfeiture of ninety days good conduct time credits, thirty days of which were suspended for 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">After an unsuccessful administrative appeal of the Board\u2019s decision, Mr. Wise sought habeas relief from the federal district court. He alleged several due process violations occurred in the course of the disciplinary proceedings. Mr. Wise also claimed the evidence before the Board did not support its determination against him. The district court denied relief and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Mr. Wise now appeals the district court\u2019s order. He argues: (1) the district court erroneously applied the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard in reviewing his due process claim; (2) the district court erred by not conducting an evidentiary hearing; (3) the district court erred by failing to rule on his petition in a timely manner; and (4) these errors cumulatively warrant reversal. We address each claim below.</p>\n<p id=\"AjL\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Mr. Wise argues the district court erroneously determined sufficient evidence supported the Board\u2019s determination as to the disciplinary charges. Specifically, he claims the court reviewed the Board\u2019s conclusion for \u201csome evidence,\u201d rather than for \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which he asserts an Army regulation requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\u201cIn reviewing a denial of a petition for habeas corpus, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and accept its findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Hickman v. Spears, </em>160 F.3d 1269, 1271 (10th Cir.1998); <em>see also Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126-27 (3d Cir.2002) (applying same standard of review to \u00a7 2241 petition involving good time credit issue). Contrary to Mr. Wise\u2019s contention, the burden of proof announced in an Army regulation does not impact habeas review based on an insufficient evidence claim. The appropriate inquiry is whether \u201cthere was sufficient evidence for any rational fact finder\u201d to find Mr. Wise committed the disciplinary infractions by a greater weight of the evidence. <em>Romano v. Gibson, </em>278 F.3d 1145, 1154 (10th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Here, the Board received evidence from three confidential sources who \u201cprovided independently verified reliable information in the past.\" At least one of the sources indicated he witnessed Mr. Wise\u2019s misconduct. Based on this evidence, a rational trier of fact could determine Mr. Wise committed the disciplinary infractions. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that sufficient evidence supported the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Mr. Wise also argues the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed facts pertaining to his habeas petition. We review a district court\u2019s decision not to conduct an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>60 F.3d 1479, 1483 (10th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1210, 116 S.Ct. 1829, 134 L.Ed.2d 933 (1996). After reviewing Mr. Wise\u2019s habeas petition, we conclude his allegations, if proved, would not warrant relief. <em>See Medina v. Barnes, </em>71 F.3d 363, 366 (10th Cir.1995) (\u201cTo be entitled to an evidentiary hearing in a federal habeas action, the petitioner must first make allegations which, if proved, would entitle him to relief.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Mr. Wise next claims the district court erred by delaying its disposition of his habeas petition until 761 days after he filed his traverse. Construing Mr. Wise\u2019s pro se appeal liberally, as we must, <em>see Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991), we interpret his argument as a due process claim. \u201c[T]he remedy for a due process violation caused by inordinate delay of a district court is not habeas relief, but a writ of mandamus directing the district court to act or rule on the pending matter.\u201d <em>United States v. Wiktor, </em>146 F.3d 815, 819 (10th Cir.1998); <em>see also Johnson v. Rogers, </em>917 F.2d 1283, 1284-85 (10th Cir.1990). In reviewing claims of judicial delay on matters eventually adjudicated by the district court, this court determines whether the district court\u2019s or the government\u2019s delay prejudiced the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>U.S. 514, 530, 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972) (holding habeas petitioner must show prejudice from Sixth Amendment speedy trial violation); <em>Wiktor, </em>146. F.3d at 819 (ruling \u201cunsuccessful direct appeal rebuts presumption of prejudice arising from [judicial] delay\u201d); <em>Harris v. Day, </em>649 F.2d 755, 761-62 (10th Cir. 1981) (explaining in a habeas proceeding, \u201c[t]his court has required a showing of prejudice where there has been a delay in holding a parolee\u2019s parole revocation hearing after execution of a parole warrant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Because the district court ruled on Mr. Wise\u2019s petition, no mandamus directing the district court to act was requested or required. Given the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Wise\u2019s petition and our affirmance thereof, he can show no prejudice resulted from judicial delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Finally, we reject Mr. Wise\u2019s argument the cumulative weight of the errors discussed above entitle him to relief. Consistent with our determination the alleged errors did not occur independently, we likewise hold such non-errors did not cumulatively warrant relief. <em>See Moore v. Reynolds, </em>153 F.3d 1086, 1113 (10th Cir. 1998) (\u201cCumulative error analysis applies where there are two or more actual errors; it does not apply to the cumulative effect of non-errors.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1025, 119 S.Ct. 1266, 143 L.Ed.2d 362 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Wise\u2019s petition for habeas corpus and DISMISS this appeal. We also deny Mr. Wise\u2019s motion to expedite this appeal as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
