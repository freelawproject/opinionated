R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-21\">Plaintiff Michael Anthony Whitesell, proceeding pro se, appeals from an order of the district court dismissing this action, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-22\">Mr. Whitesell commenced this action against Box Elder County, Utah, and the State of Utah, in which he alleged that the First Judicial District Court of Box Elder County had violated his constitutional rights to due process and to have appointed pro bono counsel. He also alleged that court had denied him his parental rights by denying him custody of his four minor children. Mr. Whitesell asked the federal district court to overturn the state court\u2019s protective orders and its order regarding custody and visitation. He sought damages and full custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-23\">The district court held that it had no subject matter jurisdiction over the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>because the State of Utah had not agreed to waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity in actions of this type and was not a person within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. The court also held that Mr. Whitesell\u2019s claims were barred by the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine because, other than the United States Supreme Court, federal courts do not have jurisdiction to act as appellate courts reviewing decisions of state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">On appeal, Mr. Whitesell does not address the federal court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over this action. Instead, he argues that the State of Utah violated his constitutional right to defend himself in the custody hearing and violated his due process rights by changing the hearing date to a time when he was in Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), and review findings of jurisdictional facts for clear error.\u201d <em>Stuart v. Colo. Interstate Gas Co., </em>271 F.3d 1221, 1225 (10th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record before us, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order for substantially the reasons stated in its March 24, 2003 order, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s February 14, 2003 report and recommendation. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b49-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-19\">. <em>Rooker v. Fid.
