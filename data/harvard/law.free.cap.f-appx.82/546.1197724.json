Cuevas appeals his conviction and sentence, challenging various rulings by the district court judge. We affirm on all issues. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>count them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">First, the district court appropriately limited the evidence pertaining to Miguel Farias\u2019 motive and means to retaliate against Cuevas. \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion whether evidence is relevant, ... and whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect....\u201d <em>United States v. Butts, </em>9 Fed.Appx. 612, 614 (9th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). \u201cThe Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986) (internal quotation and citation omitted). However, the exclusion of \u201cmarginally relevant\u201d and \u201chighly speculative\u201d evidence does not violate a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>United States v. Rubio-Topete, </em>999 F.2d 1334, 1339-40 (9th Cir.1993). Cuevas failed to tie his truck, the person who purportedly bought the truck in Cuevas\u2019 name in August 2001 and sold it to Cuevas in November 2001, or the cocaine found in the truck\u2019s compartment to Farias. Only speculation linked Farias, his organization, and their purported threats to the charged drug trafficking conduct. With no proffered evidence linking Farias to the instant crime, the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence regarding Farias\u2019 means and motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Cuevas also contends that the government exploited the district court\u2019s erroneous evidentiary ruling and thereby exacerbated the prejudice of the exclusion of evidence by presenting a closing argument contrary to the facts the court precluded Cuevas from introducing at trial. The government\u2019s references to the stale motive for retaliation \u2014 which it candidly concedes were improper \u2014 did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See United States v. Kojayan, </em>8 F.3d 1315 (9th Cir.1993). Moreover, this was not a close case, and several factors other than the stale motive cast serious doubt upon Cuevas\u2019 set up theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Second, Cuevas challenges the admission of his prior felony conviction. The court reviews the admission of a prior conviction under Federal Rule of Evidence 609 for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>214 F.3d 1095, 1097-98 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>848 F.2d 1464, 1473 (9th Cir.1988). The court \u201ccan affirm on any basis supported by the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>48 F.3d 1477, 1487 (9th Cir.1995). As Cuevas was convicted of the prior offense in 1996 \u2014 just <em>six </em>years before this trial\u2014 Rule 609(b) presented no bar to admission. Further, because the conviction bears on his propensity for truthfulness, the court properly admitted it under Rule 609(a)(2). The conviction was likewise admissible under Rule 609(a)(1) because it reflects on Cuevas\u2019 veracity and is dissimilar to the charged conduct, and because Cuevas\u2019 testimony and credibility were critical at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Third, Cuevas challenges the district court\u2019s decision to limit his cross-examination of Special Agent Lee Jacobs. The court reviews <em>de novo </em>whether a limitation on cross-examination is so severe as to violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>United States v. Adamson, </em>291 F.3d 606 (9th Cir.2002). The district court did not prevent Cuevas from probing for bias, questioning the strength of Jacobs\u2019 training or experience, or otherwise discrediting his testimony. The district court merely required Cuevas to focus his cross-examination on matters relating to Jacobs\u2019 direct testimony. This type of limitation does not violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>See United States v. Lo, </em>231 F.3d 471, 482 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Finally, Cuevas requests that the panel review the government\u2019s ex parte submissions and determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to disclose the source of the TECS alert. The government\u2019s submissions confirm that neither Farias nor anyone connected with him triggered the TECS alert. The district court did not err in protecting the information contained in these submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
