Bryson, Jr., appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for review of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000) and for modification of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2000). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Bryson, </em>No. CR-01-240 (D.S.C. July 18, 2003). In his informal brief, Bryson asserts several claims that were not raised in the district court. We decline to address these claims. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (declining to consider claims raised for first time on appeal, absent exceptional circumstances). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
