Petitioner was convicted in 1981 of second degree murder and first degree sexual abuse in the stabbing death and molestation of Audra Carter, a thirteen-year-old girl. Among the evidence presented by the State at trial was petitioner\u2019s jailhouse confession, offered through the testimony of Robert McAvoy, a fellow inmate. In 1997, petitioner sought post-conviction relief in the Suffolk County Court, and also filed a habeas petition in the District Court, offering \u201cnew evidence\u201d in the form of two hearsay affidavits that McAvoy was working for law enforcement at the time of petitioner\u2019s confession. The Suffolk County Court denied relief based on petitioner\u2019s failure to exercise \u201cdue diligence\u201d in bringing his post-conviction motion as required by statute, and, in the alternative, ruled against petitioner on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The District Court found that petitioner was not entitled to relief, rejecting petitioner\u2019s claim that the District Attorney paid McAvoy for his testimony and failed to produce such information in violation of petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>rights. Petitioner now argues that the District Court erred by failing to afford petitioner an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether petitioner\u2019s jailhouse confession was obtained by police use of an informant in violation of petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>See United States v. </em>Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 273, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner an evidentiary hearing or err in denying the writ. A federal hearing is mandatory only when the habeas petitioner has alleged facts that, if proved, entitle the petitioner to relief. <em>See Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 312, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). Because of the overwhelming evidence at trial-petitioner\u2019s wallet was found next to the dead girl\u2019s body, there was testimony from his father and his friends that he was with the girl immediately before and around the time of her death, a can of the exact brand of malt liquor he was drinking that night was found next to her body, the canine-tracking from her blood stain led to his house, and the stab wounds matched those inflicted by a buck knife that he was carrying on the night in question-it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury\u2019s determination of petitioner\u2019s guilt would have been the same in the absence of McAvoy\u2019s testimony. <em>See Milton v. Wainwright, </em>407 U.S. 371, 372, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972); <em>see also Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991), <em>Pagan v. Keane, </em>984 F.2d 61 (2d Cir.1993). Accordingly, petitioner cannot allege facts that, if proved, would entitle him to relief and it was within the District Court\u2019s discretion to deny the evidentiary hearing. <em>Townsend, </em>372 U.S. at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and have found each of them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
