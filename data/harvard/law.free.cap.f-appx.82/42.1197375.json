Jordan (\u201cJordan\u201d) seeks review of the initial decision and the final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying his request for corrective action under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-353, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. (108 Stat. 3149) 2449 (\u201cUSERRA\u201d) (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301-4333), and dismissing for lack of jurisdiction his claims of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, and age. Because the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b84-22\">Jordan was employed by the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) as a Letter Carrier. He was also a member of the United States Air Force Reserve. Jordan was ordered to active reserve duty in Cuba from December 14, 1994, to March 16, 1995. ordered to active reserve duty in Cuba from December 14, 1994, to March 16, 1995. Rather than seeking military leave from the USPS during this period, Jordan requested sick leave, annual leave, and leave without pay. When Jordan\u2019s supervisor, Wayne Davenport, discovered this, he reported it to his superiors because he believed that Jordan \u201chad deliberately misrepresented his physical condition, so as to receive paid leave from the [USPS] while also being paid to serve in the Air Force.\u201d App. at 18. After an investigation, Jordan was charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>misrepresenting his physical abilities, falsification of a form, and misrepresenting a request for leave. The deciding official sustained the charges, and Jordan was removed from employment with the USPS on July 1,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">On September 28, 2000, Jordan filed a complaint -with the Board, alleging that the USPS\u2019s decision to terminate his employment violated USERRA because the USPS allegedly discriminated against him because of his military service. He also alleged discrimination on the basis of race, religion, and age. In a first initial decision, the administrative judge rendered judgment on the written record against Jordan. <em>Jordan v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>No. SF-3443-00-0690-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 22, 2000) <em>(\u201cJordan I\"). </em>On January 9, 2002, the Board vacated the initial decision and remanded the matter for further adjudication because it found that Jordan had \u201cspecifically requested a hearing.\u201d <em>Jordan v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>90 M.S.P.R. 525, 527-28 (2002) <em>(\u201cJordan II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">After a hearing on remand, the administrative judge held that Jordan had not satisfied his burden pursuant to USERRA, \u201cof showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee\u2019s military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Jordan v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>No. SF-3443-00-0690-B-l, slip op. at 9-10 (M.S.P.B. May 2, 2002) <em>(\u201cJordan III\u201d); see also Sheehan v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed.Cir.2001). The administrative judge also dismissed Jordan\u2019s claims of discrimination based on race, religion, and age, holding that such claims \u201ccannot be litigated in the course of a USERRA appeal.\u201d <em>Jordan III, </em>slip op. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On June 18, 2003, the Board denied review. <em>Jordan v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>No. SF-3443-00-0690-B-1, 94 M.S.P.R. 482, 2003 WL 21458240 (M.S.P.B. June 19, 2003). Jordan timely sought review in this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">We sustain a decision of the Board unless it is \u201cfound to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Pyles v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>45 F.3d 411, 414 n. 2 (Fed. Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Jordan argues that the Board erred in rejecting his USERRA claim. However, the administrative judge credited the testimony of Jordan\u2019s supervisors over Jordan\u2019s testimony and held that Jordan had not satisfied his burden under USERRA of establishing that his military service was a substantial motivating factor in his removal. <em>See Sheehan, </em>240 F.3d at 1013 (\u201cThe procedures established by precedent require an employee making a USERRA claim of discrimination to bear the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee\u2019s military sendee was \u2018a substantial or motivating factor\u2019 in the adverse employment action.\u201d) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Transp. Mgmt. Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 400, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983)). The Board\u2019s decision in this respect is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Jordan also argues that the Board improperly failed to consider a case review by Deputy District Attorney Judith O\u2019Leary (\u201cO\u2019Leary\u201d), who declined to prosecute Jordan for fraud related to his mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>representations to the USPS. However, the case review was in the record before the administrative judge, and the administrative judge\u2019s denial of Jordan\u2019s untimely request to call O\u2019Leary as a witness was well within his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Therefore, the Board correctly denied the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
