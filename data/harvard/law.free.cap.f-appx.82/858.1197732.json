For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-21\">In his petition, Samba first challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Samba fails to show the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Samba\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture, both of which require the applicant to make a more stringent showing to qualify for relief. To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). To obtain relief under the Convention Against Torture, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003). Because Samba fails to show he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standards for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Finally, Samba contends he was denied due process because the Board failed to consider on appeal new evidence not raised before the immigration judge. We find this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
