Wexler, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The petitioner David Holman appeals from a judgment of the district court denying his application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 with respect to his 1996 conviction on two counts of murder in the second degree in the Supreme Court of New York, Dutchess County. <em>Holman v. Duncan, </em>204 F.Supp.2d 613 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (Memorandum Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">In his application, Holman contends that his trial counsel had an active conflict of interest with Holman at the time of Holman\u2019s trial because, having been appointed a part-time judge shortly before the trial, counsel did not call some police witnesses because he did not wish to \u201cstep on any toes\u201d at the police department. Holman argues that, because his counsel had an active conflict, his ineffectiveness claim should be judged under the standard set forth in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980) (Sixth Amendment violated where \u201cactual conflict\u201d \u201cadversely affected\u201d counsel\u2019s performance), instead of under the more difflcult-to-meet requirements of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (Sixth Amendment violated only if the defendant can show both that counsel\u2019s performance was so deficient as to be \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 690, and that prejudice resulted because \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">The district court, citing <em>Mickens v. Taylor, </em>535 U.S. 162, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002), denied Holman\u2019s habeas petition, explaining that Holman had not shown that his counsel actively represented another party with a conflicting interest while representing Holman, as the district court thought <em>Mickens </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">As the district court notes, \u201cthe law moves swiftly.\u201d <em>Holman v. Duncan, </em>204 F.Supp.2d 613 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (Memorandum Order). After the court entered judgment but before we heard argument on this appeal, we decided <em>Tueros v. Greiner, </em>343 F.3d 587 (2d Cir.2003). <em>Tueros </em>sheds doubt on the district court\u2019s reading of <em>Mickens. </em>It may also have a bearing on whether Holman\u2019s trial counsel labored under an \u201cactual conflict\u201d at the time of trial. Because the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Tueros </em>when it entered judgment, we vacate and remand for reconsideration in light of <em>Tueros, </em>including reconsideration of whether it is necessary or advisable that the hearing originally ordered by the district court on March 8, 2002, and rescinded by its April 22 Memorandum Order, go forward. By doing so, we do not intimate any view on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
