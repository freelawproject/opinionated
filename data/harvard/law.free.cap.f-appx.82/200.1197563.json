Denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint for a third time, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the suit; Douglas now appeals. We review the district court\u2019s order dismissing the case de novo, and we note that \u201cdismissal is inappropriate unless plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim to entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Thatcher Enters, v. Cache County Corp., </em>902 F.2d 1472, 1473 (10th Cir.1990) (citation omitted). We review the district court\u2019s denial of Douglas\u2019 motion to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Castleglen, Inc. v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>984 F.2d 1571, 1585 (10th Cir.1993). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">On March 5, 2001, Beaver County police went to Douglas\u2019 home and arrested Mark Russell, who was living there at the time. Pursuant to the police investigation, the officers went to Jessica\u2019s school, took Jessica to a private room, and questioned her in Erickson\u2019s presence for a short time. Asking a total of eight questions, the officers sought to determine: (1) whether Jessica was aware of any of her family members or Russell using drugs at her house; and (2) whether Russell or her family members had ever abused Jessica.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">In an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Erickson, DeArmitt, and the Beaver County School District Board, Douglas made three distinct claims: First, that the Beaver County School District Board is liable for Erickson\u2019s allowance of the allegedly illegal police detention of Jessica; second, that Erickson\u2019s acquiescence renders him and DeArmitt liable in their official capacities; and third, that Erickson is liable in his individual capacity for his role in the police interview of Jessica. We address each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">Although Utah school districts are not immune from \u00a7 1983 suits in federal court, <em>Ambus v. Granite Bd. of Educ., </em>995 F.2d 992, 997 (10th Cir.1993), they are liable only if the violation of a plaintiffs federal rights results from an action taken under an official custom or policy. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>D.T. v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 16, </em>894 F.2d 1176, 1187 (10th Cir.1990). Neither Douglas\u2019 Complaint, the Amended Complaint, nor the Second Amended Complaint alleged that a custom or policy of the Beaver County School District caused the alleged constitutional deprivation. Absent such allegations, no cognizable claim against the school district exists. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>therefore affirm the dismissal of Douglas\u2019 claims against the Beaver County School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Dismissing the claims against Erickson and DeArmitt in their official capacities, the district court concluded that the official-capacity claims were identical to the claims against the school district and thus superfluous. On appeal, Douglas argues that unlike the suit against the school district, the suit against Erickson and DeAr-mitt in their official capacities does not require proof of an official custom or policy. The Supreme Court has explained that in an official-capacity suit, however, the real party in interest is not the named official but rather the governmental entity itself. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 691. As such, in an official-capacity suit we require \u201cthe entity\u2019s \u2018policy or custom\u2019 [to have] played a part in the violation of federal law.\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (quoting <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694). Thus, Douglas\u2019 failure to allege an official custom or policy of the Beaver County School District Board is equally fatal to her claims against Erickson and DeArmitt in their official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">As to the claims against Erickson in his individual capacity, the doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials from individual liability for civil damages \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); <em>Ramirez v. Oklahoma Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>41 F.3d 584, 592 (10th Cir.1994). Thus, the touchstone of the inquiry is the \u201c \u2018objective reasonableness\u2019 of the official\u2019s conduct in light of the legal rules that were \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time the action was taken.\u201d <em>Melton v. City of Okla. City, </em>879 F.2d 706, 727 (10th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 818).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Douglas alleges that Erickson\u2019s acquiescence in the police interview violated Jessica\u2019s clearly established rights .aider the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. With respect to the Fourth Amendment claim, to overcome qualified immunity and prevail under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Douglas must demonstrate that Erickson\u2019s conduct in acquiescing to the police\u2019s brief interview of one of his students violated Jessica\u2019s clearly established statutory or constitutional rights, and that a reasonable person would have known of those rights. <em>Melton, </em>879 F.2d at 727. Because we conclude that Erickson\u2019s role in the brief police interview of Jessica did not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Douglas\u2019 Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Douglas also contends that Erickson violated Jessica\u2019s clearly established privacy rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Two separate privacy claims are at issue: (1) privacy claims based on the disclosure of personal matters, and (2) claims based on violations of the right to familial association. To plead a cognizable privacy claim based on the disclosure of personal matters, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) the disclosure of personal information in which he or she had a legitimate expectation of privacy, (2) that the disclosure serves no compelling state interest, and (3) that it was not made in the least intrusive manner. <em>See Stidham v. Peace Officer Standards and Training, </em>265 F.3d 1144, 1155 (10th Cir.2001). Because Douglas has not alleged <em>disclosure </em>of personal matters, we turn to the privacy claims based on violations of the right to familial association.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>With respect to such claims, we balance the state\u2019s interest in investigation with the plaintiffs interest in the familial right of association to determine whether the state\u2019s conduct constitutes an undue burden. <em>Griffin v. Strong, </em>983 F.2d 1544, 1547 (10th Cir.1993). Moreover, plaintiff must demonstrate that the state \u201cdirect[ed][its] statements or conduct at the intimate relationship with knowledge that the statement or conduct will adversely affect that relationship.\u201d <em>Id., </em>983 F.2d at 1548. Our balancing of the interests in the instant case leads us to conclude that Erickson\u2019s conduct did not result in an undue burden on Douglas\u2019 familial association. Moreover, Douglas fails to allege that Erickson directed his conduct at her familial relationship. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the privacy claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Finally, Douglas contests the district court\u2019s denial of her Motion for Leave of Court to File an Amended Complaint; we review the denial for abuse of discretion. <em>Castleglen, Inc., </em>984 F.2d at 1585. Although leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires,\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a), district courts may refuse it \u201cupon a showing of undue delay, undue prejudice to the opposing party, bad faith or dilatory motive, failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, or futility of amendment.\u201d <em>Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., </em>3 F.3d 1357, 1365 (10th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Prior to the instant motion, Douglas had already amended the complaint twice; moreover, she brought this motion more than a month after the district court dismissed the case. Finally, the district court noted that even with an amendment, Douglas\u2019 underlying constitutional claims were futile. In light of these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to amend represents an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
