Having done so, we affirm both the Board\u2019s decision to deny Bravo-Gallaga\u2019s motion to terminate his removal proceeding and its order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-23\">Petitioner contends that the Board\u2019s interpretation of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.2(f) to require \u201can affirmative communication of the [Immigration and Naturalization] Service\u201d in line with <em>Matter of Cruz, </em>15 I &amp; N Dec. 236 (BIA 1975), is wrong. Since applicable law and procedures have changed since <em>Cruz </em>was issued, Petitioner contends he is deprived of the opportunity for a court to review his prima facie eligibility for naturalization. He suggests the immigration judge misapplied <em>Cruz </em>by refusing to adjudicate his prima facie eligibility and instead demanding a statement from the Service, especially because the Service was then engaged in trying to deport him. Alternatively, Petitioner urges that <em>Cruz </em>be \u201crevisited\u201d to permit immigration judges to rule on the issue of prima facie eligibility for purposes of \u00a7 239.2(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-24\">In our view, these arguments are unavailing for three reasons. First, the statutes still do not authorize immigration judges or the Board to decide issues of naturalization. Second, Petitioner\u2019s inability to obtain a decision from a court (though he never went to court for such relief) or the Service amounts to harmless error in this case, because his conviction for alien smuggling destroyed his prima facie eligibility for naturalization at the time of the immigration hearing. Finally, this court lacks jurisdiction to require the Board to \u201crevisit\u201d its own decision, and we are without authority to issue an order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>this appeal compelling the Service to rule in a separate administrative proceeding on Bravo-Gallaga\u2019s prima facie eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the relief requested. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
