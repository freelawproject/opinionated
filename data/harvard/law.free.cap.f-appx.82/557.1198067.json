Miller. We affirm because we conclude that the non-competition clause of the employment agreement is unenforceable under Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 653.295.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we repeat them here only as is necessary to our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">Kroger argues that the non-competition clause is enforceable because it satisfies one of the exceptions provided for in Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295. We review grants of summary judgment de novo to determine whether there exists a genuine issue as to any material fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Glenn K. Jackson Inc. v. Roe, </em>273 F.3d 1192, 1196 (9th Cir.2001). We also review questions of state substantive law de novo, <em>Reese v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>129 F.3d 1056, 1059-60 (9th Cir.1997), applying state law principles of statutory interpretation. <em>Lares v. West One Bank, </em>188 F.3d 1166, 1168 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">Under Oregon law, agreements not to compete in the employment context violate public policy unless they satisfy one of three narrow exceptions. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295. First, non-competition agreements are enforceable if they are \u201centered into upon the [ijnitial employment of the employee with the employer.\u201d Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 653.295(l)(a). Second, non-competition agreements are enforceable if they are \u201centered into upon the [subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>bona fide advancement of the employee with the employer.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295(l)(b). Finally, such agreements are enforceable if they are \u201cbonus restriction agreements\u201d under Oregon law. Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The Supreme Court of Oregon has not interpreted the words \u201cinitial employment,\u201d \u201cbona fide advancement,\u201d or \u201cbonus restriction agreement\u201d in the context of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Kroger argues that the 1998 Fred Meyer employment agreement comes within the first exception to Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295 because it was entered into on October 13, 1998 in contemplation of the merger between Fred Meyer and Kroger. The 1998 Fred Meyer agreement was assumed by Kroger as part of the merger agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The merger became effective on May 27, 1999. Almost four months later, Mr. Miller and Kroger signed a new employment contract on September 16, 1999, with a July 22, 1999 effective date (\u201cthe Kroger agreement\u201d), Kroger also asserts that Mr. Miller and Kroger entered into an unwritten employment agreement on the date the merger took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The Court of Appeals of Oregon has interpreted \u201cinitial employment,\u201d as that term is used in Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295, in two decisions. In <em>Pac. Veterinary Hosp., P.C. v. White, </em>72 Or.App. 533, 696 P.2d 570 (1985), the Court of Appeals held that a non-competition agreement entered into one year after an employee started working was void because it was outside the employee\u2019s initial employment. <em>Id. </em>at 537, 696 P.2d 570. In <em>Bouska v. Wright, </em>49 Or.App. 763, 621 P.2d 69 (1980), the Court of Appeals concluded that a non-competition agreement signed three days after the day that the employee started work was valid because it was \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d with the employee\u2019s initial employment. <em>Id. </em>at 768, 621 P.2d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The Supreme Court of Oregon has instructed that, in interpreting a statute, \u201cwords of common usage typically should be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Portland Gen. Elec. Co. v. Bureau of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>317 Or. 606, 611, 859 P.2d 1143 (1993) (citations omitted). The plain meaning of the word \u201cinitial\u201d is \u201crelating to, or occurring at the beginning.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(4th ed.2000). \u201cEmployment\u201d means \u201cthe state of being employed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEmployed\u201d means \u201cto engage the services of; put to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We are persuaded that the Supreme Court of Oregon would construe the words \u201cinitial employment\u201d as referring to the first few days an employee begins to serve his or her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">The 1998 Fred Meyer agreement was negotiated with a different employer, before the merger occurred. Thus, it was not entered into when Mr. Miller began to serve Kroger.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">The district court found that Kroger presented no evidence of an oral non-competition agreement. The record does not support Kroger\u2019s contention that an oral employment agreement containing a non-competition clause was entered into on Mr. Miller\u2019s initial employment. The Kroger agreement did not take effect until July 22, 1999, almost two months after Mr. Miller\u2019s initial employment with Kroger. Thus, it was not executed contemporaneously with the date Mr. Miller began his service. The Kroger agreement does not come within the first exception to Or .Rev. Stat. \u00a7 653.295.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">Kroger also asserts that the non-competition agreement comes within the \u201cbona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>fide advancement\u201d exception. In <em>Pac. Veterinary Hosp., </em>in dicta, the Court of Appeals of Oregon equated a \u201cbona fide advancement\u201d with an actual promotion. 72 Or.App. at 538 n. 3, 696 P.2d 570. This is the only indication from the Court of Appeals of Oregon as to how its Supreme Court would interpret the words \u201cbona fide advancement.\u201d Absent binding authority, we again turn to the dictionary to determine the plain meaning of \u201csubsequent bona fide advancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\u201cSubsequent\u201d means \u201cfollowing in time or order; succeeding.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary. </em>In the context of Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295(1), \u201csubsequent\u201d means after initial employment. \u201cBona fide\u201d means \u201cauthentic; genuine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAdvancement\u201d means \u201ca promotion, as in rank.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Bringing these definitions together, a \u201csubsequent bona fide advancement\u201d means a genuine promotion in rank after initial employment. This interpretation is consistent with the two federal district court decisions that have addressed this provision of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295. <em>See First Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. Co. v. Sumner, </em>212 F.Supp.2d 1235, 1241 (D.Or. 2002) (noting that an increase in pay or benefits was not sufficient to be considered a \u201cbona fide advancement\u201d); <em>Nike, Inc. v. McCarthy, </em>285 F.Supp.2d 1242, 1245-46, 1246-47 (D.Or.2003) (considering several factors including increased pay, responsibilities, and compensation, to find that a non-competition agreement was enforceable).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Mr. Miller did not receive an increase in salary or benefits, or a change in his responsibilities under the Kroger agreement. We conclude, therefore, that the bona fide advancement exception to Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Kroger also argues that the non-competition clause is an enforceable \u201cbonus restriction agreement\u201d rather than an unenforceable non-competition agreement. Kroger maintains that the plain meaning of \u201cbonus compensation\u201d includes \u201cseverance compensation\u201d because it is in excess of the usual compensation that would otherwise be given to an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Bonus restriction agreements are enforceable. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295(4) (\u201cSubsection (1) of this section does not apply to bonus restriction agreements, which are lawful agreements that may be enforced by the courts in this state\u201d). \u201cThe penalty imposed on the employee for competition against the employer is limited to forfeiture of profit sharing or other bonus compensation that has not yet been paid to the employee.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295(6)(a)(C). At issue in this appeal is whether the contested non-competition provision \u201cis limited to ... other bonus compensation.\u201d No Oregon court has previously interpreted the term \u201cother bonus compensation.\u201d Applying the principle of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>\u201ca nonspecific or general phrase that appears at the end of a list of items in a statute is to be read as referring only to other items of the same kind.\u201d <em>Vannatta v. Keisling, </em>324 Or. 514, 533, 931 P.2d 770 (1997) (citation omitted). Therefore, \u201cother bonus compensation\u201d must be of the same kind as profit sharing. \u201cProfit sharing\u201d is \u201ca system by which employees receive a share of the profits of a business enterprise.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary. </em>To be logically of the same kind as profit sharing, \u201cother bonus compensation\u201d must be tied to the company\u2019s profits or some other measure of performance, so that the employee and the company share in the positive results. A \u201cbonus\u201d is \u201ca sum of money or an equivalent given to an employee in addition to the employee\u2019s usual compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCompensation\u201d is \u201csomething, such as money, given or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>received as payment or reparation, as for a service or loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We believe that the Supreme Court of Oregon would construe \u201cother bonus compensation\u201d as (1) something paid for services, (2) in addition to the employee\u2019s usual compensation, (3) because of positive company results or performance measures. In other words, if the company does not make a profit, or if performance expectations are not met, an employee will not receive \u201cother bonus compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The only part of the Kroger severance agreement that is related to performance is the pro rata bonus. Mr. Miller\u2019s severance pay as a whole is not related to any performance measure. Accordingly, the Kroger agreement is not \u201climited to ... other bonus compensation\u201d under Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Finally, Kroger argues that Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 653.295 should be read as a narrow restriction intended merely to prevent employers from using \u201csurprise and oppressive tactics\u201d against unsophisticated employees. <em>Pac. Veterinary Hosp., </em>72 Or. App. at 537-38, 696 P.2d 570. The plain language of the statute does not support Kroger\u2019s argument that sophisticated parties are not subject to Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295. The statute does not make distinctions based on the type of employee, or the employee\u2019s or employer\u2019s level of sophistication.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Had the Oregon legislature intended to limit the effect of this statute, it had the means at its disposal to specify certain classes of employees, such as executives or officers, as it has done in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.020(3) (exempting certain employees \u201cengaged in administrative, executive or professional work\u201d from minimum wage requirements). It did not do so when drafting Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295, and we lack the authority to insert an exception to the statute that the Oregon legislature omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">In summary, we hold that the non-competition clause violates Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 653.295. We deny the request to certify this matter to the Supreme Court of Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
