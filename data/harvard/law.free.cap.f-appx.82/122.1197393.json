While Shepherd\u2019s opinion about a minimum collection percentage may not support a judgment for certain dollars, it does have admissible weight to prove that HNRA was damaged because of the defendant\u2019s delay and failure to move to collection of the accounts. And it is delay that is the essence of this expert\u2019s testimony. With evidence of breach of contract that caused damages in the loss of some extent of collections, HNRA sufficiently resisted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">Shepherd\u2019s testimony should not have been excluded. The court\u2019s ruling on reconsideration becomes moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-21\">The judgment is reversed. The cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
