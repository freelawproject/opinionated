Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), claiming that the prosecution exercised peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo. See Jones v. Vacco, </em>126 F.3d 408, 413 (2d Cir.1997). In doing so here, we conclude that the district court properly held that the state court\u2019s decisions were not contrary to or unreasonable applications of federal law as established by the United States Supreme Court, and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">I. <em>The Closure Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">With regard to the closure issue, we very recently clarified this area of law in two published opinions addressing a defendant\u2019s right to a public trial. <em>See Yung v. Walker, </em>341 F.3d 104, 110-11 (2d Cir. 2003); <em>Sevencan v. Herbert, </em>342 F.3d 69, 74 (2d Cir.2003). Because these decisions control the merits of petitioners\u2019 claims, there is no need to address whether the claims have been waived or procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">At issue are two separate decisions the state court made after required hearings, pursuant to <em>People v. Hinton, </em>31 N.Y.2d 71, 334 N.Y.S.2d 885, 286 N.E.2d 265 (N.Y. 1972), to determine the propriety and scope of the proposed courtroom closure. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), we may overturn a state court adjudication only if it \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). \u201cWe must presume the state court\u2019s factual findings to be correct and may overturn those findings only if petitioner[s] offer[] clear and convincing evidence of their incorrectness.\u201d <em>Yung, </em>341 F.3d at 109 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)). In <em>Yung, </em>we clarified that application of our pre-AEDPA decision in <em>Vidal v. Williams, </em>31 F.3d 67 (2d Cir.1994), which adopted a specialized standard for the exclusion of family members in this circuit, cannot be reconciled with the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Court\u2019s holding in <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), that under AEDPA only Supreme Court precedent is relevant to the inquiry at hand. <em>See Yung, </em>341 F.3d at 110; <em>Sevencan, </em>342 F.3d at 74-75. Therefore, <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984), not <em>Vidal, </em>provides the guiding test. <em>Yung, </em>341 F.3d at 111. Because both state court decisions conformed to <em>Waller, </em>neither exclusion violated appellants\u2019 right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In <em>Waller, </em>the Supreme Court held that before public access to a courtroom in a criminal case may be restricted, \u201c[ (1) ] the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, [ (2) ] the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, [ (3) ] the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and [ (4) ] [the court] must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d 467 U.S. at 48. <em>Yung </em>requires us to apply the \u201cmore general teachings of <em>Waller\u201d </em>even when reviewing the exclusion of family members. <em>Yung, </em>341 F.3d at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The trial court\u2019s decision to exclude everyone from the courtroom during the testimony of a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) comported with <em>Waller\u2019s </em>parameters and was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d in its application: (1) The prosecutor advanced an \u201coverriding interest\u201d that was \u201clikely to be prejudiced\u201d by a public hearing-the safety of the Cl. (2) The closure was \u201cno broader than necessary to protect that interest,\u201d as it occurred solely during the Cl\u2019s and an undercover officer\u2019s testimony. <em>See Sevencan, </em>342 F.3d at 76.(3) The trial court satisfied its obligation to consider reasonable alternatives; in any event, where \u201c[n]o additional alternatives [a]re suggested by any party, ... trial judges ha[ve] no obligation to consider additional alternatives <em>sua sponte. \u201d Ayala v. Speckard, </em>131 F.3d 62, 72 (2d Cir.1997) <em>(in </em>banc). And, (4) the court made an explicit finding about the threats on the Cl\u2019s life and family.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The second closure-this time for an undercover police officer\u2019s (\u201cUC-1028\u201d) testimony-also comported with <em>Waller. </em>(1) The prosecutor advanced an \u201coverriding interest\u201d that was \u201clikely to be prejudiced\u201d by a public hearing-protecting both the life and usefulness of UC-1028. (2) The closure was also \u201cno broader than necessary to protect that interest,\u201d as it occurred solely during the Cl\u2019s and UC-1028\u2019s testimony. <em>See Sevencan, </em>342 F.3d at 76. Moreover, transcripts of the testimony were available to the public, and the trial court did not seal the courtroom for other law enforcement officer testimony, indicating the exercise of discretion in closure. <em>See Ayala, </em>131 F.3d at 69-72.(3) The trial court considered reasonable alternatives; in any event, no alternatives were offered by the parties and the trial court need not have considered any <em>sua sponte. See id. </em>at 72. Finally, because the court made an explicit finding about UC-1028\u2019s life and family, prong (4) is satisfied on the record before us. We are presented with no clear and convincing evidence of the incorrectness of the state court actions, as required for reversal under AEPDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">While <em>Waller </em>plainly provides no relief on appellants\u2019 general closure claim, they further assert that the exclusion of them families required a special standard and a specialized finding by the trial court. However, <em>Yung </em>and <em>Sevencan </em>hold that <em>Waller, </em>rather than cases from this circuit, supplies the standard by which all courtroom closures are to be judged. Because <em>Waller </em>requires that a closure be no broader-as to either duration of the closing or the portion of the public excluded-than necessary to serve the overriding interest at stake, it would be an unreasonable interpretation of <em>Waller </em>for a trial court to deny a defendant\u2019s request to exempt rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>tives from a closure order unless the relatives\u2019 exclusion was necessary to serve the overriding interest. <em>Yung, </em>341 F.3d at 110-11; <em>Sevencan, </em>342 F.3d at 76. Here, the defendants did not request exemptions for their family members, so the court\u2019s failure to exempt them was not an unreasonable interpretation of <em>Waller. See id.; see also Brown v. Kuhlmann, </em>142 F.3d 529, 538 (2d Cir.1998) (holding that when a defendant does not ask the court to permit family members to remain, he \u201ccannot argue that their exclusion renders the closure overbroad\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 habeas petitions on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">II. <em>The </em>Batson <em>Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We next address appellants\u2019 claim that the prosecution violated <em>Batson </em>by exercising its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. Again, we let pass the possibility that the claim is procedurally barred as to any petitioner because the claim plainly lack merit. The defense objected to the prosecution\u2019s challenges after the second and fourth (of five) rounds of jury selection from a venire that was 68% minority-composed based on what they thought was a <em>prima facie </em>showing of statistical discrimination. We agree with the district court that there was no <em>Batson </em>violation and affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">After the second round of jury selection, six of the seven jurors seated were black; after the fourth, nine of the eleven seated were black. Given that the final proportion of seated jurors well exceeded the proportion of minority prospective jurors in the venire, a <em>prima facie </em>claim of discrimination is undermined. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 77 (2d Cir.1999). \u201cOnly a rate of minority challenges significantly higher than the minority percentage of the venire would support a statistical inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>923 F.2d 253, 255 (2d Cir.1991). And that was not the case here. Under a \u201cmulti-factor analysis,\u201d <em>Tankleff v. Senkowski, </em>135 F.3d 235, 249 (2d Cir. 1998), and according \u201cbroad latitude\u201d to the trial judge in determining whether a <em>prima facie </em>case was made, <em>Diaz, </em>176 F.3d at 76 (internal quotation marks omitted), we find that the state court made no erroneous application of <em>Batson, </em>nor did it act contrary to any federal law, as established by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">We have carefully considered all of appellants\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
