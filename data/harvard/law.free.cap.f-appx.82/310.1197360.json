California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing whether Mason\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and whether the district court correctly determined Mason\u2019s sentence. Counsel concedes, however, that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Mason has filed a supplemental pro se brief in which he also claims that: (1) the Government was required to prove whether the methamphetamine was \u201cinjectable\u201d or \u201cnon-injectable;\u201d (2) his attorney was ineffective for failing to raise this issue at sentencing; and (3) \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Counsel first addresses whether Mason\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. Our review of the record reveals that the district court fully complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. The court ascertained that Mason was 43 years old, had obtained a GED, and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Mason stated that he understood the charge against him, the maximum penalty that he faced (life imprisonment), the binding nature of his plea, the rights he waived by pleading guilty, the abolition of parole, and supervised release. He informed the court that he was guilty was charged and that he had not been threatened or coerced to enter a plea. Mason expressed satisfaction with his lawyer\u2019s services. The court determined that there was an independent factual basis to support the plea and entered a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Next, counsel addresses whether the district court properly determined Mason\u2019s sentence; he notes, however, that no objections were made at Mason\u2019s sentencing hearing. Accordingly, the standard of review is plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Based on a total offense level of 33 and criminal history category IV, Mason\u2019s guideline range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment; the statutory maximum is life imprisonment. The district court\u2019s decision to sentence Mason to a term within the guideline range may not be challenged on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Mason first claims that the district court erred in sentencing him without first requiring the Government to prove whether the methamphetamine was \u201cinjectable\u201d or \u201cnon-injectable.\u201d We find no merit to this claim. Next, Mason claims that his attorney was ineffective for failing to raise this claim at sentencing. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not properly raised on direct appeal unless the record conclusively reveals that the defendant\u2019s representation was defective. <em>United States v. Vinyard, </em>266 F.3d 320, 333 (4th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 922, 122 S.Ct. 2587, 153 L.Ed.2d 777 (2002). Because the record does not conclusively show that Mason\u2019s counsel was ineffective, we decline to consider this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Finally, Mason challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 841 on two grounds: (1) that it \u201cselectively punishes certain users of drugs, that are \u2018harmful\u2019 to society, while allowing other of greater harm,\u201d and (2) that it fails to show a substantial effect on interstate commerce and, therefore, violates the rule in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>626 (1995). As to Mason\u2019s first ground, \u201c[s]tatutes are presumed constitutional, and a law that neither creates a suspect class nor abridges a fundamental right is given only minimal equal protection scrutiny.\u201d <em>Faircloth v. Finesod, </em>938 F.2d 513, 516 (4th Cir.1991). Section 841 clearly survives this minimal scrutiny as there is no basis to deem Congress\u2019 actions \u201cirrational.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516-17. His second ground fares no better. Indeed, this court has already considered and rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>United States v. Leshuk, </em>65 F.3d 1105, 1112 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm Mason\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> We grant Mason's motion to file the supplemental brief out of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
