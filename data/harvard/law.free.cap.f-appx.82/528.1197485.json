He argues that his sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed pursuant to Washington\u2019s Persistent Offender Accountability Act (\u201cPOAA\u201d) is unconstitutional. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.94A.555, 9.94A.570.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">Because the state court decision denying Garcia\u2019s claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, the district court properly denied Garcia\u2019s habeus corpus petition. The state court conducted an adequate proportionality analysis in determining that Garcia\u2019s sentence was constitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The Washington state constitution\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment is more protective than the Eighth Amendment\u2019s, as state courts are required to conduct a proportionality analysis which examines the nature of the offense, the legislative purpose behind the statute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the length of the defendant\u2019s sentence compared to sentences imposed for similar crimes both in Washington and in other jurisdictions. <em>State v. Rivers, </em>129 Wash.2d 697, 713, 921 P.2d 495 (Wash.1996). In finding that Garcia\u2019s sentence was not unconstitutional, the state court did not \u201cappl[y] a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Rather, the state court applied a standard that would have given Garcia more protection than he would have received under federal law and still found that his sentence was not grossly disproportionate. Thus, Garcia is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Garcia\u2019s challenge to his sentence on the basis that it is cruel and unusual because none of his felonies involved weapons or resulted in serious injury also fails. As the district court noted, Garcia\u2019s triggering offense of attempted first degree robbery is considered a violent offense, as is second degree assault, one of his predicate offenses. While Garcia\u2019s previous felonies did not involve weapons, his predicate crimes are all felonies and are considered \u201cmost serious offenses\u201d under Washington law. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9.94A.030. In holding that Garcia\u2019s sentence was constitutional, the district court relied upon Supreme Court precedent which has held that a life sentence without parole which is triggered by a serious felony is not grossly disproportionate. <em>See Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (upholding a sentence of life without parole for a first time offender convicted of possessing 672 grams of cocaine). As no constitutional violation occurred, the district court correctly denied Garcia\u2019s habeus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Finally, we lack grounds to overturn the state court\u2019s ruling that the POAA is facially valid. The state court reasonably relied upon the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s holding that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed under the POAA is constitutional. <em>See State v. Thorne, </em>129 Wash.2d 736, 921 P.2d 514 (Wash.1996). As discussed above, the state court, performing a more thorough proportionality analysis than the federal constitution requires, found that Garcia\u2019s sentence was not grossly disproportionate under the POAA. Although the state court\u2019s decision was handed down before the Supreme Court\u2019s recent rulings in <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) and <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003), these recent decisions upholding sentences of 25 years to life in prison under California\u2019s recidivist sentencing statute demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. As the Washington legislature may constitutionally impose life sentences for recidivist offenders with serious criminal histories, Garcia\u2019s facial challenge to the POAA is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
