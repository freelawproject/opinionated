As the Board decision at issue was a refusal to reopen Mims\u2019s case for failure timely to appeal the underlying hearings officer decision, we have no jurisdiction to consider Mims\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Mims injured his back in 1984. In July 1992, he filed an application for a disability annuity under Section 2(a)(l)(v) of the Railroad Retirement Act (the \u201cAct\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asserting that he was disabled for all work. He also applied for a \u201cperiod of disability\u201d and early Medicare coverage under applicable sections of the Social Security Act. When these applications were denied, Mims pursued his administrative remedies, requesting reconsideration and eventually filing an appeal to the Board itself. The Board found that Mims was not totally disabled, a decision that Mims did not appeal to this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Years later, in July 1998, Mims filed a second application for a disability annuity, and in a letter dated October 20th, 1998, the Board\u2019s Director of Operations notified him that this application was denied. Mims requested reconsideration, and was informed by letter dated December 10th, 1998, that his request had been denied. Mims timely appealed that denial, and the hearings officer in his case reversed the reconsideration determination in part and affirmed it in part. In a decision issued August 30, 1999, the hearing officer found that Mims was disabled from all work effective January 1, 1997, and that he was entitled to a monthly disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. The hearing officer also determined, however, that Mims was ineligible for a \u201cperiod of disability\u201d under the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">Mims was informed of that decision by a letter that was also dated August 30, 1999. Then, by letter dated September 3, 1999, the Office of Programs Operations notified Mims of his initial, partial, annuity rate and initial retroactive payment. And in a letter dated October 1, 1999, the Board\u2019s Director of Operations informed Mims of his final annuity amount and also of his second retroactive payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">On October 29, 2001, Mims appealed the hearing officer\u2019s August 1999 decision. Mims claimed that he should have received payments retroactive to 1984, the year of his first disability application. He also asserted that his annuity payment should be increased to account for his (formerly) minor children. The Board informed Mims by letter dated May 10th, 2002, that his appeal was dismissed as untimely, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">II. Analysis: Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231g gives us jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board concerning the \u201crights or liabilities of any person under [the Railroad Retirement Act].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">A. <em>Timeliness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-18\">Because Mims\u2019s Petition for Review was filed within one year after May 10th, 2002, the date of the decision at issue, it is timely under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231g.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">B. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZs\">1. The Board\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b418-20\">In addition to mandating a one-year appellate time frame, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231g in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>corporates by reference the appeals provisions of the Railroad Unemployment Retirement Act (codified at 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(f)):<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">Decisions of the Board ... shall be subject to judicial review in the same manner, subject to the same limitations, and all provisions of law shall apply in the same manner as though the decision were a determination of corresponding rights or liabilities under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act... ,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARG\">As \u00a7 355(f) allows for appellate review by the court of appeals for the circuit in which the appellant resides, and Mims resides in the Fifth Circuit, the Board concedes that appeal to this court would be proper if Mims has the right to appeal this issue. The Board argues, however, that what Mims seeks to have reviewed \u2014 a Board refusal to <em>reopen </em>a prior denial of his claim \u2014 is not an appealable \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Board as that phrase is used in 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(f), which governs this appeal, dictates that a claimant \u201caggrieved by a final decision under subsection (c) of this section\u201d may seek appellate review of that decision \u201conly after all administrative remedies within the Board ... have been availed of and exhausted ... \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsection (c), in turn, sets out the administrative review process for these types of claims. Paragraph(l) of that subsection provides \u201can opportunity for a fair hearing,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and paragraph(2) authorizes appeals to the Board, noting that \u201c[t]he Board shall prescribe regulations governing the appeals provided for in this paragraph.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Paragraph (5) then allows for appellate review \u201cin the manner provided in subsection (f) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">In the instant case, the government contends that Mims failed to follow the regulations established by the Board \u2014 promulgated under the authority of \u00a7 355(e)(2)\u2014 which require appeals of hearing officer decisions to be filed within 60 days.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a result, according to the government (given that the Board found no \u201cgood cause\u201d excusing the delay), the hearings officer\u2019s decision became \u201cfinal\u201d and yet unappealable in this court because Mims did not first appeal that decision administratively to the Board itself. The government argues that Mims\u2019s failure to take that final administrative step means that he did not avail himself of all administrative remedies before bringing his petition for review to this court, as required by 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\u00ae. The government contends that the denial of Mims\u2019s request to reopen his case \u2014 not a decision on the merits \u2014 is thus not an appealable final decision as that phrase is used in 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 355. According to the government, the only appealable final decision in Mims\u2019s case would have been a final Board decision on his appeal, had he followed the administrative appeals process to completion. Having failed to do so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>he deprived himself of the authority to appeal to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">2. Applicable Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In <em>Roberts v. United States Railroad Retirement Board,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we considered whether, under the Railroad Retirement Act, we have jurisdiction to review a refusal to reopen a closed case, and held that we do not. The concerns discussed in <em>Roberts </em>are present in the instant case, just as they are when petitioners seek review of refusals to reopen closed cases under the Social Security Act:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If we were to sanction appeals of refusals to reopen closed cases, we would undermine the ability of Congress to authorize the Board to fashion meaningful regulations concerning the administrative appeals process. As we noted in <em>Harper v. Bowen, </em>\u201c[i]f courts were able to review denials of requests to reopen long dormant claims, a claimant could \u2018frustrate the congressional purpose ... to impose a 60-day limitation upon judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision .... \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If we were to allow Mims to appeal in the instant case, we would render meaningless both the 60-day limitation on administrative appeals and \u00a7 355(f)\u2019s exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Although we are sympathetic to <em>pro se </em>litigants navigating unfamiliar legal waters, it is clear in this case that Mims slept on his right of appeal. Although Mims states that he did not appeal immediately because the Board was still endeavoring to determine the proper amount of his annuity payments,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the October 1st, 1999, letter informing him of his final annuity amount and additional retroactive payment of $9,487 clearly states that any request for reconsideration and appeal \u201cmust be received by the Railroad Retirement Board WITHIN 60 DAYS from the date of this notice.\u201d Mims did not act within that time; in fact, it appears from the record that he did not raise any concerns about his annuity award until an April 2000 phone call. Furthermore, he must have been aware of the 60-day time limitation because he had appealed numerous prior decisions in his case, and much of the correspondence sent to him - including letters in October and December 1998 - specified that limitation. Even though these facts do not affect our jurisdictional analysis, we note them now to demonstrate that, even as a <em>pro se </em>layman, Mims had ample notice and opportunity to avoid the jurisdictional bar he now faces.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">Mims failed timely to appeal the hearings officer decision in his case. As the Board decision of which he now seeks review is a decision not to reopen his case, we have no jurisdiction to consider his petition. For lack of jurisdiction, Mims\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
