The district court found that because Cortez was effectively challenging the legality of his sentence, his claim was more properly brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). We agree. However, the court did not give Cortez notice and an opportunity to respond before recharacterizing his petition, as required by our decision in <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings in light of <em>Emmanuel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
