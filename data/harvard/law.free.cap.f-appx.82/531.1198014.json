U.S. I.N.S., </em>774 F.2d 965, 967 (9th Cir.1985) (citation omitted). \u201cCursory, summary or conclusory statements\u201d are not sufficient to support a BIA decision. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">The BIA failed to elucidate its rationale for denying relief to Zakharyan. It failed to discuss crucial facts, such as Zakharyan\u2019s imprisonment and the murder of his wife. The BIA\u2019s total failure to address pertinent evidence presented by Zakharyan and to articulate its reasons for its ruling requires a reversal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">It is important to note that the BIA \u201cmay incorporate the [Immigration Judge\u2019s] opinion if the BIA opinion makes it clear it is doing so.\u201d <em>Alaelua v. I.N.S., </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir.1995). However, in this case, the BIA did not incorporate the IJ\u2019s findings clearly or otherwise. Accordingly, we cannot consider the IJ\u2019s findings in determining whether or not the BIA abused its discretion. <em>See id. </em>Looking solely at the BIA decision, as we must, we hold that the BIA abused its discretion in this case when it failed to address the record evidence and to explain the reasons for its ruling. We therefore grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b574-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
