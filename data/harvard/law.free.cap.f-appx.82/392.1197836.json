Both contentions are misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-24\">The bankruptcy court clearly had jurisdiction to adjudicate this contract dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that was \u201crelated to\u201d the bankruptcy case. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b). We cannot say that the bankruptcy court, after properly exercising jurisdiction, committed clear error in finding that a contract had not been formed and in entering a take-nothing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">For these reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
