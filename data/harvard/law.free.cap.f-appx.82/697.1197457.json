R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule <em>34(j). It is</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-18\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed June 21, 2002, be affirmed. Defendant was convicted on his second trial, after the first trial resulted in a hung jury, of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(w).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-19\">He offers two contentions on appeal. First, he argues that the district court improperly precluded him from offering evidence as to his half-brother\u2019s criminal history, the circumstances surrounding the half-brother\u2019s death, and the half-brother\u2019s purported confession to the crimes, which was made to defendant\u2019s father. Second, defendant argues that Congress\u2019s decision to penalize possession of crack cocaine more stringently than it penalizes possession of powder cocaine violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-20\">Regarding defendant\u2019s claim that he was improperly precluded from offering evidence as to his brother\u2019s death and confession, he did not ask for the admission of such evidence in the second trial. Defendant\u2019s objection in the first trial is without effect, because upon mistrial the first trial became a nullity. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Akers, </em>702 F.2d 1145, 1148 (D.C.Cir. 1983). Even if his objection in the first trial preserved the issue for appeal, however, the district court was well within its discretion in excluding the evidence. The brother\u2019s purported admission \u2014 as related by the father \u2014 was not reliable. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3); <em>United States v. Edelin, </em>996 F.2d 1238, 1242 (D.C.Cir.1993) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Salvador, </em>820 F.2d 558, 561 (2d Cir.1987). And the details of the brother\u2019s death were only marginally relevant to the question of defendant\u2019s guilt, if relevant at all. It would certainly have been well within the district court\u2019s discretion to conclude that any probative value of the testimony would have been outweighed substantially by the prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-21\">The one objection that defendant did preserve \u2014 that his father be allowed to testify to the brother\u2019s prior court appearances on drug charges \u2014 was properly rejected. There would have been nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>gained by allowing the father to testify that the brother had been involved in a drug case whose circumstances may or may not have been similar to those in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contention is frivolous. We have repeatedly held that the sentencing differential for crack cocaine versus powder cocaine passes the rational basis test. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Holton, </em>116 F.3d 1536, 1548-49 (D.C.Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
