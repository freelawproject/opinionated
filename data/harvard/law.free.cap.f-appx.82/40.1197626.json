Booker (\u201cBooker\u201d) appeals from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans\u2019 Court\u201d) denying Booker\u2019s motion for extraordinary relief in the nature of mandamus. <em>Booker v. Principi, </em>No. 03-252, 2003 WL 1737645 (Vet.App. Mar. 19, 2003) <em>(\u201cOrder\u201d). </em>Because the Veterans\u2019 Court did not err in determining that Booker had not exhausted his administrative remedies, we <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the Veterans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-19\">Booker served in the United States Air Force from 1981 to 1984. In 1995, Booker first filed a claim for service connection for depression, followed by claims in 1996 for problems with his left knee and in 1998 for problems with his right knee. His claims were denied at a regional office of the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs (\u201cagency\u201d); however, in August 1998, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d) remanded his claims for right knee disorder and depression to the regional office for development. After further consideration by the regional office, Booker\u2019s claims again were before the BVA which, in a November 1999 decision, denied claims for service connection for the left knee disorder and depression, and again remanded the right knee disorder claim to the regional office for further development. <em>Order </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">Booker appealed the November 1999 decision to the Veterans\u2019 Court. On request from the agency following the enactment of the Veterans\u2019 Claims Assistance Act of 2000, the Veterans\u2019 Court vacated the portion of the November 1999 decision denying Booker relief and remanded the case to the BVA. The BVA in turn remanded the case to the regional office, with in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>structions to aid Booker in obtaining medical records and providing Booker with additional medical examinations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">On October 9, 2002, the regional office: (a) denied Booker\u2019s claims for service connection for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, right knee disorder, and left knee disorder; and (b) deferred a decision on Booker\u2019s separate claim filed under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151. In response to the October 9, 2002 decision, Booker filed a request for a writ of mandamus with the Veterans\u2019 Court on February 10, 2003, seeking to have the Veterans\u2019 Court find service connection for each of his claims. On March 19, 2003, the Veterans\u2019 Court denied Booker\u2019s request, holding that \u201cby the filing of his petition with the court, [Booker] is merely seeking to bypass a BVA decision\u201d and finding that Booker had not exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Booker timely appeals from the denial of his request. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The scope of this court\u2019s review of a decision of the Veterans\u2019 Court is set forth in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. This court has jurisdiction \u201cto review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under this section, and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c) (2000). These legal determinations we review de novo. <em>Prenzler v. Derwinski, </em>928 F.2d 392, 393 (Fed.Cir.1991). This court, however, \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case,\u201d except where a constitutional issue is presented. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(d)(2). That being said, \u201cthere is no indication however, that in thus limiting our jurisdiction, Congress intended to insulate from judicial review [a Veterans\u2019 Court] ruling on mandamus petitions.\u201d <em>Lamb v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">\u201cTo obtain mandamus, the petitioner must show (1) that he has a \u2018clear and indisputable right\u2019 to the writ and (2) that he has no alternative way to obtain the relief sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Veterans\u2019 Court correctly recognized that it should apply this standard when considering Booker\u2019s petition. <em>See Order </em>at 2. Booker, on appeal, makes numerous allegations of \u201cdelay, discrimination, and obstruction\u201d in processing his claim. Informal Br. of Pet\u2019r at 1. He also asserts that the agency violated other provisions of Titles 18 and 38, <em>id. </em>at 1-2, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, <em>id. </em>at 3. However, at no point does Booker establish that he has no alternative way to obtain the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The Veterans\u2019 Court clearly considered the delaying effect of the multiple remands in this case. <em>Order </em>at 2 (\u201cIt is unfortunate that an ultimate decision regarding several of petitioner\u2019s claims has been delayed by multiple remands.\u201d). We agree, however, with the Veterans\u2019 Court conclusion that Booker\u2019s petition is \u201cmerely seeking to bypass a BVA decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Absent the writ, Booker will still have recourse, via timely appeal, to the Veterans\u2019 Court from any adverse BVA decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">We have considered Booker\u2019s arguments and find them to be unpersuasive. We conclude that Booker is not entitled to a writ of mandamus because he has not established that he has \u201c \u2018a clear and indisputable right\u2019 to the writ and that he has no alternative way to obtain the relief sought.\u201d <em>Lamb, </em>284 F.3d at 1382. The order of the Veterans\u2019 Court, denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Booker\u2019s request for such writ, is therefore <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
