All of the foregoing motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">The appellants do not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that there is no federal subject matter jurisdiction because defendant Robert Goodwin is not a state actor within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Thus, they have abandoned the only issue that is properly before this court. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">The appeal is frivolous and it is DISMISSED as such. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The appellants are WARNED that sanctions will be imposed if they file frivolous appeals in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-20\">ALL MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-16\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
