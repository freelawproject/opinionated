Kaltman-Glasel appeals, contending that the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction over appellees\u2019 counter-claims once her claims were disposed of by summary judgment because appellees\u2019 claim did not meet the amount in controversy requirement of $75,000 for diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. At oral argument, appellant offered an argument different from any in her brief: counsel suggested that since the counterclaims did not articulate a basis for jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, and the district court did not make any independent determination that the counter-claims ar\u00f3se from a common nucleus of operative fact, this court should find a failure of subject matter jurisdiction on the counterclaims. Kaltman-Glasel also argues that the appellees\u2019 counterclaims were time-barred under Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-581. Because none of appellant\u2019s contentions have any colorable merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">We review legal conclusions about subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Viacom Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Kearney, </em>212 F.3d 721, 726 (2d Cir.2000). The case before us presents a textbook example of an appropriate exercise of that jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. The district court \u201cmay exercise \u2018supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Viacom, </em>212 F.3d at 726 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a)). Here, the appellees\u2019 state law counter-claim for unpaid legal fees was plainly derived \u201cfrom a common nucleus of operative fact\u201d that was the basis of the appellant\u2019s legal malpractice claim in diversity. <em>See Cicio v. Does 1-8, </em>321 F.3d 83, 97 (2d Cir.2003). Having been seized with subject matter jurisdiction over the counterclaims, the district court did not lose it by disposing of appellant\u2019s claims-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Appellant alleged at oral argument that the pleading instructions of Rule 8(a) required the defendants to assert a basis for the district court\u2019s jurisdiction on its counterclaim. This argument has no merit. Appellant waived this argument by failing to address it in her brief, <em>Frank v. United States, </em>78 F.3d 815, 832-33 (2d Cir.1996), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>521 U.S. 114, 117 S.Ct. 2501, 138 L.Ed.2d 1007 (1997); in any case, the language of Rule 8(a) makes plain that a new statement of jurisdictional basis is not necessary when \u201cthe court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a). Finally, even if there were a pleading failure, our <em>de novo </em>review allows us to find, as we do, that the counter-claim clearly arose from a common nucleus of operative fact and the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Nor can Kaltman-Glasel prevail on her argument based on the statute of limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tions, because she waived it. When the issue was raised in the district court, the judge suggested that statute of limitations questions not be presented to the jury but be presented to the court. Plaintiff agreed and made no objection to the jury charge, which omitted all issues pertinent to timeliness. Thereafter, Kaltman-Glasel never raised the question again until she appealed. Accordingly, the question was not preserved for appeal and is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">We have carefully considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
