Hernandez contends that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained by police officers. A district court may revoke a term of supervised release upon a finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d 507, 509 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">Hernandez has failed to demonstrate that his case is factually distinguishable from <em>United States v. Montez, </em>952 F.2d 854, 857-59 (5th Cir.1992) (absent a showing of harassment by police, the exclusionary rule does not apply to revocation of supervised release hearings). Hernandez\u2019s statements, although made without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings following his arrest, were disclaimers of ownership of the \u201cdaytimer\u201d at issue here and not in any way inculpatory. Hernandez\u2019s supervised release was revoked on the basis of tangible evidence found pursuant to the search of the vehicle, which includes the daytimer and its contents, specifically Hernandez\u2019s social security card and the pawn ticket bearing his name and birthdate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">Because these items were seized incident to a lawful Fourth Amendment search following his arrest, there is no basis for distinguishing <em>Montez </em>from Hernandez\u2019s case. Consequently, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1034-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
