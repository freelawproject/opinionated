See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-23\">Reginald Anthony Falice seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his pleading construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. Falice cannot appeal this order unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability, and a certificate of appealability will not issue absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A habeas appellant meets this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Falice has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-16\"> The district court relied on <em>Torres v. United States, </em>211 F.3d 836, 837 (4th Cir.2000) to determine that Falice's conviction became final when this Court issued its mandate affirming his conviction and sentence on direct appeal. Applying <em>Torres, </em>the district court found that Falice's petition was untimely be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>cause it was filed more than one year after we issued a mandate affirming his conviction on direct appeal. The United States Supreme Court has since held that where, as here, a federal prisoner does not challenge an appellate court's affirmance of his conviction and sentence by petitioning for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, his conviction does not become final until the time expires for him to do so. <em>Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003). For this appeal, we have assumed Falice filed his pleading on the date he signed it, <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), and applied <em>Clay </em>to determine that Falice's pleading was timely under the AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (2000). However, Falice's pleading fails to establish he can make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, and consequently, Falice establishes no grounds that warrant the issuance of a certificate of appealability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
