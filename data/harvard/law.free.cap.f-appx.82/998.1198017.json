Carter Co., Inc., </em>179 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.1999). Inasmuch as the record supports the district court\u2019s determination that Jarjoura failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, it is unnecessary to address Jarjoura\u2019s arguments challenging the district court\u2019s alternative holding that, even if a <em>prima facie </em>case was shown, there was no evidence of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>L</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1041-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
