Li argues that the I J\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence because he is eligible for asylum and withholding of removal due to his wife\u2019s involuntary sterilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">Because the IJ found that Li did not meet the statutory definition of a \u201crefugee\u201d and was, therefore, ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal even assuming that Li\u2019s testimony was credible, there are no credibility determinations at issue in this matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Assuming Li\u2019s statements to be true, the involuntary sterilization of Li\u2019s wife constituted past persecution of Li.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This created regulatory presumptions that Li had a well-founded fear of future persecution and that Li\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in China in the future.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As there was no evidence that conditions had changed in China or that Li could avoid persecution by relocating within China, the presumptions were not rebutted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Li was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-16\">While the I J\u2019s factual finding that Li left China for reasons other than the sterilization of his wife was supported by substantial evidence, his legal conclusion that Li did not meet the statutory definition of refugee for this reason was erroneous. The statutory definition of refugee does not require Li to have left China for any particular reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the IJ did not make any finding regarding Li\u2019s reasons for being unwilling to return to China, the court need not consider whether such a finding is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, Li was not required to demonstrate \u201ccompelling reasons for being unwilling to return resulting from the severity of the past persecution unless the presumption under 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i) ha[d] been rebutted by the [INS].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the Id\u2019s determinations that Li was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal were based upon an error of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of Li\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal is REVERSED and this matter is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
