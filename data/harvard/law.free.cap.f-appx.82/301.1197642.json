Brown appeals the judgment of the district court convicting him of possession with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000). On appeal, Brown claims that the Government produced insufficient evidence of its informant\u2019s reliability to support its search warrant. As noted by Brown in his brief, this court has previously addressed the reliability of informants with respect to controlled purchases of narcotics and found such use entirely appropriate. <em>See United States v. Clyburn, </em>24 F.3d 613, 618 (4th Cir.1994). Moreover, we find Brown\u2019s attempts to distinguish the facts of his case from <em>Clybum </em>to be unpersuasive. Accordingly, we affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
