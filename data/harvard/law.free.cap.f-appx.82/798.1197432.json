We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-25\">A determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld unless that determination is \u201cmanifestly contrary to law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). This Court will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio, </em>979 F.2d at 999 (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-26\">We find the evidence does not compel a finding that Makonnen established either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>The standard for receiving withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Makonnen failed to establish entitlement to asylum, she cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
