The district court sentenced Robinson to 96 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. Counsel has moved to withdraw on appeal pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief challenging the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Robinson at the top of the Guidelines range. Robinson has not filed a supplemental pro se brief. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Specifically, Robinson\u2019s sentence is within an unchallenged Guidelines range based on unobjected-to information in the presentence report, and thus the sentence is not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Smotherman, </em>326 F.3d 988, 989 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (holding appeals court lacks jurisdiction to review sentencing court\u2019s exercise of discretion in setting sentence within Guidelines range), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 293, 157 L.Ed.2d 203 (2003); <em>United States v. Woodrwm, </em>959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (holding sentence is not reviewable merely because it is at top end of properly calculated Guidelines range). Further, we have carefully reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">Thus, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-12\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
