Garcia-Gonzalez argues that the district court erred by enhancing his base offense level sixteen levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii), based on a determination that his prior conviction for transporting an unlawful alien was an alien smuggling offense committed for profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">In <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164, 167-68 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 123 S.Ct. 1811, 155 L.Ed.2d 689 (2003), this court held that the term \u201calien smuggling offense,\u201d as used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) includes the offense of transporting aliens within the United States. Accordingly, the district court did not err in sentencing Garcia-Gonzalez under that guideline. Garcia-Gonzalez concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Solis-Campozano. </em>He raises the issue solely to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief. In its motion, the Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The motion is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
