After Allstate refused to settle, Seay recovered a damages award substantially in excess of the Greenidges\u2019 insurance coverage. The Greenidges subsequently instituted a suit against Allstate in New York state court for bad faith refusal to settle, and the suit was removed to the District Court for the Southern District of New York based on diversity of citizenship. Before discovery began, Seay moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the action in order to protect her interest, as judgment creditor of the Greenidges, in the outcome of the action. Seay moved both for intervention as a matter of right, Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2), and for permissive intervention, Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b)(2). The district court denied Seay\u2019s motion in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-24\">A motion to intervene as of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) must be granted if the applicant (1) timely files an application, (2) shows an interest in the action, (3) demonstrates that the interest may be impaired, and (4) shows that the interest is not adequately protected by the parties to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>action. <em>New York News, Inc. v. Kheel, </em>972 F.2d 482, 485 (2d Cir.1992). Moreover, the \u201cinterest\u201d asserted must be \u201cdirect,\u201d as opposed to \u201ccontingent.\u201d <em>Restor-A-Dent Dental Labs., Inc. v. Certified Alloy Prods., Inc., </em>725 F.2d 871, 874 (2d Cir. 1984). If any one of these four elements is lacking, the application for intervention as of right may be denied. <em>In re Bank of New York Derivative Litig., </em>320 F.3d 291, 300 (2d Cir.2003). The district court based its decision to deny Seay\u2019s motion on its conclusions that prongs (2) and (4) of Kheel\u2019s gloss of the rule were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to intervene, whether as of right or by permission, for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Holocaust Victim Assets Litig., </em>225 F.3d 191, 197 (2d Cir.2000). Although we have some doubt about the correctness of the district court\u2019s conclusion that the appellant\u2019s interest in this case was contingent rather than direct, we conclude, upon a review of the record, that the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion in ruling that the Greenidges adequately represented Seay\u2019s interest in the litigation. This finding of adequate representation, standing alone, is sufficient to support the district court\u2019s denial of Seay\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In light of the standard of review for permissive intervention coupled with the non-mandatory language of Rule 24(b)(2), we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling against the appellant\u2019s application for permissive intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
