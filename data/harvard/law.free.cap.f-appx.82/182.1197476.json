Because the relevant facts are known to the parties they are here repeated only as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Henderson first claims that both the prosecutor and defense counsel impermissibly struck jurors from the venire on the basis of race and gender. Applying-as did the district court-the three-part test from <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 96-97, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), we conclude that the prosecutor offered legitimate, neutral justifications for striking three of the jurors. The trial court in this case carefully considered these justifications and found them to be genuine. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s justifications have been deemed valid by both California and federal courts. The trial court\u2019s conclusion can be reversed only if it was clearly erroneous. <em>See McClain v. Prunty, </em>217 F.3d 1209, 1220 (9th Cir.2000). And because we review this petition under the standard prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Henderson\u2019s claim can only succeed if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>See Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1174-75, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). We agree with the district court\u2019s ruling that the trial court\u2019s conclusions were neither clearly erroneous nor objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">With regard to Henderson\u2019s claim that a fourth juror, Louise Toboroff, was struck because of her gender, we do not agree with the district court that this claim was waived because no person-specific <em>Batson </em>objection was made at trial. Under California law, a <em>Batson </em>objection to a pattern of discriminatory challenges is timely if made before jury impanelment is completed; the general objection relates back to jurors dismissed earlier in the jury selection process. <em>See People v. McDermott, </em>28 Cal.4th 946, 969, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 654, 51 P.3d 874 (2002); <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>827 F.2d 1254, 1257 (9th Cir.1987) (permitting objection raised after jury was sworn because it \u201cmight not have been apparent until the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>selected, so the objection could not, in any case, have been raised much earlier\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Even though Henderson\u2019s objection to Toboroff was timely, however, the California Supreme Court has not further required prosecutors to provide individual neutral justifications for jurors included in the general objection. <em>See McDermott, </em>28 Cal.4th at 980, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 654, 51 P.3d 874 (\u201cAlthough we agree that it is generally preferable to have individual reasons and individual findings for each challenged juror, we have never required them.\u201d). Moreover, because Henderson\u2019s claim is a novel one under federal law, it was not \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d for the California Court of Appeal to conclude that the prosecutor was not required to offer a gender-neutral justification for Toboroff s exclusion in the absence of a person-specific objection. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Andrade, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1174-75. And the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination under the third step of the <em>Batson </em>inquiry that Henderson had not established purposeful discrimination by the prosecution is a factual finding presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence under AEDPA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 769, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (purposeful discrimination inquiry under <em>Batson </em>results in a factual finding by state trial court). Henderson has not proffered such evidence of purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Henderson\u2019s argument that his defense counsel\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges violated <em>Batson </em>must also fail. In this case, the issue was not preserved for appeal because the prosecutor withdrew her <em>Batson </em>motions without objection from defense counsel. And even had these objections been preserved, there is no clearly established Supreme Court precedent holding that a defense counsel\u2019s <em>Bat-son </em>violations warrant reversal of a conviction. The authority cited by Henderson, <em>Georgia v. McCollum, </em>505 U.S. 42, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992), stands only for the proposition that prosecutors may assert a <em>Batson </em>challenge to a defense counsel\u2019s use of peremptory challenges. <em>Id. </em>at 56. But <em>McCollum </em>does not discuss the potential remedy for a defense counsel\u2019s <em>Batson </em>violation, and thus cannot be said to have clearly established that any such violation warrants a new trial. Because AEDPA\u2019s standard of review controls here, this claim fails because the trial court\u2019s conclusion did not involve an unreasonable application of \u201cclearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Henderson next alleges prosecutorial misconduct. At trial, Henderson claimed that he fled from officers because he believed that he was subject to an outstanding parole warrant. In her closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the fact that no evidence had been introduced regarding the existence of this warrant. Even assuming that this remark was somehow improper, we conclude that it does not rise to the level of misconduct constituting a due process violation. The trial court interrupted the prosecutor at the behest of defense counsel before she completed the offending remark, and later instructed the jury not to consider statements of counsel as evidence. In light of the significant evidence of Henderson\u2019s guilt presented to the jury, the prosecutor\u2019s comment cannot be said to have \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resultant conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Henderson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>was not unfairly prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Finally, Henderson claims that his trial counsel was ineffective. We disagree. Henderson has not demonstrated prejudice from either his trial counsel\u2019s allegedly improper use of peremptory challenges or his failure to stipulate to the element of intent in order to prevent the introduction of other crimes evidence. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). And trial counsel\u2019s choice not to introduce evidence of an outstanding parole warrant was a reasonable tactical decision that cannot be the basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Hensley v. Crist, </em>67 F.3d 181, 185 (9th 0.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Henderson\u2019s petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
