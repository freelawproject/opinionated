Pauley III, <em>Judge) </em>granting the defendant-appellee police and city officials\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissing the complaint in its entirety. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-22\">By amended complaint dated May 1, 2001, Martinez asserted four causes of action against defendants-appellees: (1) retaliation in violation of the First Amendment (against her supervisor, Director Lucia Raiford); (2) deprivation of \u201csubstantive due process liberty interests\u201d in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (against all defendants); (3) retaliation in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments (against two of the individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>al defendants and the City of New York); and (4) retaliation in violation of New York Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b (against all defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The district court found that, drawing all justifiable inferences in favor of Martinez, there was no genuine issue of material fact necessitating a trial and that Martinez\u2019s claims must fail. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Smith ex rel. Estate of Smith v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, </em>346 F.3d 264, 267 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Martinez\u2019s retaliation claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments fail, as does her New York civil rights claim, from the absence of evidence of causation. The undisputed evidence shows that Raiford told Martinez of her intent to effect a transfer <em>before </em>Martinez\u2019s mother lodged a complaint on her daughter\u2019s behalf. Accordingly, the transfer could not have been caused by the complaint. Similarly, the memorandum dated December 9, 1999, which set forth Raiford\u2019s recommendation that Martinez be transferred and which Martinez seeks to characterize as a \u201creprimand,\u201d pre-dated the December 10 complaint lodged by Martinez\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Martinez\u2019s due process claim is equally unmeritorious. As the district court correctly noted, there is no evidence whatever to suggest that anyone hid evidence from the court or tried to influence witnesses\u2019 testimony. Moreover, the allegations concerning defendants-appellees\u2019 defamatory tactics cannot support a due process claim because Martinez has failed to adduce any evidence that the alleged defamation \u201cwas coupled with a deprivation of a legal right or status.\u201d <em>Abramson v. Pataki, </em>278 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir.2002). Martinez was transferred between precincts, but suffered no demotion or reduction in pay. Finally, insofar as her prospective employment with the United States Secret Service was concerned, Martinez had no right to obtain that employment and, accordingly, cannot sustain her constitutional claim. <em>See Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 234, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (holding that damage to reputation, even if coupled with impairment of \u201cfuture employment prospects,\u201d is not alone sufficient to establish a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Because we find that Martinez failed to adduce any evidence of deprivation of a legal right or status, we need not reach her argument that the district court erred in relying on a redacted version of a Secret Service document. Even if the redacted portions were defamatory, Martinez\u2019s claim would still fail for want of a deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
