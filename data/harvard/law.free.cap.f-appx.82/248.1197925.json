Williams was sentenced principally to 211 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">On appeal, Williams argues that (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements obtained through electronic surveillance on the ground that the application for the eavesdropping warrant failed to establish that normal investigative procedures had been tried and failed or were reasonably unlikely to succeed or to be too dangerous; (2) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained through a pole surveillance camera; (3) the search warrant issued for Williams\u2019s residence was not supported by probable cause; and (4) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained through a search warrant because there was an insufficient basis to issue a warrant allowing a \u201cno knock, anytime\u201d search.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">We reject these arguments for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s July 1, 2002 Memorandum Decision and Order. The application for an eavesdropping warrant sufficiently established that while investigators had achieved some success using normal investigative procedures, such procedures were reasonably unlikely to succeed if tried or too dangerous to employ to obtain evidence sufficient to meet the investigation\u2019s objective of discovering all of the buyers, sellers, and participants in this \u201clarge scale\u201d drug conspiracy. <em>See </em>N.Y.Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 700.15(4) and 700.20(2)(d); <em>United States v. Torres, </em>901 F.2d 205, 230-32 (2d Cir.1990) (finding similar allegations to satisfy federal requirements under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518); <em>United States v. Lilia, </em>699 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>F.2d 99, 102 (2d Cir.1983) (holding that federal and New York state requirements for wiretaps are the same).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Williams waived his right to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained through a pole surveillance camera because that issue was not one of the two expressly preserved for appeal in Williams\u2019 plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Arango, </em>966 F.2d 64, 66 (2d Cir.1992). Accordingly, Williams\u2019s appeal of this issue is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Finally, the application for a search warrant established both (i) probable cause to search Williams\u2019s residence, and (ii) reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the conspiracy would be destroyed or removed and that knocking and announcing their presence would be dangerous to the officers conducting the search, thereby justifying issuance of a \u201cno knock, anytime\u201d warrant. <em>See </em>N.Y.Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 690.35(4)(a) and (b); <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 394-95, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997); <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <em>United States v. Pforzheimer, </em>826 F.2d 200, 202-04 (2d Cir.1987); <em>People v. Ackerman, </em>237 A.D.2d 849, 654 N.Y.S.2d 876, 877 (App. Div.1997). Moreover, even if the \u201cno-knock, anytime\u201d authorization were improper, no constitutional violations resulted because the warrant was executed during the daytime and when no one was home.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
