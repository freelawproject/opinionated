He argues: (1) that the district court erred in denying him a reduction in his total offense level based on his minor role in the offense and (2) that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 952 and 960 are facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Gomez concedes that his second argument is foreclosed but nevertheless raises the issue to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">The district court did not clearly err in determining that Gomez was not entitled to a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). <em>See United States v. Zuniga, </em>18 F.3d 1254, 1261 (5th Cir.1994). Gomez did not demonstrate that he was peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-23\">Gomez\u2019s argument regarding the constitutionality of the statutes of conviction is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b910-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
