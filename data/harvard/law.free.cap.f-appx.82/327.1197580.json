This Court reviews a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">First, Ross argues the district court deprived him of his constitutional rights by conducting his supervised release revocation hearing before the conclusion of related state court criminal proceedings. Second, Ross argues the district court erred by determining the grade of his violation based on its assessment of his offense conduct, asserting the district court should have based its conclusions on Ross\u2019 related state court criminal proceeding. These claims are meritless. A defendant\u2019s violation of supervised release terms allows for revocation, regardless of whether his violation subjects him to state court proceedings. Additionally, the grade of the defendant\u2019s violation is based on his conduct. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.1, comment. (n.l) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Third, Ross argues the district court erred by relying on incredible testimony to find he violated supervised release through conduct constituting malicious wounding. This claim is meritless. Witness credibility is not subject to appellate review. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Fourth, Ross asserts the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for bond reveals the district court violated his due process rights by adjudging him guilty before conducting his supervised release revocation hearing. This claim is meritless. The record reveals the district court\u2019s order denying bond was appropriate, and Ross fails to establish any violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment revoking Ross\u2019 supervised release. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
