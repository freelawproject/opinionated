Califor</em>nia, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). McCrary has filed a \u201cMotion to Find Legal Points Arguable on the Merits,\u201d which is treated, in part, as a motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. The FPD\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, the FPD is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Because there is no nonfrivolous issue for appeal, McCrary\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>Cf. United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">We decline to address the ineffective assistance claims raised by McCrary in this proceeding. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998). Our decision is without prejudice to McCrary\u2019s right to assert such claims in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">ANDERS MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
