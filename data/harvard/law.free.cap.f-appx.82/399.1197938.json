Payton, Mississippi inmate # 65110, appeals the dismissal of his civil rights complaint, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Payton has filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and/or in the alternative, for a Temporary Restraining Order. Payton asks this court to enjoin the Mississippi Department of Corrections from moving him to another prison unit in retaliation for his filing the instant lawsuit. Payton\u2019s motion is DENIED. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1275-76 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">Payton argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Payton\u2019s allegation that prison officials were negligent for failing to place slip guards and guard rails in the showers where he is housed fails to state a claim because a claim for negligence does not establish an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Payton\u2019s allegation that prison officials failed to provide adequate medical treatment fails to state a claim because mere dissatisfaction with medical treatment does not rise to a constitutional violation. <em>See id. </em>Last, Payton\u2019s allegation that prison officials failed to comply with Mississippi state law when they overcharged him for medical treatment he received fails to state a claim inasmuch as a prison official\u2019s failure to follow state regulations does not establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1251-52 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-21\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the present case and this court\u2019s affirmance of the dismissal count as one strike against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Payton for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Pay-ton is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes he will be barred from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">AFFIRMED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
