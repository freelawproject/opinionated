Friend pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement to conspiracy to interfere with interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (2000), and carjacking, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 (2000). Thereafter, Friend pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement to a separate incident of carjacking. Both carjackings resulted in the deaths of the victims, and Friend received two life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that Friend has not made the requisite showing. We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
