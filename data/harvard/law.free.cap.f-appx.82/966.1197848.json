California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Esparza has filed a response to counsel\u2019s motion in which he argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The record has not been adequately developed for us to consider on direct appeal Esparza\u2019s argument that trial counsel was ineffective. <em>See United States v. Haese, </em>162 F.3d 359, 363-64 (5th Cir.1998). Our independent review of the briefs and the record discloses no nonfrivolous appellate issue. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
