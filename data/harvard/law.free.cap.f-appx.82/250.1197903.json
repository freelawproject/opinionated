Trager, Judge) holding him in contempt of court for failure to comply with a court order directing him to respond to a subpoena <em>ad testificandum. </em>We vacate and remand for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Doe represents an accountant (\u201cAccountant\u201d) whose records were subpoenaed in connection with a grand jury investigation. When, in November 2002, the Accountant produced only a small number of documents in response to the subpoena, Doe explained to the government that the Accountant had a policy of returning records to his clients promptly upon completing any necessary accounting work.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">Several months later, on March 18, 2003, the government executed a search warrant at the Accountant\u2019s offices. The search yielded a large volume of documents that would have been responsive to the earlier subpoena had they been in the Accountant\u2019s possession at that time. Following the search, Doe repeated to the government, both orally and in writing, that the Accountant did not keep his clients\u2019 records, but rather received them only when necessary to perform accounting work and returned them upon completion of such work. This representation was tendered as an explanation for the disparity between the number of documents that the Accountant had produced voluntarily in November 2002 and the number seized by the government several months later. However, when asked whether the Accountant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>was the source of the record-keeping explanation, Doe refused to answer on the ground that an answer would breach the attorney-client privilege. The government thereupon served Doe with a subpoena <em>ad testificandum </em>requiring him to appear before the grand jury to repeat the explanation that he had proffered to the government and to reveal the source of that explanation. Doe moved the district court to quash the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The district court, after having heard extensive oral argument but without having conducted an evidentiary hearing, ordered that Doe comply with the subpoena. Although the court found that the government had \u201cestablished a basis for the crime fraud exception,\u201d it did not explain how it had arrived at this conclusion. Doe appeared before the grand jury on July 7, 2003, but refused to answer questions about communications made to him by the Accountant. That same day, the district court issued an order holding Doe in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its contempt order for abuse of discretion. <em>Perez v. Danbury Hosp., </em>347 F.3d 419, 423 (2d Cir.2003). However, where the district court has not made any express factual findings and the record is insufficiently developed to permit meaningful review, the appropriate course is to vacate and remand for further findings. <em>See, e.g., Knox v. Salinas, </em>193 F.3d 123, 125 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The problem we face in this case is that the district court did not explain the basis for its conclusion that the suspected communication \u2014 namely, the record-keeping explanation \u2014 fell within the so-called \u201ccrime-fraud\u201d exception to the attorney-client privilege. The crime-fraud exception applies when there is probable cause to believe that: (1) a fraud or crime has been committed; and (2) the communication in question was intended to further the fraud or crime. <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>117 F.3d 82, 87-88 (2d Cir.1997). Although the record reflects that there was probable cause to believe that the Accountant engaged in obstruction of justice, it is much less clear on the issue of whether the suspected communication to counsel was intended to further the alleged obstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Specifically, the record contains little indication of the Accountant\u2019s intent in making the suspected communication. If he had simply told counsel about his record-keeping practices without ever intending that that information be conveyed to third parties, it is difficult to see how the communication could have furthered the obstruction. On the other hand, if he intended that Doe convey the record-keeping explanation to the government and thus made his communication to counsel in furtherance of the obstruction, then the crime-fraud exception might very well apply to this limited situation. <em>See In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Duces Tecum, </em>798 F.2d 32, 34 (2d Cir.1986) (crime-fraud exception applies only \u201cwhere there is probable cause to believe that the particular communication with counsel ... was <em>intended in some way to facilitate or to conceal the criminal activity\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Because the district court made no explicit findings concerning the manner in which the supposed communication was intended to further the Accountant\u2019s obstruction of justice, and because the record is insufficiently developed for this court to review the basis for the district court\u2019s conclusion, we vacate and remand for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Finally, the district court need not cause a breach of the asserted attorney-client privilege in making its findings because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>any confidences can be preserved by proceeding <em>in camera </em>where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
