(\u201cthe Hotel\u201d) in a case alleging employment discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 951 <em>et seq. </em>Immigration and Nationality Act, \u00a7 101 et seq., 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 et seq.(\u201cPHRA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">After a thorough analysis of the summary judgment record, the District Court concluded that Ms. Mahramas\u2019 claim of discriminatory discharge failed because Ms. Mahramas failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. Specifically, the Court held that Ms. Mahramas failed to establish she was terminated under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. In addition, the Court concluded that she failed to establish that the Hotel\u2019s reasons for dismissing her were pretextual. Although Ms. Mahramas contests these holdings on appeal, we agree with the District Court and therefore affirm the order of the District Court regarding the claim of gender discrimination for essentially the reasons given in the District Court\u2019s Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">The District Court likewise rejected the plaintiffs claim of retaliatory discharge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>because Ms. Mahramas failed to establish her <em>prima facie </em>case. Specifically, the Court held that Ms. Mahramas failed to establish a causal link between the activities she identified as protected and her termination. We agree with this analysis and therefore affirm this aspect of the District Court\u2019s order for essentially the reasons set out in the District Court\u2019s Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s arguments, but we conclude that the order of the District Court should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
