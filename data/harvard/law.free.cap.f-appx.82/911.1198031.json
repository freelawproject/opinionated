Blacklock argues that the prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his need for protection from the other inmates. Blacklock further alleges that Thomas Boughner and Norma Saenz violated his civil rights by reducing his classification status, placing him on restriction, and failing to interview witnesses in connection with a disciplinary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>Blacklock has not stated a cognizable claim for relief by showing both that the conditions of his incarceration posed \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm\u201d and that prison officials exhibited deliberate indifference to his need for protection. <em>Newton v. Black, </em>133 F.3d 301, 308 (5th Cir. 1998). Blacklock fails to state a constitutional claim arising out of the disciplinary hearing. <em>See Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999). The district court did not err in dismissing Blacklock\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Because Blacklock\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, it is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Blacklock\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim count as strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Blacklock previously earned two strikes in <em>Blacklock v. Hamilton, </em>No. 97-10304 (5th Cir. Oct.21, 1997) (dismissing as frivolous an appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous), and he was cautioned in that opinion that future frivolous civil suits and appeals filed by him would invite the imposition of sanctions. Because Blacklock has accumulated at least three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he is BARRED from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b953-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
