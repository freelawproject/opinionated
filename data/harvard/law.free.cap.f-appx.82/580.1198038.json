(\u201cLVSI\u201d) for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. LVSI cross-appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing its claim for breach of contract and its claim for tortious interference with economic advantage, to the extent that tort claim is predicated upon Culinary\u2019s lobbying activities. We have jurisdiction over these consolidated appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). We reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Culinary\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of the implied covenant claim, and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of LVSI\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">We first address a portion of LVSI\u2019s cross-appeal: the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim. We review de novo the district court\u2019s construction and interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d). <em>See Carpenters Health and Welfare Trust Fund v. Bla-Delco Constr. Inc., </em>8 F.3d 1365, 1367 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">Section 22.01 of the CBA prohibits Culinary from interfering with the \u201cEmployer\u2019s business.\u201d The district court interpreted the \u201cEmployer\u2019s business\u201d to mean the Sands Hotel Casino (\u201cthe Sands\u201d). It also determined that Culinary\u2019s campaign was directed only against the Venetian. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">The first relevant document pertaining to the interpretation of the phrase \u201cEmployer\u2019s business\u201d is the Memorandum of Agreement amending the prior CBA and extending the term through May 1997. In that Memorandum, the \u201cEmployer\u201d is defined as \u201cLas Vegas Sands, Inc. d/b/a Sands Hotel Casino.\u201d The designation \u201cd/ b/a\u201d (or \u201cdoing business as\u201d) is a descriptive term identifying the <em>business </em>of LVSI. If LVSI operated several businesses, those other businesses would not have been included under the d/b/a Sands Hotel designation. The d/b/a designation limits the meaning of Employer to LVSI in its capacity as owner and operator of the Sands.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">Next, \u00a7 4.01 of the CBA authorizes Culinary\u2019s representatives to enter the \u201cEmployer\u2019s establishment\u201d to communicate with its members about union business. The section goes on to state that \u201c[sjuch visits shall not interfere with the conduct of the Employer\u2019s business.... \u201d This section is useful because, like \u00a7 22.01, it uses the term \u201cEmployer\u2019s business.\u201d The \u201cbusiness\u201d here clearly means operation of the Sands.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-17\">Perhaps most significant is \u00a7 28.01 of the CBA, which is read together with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>appended Side Letter Agreement. Section 28.01 broadly defines the term \u201cEmployer\u201d to include subsidiaries and other entities under LVSI\u2019s control. The Side Letter Agreement establishes a \u201cprocedure ... to avoid picketing and/or other economic action directed at the Employer in the event the Union decides to conduct an organizing campaign at any operation (at which the Union does not have representation rights) covered by Section 28.01....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Taken by itself, \u00a7 28.01 might suggest that the parties intended the \u201cEmployer\u201d (and thus the \u201cEmployer\u2019s business\u201d) to encompass a broad scope. However, read together with the Side Letter Agreement, it becomes clear that the relevant provisions of \u00a7 22.01 pertain only to interference with the Sands. Otherwise, the Side Letter Agreement\u2019s prohibition of picketing and other economic activity at <em>other </em>Employer facilities would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">LVSI argues that the Side Letter Agreement is not probative because it established a procedure for an organizational card check campaign, a circumstance not addressed by \u00a7 22.01. However, the Side Letter Agreement explicitly states that among its purposes is \u201cto <em>avoid picketing and/or other economic action </em>directed at the Employer in the event the Union decides to conduct an organizing campaign ...\u201d (emphasis added). Since picketing was already prohibited by \u00a7 22.01 (regardless of Culinary\u2019s motive), the Side Letter Agreement necessarily suggests that Culinary could otherwise have picketed at establishments other than the Sands.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">While the district court relied on the above provisions, other instances in the CBA of the term \u201cEmployer\u2019s business\u201d confirm the district court\u2019s interpretation. For example, \u00a7 23.01 provides that \u201c[t]he right to manage the <em>Employer\u2019s business </em>and the direction of its employees ... are reserved to the Employer\u201d (emphasis added). Examples of the Employer\u2019s business include \u201cthe right to direct, plan and control operations, to determine the number of employees to be employed, and to determine the means, methods and schedules of operations.\u201d This suggests \u201cbusiness\u201d means hotel and casino operation, not real estate development. Similarly, \u00a7 28.01 requires the Employer to give advance notice and to honor its payment obligations \u201c[i]n the event the Employer sells or assigns its business.\u201d The sale of unrelated businesses by LVSI would clearly not trigger the notice and payment requirement here. As in \u00a7 22.01, the parties did not deem it necessary to specify which \u201cbusiness\u201d because LVSI had only one business covered by the CBA \u2014 the Sands.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The district court also determined that extrinsic evidence weighed in favor of its interpretation. LVSI contends that the use of extrinsic evidence by the district court was improper. Generally, Nevada\u2019s parol evidence rule bars the use of extrinsic evidence when the terms of a contract are unambiguous. <em>Crow-Spieker No. 23 v. Robinson, </em>97 Nev. 302, 629 P.2d 1198, 1199 (1981). We need not determine whether use of extrinsic evidence was proper here because the same interpretation would obtain even without the introduction of parol evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">LVSI further argues that even if \u201cEmployer\u2019s business\u201d means the Sands, Culinary interfered with the Sands itself. LVSI\u2019s argument is unconvincing because all of the union\u2019s activities were directed against the Venetian, not the Sands. LVSI cites letters sent to potential investors and customers that specifically named the Sands. The earliest of these letters, however, was sent after the Sands announced its closure and only six days before the Sands shut its doors. Other letters were sent after the Sands was demolished and its business ceased to exist. The references in these letters to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201cSands Hotel\u201d served merely to identify the yet-unnamed resort and yet-unknown owner in Culinary's campaign against the Venetian.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that \u201cEmployer\u2019s business\u201d as used in \u00a7 22.01 of the CBA refers only to the Sands, and that Culinary did not violate this provision in its campaign against the Venetian. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Culinary on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We next turn to Culinary\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to compel arbitration. We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination of the scope of an arbitration clause and its denial of a motion to compel arbitration. <em>Ingle v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1165, 1169 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Moore v. Local 569 of Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>53 F.3d 1054, 1055 (9th Cir.1995). The CBA specifically exempts \u201c[a]ny violation or alleged violation of Section 22.01\u201d from arbitration. The district court held that LVSI\u2019s claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is exempt from arbitration because it is encompassed by \u00a7 22.01. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">An implied covenant claim necessarily arises from more than a singular contract provision. In <em>Teamsters Local 216 v. Granite Rock, </em>851 F.2d 1190, 1193 (9th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied </em>488 U.S. 986, 109 S.Ct. 543, 102 L.Ed.2d 573 (1988), we held that an implied covenant claim was subject to a CBA arbitration clause \u201c[bjecause the parties\u2019 dispute clearly involves the proper interpretation of the agreement!.]\u201d Issues such as the nature of the contractual relationship and what the parties expected from one another as fair treatment are relevant to this inquiry. Because the implied covenant claim implicates the entire CBA, arbitration is the proper forum for its resolution. The fact that the implied covenant claim is related to the \u00a7 22.01 claim does not preclude its arbitrability. The Supreme Court rejected the so-called \u201cintertwinement\u201d doctrine in <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 221-24, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Moreover, \u201c[a]n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 582-583, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960). The only non-arbitrable claim under the CBA is for \u201cviolation or alleged violation of Section 22.01.\u201d This does not preclude arbitration of the breach of implied covenant claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">LVSI also argues that Culinary waived its right to arbitration because it did not first invoke the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure described in the CBA. We disagree. \u201c[T]he question of arbitrability\u2014 whether a collective-bargaining agreement creates a duty for the parties to arbitrate the particular grievance \u2014 is undeniably an issue for judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. v. Communications Workers of Am., </em>475 U.S. 643, 649, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986). LVSI\u2019s waiver argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">We turn now to LVSI\u2019s cross-appeal of the district court\u2019s entry of partial summary judgment against it on its tortious interference claim. The district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Culinary to the extent LVSI\u2019s claims were based on Culinary\u2019s lobbying activity. Such activity, according to the district court, was immune from civil liability under the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>LVSI argues that <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>immunity should not apply to Culinary\u2019s lobbying efforts because (1) Culinary\u2019s lobbying efforts were a \u201csham,\u201d and (2) Culinary waived its <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>immunity by agreeing to \u00a7 22.01 of the CBA, the non-interference clause. Because we have decided that \u00a7 22.01 precluded campaigning only against the Sands, not against the Venetian, the LVSI\u2019s waiver argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">LVSI\u2019s sham contention also fails. For a plaintiff to succeed in invoking the sham exception to defeat <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>immunity, a plaintiff must plead with specificity the \u201csham-ful\u201d nature of the alleged interference. \u201c[W]hen a plaintiff seeks damages for conduct which is prima facie protected by the First Amendment, the danger that the mere pendency of the action will chill the exercise of First Amendment rights requires more specific allegations than would otherwise be required.\u201d <em>Kottle v. Northwest Kidney Ctrs., </em>146 F.3d 1056, 1063 (9th Cir.1998), quoting <em>Franchise Realty Interstate Corp. v. San Francisco Local Joint Executive Bd. of Culinary Workers, </em>542 F.2d 1076, 1083 (9th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">LVSI\u2019s allegations fall short of the required specificity. LVSI alleged that Culinary appeared before the Clark County Board of Commissioners (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to oppose LVSI\u2019s applications for various permits and approvals, but does not specify what information Culinary presented to the Board, whether the Board in fact rejected LVSI\u2019s permit applications, whether Culinary was alone in opposing the permit applications, or whether Culinary\u2019s grounds for opposing the permit applications were false or \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">At oral argument before this court, LVSI contended that it raised sufficiently specific allegations to invoke the sham exception at the district court\u2019s summary judgment hearing. At that hearing, however, LVSI <em>conceded </em>that Culinary\u2019s lobbying activity would be protected by <em>NoerrPennington; </em>its argument was that Culinary, in \u00a7 22.01 of the CBA, waived its right to lobby. <em>See </em>District Court Hearing Transcript of hearing held April 8, 1999, at page 24 (\u201cOur position, as expressed in our brief, I think it\u2019s pretty clear is that if they had the right to lobby, <em>and they did, everybody does, </em>they waived it, they gave it up as part of the contract ....\u201d) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment. The appellant and the appellee shall each bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
