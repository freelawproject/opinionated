He argues that there was insufficient evidence in the aiding and abetting conviction to prove that Silva shared in the criminal intent of principal Marco Blancas and that Silva took a substantial step toward accomplishing the criminal venture (although aiding and abetting requires Silva merely to have acted in some affirmative manner designed to aid the venture), and that there was insufficient evidence in the conspiracy conviction to prove that Silva knowingly entered into the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-24\">Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, there is sufficient evidence to support both convictions. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>975 F.2d 159, 160-61 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>145 F.3d 273, 277 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v.
