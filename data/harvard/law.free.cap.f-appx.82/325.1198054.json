Henderson\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing whether the district court properly accepted Henderson\u2019s guilty plea and properly calculated his sentence. Counsel concedes, however, that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Henderson has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Neither claim presented by counsel was preserved in the district court. Therefore, they are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 526-27 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). First, Henderson asserts that the district court failed to comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting his guilty plea. Our review of the transcript of Henderson\u2019s guilty plea hearing discloses that the district court fully complied with Rule 11. Therefore, we deny relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Next, Henderson asserts that the district court erred in calculating his sentence. However, our review of the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines discloses no error. Henderson\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum and was within a properly calculated guideline range. Accordingly, we deny relief on this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm Henderson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
