R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Appellant Cyrus D.A. Braswell, federal inmate appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Braswell also requests leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal. We grant him leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The United States District Court for the District of Alaska convicted Mr. Braswell of \u201cpossession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, maintaining a place for drug trafficking, and money laundering.\u201d <em>United States v. Braswell, </em>No. 93-30198, 2000 WL 335570 (9th Cir. Mar. 30, 2000). Because Mr. Braswell is imprisoned in a federal facility in Colorado, he filed his \u00a7 2241 petition with the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In his petition, Mr. Braswell claimed the Bureau of Prisons violated his constitutional rights when it based his custody and classification level on the fact his conviction involved cocaine and marijuana, even though his criminal indictment did not specify any type or quantity of drugs. As relief, he asked the Colorado federal district court to order the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to file a motion, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)\u00a9, with the Alaska federal district court, asking it to correct the type and quantity of controlled substance used to determine his custody and classification level.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The Colorado federal district court issued an Order and Judgment of Dismissal (Order), construing Mr. Braswell\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petition liberally and denying his petition. In the Order, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYg\">The habeas corpus [petition] will be denied because Mr. Braswell cites no law that authorizes the Court to grant the relief he seeks. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)\u00ae provides that, although a court generally may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, upon motion of the Director of the [Bureau of Prisons] a court may modify a sentence if the court finds that extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The district court further noted that in filing his \u00a7 2241 petition, Mr. Braswell was \u201cnot challenging his sentence, and if he was, he could not do so in this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The district court also explained that while Mr. Braswell apparently asked the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to file a \u00a7 3582 motion in the Alaska federal district court, the statute did not authorize the Colorado federal district court \u201cto review the Director\u2019s failure or refusal to file such a motion.\u201d For these reasons, the district court denied Mr. Braswell\u2019s petition and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">On appeal, Mr. Braswell renews his constitutional due process claim, stating his prisoner custody and classification level is inaccurate because neither the indictment nor the judgment, submitted to the Bureau of Prisons by the Alaska federal district court, defines any particular type or quantity of controlled substance. Mr. Braswell suggests the district court erred in denying his petition merely \u201con grounds [h]e didn\u2019t cite case law to support his claim(s),\u201d and because it failed to properly review the facts supporting his claim. He points out that the official form, used for filing \u00a7 2241 habeas actions and provided to him by the Colorado federal district court, specifically states, \u201c[y]ou do not need to cite specific cases to support your elaim(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas corpus petition <em>de novo. See Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996). Similarly, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination as to whether it possesses jurisdiction to modify a sentence. <em>See United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997). Because Mr. Braswell is representing himself on appeal, we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). We may affirm a district court\u2019s decision denying a \u00a7 2241 petition on any grounds supported by the record. See <em>Aguilera v. Kirkpatrick, </em>241 F.3d 1286, 1290 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In understanding the district court\u2019s ruling on Mr. Braswell\u2019s request for relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, it is helpful to understand the difference between \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2255 habeas petitions, and a motion filed under \u00a7 3582. \u201cA petition [filed] under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 attacks the execution of a sentence rather than its validity and must be filed in the district where the prisoner is confined.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166. On the other hand, \u201c[a] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition attacks the legality of detention, and must be filed in the district that imposed the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). A motion filed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), is neither a direct appeal of a sentence nor a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Trujeque, </em>100 F.3d 869, 870 (10th Cir.1996). Instead, it is another statutory means, separate from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, for a district court to modify a previously imposed sentence. <em>See United States v. Mendoza, </em>118 F.3d 707, 709 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 961, 118 S.Ct. 393, 139 L.Ed.2d 307 (1997). Because a motion filed under \u00a7 3582 requests modification of a sentence, it follows that such a motion must be filed in the district court which imposed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In this case, Mr. Braswell filed his \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court where he is confined to contest the execution of his sentence based on the classification prison officials associated with the Colorado federal prison afforded him. But for relief, he sought modification of his sentence, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, in the Colorado federal district court \u2014 not the Alaska federal district court which imposed his sentence. Although we have jurisdiction to review Mr. Braswell\u2019s classification claim, neither the Colorado federal district court nor this court possesses the requisite jurisdiction to consider Mr. Braswell\u2019s request for modification of his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the district court indicated, if Mr. Braswell desires to have a court review his \u00a7 3582(c) request, he must file a \u00a7 3582 motion in the Alaska federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">While we do not have jurisdiction to consider Mr. Braswell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) request, we may review Mr. Braswell\u2019s general allegation that his classification status, which the Bureau of Prisons based on his conviction for cocaine and marijuana, is unconstitutional in violation of the Due Process Clause. In so doing, we find his allegation lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>It is well established that prisoners do not have a due process liberty interest in their classification while incarcerated. <em>See Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976); <em>Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Solomon v. Benson, </em>563 F.2d 339, 340, 342 (7th Cir.1977). As the Supreme Court pointed out, the classification of prisoners is a matter Congress delegated to the discretion of federal prison officials under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4081, and such classification implicates \u201cno legitimate statutory or constitutional entitlement sufficient to invoke due process.\u201d <em>Moody, </em>429 U.S. at 88 n. 9; <em>see also </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.95(d). This circuit has long recognized that prison security classifications are \u201ca necessary tool in the management and control of the penal and correctional institutions,\u201d and as such, lie \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the responsible administrative agency.\u201d <em>Marchesani v. McCune, </em>531 F.2d 459, 461-62 (10th Cir.1976). Because Mr. Braswell\u2019s classification does not implicate any liberty interest, the district court properly denied his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">As to the district court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he habeas corpus [petition] will be denied because Mr. Braswell cites no law that authorizes the Court to grant the relief he seeks,\u201d we find no error. In essence, the district court merely indicated that no constitutional, statutory or case law warrants granting Mr. Braswell relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s Order denying Mr. Braswell\u2019s petition and dismissing the action. As previously noted, we grant Mr. Braswell\u2019s request for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(c). The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">. Because Mr. Braswell is a federal prisoner, a certificate of appealability is not required to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 867 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\">. The statute on which Mr. Braswell relies, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), provides that a \u201ccourt may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except in [certain] limited circumstances.\u201d <em>See Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 540-41. One of those circumstances, as set out in \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i), is on motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons. <em>Id. </em>at 541. In this case, it appears the Director never filed such a motion. For the reasons described herein, we lack jurisdiction to consider Mr. Braswell's request that the Colorado federal district court order the Director to file such a motion in the appropriate Alaska court, and are unaware of any legal authority allowing this court or any court to make such a directive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
