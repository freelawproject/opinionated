He alleged that the Government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion was based on unconstitutional motives. Andrews seeks an order from this court directing the district court to make factual findings regarding his motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to compel. He also filed a motion seeking a judicial reassignment within the district court and a motion seeking to hold the petition for writ of mandamus in abeyance pending the disposition of a motion for recusal based on bias and impartiality under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 455(a) and (b)(1) (2000) that he filed in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-18\">On May 6, 2003, the district court notified Andrews of his obligation to respond to the Government\u2019s response to his motion to reconsider. Andrews filed the present petition for mandamus relief on August 4, 2003, after filing three additional pleadings in the district court. Although we grant Andrews in forma pauperis status, we deny his petition for mandamus relief because it does not appear that the district court\u2019s consideration of his motion to reconsider has been unduly delayed. We also deny Andrews\u2019s motions for judicial reassignment and for abeyance. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
