We reserved jurisdiction over this appeal. The district court has now issued at our direction a Clarification of Ruling, in which it specifies that the burglary tools were deemed inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) and 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-22\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Alatorre, </em>222 F.3d 1098, 1100 (9th Cir.2000). The district court clarified that it excluded the burglary tools because it found no logical nexus between the tools and the defendant\u2019s firearm charge. <em>See United States v. Vizcarrar-Martinez, </em>66 F.3d 1006, 1012-13 (9th Cir.1995). In addition, the court ruled that the tools could not be admitted under an exception to Rule 404(b) because their presence in Carey\u2019s car did not tend to prove a material point of the government\u2019s prosecution. <em>See United States v. Blackstone, </em>56 F.3d 1143, 1145-46 (9th Cir.1995). The court also found that the danger of potential prejudice outweighed the probative value of introducing this evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-23\">The district court\u2019s decision to exclude this evidence was not an abuse of its discretion. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude this evidence and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-24\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
