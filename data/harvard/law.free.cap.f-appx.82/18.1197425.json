R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-23\">Appellant John Richard Housel, a federal inmate appearing <em>pro se, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. His claims center on allegations of ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>tance of counsel during sentencing. We deny his request for a certificate of appeal-ability on all, but one issue, and dismiss his appeal with respect to those issues. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), we grant a certificate of appealability on the issue regarding the amount of pseudoephedrine to be applied in calculating his sentence, but nevertheless affirm the district court\u2019s decision on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Mr. Housel was charged in a six-count indictment, including offenses relating to distribution of marijuana, conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, and possession of pseudoephedrine and iodine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. In exchange for dismissal of four counts, Mr. Housel pled guilty to one count of distributing marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and one count of attempted distribution of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. In order to understand Mr. Housel\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, it is necessary to explain the types and amount of contraband involved in calculating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The specific contraband used in determining Mr. Housel\u2019s sentence included the 1,128 grams (or 1.13 kilograms) of marijuana to which he pled guilty, and the \u201crelated conduct\u201d contraband consisting of multiple chemicals he intended to use to manufacture methamphetamine, but for which he received no conviction. According to the presentencing report, Mr. Housel was attempting to use those chemicals to manufacture methamphetamine, and therefore, the base offense level in United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1 applied in calculating his sentence, rather than \u00a7 2D1.11. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.ll(c) (stating if an offense involves an attempt to manufacture controlled substances, \u00a7 2D1.1 is applied.) According to the presentencing report, the chemicals involved included an amount of iodine capable of producing 708 grams of methamphetamine, phosphorus capable of producing 1,043 grams of methamphetamine, and pseudoephedrine capable of producing 178 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Because Mr. Housel\u2019s sentence calculation involved both marijuana and chemicals used for producing methamphetamine, the probation officer who prepared the presentencing report converted a portion of the total amount of producible methamphetamine for which Mr. Housel was responsible into a total volume of marijuana. In so doing, the probation officer converted only the most abundant chemical \u2014 phosphorus \u2014 which laboratory analysis indicated could produce 1,043 grams of methamphetamine. Once the 1,043 grams was converted into marijuana, the total conversion amount consisted of 10,430 kilograms of marijuana. When added to the 1.13 kilograms of actual marijuana he possessed, the total amount of marijuana attributable to Mr. Housel in the presentencing report totaled 10,431 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The presentencing report concluded that 10,431 kilograms of marijuana results in a base offense level of 36, which together with Mr. Housel\u2019s criminal history category of III, placed him in a sentencing range of 235-293 months imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) and ch. 5, pt. A (1998 Sentencing Table). However, the presentencing report also pointed out that the offenses and statutes to which Mr. Housel pled guilty provided a maximum of only sixty months or five years imprisonment, and that the terms of imprisonment must run consecutively if the highest statutory maximum, as in this case, is less than the guideline range. <em>Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d). As a result, the presentencing report calculated the appropriate sentence range at 120 months. Mr. Housel\u2019s counsel initially filed several objections to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>presentencing report, but withdrew them at sentencing, stating they would not affect Mr. Housel\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Housel, </em>No. 00-3252, 2001 WL 557977 at *1, 9 Fed.Appx. 874 (10th Cir. May 24, 2001) (unpublished decision). The district court relied on the presentencing report, and on August 23, 2000, sentenced Mr. Housel to two sixty-month terms of imprisonment to run consecutively. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Mr. Housel filed a direct appeal challenging the calculation in the presentencing report attributing 10,431 kilograms of marijuana to him. <em>Id. </em>Because he did not raise this argument prior to sentencing, this court reviewed his claim for \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so doing, we rejected Mr. Housel\u2019s contention his conduct should have been treated as possession of a listed chemical under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11, which would result in a lesser sentencing range, rather than an attempt to manufacture a controlled substance under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. Our ruling was based on a factual determination in the presentencing report that Mr. Housel intended to manufacture methamphetamine \u2014 conduct for which U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 is applied, and for which no plain error was shown. <em>Id. </em>In addition, this court noted Mr. Housel\u2019s appeal seemed to suggest his counsel acted ineffectively in failing to raise objections to the Presentencing Report, and directed him to file a collateral proceeding if he wished to pursue those claims. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Mr. Housel filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion, raising the following ineffective assistance of counsel issues: 1) counsel failed to raise the argument his sentence should have been calculated under sentencing guideline \u00a7 2D1.11 instead of \u00a7 2D1.1; 2) counsel failed to object to the use of phosphorus, an unlisted chemical, as the basis for the converted quantity of methamphetamine used to calculate the base offense level; and 3) counsel failed to otherwise function as an effective advocate for his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Following the government\u2019s response and opposition to Mr. Housel\u2019s motion, the district court issued a \u201cMemorandum and Order Denying Motion to Vacate Sentence\u201d (Memorandum), in which it rejected Mr. Housel\u2019s arguments in support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims and dismissed his motion. Specifically, the district court determined that the sentencing judge properly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 because the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated Mr. Housel intended to use the chemicals at issue to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Next, the district court examined Mr. Housel\u2019s related claim that the sentencing court, in calculating the amount of methamphetamine attributable to him, improperly applied an unlisted chemical under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 <em>2D1.1 </em>\u2014 i.e., phosphorus, rather than one of the listed chemicals \u2014 iodine or pseudoephedrine. The government did not dispute Mr. Housel\u2019s contention that phosphorus should not have been used to calculate his sentence, but reasoned pseudoephedrine, as a listed chemical, could be used instead. The district court agreed and explained that if pseudoephedrine had been applied, instead of phosphorus, \u201cthere is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d In support, the district court relied on the presentencing report to point out that 388.8 grams of pseudoephedrine would result in 178 grams of methamphetamine, which when converted into marijuana and added to the 1.13 kilograms of marijuana, would place the base offense level at 32, resulting in a sentencing range far exceeding the 120-month statutory maximum term of imprisonment imposed. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. eh. 5, pt. A (1998 Sentencing Table) (showing applicable guideline sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>fencing range at 151-188 months of imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The district court also considered Mr. Housel\u2019s argument his counsel failed to argue Mr. Housel should only be responsible for the 250 grams of pseudoephedrine he agreed to purchase from agents, and not the 388.8 grams that agents delivered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Housel asserted that 250 grams of pseudoephedrine would produce only 95 grams of methamphetamine, placing him in a sentencing range substantially below 120 months imprisonment. The district court determined Mr. Housel\u2019s failure to challenge the presentencing report\u2019s calculation of either iodine or pseudoephedrine at trial or on direct appeal imposed a procedural bar to this ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In so concluding, the district court noted that Mr. Housel retained different counsel at trial and on appeal, and his appellate counsel failed to raise this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Finally, the district court determined counsel did not fail to function as an effective advocate based on his statements made at sentencing or his failure to move for a downward departure. After careful analysis, the district court concluded counsel\u2019s conduct, under the circumstances in the case, did not constitute ineffective performance under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984.) Accordingly, the district court dismissed Mr. Housel\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and denied his request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">On appeal, Mr. Housel renews his request for a certificate of appealability, and raises the same issues asserted in his motion and rejected by the district court. Mr. Housel contends the district court erred in determining his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, on the proper amount of pseudoephedrine used in calculating his sentence, was procedurally barred. In support, Mr. Housel relies on <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>which holds that failure to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal does not bar review in a later collateral proceeding. <em>See </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Finally, he contends the district court erred in failing to grant an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his claims. The government filed a brief opposing both Mr. Housel\u2019s appeal and request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">An appeal may not be taken from a final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding without a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). In order for a movant to be entitled a certificate of appealability, he must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cWhere a district court has rejected the constitutional claims on the merits, the showing required to satisfy \u00a7 2253(c) is straightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931(2003) (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted). When the district court dismisses a habeas motion \u201con procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a [certificate of appealability] should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">These are threshold inquiries we apply to determine whether we may entertain an appeal. <em>See Miller-El, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1039. We may perform these inquiries with \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive,\u201d analysis of the claims raised. <em>Id. </em>at 1040. In reviewing a district court\u2019s dismissal of a motion for post conviction relief, we are free to affirm a district court decision on any grounds for which there is a sufficient record, including grounds not relied on by the district court. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>137 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir. 1998). We review the denial of an evidentiary hearing on a \u00a7 2255 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whalen, </em>976 F.2d 1346, 1348 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Applying these principles, we have conducted a thorough review of the pleadings, record on appeal, and the district court\u2019s decision. Under the circumstances and record presented in this case, we conclude no hearing was warranted, and therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying a hearing on any of Mr. Housel\u2019s claims. For the purpose of judicial economy, we decline to duplicate the district court\u2019s analysis on those issues on which it addressed the merits, other than to conclude Mr. Housel clearly fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). Thus, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s January 6, 2003 Memorandum, we deny Mr. Housel\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability as to those issues and dismiss his appeal with respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">We grant a certificate of appealability on Mr. Housel\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning the amount of pseudoephedrine to be applied in calculating his sentence, which the district court determined was procedurally barred. Because we can easily resolve the issue on other grounds, we decline to remand the issue to the district court and instead directly address the merits of his claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">This circuit has held that \u201c[wjhen a defendant fails to raise a claim on direct appeal, he is barred from pursuing that claim in a later \u00a7 2255 proceeding, absent a showing of cause and actual prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice,\u201d but that \u201c[t]his bar does not apply to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir.) (quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 961, 123 S.Ct. 388, 154 L.Ed.2d 315 (2002). This is in accord with <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>which holds that failure to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal does not bar review in a later collateral proceeding. <em>See </em>123 S.Ct. at 1694, 1696. Under the circumstances presented here, it is likely that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling with respect to Mr. House\u2019s claim. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484. However, in this case, even assuming Mr. Housel\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not barred, we can easily resolve his claim on the merits and conclude he is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">In addressing Mr. Housel\u2019s claim on the merits, we must determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>failure of Mr. Housel\u2019s counsel to raise an objection to the amount of pseudoephedrine requested was deficient and if it was deficient, whether it prejudiced Mr. Housel. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687. To succeed, Mr. Housel must show \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We begin by noting that even if Mr. Housel agreed to only purchase 250 grams of pseudoephedrine, and not a total of 388.8 grams, it is unclear how he arrives at his calculation that 250 grams would produce only 95 grams of methamphetamine. Similarly, if 388.8 grams is used, it is unclear how he arrives at his calculation that 388.8 grams would, at the most, produce only 142 grams of methamphetamine, and not the 178 grams of methamphetamine calculated in the presentencing report.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so doing, he incorrectly asserts that 142 grams converted into marijuana would result in an offense level of 30, and a sentence less than the one imposed. Instead, the accurate offense level for 142 grams of methamphetamine converted to 1,420 kilograms of marijuana is 32, resulting in a sentencing range of 151-188 \u2014 well above the 120-month sentence imposed. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(4) and ch. 5, pt. A (1998 Sentencing Table). We find Mr. Housel\u2019s incorrect calculation of the base offense level, and his unsupported pseudoephedrine computations, together with his failure to provide an adequate record or references to support them, insufficient in this case to support his claim. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, </em>108 F.3d 1228, 1237 n. 8 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 847, 118 S.Ct. 132, 139 L.Ed.2d 81 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Even if the record supported Mr. Housel\u2019s claim with respect to the amount of pseudoephedrine applied, Mr. Housel\u2019s sentence would be unaffected because the methamphetamine conversion for iodine would result in the same sentence he received. Mr. Housel claims iodine is not a listed chemical under the sentencing guidelines and cannot be used to calculate his sentence. We disagree. In 1996, iodine was explicitly designated as a List II chemical in the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, Pub. L. No. 104-237, \u00a7 204, 110 Stat. 3099 (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(35)(I)). The current sentencing guidelines manual expressly categorizes iodine as a List II chemical under \u00a7 2Dl.ll(e)(2). Admittedly, iodine was not expressly Usted in \u00a7 2D1.11 of the 1998 Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u2014 the version in effect at the time of Mr. Housel\u2019s sentencing. In such a case, \u201c[i]f the offense is a felony or Class A misdemeanor for which no guidehne expressly has been promulgated, [the court must] apply the most analogous offense guideline.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1 (1997). In this case, the probation officer determined the analogous offense guideline for iodine was methamphetamine, resulting in conversion of the iodine into 708 grams of methamphetamine and then a conversion to 7,080 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Similarly, under the sentencing guidelines applicable to Mr. Housel, it is also appropriate to use 708 grams of methamphetamine to calculate his sentence, rather than the amounts of methamphetamine attributed to pseudoephedrine. This is because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11 indicates that if more than one chemical is involved, regardless of whether it is Class I or II, the court should use the one which results in the greater offense level, which in this case is 708 grams of Class II iodine rather than 250 grams of Class I pseudoephedrine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.11(d) n.(A)-(D) (1998); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2Dl.ll(e) n.(A) (2003) (providing same result).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In this case, the base offense level for 7,080 grams of marijuana is 34, placing Mr. Housel in a sentencing guideline range of 188-235 months imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) and eh.5, pt. A (1998 Sentencing Table). Thus, it is logical to conclude that if Mr. Housel\u2019s counsel had successfully objected to the use of phosphorus and the amount of pseudoephedrine to calculate his sentence, the probation officer and the sentencing court would have simply applied the most abundant statutory listed chemical \u2014 iodine\u2014to calculate his sentence, which would have resulted in an offense level higher than the offense level for the 250 grams of pseudoephedrine Mr. Housel claims is the appropriate amount. For these reasons, even if Mr. Housel\u2019s counsel had raised these objections, the sentencing range would have far exceeded the 120-month statutory maximum imposed. Given the circumstances of this case, Mr. Housel\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to raise an objection was not deficient, or if it was deficient, it did not prejudice Mr. Housel. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687. Accordingly, Mr. Housel has failed to show \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">For these reasons, Mr. Housel\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability is granted on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim concerning the use of pseudoephedrine to calculate his sentence, but for the reasons delineated here, the district court\u2019s judgment is nevertheless AFFIRMED. As to all other issues raised, we conclude Mr. Housel fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). Thus, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s January 6, 2003 Memorandum, we deny Mr. Housel\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability on those issues and DISMISS his appeal with respect to those issues.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">. In support of his argument, Mr. Housel relied on <em>United States v. Perez de Dios, </em>in which this circuit held that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1, a defendant is responsible for the quantity of cocaine he agrees to buy and not the amount the government delivers. <em>See </em>237 F.3d 1192, <em>1195 </em>(10th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. Given our agreement with the district court on Mr. Housel's ineffective assistance of counsel claim with respect to any \u201cdownward departure,\u201d we decline to entertain his assertion that any calculation of his sentence should include a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">. On appeal, Mr. Housel provides the following equation, without any explanation of how he arrived at its components: \u201c250 grams of [pseudo]ephedrine x .5 x .76 = 95 grams [methamphetamine] x 10kg marijuana = 950 kg.\u201d Apparently, \".5\" refers to a fifty percent yield rate and \".76\" to a twenty-four percent HCL salt removal rate referenced in one of his district court pleadings. But neither his appeal brief nor record references explain why these percentages are appropriate or correct. To show the possible fallacy of Mr. Housel's computations, if the above equation is applied to 388.8 grams, it results in 147.75 grams of methamphetamine, and not the 178 grams used in the presentencing report or the 142 grams Mr. Housel claims would result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
