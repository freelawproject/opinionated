For reversal Parker argues that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">In January 2000, Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Sid Canham stopped Parker\u2019s vehicle, pursuant to a law enforcement agreement between the Band and Mahnomen County, for exceeding the speed limit. According to Parker, he and Canham argued over whether Canham had jurisdiction to stop him, because the stop occurred on the Band\u2019s reservation. Canham allegedly used profanity and a racial slur, and threatened to \u201cbeat the hell out of\u2019 Parker with a club he was holding. Parker was frightened, but Canham cooled down and told Parker he would receive a ticket from the Band police.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">We agree with the district court that summary judgment was appropriate on Parker\u2019s constitutional claims against Sheriff Richard Rooney and Mahnomen County. <em>See Heisler v. Metro. Council, </em>339 F.3d 622, 626 (8th Cir.2003) (summary judgment standard of review). Parker offered no evidence that his constitutional rights were violated as a result of the Sheriff\u2019s own actions, <em>see Ottman v. City of Independence, </em>341 F.3d 751, 761 (8th Cir. 2003), and we conclude that the law enforcement agreement between the Band and Mahnomen County was not an unconstitutional policy or custom, <em>see Liebe v. Norton, </em>157 F.3d 574, 578-79 (8th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-23\">We also find that Parker did not establish a constitutional claim against Canham, because (1) Canham had authority to make a traffic stop under the law enforcement agreement and did not violate the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Amendment by stopping Parker after observing him exceeding the speed limit, <em>see United States v. Linkous, </em>285 F.3d 716, 719 (8th Cir.2002); (2) the duration of the stop was not unconstitutional, <em>see United States v. Long, </em>320 F.3d 795, 801 (8th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. $101,905.00, </em>182 F.3d 643, 647 (8th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1161, 120 S.Ct. 1175, 145 L.Ed.2d 1083 (2000); (3) there was no evidence that Canham did not stop similarly situated non-Native Americans under similar circumstances, <em>see Johnson v. City of Minneapolis, </em>152 F.3d 859, 862 (8th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1142, 119 S.Ct. 1035, 143 L.Ed.2d 43 (1999); and (4) Canham\u2019s alleged verbal threat and use of a racial epithet are not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, <em>see Hopson v. Fredericksen, </em>961 F.2d 1374, 1378 (8th Cir.1992); <em>Martin v. Sargent, </em>780 F.2d 1334, 1338 (8th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In addition, we conclude that Parker\u2019s Minnesota Human Rights Act claim was time-barred, <em>see </em>Minn.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 363.14, subd. 1(a)(1) (West 1991 &amp; Supp.2003); and Parker did not offer evidence sufficient to support his state law claims for false imprisonment and abuse of process, <em>see Guite v. Wright, </em>976 F.Supp. 866, 871 (D.Minn.1997); <em>Kittler &amp; Hedelson v. Sheehan Prop., Inc., </em>295 Minn. 232, 203 N.W.2d 835, 840 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">With regard to Parker\u2019s state law assault claim, however, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to decide whether Canham made an unlawful threat to do bodily harm with the present ability to carry the threat into effect. <em>See Dahlin v. Fraser, </em>205 Minn. 476, 288 N.W. 851, 852 (1939). Further, based upon Parker\u2019s deposition testimony, there remains a genuine issue of material fact whether Canham acted maliciously or willfully, which precludes summary judgment based upon Minnesota\u2019s official immunity doctrine, <em>see Johnson v. Morris, </em>453 N.W.2d 31, 41 (Minn.1990), and the record does not support summary judgment for the County and Sheriff Rooney on an assault claim based upon respondeat superior, <em>see </em>Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 466.02 (West 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, except with regard to Parker\u2019s state law assault claim, as to which we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
