The other petitioners\u2019 claims are all dependent upon the resolution of Abedi\u2019s claims. When, as here, the BIA summarily affirms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Abedi argues that the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for voluntary departure violated his due process rights. Abedi, however, did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for voluntary departure before the BIA. An alien\u2019s failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA serves as a jurisdictional bar to our consideration of the issue. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir. 2001). As the BIA had the power to address this claim, it does not fall under the exception to the exhaustion requirement for due process claims and we are is without jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 389-90 &amp; n. 13 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, regarding the denial of Abedi\u2019s request for voluntary departure, the petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Abedi argues that the IJ\u2019s denial of his requests for asylum and withholding of removal were not supported by substantial evidence. Because the IJ\u2019s finding that Abedi\u2019s allegations of past persecution and fear of future persecution were not credible was sufficient to support his ruling and because Abedi has not shown that the record compels a contrary conclusion, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to his credibility determination. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994). Because Abedi has not shown that he was eligible for asylum, he has not shown that he has met the stricter standards for eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 306 &amp; n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Abedi further argues that his case did not meet the BIA\u2019s requirements for issuance of an affirmance without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) and that the BIA\u2019s use of this summary affirmance procedure violated his due process rights. The due process argument is without merit. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003) (rejecting due process challenge to a similar summary affirmance procedure set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)). Because the decision of the IJ was correct and did not raise novel or substantial factual or legal questions, the decision met the criteria for a summary affirmance pursuant to \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). The remainder of the petition for review is, therefore, DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
