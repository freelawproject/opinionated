Tonchev argues that he has demonstrated evidence sufficient to receive asylum and withholding of removal based on past persecution alone. He also argues that the IJ erred in failing to articulate cogent and specific reasons for finding his testimony non-credible. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision, because the BIA adopted it as its own. Osorio <em>v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996). We review Tonchev\u2019s petition under the substantial evidence standard, and may overturn the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Tonchev\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal only if there is evidence in the record \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacharias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 484, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Abovian v. INS, </em>219 F.3d 972, 977-78 (9th Cir.2000). In reviewing the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, we recognize that \u201c[t]he immigration judge is in the best position to make credibility findings because he sees the witness as the testimony is given,\u201d although the IJ \u201cmust have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 342 (9th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We conclude that a reasonable factfinder considering this record could find that Tonchev lacked the \u201crequsite fear of persecution.\u201d Tonchev, who described a single incident of physical violence directed against him based on his ethnicity (the cause of which was ambiguous), did not demonstrate the kind of \u201catrocious persecution\u201d we have previously required to support claims for asylum based on past persecution alone. <em>See Vongsakdy v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 1203, 1205-1206 (9th Cir.1999) (describing a petitioner kept in Laotian communist reeducation camp and subjected to repeated beatings and torture). There is considerable evidence in the record, including State Department reports from 1997 and 1999, to suggest that there is no likelihood of future persecution in Bulgaria based merely on Macedonian ethnic identity or membership in OMO-Ilinden, the political group to which Tonchev belongs. Finally, we defer to the IJ\u2019s finding that Tonchev was not credible, because the IJ offered \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201ccogent\u201d reasons for finding Tonchev non-credible that bore a \u201clegitimate nexus\u201d to the credibility determination. <em>Osorio, </em>99 F.3d at 931 (internal quotation marks omitted). The IJ called into question the authenticity of a number of specific documents provided by Tonchev, he offered specific reasons for suspicion about Tonchev\u2019s account of his father\u2019s death, and he found Tonchev surprisingly ill-informed about the activities of OMO-Ilinden. Therefore, reviewing Tonchev\u2019s petition under the substantial evidence standard, we affirm the determination of the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">.
