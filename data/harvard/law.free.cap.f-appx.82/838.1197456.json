See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-19\">Zia U1 Hassan and his wife, Lubna Zia, and son, Mohammad Zia, natives and citizens of Pakistan, petition for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d). The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. For the reason discussed below, we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-22\">The immigration judge found Hassan\u2019s and his family\u2019s asylum claims were untimely and they failed to offer any explanation to demonstrate a change in circumstances or extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing of the applications for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5) (2003). We conclude we lack jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s ruling pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Castellano-Chacon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 544 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185-86 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Fahim v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-24\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-20\"> Finally, while we do not have jurisdiction to consider the denial of the asylum claims as untimely, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denials of the requests for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture as they are not subject to the one-year time limitation. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2003). However, in their brief, Hassan and his family do not specifically challenge the denial of these two forms of relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
