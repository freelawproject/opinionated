Wellons\u2019 attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that, in her view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issues of whether the district court erred in imposing a nine-month sentence and whether counsel was ineffective during the revocation proceedings. Although informed of his right to do so, Wellons has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no meritorious issues and no error by the district court, we affirm the revocation order and the nine-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-23\">In light of Wellons\u2019 admission that he committed the first alleged violation of his supervision, we find no error by the district court in revoking his supervised release and imposing a nine-month sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2003); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-24\">Wellons also contends that counsel was ineffective during the revocation proceedings. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must first be raised in the district court in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>record does not conclusively show that counsel was ineffective, we decline to address this claim at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we deny Wellons\u2019 motion for substitution of counsel and affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release and imposing a nine-month sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We deny Wellons\u2019 motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
