Although the Postal Service may not have performed the most effective examination of Clouatre, the court did not err in holding that the employer participated in the process of exploring Clouatre\u2019s condition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, as the court noted, at the time of Clouatre\u2019s termination, his mental state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>deteriorated to such an extent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the Postal Service could not have made <em>any </em>accommodation that would have allowed him to remain in his position. Consequently, the court did not err in finding that Clouatre did not produce ample evidence that he had notified the Postal Service of a needed accommodation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Thus, Clouatre failed to prove a claim under the Rehabilitation Act. Although the conduct of his supervisors is troubling,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Clouatre may not pursue his claim in this form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1014-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-19\">. The Rehabilitation Act states, in part, \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability!)] be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or ... by the United States Postal Service.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). The statute tracks the language of the Americans with Disabilities Act in determining whether a violation has occurred with regard to an employment decision. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">. Couatre displayed symptoms of depression following complications arising from the unique and substantial health problems of his daughter. After Richard Palisi became postmaster at Clouatre's station, Palisi asked his employees to take on additional workloads. Clouatre refused. Palisi and other supervisors cited Clouatre for numerous technical violations concerning the delivery of his mail; they rarely, if ever, cited other employees for similar violations. Clouatre complained of increased stress, his behavior became erratic, and he requested assistance for his deliveries. He eventually sought psychiatric treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>claim of intentional discrimination, a plaintiff must show \" '(1) he or she suffers from a disability; ,(2) he or she is qualified for the job; (3) he or she was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) he or she was replaced by a non-disabled person or was treated less favorably than non-disabled employees.'\" <em>Burch v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>119 F.3d 305, 320 (5th Cir. 1997) (quoting <em>Daigle v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., </em>70 F.3d 394, 396 (5th Cir. 1995)). As part of proving he is a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d a disabled plaintiff must illustrate that, \"with or without reasonable accommodation, [he] can perform the essential functions of the employment position [he] holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">. The court, <em>arguendo, </em>assumed that a combination of Clouatre's increasingly odd behavior and his requests to management to \u201cback off\u201d sufficed to alert his supervisors that something warranted their attention. See <em>Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., </em>184 F.3d 296, 313-14 (3d Cir.1999). Such odd behavior included switching delivery routes on a frequent basis, requesting help for routine deliveries, and substantially underperforming on the amount of mail delivered in a shift. We do not express an opinion as to whether one may notify an employer of a disability merely through actions and informal statements rather than through a more formalized declaration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">. \u201cWhere the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not ... apparent to the employer, as is often the case when mental disabilities are involved, the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee, or his health-care provider, to specifically identify the disability ... and to suggest the reasonable accommodations.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Principal Fin. Group, </em>93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir.1996). Such a notification triggers a duty on the part of the employer \u201cto participate in the interactive process of determining\u201d an accommodation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">. In certain instances, the employee's disability will be such that the employer \"may have an extra duty to explore the employee's condition.\u201d <em>Loulseged v. Akzo Nobel, Inc., </em>178 F.3d 731, 736 n. 5 (5th Cir.1999). Here, the court determined that the Postal Service, by conducting a fitness-for-duty examination of Clouatre, sufficiently explored his condition to satisfy whatever duty it may have owed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">. Shortly after Clouatre's termination, a psychiatrist who treated him diagnosed a disabling medication condition that precluded \"useful service\" in the Postal Service. Eventually, in interviews with a psychiatrist, Clouatre made threatening statements against some of his former supervisors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1016-18\">. We review the court's findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Coggin v. Longview Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>289 F.3d 326, 330 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">. The court stated that \"[m]uch of the behavior directed toward [Clouatre] was unjust and inhumane.... This, however, does not bring plaintiff under the protection of the Rehabilitation Act.\u201d Because he is a federal employee, Clouatre may not sue under the Federal Tort Claims Act or similar state tort statutes. See, <em>e.g., Bennett v. Barnett, </em>210 F.3d 272, 277 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that a postal employee\u2019s emotional distress claims brought against the Postal Service, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, were preempted by the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act); <em>Rollins v. Marsh, </em>937 F.2d 134, 138-40 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that Civil Service Reform Act precluded suit under Federal Tort Claims Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
