He was sentenced to 135 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Hansen\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising only the issue of whether Hansen received ineffective assistance of counsel in relation to his guilty plea and stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Though notified of his opportunity to do so, Hansen did not file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">In addition to the one issue raised by appellate counsel, pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hansen\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b892-25\"> The Government has elected not to file a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
