We add that neither below nor on appeal has plaintiff set forth \u201ca general scenario which, if proven, would entitle [him] to relief against the defendants] on some cognizable theory.\u201d <em>Hatch v. Dep\u2019t for Children, Youth &amp; Families, </em>274 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.2001). <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Newberger, </em>291 F.3d 89, 92 (1st Cir.2002) (explaining why claims against state agency would fail); <em>Monahan v. Dorchester Counseling Center, Inc., </em>961 F.2d 987, 994-95 (1st Cir.1992) (concluding that Restatement of Bill of Rights for Mental Health Patients, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10841, \u201ccreates no enforceable federal rights\u201d) (footnote omitted). The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs request to amend his complaint on the ground of futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
