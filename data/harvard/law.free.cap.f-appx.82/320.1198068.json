Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two potential issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Ellis has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Counsel questions whether the district court properly conducted the plea colloquy pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, and Ellis asserts that he was coerced into pleading guilty. However, Ellis\u2019 assertion is belied by his sworn statements to the contrary at the plea hearing. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119 (4th Cir.1991) (stating that defendant\u2019s statement at Rule 11 hearing that he was not coerced or threatened constitutes \u201cstrong evidence of the voluntariness of his plea\u201d). Because the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11, we find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Ellis\u2019 guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-25 (4th Cir.) (discussing standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">Next, counsel raises as a potential issue whether the district court properly established a base offense level of thirty-six under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (2001), and Ellis claims that he should have been held accountable only for the amount of crack involved in the controlled buys. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that there is no clear error in the calculation of Ellis\u2019 offense level. <em>See United States v. Pauley, </em>289 F.3d 254, 258 (4th Cir.2002) (stating standard of review), cert</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">Finally, Ellis\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be brought, if at all, in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). The record in this appeal does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. Mohr, </em>318 F.3d 613, 616 n. 1 (4th Cir.2003) (providing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Ellis\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
