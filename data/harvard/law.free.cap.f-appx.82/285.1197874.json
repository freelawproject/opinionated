Norris claims that his assorted disabilities leave him unable to work at any job available in the national economy. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Commissioner. We affirm because we find that the ALJ\u2019s determinations were supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. 405(g); <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)(defining \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d) As we write only for the parties, we will not restate the full facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-23\">In his opinion, the ALJ found that Norris suffered from fibromyalgia, chronic sinusitis/rhinitis, and a depressive disorder, none of which were severe enough to meet a listed disability under 20 C.F.R. 404 supt. P., app 1. The ALJ, relying upon the testimony of a vocational expert, found that a man with Norris\u2019s characteristics and disabilities could engage in several jobs available in the economy, such as dishwashing, clerking, or janitorial work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.905 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-24\">Norris\u2019s major contention is that the ALJ improperly discredited his testimony and the opinions of his two treating physicians, all of which the ALJ found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>inconsistent with objective medical evidence, Norris\u2019s own testimony, and the opinions of two other physicians. While Norris is correct that the opinion of treating physicians is typically afforded greater weight than other medical evidence, <em>see Adorno v. Shalala, </em>40 F.3d 43, 47 (3d Cir.1994), the physicians\u2019s explanations as to the extent of Norris\u2019s disabilities were unclear, <em>see Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 429 (3d Cir.1999), and were contradictory to almost all the other medical and opinion evidence in the case (e.g., Norris\u2019s x-rays, hospitalization record, physical examinations results, his own testimony about his daily activities, and the reports and opinions of Doctors Tam and Mahon). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d); <em>Newhouse v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 283, 286 (3d Cir.1985). As such, the ALJ was well within his discretion to partially discount Norris\u2019s testimony and the opinions of his treating physicians. <em>See Van Horn v. Schweiker, </em>717 F.2d 871, 873 (3d Cir.1983)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Without those opinions, there is substantial evidence showing that Norris\u2019s disabilities do not preclude him from holding the various jobs identified by the ALJ. The various medical evidence cited above shows that Norris is both physically and mentally able to work at numerous low-stress jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
