Seeley appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cboard\u201d) dismissing his claims for lack of jurisdiction. No. CH0752030093-I-1 (MSPB Jun 23, 2003). We review this decision <em>de novo. See Waldau v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>19 F.3d 1395, 1398 (Fed. Cir.1994). Because the board failed to make required factual findings, we <em>vacate </em>and <em>remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In the board\u2019s Acknowledgment Order dated November 13, 2002, the administrative judge informed Seeley that he had the burden of estabhshing jurisdiction by showing that he was either preference-eligible or a management or supervisory employee. <em>See id. </em>(citing 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108). In response, Seeley submitted documents that conceivably support a finding that he was a supervisory employee pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11). Thereafter, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that Seeley was not entitled to preference-eligible status. The administrative judge failed, however, to determine whether Seeley was a supervisor or a management employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">On appeal, the government argues that while Seeley did submit evidence of his \u201csupervisory potential,\u201d he failed to allege that he was a supervisor. It is clear from the papers he submitted, however, that he was attempting to prove that he was a supervisory employee. This is evident from several documents that refer either directly or impliedly to Seeley\u2019s position as \u201csupervisory.\u201d As such, and because we generally interpret a <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally, <em>Pentagen Tech. Int\u2019l Ltd. v. United States, </em>175 F.3d 1003, 1005 (Fed.Cir.1999), the board should have considered and made attendant factual findings as to whether Seeley was a supervisory employee. <em>See Killip v. OPM, </em>991 F.2d 1564, 1568-69 (Fed.Cir.1993). The decision of the board is vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
