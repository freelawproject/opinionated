The district court sentenced Fairclough to 120 months in prison. On appeal, Fairclough argues the court improperly denied him a sentencing reduction under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-26\">To qualify for the safety valve reduction, the defendant bears the burden of proving the statutory requirements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>114 F.3d 428, 429 (4th Cir.1997). We review a district court\u2019s determination on safety valve eligibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). We conclude that the district court\u2019s decision that defendant had not met his burden of proof was not clearly erroneous. Therefore, we affirm Fairclough\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional proces.</p>\n<p id=\"A3c\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
