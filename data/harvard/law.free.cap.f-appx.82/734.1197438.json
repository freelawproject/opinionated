R.App. P. 9(a), challenging the September 9, 2003 order of the district court revoking Bazuaye\u2019s bail and remanding him prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-18\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings with respect to a bail decision for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. See United States v. LaFontaine, </em>210 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir.2000). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148, a district court may revoke a prior grant of bail upon the government\u2019s motion if, <em>inter alia, </em>it finds, after a hearing, that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed a crime while on release and that \u201cthere is no condition or combination of conditions of release that will assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3148(b)(1), (b)(2). Furthermore, \u201c[i]f there is probable cause to believe that, while on release, the person committed a Federal, State, or local felony, a rebuttable presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b). That presumption does not disappear once the defendant has produced some rebuttal evidence, but \u201ccontinues to be weighed along with other factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-19\">The district court here revoked bail on the grounds that there was probable cause to believe that Bazuaye had committed perjury during a suppression hearing and that no other combination <em>of </em>bail conditions could protect the community from the threat that Bazuaye would further seek to obstruct justice. <em>See LaFontaine, </em>210 F.3d at 134 (observing that obstruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>of justice has been a traditional ground for pretrial detention by the courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Having thoroughly considered appellant\u2019s arguments and the record below, we find no error in the district court\u2019s order. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
