We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Brooks first contends that the district court erred in refusing to submit his jury instruction regarding multiple conspiracies to the jury. Brooks\u2019s proposed instruction informed the jury that even if it found Brooks was a member of another on-going conspiracy, it could not return a verdict of guilty unless it found Brooks was a member of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. The district court found that Brooks\u2019s instruction was not necessary because the evidence established neither separate drug conspiracies nor an illegal gambling conspiracy in which Brooks testified he was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">We review the denial of a proposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 551 (4th Cir.1998), but we review the trial court\u2019s decision not to instruct the jury-regarding multiple conspiracies for clear error. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>995 F.2d 480, 485 (4th Cir.1993). We find the district court did not clearly err in refusing to instruct on multiple conspiracies. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>115 F.3d 1151, 1157 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d 876, 884 (4th Cir.1994). Likewise, the court\u2019s instruction did not prevent Brooks from presenting his theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">Brooks next claims the court constructively amended his indictment in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), when it instructed the jury that the evidence need not establish a specific amount or quantity of a controlled substance, but only that Brooks conspired to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base, or \u201cat least\u201d fifty grams of cocaine base. Because Brooks did not object to the court\u2019s instruction at trial, we review his claim for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">We find no such error. While the indictment stated that Brooks conspired with intent to distribute \u201cmore than 50 grams of cocaine base\u201d rather than \u201cat least\u201d fifty grams, the court\u2019s instruction was fully in keeping with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (2000). Moreover, the Government established by \u201coverwhelming and essentially uncontroverted,\u201d evidence, <em>see United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 633, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted), that Brooks was responsible for between 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base during the course of the conspiracy. Thus, variation between the indictment and court\u2019s instruction did not affect Brooks\u2019s substantial rights. Even if there were error, we conclude it did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">Accordingly, we affirm Brooks\u2019s conspiracy conviction and his sentence. We deny Brooks\u2019s motions for leave to file two pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>se supplemental briefs because he is represented by counsel who has fully briefed his appeal. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
