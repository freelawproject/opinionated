United States. </em>No. 01-CV-327 (Fed.Cl. Aug 23, 2002). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">Fontroy raises arguments about the dismissal of his case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In a previous order dated November 26, 2002, we held that Fontroy\u2019s appeal of the original judgment was untimely and, therefore, not subject to review. Here, because this appeal is limited to the issue of the propriety of the denial of Fontroy\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, we cannot review the original judgment. <em>See Browder v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 263, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). We review a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion, <em>Info. Sys. and Networks Corp. v. United States, </em>994 F.2d 792, 794 (Fed.Cir.1993), and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fontroy\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. The new authorities cited, and thoroughly considered below, do not demonstrate that the Court of Federal Claims could properly assert subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
