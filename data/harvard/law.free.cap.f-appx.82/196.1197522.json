We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the increase for obstruction of justice and remand for a recalculation of the restitution amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Ruppert obstructed justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>300 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 2002). Ruppert willfully provided materially false information to the judge and pretrial services about his car (which secured his bond), his unapproved travel, and his failure to attend the victims\u2019 depositions. There is no requirement that actual obstruction have occurred when material false statements are made to pretrial services officers. <em>See United States v. Magana-Guerrero, </em>80 F.3d 398, 400-01 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-21\">Further, it was not error to order restitution in the full amount of the victims\u2019 financial loss, because Ruppert had yet to pay anything to the victims despite the outstanding civil judgment in state court. Any amount that he subsequently does pay will be offset against the restitution order. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(j)(2)(B). The government concedes that the restitution amount should be offset by the amounts Ruppert paid to the victims as \u201clulling\u201d payments. We remand for the recalculation of the restitution amount, reduced by any amounts actually paid to the victims to lull them into believing the investment plan was genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-22\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b238-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
