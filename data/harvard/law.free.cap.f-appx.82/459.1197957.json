Dillon, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Dillon claimed entitlement to the writ because the State of Tennessee denied him his right to a speedy trial after his transfer from federal to state custody to be tried on pending state charges pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (\u201cIAD\u201d). The district court dismissed the petition because it found that the one-year statute of limitations enacted by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), barred the petition as untimely and Dillon failed to exhaust available state remedies. The district court also noted that violations of the IAD are not a basis for federal habeas corpus relief. We conclude that the statute of limitations does not bar Dillon\u2019s petition, but his failure to exhaust state remedies does. Therefore, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b502-20\">In 1989, Dillon was in federal custody pursuant to a sentence unrelated to the matter now before the court. That same year, Tennessee indicted Dillon on charges of premeditated and felony murder. In December 1990, the federal government transferred Dillon to Tennessee\u2019s custody. This transfer was made under the IAD, which imposes strict time limits on the defendant\u2019s time for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-21\">The trial court originally set Dillon\u2019s trial for February 11, 1991, two months after he arrived in Tennessee\u2019s custody, within the time period permitted by the IAD. On the day of trial, however, the court granted Dillon\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, prompting Tennessee to file an interlocutory appeal of that court order. While that appeal was pending, Dillon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>moved to dismiss the indictment because Tennessee did not try him within the 120-day time limit set by the IAD. Finding that Tennessee\u2019s appeal of the suppression order delayed the trial beyond the IAD\u2019s time limit, the court dismissed the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Tennessee then also appealed the dismissal of the indictment. The Court of Criminal Appeals, having consolidated Tennessee\u2019s appeals, reversed both the trial court\u2019s suppression order and the dismissal order and remanded the case. The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed, holding that Dillon\u2019s motion to suppress tolled the 120-day period prescribed in Article IV of the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">On remand, the parties reargued the suppression issue. The trial court again suppressed the evidence and Tennessee again pursued an interlocutory appeal. During the pendency of that appeal, Tennessee released Dillon on bond. Three years after the original Tennessee trial date, the Court of Criminal Appeals again reversed the trial court\u2019s decision and remanded the case. The Tennessee Supreme Court denied Dillon\u2019s petition for review. Since that time, Dillon remains on bond awaiting trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">On April 21, 1999, Dillon filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under section 2241 claiming that (1) Tennessee failed to comply with the IAD\u2019s Article 111(a) requirement that a continuance be granted only \u201cfor good cause shown in open court,\u201d (2) Tennessee violated the antishuttling provision of Article 111(d) of the IAD by returning him to federal custody, (3) Tennessee violated Article 111(a) of the IAD by failing to try Dillon within 180 days of his initial request for a speedy trial, and (4) Tennessee denied Dillon his constitutional right to a speedy trial because of the IAD violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The district court dismissed the habeas petition and denied Dillon a certificate of appealability. This court then granted a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and Fed. R.App. P. 22(b), limited to three issues: (1) whether Dillon\u2019s petition is barred by the one-year statute of limitations of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), (2) whether Dillon has exhausted available state court remedies, and (3) whether a violation of the IAD can support federal habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">This court reviews de novo a district court judgment dismissing a habeas corpus petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">B. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">Tennessee argues that the applicable statute of limitations bars Dillon\u2019s habeas petition. A one-year statute of limitations governs petitions for habeas corpus filed, as was Dillon\u2019s, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Section 2244(d)(1) (emphasis added) provides, in part, that: \u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to a <em>judgment </em>of a State court....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">We conclude that this provision does not bar Dillon\u2019s petition because he is not \u201ca person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Dillon is not in custody pursuant to the <em>judgment </em>of a state court. Instead, Dillon currently awaits trial on Tennessee\u2019s charges. The limitations period, therefore, has not yet commenced, and the district court erred in holding Dillon\u2019s petition time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">C. Exhaustion of State Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">Though we find the applicable one-year statute of limitations does not impede <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>relief in this case, Dillon\u2019s failure to exhaust remedies available under Tennessee law precludes our granting a writ. The United States Supreme Court has held that federal courts generally should not rule on a habeas corpus petition until the state courts have had a complete opportunity to act on the claims raised in that petition. <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 515, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). A \u201cstrong presumption\u201d exists that all available state remedies must be exhausted before a petitioner files a petition for writ of habeas corpus. <em>Granberry v. Greer, </em>481 U.S. 129, 131, 107 S.Ct. 1671, 95 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987). If some of a petitioner\u2019s claims have been exhausted in state court, but others have not, a federal court should dismiss the entire petition. <em>Rose, </em>455 U.S. at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Dillon\u2019s petition includes four claims, each of which he failed to exhaust in state court. During oral argument, and in supplemental briefing, Dillon conceded that his petition presented unexhausted claims. Dillon asks this court to exercise its discretion to hear a petition that includes unexhausted claims, despite the strong presumption in favor of state courts having the first opportunity to resolve them. <em>Granberry, </em>481 U.S. at 130. Courts should only rarely and reluctantly review unexhausted claims because doing so undermines the law\u2019s clear preference for having unexhausted claims decided in state court. <em>O\u2019Guinn v. Dutton, </em>88 F.3d 1409, 1413 (6th Cir.1996) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Dillon argued that the extended delay in bringing his case to trial warrants overcoming the strong presumption in favor of state courts resolving claims. Dillon argues his is the rare case deserving exception from the exhaustion requirement. But Dillon\u2019s failure to pursue in state court the claims he presents to this court disqualifies his case from consideration under the narrow exception. <em>Rockwell v. Yukins, </em>217 F.3d 421, 424 (6th Cir.2000) (petitioner was responsible for delay caused by presenting unexhausted claim in her petition and the delay did not create an exceptional factor warranting excusing her failure to exhaust); <em>Dunbar v. Pitcher, </em>No. 98-2068, 2000 WL 179026, at *1 (6th Cir. Feb. 9, 2000) (\u201cinordinate delay\u201d in Michigan\u2019s appeals process is best addressed to Michigan\u2019s courts in the first instance).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Because we decide that Tennessee must first have its opportunity to review Dillon\u2019s unexhausted claims, we do not reach the third issue certified for appeal \u2014 whether a violation of the IAD can support federal habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
