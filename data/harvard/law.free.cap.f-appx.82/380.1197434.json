California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Johnson has filed a response in which he argues that his guilty plea was involuntary, his trial counsel was ineffective, and the district court abused its discretion. We decline to address the ineffective assistance claims raised by Johnson in this proceeding. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, Johnson\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED. Counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Because there is no nonfrivolous issue for appeal, Johnson\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>Cf United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-20\">ANDERS MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
