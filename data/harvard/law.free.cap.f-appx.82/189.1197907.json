That is not the law. <em>See City of Los Angeles v. Santa Monica Baykeeper, </em>254 F.3d 882, 888-89 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Houser, </em>804 F.2d 565, 567 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>608 F.2d 386, 390 (9th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Emens, </em>565 F.2d 1142, 1144-45 (9th Cir.1977); <em>cf. United States v. Alexander, </em>106 F.3d 874, 876 (9th Cir.1997) (a clearly erroneous ruling is a basis for reconsideration). Thus, we cannot say that the district court erred in reconsidering its ruling on the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">(2) If we assume that the border patrol officers did detain Zepeda,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we agree with the district court that there was reasonable suspicion so to do. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Juarez, </em>299 F.3d 1138, 1141 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Montero-Camargo, </em>208 F.3d 1122, 1129 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 884-85, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2582, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975). The information known to the officer, coupled with his substantial experience, indicated that Zepeda\u2019s truck might well be the one that had recently slipped across the border. That was enough to allow the officer to detain and question Zepeda briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">(3) When merely asked about what was in the bed of his truck, Zepeda\u2019s ensuing actions had all the earmarks of a consent to a search. <em>See United States v. Murillo, </em>255 F.3d 1169, 1175 (9th Cir.2001) ; <em>United States v. Chan-Jimenez, </em>125 F.3d 1324, 1327 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Kim, </em>25 F.3d at 1431-32; <em>United States v. O\u2019Looney, </em>544 F.2d 385, 388 (9th Cir.1976). Moreover, once the officer walked toward the back of Zepeda\u2019s truck, his nose was assaulted by the strong odor of marijuana emanating from the bed of the truck. That sufficed to give the officer probable cause to search. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>205 F.3d 1182, 1187 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>558 F.2d 956, 964 (9th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Laird, </em>511 F.2d 1039, 1040 (9th Cir.1975). Thus, the search was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b232-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-11\">. We grant the motion for filing of the reply brief late.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\">. The parties dispute that question. Answering it would require exploring whether the officer precluded his movement, or whether other circumstances or desires on his own part did so. <em>See United States v. Drayton, </em>536 U.S. 194, 200-03, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 2110-12, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002); <em>United States v. Summers, </em>268 F.3d 683, 686-87 (9th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Kim, </em>25 F.3d 1426, 1431 &amp; n. 2 (9th Cir. 1994). In this case, we need not resolve that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
