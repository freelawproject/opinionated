Ortega, one of the alleged leaders of a family-run crack cocaine and heroin distribution organization in the Bronx, was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five grams and more of crack cocaine and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), 841(b)(1)(C), and 846 and distributing and possessing with intent to distribute 3.5 grams of heroin within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), and 860. He was sentenced to 80 years\u2019 incarceration and is currently serving his sentence. Ortega appeals his conviction on numerous grounds. Familiarity with the facts of this case is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">\n<em>Alleged Brady Violation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">For the first time on appeal, Ortega claims that the Government violated his due process rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Ortega argues that, contrary to the Government\u2019s disclaimer of knowledge concerning any exculpatory evidence, federal prosecutors failed to disclose that they possessed an exculpatory \u201cbuy report\u201d completed by an undercover police officer describing a drug purchase from a heroin dealer whom he referred to as \u201cJ.D. Bubble.\u201d Although this officer \u2014 a chief prosecution witness \u2014 identified Ortega as the man whom he had earlier referenced as \u201cJ.D. Bubble,\u201d the physical description of \u201cJ.D. Bubble\u201d entered in this \u201cbuy report\u201d differed from the physical description of Ortega that was indicated in his 1998 mug shot pedigree form. This \u201cbuy report\u201d was eventually turned over to Ortega\u2019s counsel along with a large group of other documents four days before trial in compliance with a court-determined discovery deadline. Ortega claims that this disclosure violated this Court\u2019s applications of <em>Brady </em>since it deprived the defense of a reasonable opportunity to investigate the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">Since Ortega did not object to this last-minute <em>Brady </em>disclosure, either at trial or in his post-trial motions, our standard of review for this claim is the \u201cplain error\u201d analysis of <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Failure to disclose alleged exculpatory evidence in a prompt manner violates <em>Brady </em>only if \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that the government\u2019s suppression affected the outcome of the ease.\u201d <em>United States v. Coppa, </em>267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir.2001); <em>accord Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Ortega alleges a number of prejudicial consequences of the allegedly late and \u201cburied\u201d disclosure of the \u201cbuy report\u201d including, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) that the late disclosure of the \u201cbuy report\u201d set into motion a chain of retrospectively unwise pretrial evidentiary decisions by Ortega\u2019s counsel; (2) that the late disclosure prevented Ortega from searching for the \u201creal J.D. Bubble,\u201d and (3) that late disclosure of the \u201cbuy report\u201d prevented his counsel from realizing the importance of introducing additional evidence at trial related to Ortega\u2019s physical appearance at the time of the \u201cbuy report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>These speculative assertions ignore other corroborating evidence at trial that supported Ortega\u2019s identification as \u201cJ.D. Bubble\u201d and do not support a reasonable probability that the \u201cbuy report\u201d affected the trial outcome under a \u201cplain error\u201d standard of review. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\n<em>Alleged Jencks Act Violation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Ortega argues that the trial court erroneously refused to grant him a new trial for the Government\u2019s alleged violation of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. Ortega cites the prosecution\u2019s failure to produce a handwritten notation made on a photograph from a pre-arrest photo identification of Ortega by a Government witness. This claim was considered by the district court in its July 17, 2002 Opinion and Order, which concluded that the notation did not constitute a \u201cstatement\u201d under the Jencks Act because it was not contemporaneous with the oral statement of the Government\u2019s witness and therefore was not covered by the Jencks Act. In any case, the district court found that the failure of prosecutors to produce the notation was inadvertent, which means that Ortega could secure a new trial only by showing prejudice from the nondisclosure. Since the district court found that the notation would have undermined Ortega\u2019s defense, the district court held that no prejudice resulted from the prosecution\u2019s failure to produce the notation.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">This Court will uphold the denial of a motion for a new trial under Fed. R.Crim.P. 33 unless there is a clear \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d by the district court. <em>United States v. Brunshtein, </em>344 F.3d 91, 101 (2d Cir.2003). Ortega\u2019s chief attack is that the district court erred in finding the post-trial testimony of the Government\u2019s witnesses to be credible. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s factual findings and we conclude that, even if the notation constituted a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of the Jencks Act, \u201cthere is no substantial probability that had the evidence been disclosed, the result would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>110 F.3d 936, 943 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Waiver of the Right to Suppress Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Based on trial testimony by Government witnesses, Ortega speculates that physical evidence seized on his property <em>might </em>have been seized illegally, which would belie the prosecution\u2019s pretrial representations to Ortega\u2019s counsel that all evidence was properly seized under the Fourth Amendment as the items in question were in plain view. On appeal, Ortega now argues that this alleged \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d dissuaded his counsel from filing a pretrial suppression motion under Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3) and helped deprive him of effective assistance by his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">The district court\u2019s December 13, 2001 Opinion and Order stated, in the context of a motion by Ortega under Rule 12, that it found \u201cnothing in [police] testimony [to be] inconsistent with the discovery of [evidence] in plain view\u201d and that counsel\u2019s failure to suppress the evidence was a strategic decision. A district court\u2019s decision to deny relief from a Rule 12 waiver is reviewed for abuse of discretion or clear legal error. <em>See United States v. Crowley, </em>236 F.3d 104, 110 (2d Cir.2000). We see neither. Ortega\u2019s claim of an invalid waiver is therefore meritless. Moreover, to the extent that Ortega raises a claim that his counsel was ineffective in not moving to suppress the evidence, we decline to review that matter on the record now before us. Ortega may pursue this claim in a \u00a7 2255 petition. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Morris, </em>350 F.3d 32, 39 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">Ortega also claimed that the Government erred in not disclosing his pre-arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>photo identification by a Government witness. We conclude that, even if there was such an error, it was without prejudice and does not merit a new trial. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>239 F.3d 163, 167 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">We have examined Ortega\u2019s remaining claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
