Ndula, a native and citizen of Cameroon, seeks review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of Ndula\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. We reject Ndula\u2019s contention that the evidence he presented at the hearing before the IJ, in the form of his testimony, was adequate to establish his entitlement to the relief sought. Ndula does not qualify because the IJ made a negative credibility determination that is amply supported by the record and is entitled to deference. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000); <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 323 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Additionally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Ndula\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for receiving withholding is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Ndula has failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Ndula asserts that he seeks to have his case reopened to adjudicate his right to protection under the Convention Against Torture. As the IJ has already held that Ndula was not entitled to such relief, we conclude that the denial of any such motion to reopen was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
