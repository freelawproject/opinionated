Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and other grounds. Pajooh argues that defendants DeGabrielle and Judge Harmon are not absolutely immune from suit for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-29\">Judge Harmon enjoys absolute immunity because Pajooh\u2019s claims for damages arose out of acts she performed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>exercise of her judicial functions. <em>See Mitchell v. McBryde, </em>944 F.2d 229, 230 (5th Cir.1991). DeGabrielle enjoys absolute immunity because his conduct was \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\u201d <em>See Beck v. Texas State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>204 F.3d 629, 637 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Pajooh argues that the district court erred when it determined that he had failed to state a claim upon which declaratory or injunctive relief could be granted. Pajooh\u2019s unsupported conclusory accusations do not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss. <em>See Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1200, 123 S.Ct. 1287, 154 L.Ed.2d 1041 (2003). The district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Pajooh\u2019s suit is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
