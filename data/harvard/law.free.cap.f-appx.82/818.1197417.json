See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-23\">Andre Marie Songue, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>On appeal, Songue raises challenges to the Board\u2019s and immigration judge\u2019s determinations that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 488-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Songue fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Songue seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
