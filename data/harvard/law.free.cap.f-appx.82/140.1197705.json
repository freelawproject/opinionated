Bevers is currently serving consecutive sentences of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated rape, fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for retaliation, and life imprisonment for aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Severs\u2019 motion to strike Respondent\u2019s brief as untimely filed is DENIED. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Severs asserts that his rights under the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses have been violated. He argues that he is eligible for an initial parole hearing and has not yet received a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The denial of federal habeas relief may be affirmed on any ground supported by the record. <em>Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000). The 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) statute of limitations may be raised <em>sua sponte </em>provided that the petitioner has been afforded an opportunity to argue against the limitations issue and Respondent has not intentionally waived the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In the instant case, Respondent was not served in the district court and did not waive or forfeit the affirmative defense of limitations. <em>See id. </em>at 263. Severs was afforded an opportunity to argue and did argue against the limitations issue. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u201c[T]he limitation period runs from the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Severs does not dispute that the factual predicate for his claim was revealed by the July 26, 2000, nunc pro tunc order wherein he was issued credit against his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The period ran from July 27, 2000, until December 26, 2000, and from April 12, 2001, expiring before Severs filed state habeas application on December 13, 2001. Additional time elapsed between the denial of Severs\u2019 second state habeas application and the filing of a third state habeas application and prior to the submission of Severs\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Spotville v. Cain, </em>149 F.3d 374, 376 (5th Cir. 1998). Severs\u2019 parole claim is time-barred. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Severs has not shown that his argument based on <em>Ex Parte Franks, </em>71 S.W.3d 327 (Tex. Crim.App.2001), and his contention that he is experiencing a \u201ccontinuous and ongoing\u201d violation excuse the untimely presentation of his claim. Severs has provided no grounds for the application of equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court denying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 relief is AFFIRMED on alternative grounds. <em>See Scott, </em>227 F.3d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b182-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
