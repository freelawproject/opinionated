United States Postal Serv., </em>No. AT-0353-03-0164-1-1 (M.S.P.B. Jan. 15, 2003) <em>(\u201cMartin </em>//\u201d), <em>revieiv denied, Martin v. United States Postal Serv., </em>No. AT-0353-03-0164-1-1, 2003 WL 21542329, 94 M.S.P.R. 483 (M.S.P.B. June 30, 2003). <em>We affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">On March 11, 1994, the United States Postal Service (\u201cthe USPS\u201d) removed Mr. Martin from his position as a mail handler for unacceptable conduct and submitting falsified claims for compensation for an on-the-job injury and continuation-of-pay (\u201cCOP\u201d) benefits (Forms CA-7 and 3971) to the Department of Labor, Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs (\u201cthe OWCP\u201d). Subsequently, on January 24, 1996, the OWCP awarded Mr. Martin his requested COP benefits. The OWCP did not award Mr. Martin any compensation for on-the-job injury. The USPS declined to restore Mr. Martin to his former position.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">In August of 2001, Mr. Martin appealed to the Board arguing that the USPS denied him his \u201cright to resume\u201d employment, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8151(b), by failing to restore him to his former position following the award of COP benefits. The administrative judge held that the \u201cright to resume\u201d employment under section 8151(b) is only accorded to employees who receive \u201ccompensation\u201d for a work related injury. <em>Martin v. United States Postal Serv., </em>No. AT-0353-01-0819-I-1, slip op. at 2 (M.S.P.B. Oct. 17, 2001) <em>(\u201cMartm </em>/\u201d), <em>review denied, Martin v. United States Postal Serv., </em>No. AT-0353-01-0819-I-1, 91 M.S.P.R. 667, 2002 WL 521423 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 3, 2002); <em>see also </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.304(c) (2003). Since 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8118(e) \u201cplainly and expressly excludes COP payments from the definition of \u2018compensation,\u2019 \u201d the administrative judge held that \u201cthere is no law, rule or regulation that provides the Board with jurisdiction to review the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Martin I, </em>slip op. at 3. The full Board denied review, and the decision became final on April 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">On November 15, 2002, Mr. Martin again appealed to the Board arguing that the USPS should have restored him to his former position following the OWCP\u2019s decision to award him COP benefits. The Board issued an \u201cAcknowledgement Order\u201d on November 21, 2002, notifying Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Martin that there was a question as to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction and that the appeal appeared to be barred by collateral estoppel arising from the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Martin I. Martin v. United States Postal Serv., </em>No. AT-0353-03-0164-I-1, slip op. at 2 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 21, 2002). Subsequently, on January 15, 2003, the administrative judge declined to hold a hearing \u201cbecause there was no factual dispute bearing on the issue of jurisdiction,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and instead held that collateral estoppel barred the appeal. <em>Martin II, </em>slip op. at 1. The full Board denied review on June 30, 2003, and Mr. Martin timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In <em>Martin I, </em>the Board determined that section 8151(b) is inapplicable to Mr. Martin because COP benefits are not \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>Martin I, </em>slip op. at 3. As a result of this finding, the Board held that it did not have jurisdiction over the appeal. Here, Mr. Martin argues that the Board\u2019s decision in the <em>Martin I </em>was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of an issue if: (1) the issue previously litigated is identical to the one currently before the court; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior case; (3) determination of that issue was necessary in the prior case; and (4) the precluded party was fully represented in the prior case. <em>Rice v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>998 F.2d 997, 999 (Fed.Cir.1993). Here we agree with the Board that the appellant is barred from relitigating the Issue of whether an award of COP benefits qualifies as \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 8151(b). The appellant was given a full opportunity to argue this issue in <em>Martin I. </em>There the Board held, contrary to Mr. Martin\u2019s arguments, that section 8151(b) was inapplicable and, as a result, it lacked jurisdiction. Mr. Martin\u2019s effort to relitigate that jurisdictional question here is barred by collateral estoppel. Collateral estoppel bars Mr. Martin from relitigating the applicability of section 8151(b) in the second appeal. Consequently, the decision of the Board is</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">. We have previously held that there is no right to a \"jurisdictional hearing.\u201d <em>Dick </em>v. <em>Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>290 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002). To be sure, the right to an evidentiary hearing may arise after an appellant makes a non-frivolous argument under an applicable statute or regulation, but \u201csuch a hearing is a hearing on the merits, not a jurisdictional hearing.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
