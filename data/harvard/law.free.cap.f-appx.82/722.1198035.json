At sentencing, the appellant argued that his offense level should be reduced under United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l) because he did not attempt to smuggle the alien in exchange for money, and further reduced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because he was a minor participant in the crime. The district court rejected these arguments and also increased the appellant\u2019s applicable offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because, the district court concluded, he attempted to obstruct justice through perjury. On appeal, the appellant challenges both his conviction and the factual support for his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-21\">The testimony of the three prosecution witnesses adequately supports the appellant\u2019s conviction and the factual findings underlying his sentence. That both the jury and the trial judge apparently chose to credit their testimony rather than the appellant\u2019s is not grounds for reversal, particularly in light of the substantial deference we give to determinations of wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ness credibility by the jury, <em>United States v.
