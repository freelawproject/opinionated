Harris argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not narrowly tailored in light of the interplay of the Second Amendment and the regulation of interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause, is overly broad in its reach given the legislative history of its intent, and unevenly burdens a fundamental right in violation of equal protection by relying on inconsistent state law definitions. He acknowledges that the foregoing arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Darrington, </em>351 F.3d 632, 633 (5th Cir.2003). We note, however, that Harris has preserved the issues for review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Hams also argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power because the regulated activity does not substantially affect interstate commerce. Alternatively, he argues that the factual basis for his plea was insufficient because the evidence established only that the firearm had traveled across state lines at some unspecified point in the past. Harris raises these arguments solely to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review. As he acknowledges, they are foreclosed by existing Fifth Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">Finally, Harris argues that the district court erred at sentencing by accepting the probation officer\u2019s report without requiring the Government to offer evidence to rebut Harris\u2019s objections to the report. Harris concedes that he offered no evidence in support of his objections and that this issue is also foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>283 F.3d 300, 314 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 934, 122 S.Ct. 2612, 153 L.Ed.2d 797 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
