Fabela argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level increase to the base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a dangerous weapon during the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">The Government need not prove that Fabela had knowledge of the weapon\u2019s existence. <em>See United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 179 (5th Cir.1996). A review of the record indicates that Fabela did not meet his burden of proving that it was \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>106 F.3d 1213, 1216 (5th Cir. 1997). Because the Government showed that Fabela\u2019s co-defendant knowingly possessed a weapon while they committed the offense and because firearms are the \u201ctools of the trade\u201d in drug conspiracies, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Fabela should have foreseen his co-defendant\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon. <em>See United States v. Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209, 1215 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1035-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
