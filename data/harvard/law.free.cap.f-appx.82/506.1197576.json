Tolstedt appeals, and, having reviewed each of his claims of error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Specifically, we reject Tolstedt\u2019s speedy-trial claims, because he never asserted his right to a speedy trial, he agreed with the government\u2019s first request for a continuance, and he makes no showing of prejudice from the eight-month delay between his arraignment and trial. <em>See United States v. Nazarenus, </em>983 F.2d 1480, 1483-84 (8th Cir.1993). We also find that the evidence, considered in a light most favorable to the prosecution, amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Brooks, </em>174 F.3d 950, 955 (8th Cir.1999) (\u201cwillfulness\u201d in criminal tax context requires proof that defendant knew of and intentionally violated legal duty); <em>United States v. Gleason, </em>726 F.2d 385, 387-88 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (elements of \u00a7 7203 violation; good faith disagreement with law does not negate willfulness, and circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove willfulness). In addition, even assuming Tolstedt preserved his objection to the district court\u2019s tax-loss finding at sentencing, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding, which was supported by the testimony of an Internal Revenue Service Agent, was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.1, n. 1; <em>United States v. Hart, </em>324 F.3d 575, 578 (8th Cir.2003) (standard of review). We also conclude that, contrary to Tolstedt\u2019s contentions, it was permissible for the government to investigate the offense, <em>see United States v. Rosnow, </em>977 F.2d 399, 409 n. 17, 413 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 990, 113 S.Ct. 1596, 123 L.Ed.2d 159 (1993), and to charge Tolstedt by information, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203; Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(a) (concerning use of indictment and information).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The balance of Tolstedt\u2019s arguments are either frivolous, cumulative, or do not rise to the level of plain error. <em>See United States v. Guerra, </em>113 F.3d 809, 816 (8th Cir.1997) (when issue is not raised at trial, review is only for plain error, which occurs when obvious error effects defendant\u2019s substantial rights); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>110 F.3d 1320, 1326 (8th Cir.) (reversal under plain-error standard for arguably improper closing argument would be proper only if error seriously affected fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 975, 118 S.Ct. 432, 139 L.Ed.2d 331 (1997); <em>United States v. NB, </em>59 F.3d 771, 774 (8th Cir.1995) (finding no miscarriage of justice resulted which justified reversal based on admission of unobjected-to hearsay testimony). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\">. The Honorable Richard G.
