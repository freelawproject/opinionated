The district court sentenced Perales-Avila to concurrent terms of 71 months and 36 months imprisonment and to concurrent supervised release terms of 3 years and 1 year. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in declining to depart downward based on cultural assimilation. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-22\">We do not review a sentencing court\u2019s denial of a downward departure motion where, as here, there is no indication the court believed it lacked the authority to depart. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Arce, </em>267 F.3d 775, 784 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-23\">We have reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-20\">. The Honorable Charles R. Wolle, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
