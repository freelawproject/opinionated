Finding that counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a direct appeal on Herrera\u2019s behalf, the district court granted Herrera leave to file an out-of-time appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">In Herrera\u2019s sole issue on appeal, he argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the statute\u2019s structure treats drug types and quantities as sentencing factors. Herrera concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000), but he raises the issue in order to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Herrera also requests that his case be remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective-assistance claims. Those claims were raised by Herrera in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, but review of those claims was previously pretermitted by this court. Herrera has failed, however, to squarely present those claims on direct appeal and they are thus not properly before this court. Nor is the record adequately developed so as to permit this court to address any such claims in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Haese, </em>162 F.3d 359, 363-64 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited, circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
