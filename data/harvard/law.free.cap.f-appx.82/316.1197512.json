Jones appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his complaint filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The district court properly required exhaustion of administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2000). Because Jones did not demonstrate to the district court that he had exhausted administrative remedies or that such remedies were not available, the court\u2019s dismissal of the action, without prejudice, was not an abuse of discretion. We also find that the district court properly denied relief on Jones\u2019 claims that accrued more than two years before he filed his complaint. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-243 (Michie 2000). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
