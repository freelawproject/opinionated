Rakoff, <em>J.) </em>which adopted the February 25, 2003 Recommendation of the Honorable Kevin Nathaniel Fox, United States Magistrate Judge, to disqualify Jacobs from serving in the dual role of class representative and class counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-20\">Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues. Jacob\u2019s appeal is not properly before this court because a final judgment has not been entered in this case nor are any exceptions to the final judgment rule applicable. Here, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that attorney Harry Jacobs be disqualified from serving in the dual role of class representative and class counsel. In <em>Richardson-Merrell, Inc. v. Roller, </em>the Supreme Court states that \u201corders disqualifying counsel in a civil case ... are not collateral orders subject to appeal as \u2018final judgments\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d 472 U.S. 424, 440, 105 S.Ct. 2757, 86 L.Ed.2d 340 (1985); <em>see also Gary Plastic Packaging Corp. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>903 F.2d 176 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1025, 111 S.Ct. 675, 112 L.Ed.2d 667 (1991) (\u201cThe denial of a class certification and the disqualification of counsel are interlocutory orders which are not immediately appealable[J\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-21\">Accordingly, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
