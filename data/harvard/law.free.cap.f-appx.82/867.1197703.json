The district court dismissed Aranda\u2019s petition without prejudice because he had failed to comply with a preclusion order that required him to obtain judicial permission before filing any action. Because Aranda\u2019s petition was filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and did not challenge a process arising out of a state court, he is not required to obtain a COA to proceed on appeal. <em>See Ojo v. I.N.S., </em>106 F.3d 680, 681 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-22\">Aranda\u2019s assertion that the district court required him to inform the court about payment on any monetary sanctions imposed in civil litigation is not supported by the record. The district court properly found that Aranda had not complied with the preclusion order issued in <em>Aranda v. Simpson, </em>4:00cv3253 (S.D.Tex. Oct. 13, 2000), and Aranda has not shown that such a preclusion order, as applied to a habeas proceeding, has blocked his access to the courts. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 355-56, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
