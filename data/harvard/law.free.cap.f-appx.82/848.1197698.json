R.App. P. 5. Because the district court\u2019s orders do not contain the statement required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (2000) and by Fed. R.App. P. 5 that the order involves a controlling question of law on which substantial grounds for disagreement exist, we deny Clark\u2019s petition for permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-25\">Moreover, to the extent that Clark\u2019s petition could be construed as a notice of appeal from these orders, we find that we lack jurisdiction over these orders. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292; Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The orders that Clark seeks to appeal are neither final orders nor appeal-able interlocutory or collateral orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Accordingly, we deny the petition. We also deny Clark\u2019s pending motion to stay the district court proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
