The District Court dismissed the complaint. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The facts of this case are set forth at length in the parties\u2019 briefs and, therefore, will only be summarized here. Appellant, Todd Chapman, was convicted by a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County of driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) and resisting arrest. Chapman was sentenced to a period of incarceration of, twenty-eight days and to a two-year term of probation for the DUI charge. No further penalty was imposed for the resisting arrest conviction, and his sentence was stayed pending appeal. Chapman had difficulties with several of the attorneys appointed to represent him and, after conducting a hearing, the trial court determined that new counsel should not be appointed for Chapman.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The Pennsylvania Superior Court adopted the trial court\u2019s findings, and ordered Chapman to file his brief by March 1, 1999. Chapman failed to comply with this order and the Superior Court dismissed his appeal for failure to prosecute. Two months later, the trial court ordered Chapman to report to the courthouse to serve the sentence that had been imposed. Chapman failed to appear, was found to be in contempt of the court\u2019s January 30,1997 sentencing order, and was remanded to the custody of the Allegheny County Jail. At a contempt review hearing, the trial court determined that Chapman was unable to cooperate in the criminal justice system due to mental illness. Accordingly, the court revoked its previous sentence, imposed a sentence of time served plus eighteen months probation, and released Chapman from custody. Chapman did not appeal this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">During the pendency of these state court proceedings (in particular, while his appeal was before the Pennsylvania Superior Court), Appellant filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging violations of his constitutional and civil rights arising out of his arrest, convictions and sentence. Chapman alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that various state defendants (more than eighty in total) had falsely arrested and imprisoned him, used excessive force in arresting him, and pursued his arrest, prosecution and incarceration without probable cause and on the basis of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">The District Court (Cindrich, J.) adopted the report issued by the Magistrate Judge, which recommended that defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>state a claim be granted and that the complaint be dismissed (with the exception of Appellant\u2019s claims of use of excessive force, which were dismissed as violative of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8) on the ground that Chapman\u2019s convictions had not been previously invalidated by the state courts or called into question by the issuance of a federal writ of habeas corpus as required by the Supreme Court in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Chapman appealed the District Court\u2019s dismissal order and we appointed <em>amicus </em>counsel to brief the question of whether the favorable termination requirement set forth in <em>Heck </em>bars a claim brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by a plaintiff who, because of the imposition of a very short sentence (or no period of incarceration at all), is no longer in the custody of the State, and thus has no remedy in habeas corpus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Briefing is complete and this appeal is now ripe for disposition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Varied interpretations of the <em>Heck </em>holding have issued, partially because the language of the holding does not appear to be limited to the facts of the case. The holding speaks in terms of \u201ca \u00a7 1983 plaintiff,\u201d although the plaintiff in <em>Heck </em>was an inmate. The Supreme Court in <em>Heck </em>held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>invalid, [footnote omitted] a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has <em>not </em>been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">512 U.S. at 486-87 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We conclude that we need not answer the question of the applicability of <em>Heck </em>at this time because the situation presented by this case does not give us the appropriate opportunity to do so. When Chapman filed his \u00a7 1983 action in the District Court, his state appeal was pending before the Pennsylvania Superior Court. It has long been established that the exclusive method of challenging an allegedly unconstitutional state conviction in the lower federal courts is a habeas corpus action. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>see also Learner v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 540 (3d Cir.2002). Additionally, the Supreme Court has repeatedly admonished that civil tort actions (as well as \u00a7 1983 actions) are not the \u201cappropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486. Thus, the Court made clear in <em>Heck </em>that to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, \u201ca \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">As summarized by the Second Circuit in <em>Huang v. Johnson, </em>\u201c[t]he Court\u2019s rationale was based, in part, on a desire to \u2018avoid parallel litigation over the issues of probable cause and guilt,\u2019 prevent \u2018the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction,\u2019 and preclude \u2018a convicted criminal defendant from making a collateral attack on the conviction through the vehicle of a civil suit.\u2019\u201d 251 F.3d 65, 73 (2nd Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 484). What Chapman sought to do through the filing of his \u00a7 1983 action was to simultaneously have his DUI and resisting arrest convictions and sentence declared invalid, and to recover damages for the allegedly improper actions of the named defendants-all while his direct appeal was still pending in state court. This type of \u201chybridization,\u201d as the First Circuit referred to it in <em>Figueroa v. Rivera, </em>147 F.3d 77, 81 (1st Cir.1998), is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck, </em>which \u201cmakes the impugning of an allegedly unconstitutional conviction <em>in a separate, antecedent proceeding </em>a prerequisite to a resultant section 1983 action for damages.\u201d As Justice Souter explained in <em>Heck, </em>\u201callowing a state prisoner to proceed directly with a federal court \u00a7 1983 attack on his conviction or sentence \u2018would wholly frustrate explicit intent\u2019 as declared in the habeas exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 498 (quoting <em>Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 489). This appears to be exactly what Chapman did. Without waiting for a decision by the Superior Court on his direct appeal, Chapman sought to challenge his convictions and sentence and to obtain damages through a \u00a7 1983 action filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">This is not a situation where the remedy of federal habeas was unavailable to Chapman, but rather presents a case in which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>at the time he filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Chapman simply had not first exhausted state remedies nor availed himself of the federal habeas option.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court imposed a sentence of twenty-eight days imprisonment and a two-year probationary period on Chapman. That sentence was stayed during the pendency of Chapman\u2019s appeal. Additionally, the trial court revoked its earlier order and sentenced Chapman to time served plus eighteen months of probation. Chapman failed to seek even initial review of this newly imposed sentence, despite the fact that such an appeal would have afforded him direct appellate review of a criminal sentence that had once before been dismissed on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Given the particular circumstances of this case, Appellant does not appear to fall within one of the classes of \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs that the Justices had noted concern for in the <em>Spencer v. Kemna dictum, </em>i.e., \u201cindividuals without recourse to the habeas statute because they are not \u2018in custody\u2019 (people merely fined or whose sentences have been fully served, for example)\u201d, 523 U.S. 1, 21, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998), as his probationary period-which did not expire until April 8, 2001 (more than three years after the filing of his \u00a7 1983 complaint)-would have satisfied the habeas \u201cin custody\u201d requirement even if his period of incarceration had been served in its entirety. <em>See United States ex rel. Wojtycha v. Hopkins, </em>517 F.2d 420 (3d Cir.1975) (a prisoner out on probation is still in custody). In fact, as noted previously, Chapman did seek habeas relief after the court dismissed his \u00a7 1983 complaint, although without successfully securing its remedy since his sentence had expired during the pendency of that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\"><em>Amicus </em>argues that, regardless of Chapman\u2019s custody status at the time he filed his \u00a7 1983 action, Appellant has since been released and thus any <em>Heck </em>bar that might have existed at the time of the District Court\u2019s dismissal has been removed. We do not agree. The Supreme Court specifically noted in <em>Heck </em>that \u201cthe principle barring collateral attacks is not rendered inapplicable by the fortuity that a convicted criminal is no longer incarcerated.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 490 n. 10. <em>Amicus </em>is correct to point out that in <em>Nonnette v. Small, </em>the Ninth Circuit allowed one plaintiff to proceed with a \u00a7 1983 claim even though a petition for writ of habeas corpus would have had to be dismissed for lack of a case or controversy because the plaintiffs period of incarceration expired after the entry of the order of dismissal but prior to the disposition of the appeal. 316 F.3d 872, 877-78 (9th Cir.2002). The court in <em>Nonnette, </em>however, was particularly careful to limit its holding to a narrow class of plaintiffs. The court emphasized that its holding \u201caffects only former prisoners challenging loss of good-time credits, revocation of parole or similar matters; the status of prisoners challenging their underlying convictions or sentences does not change upon release, because they continue to be able to petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 878 n. 7 (citing <em>Spencer, </em>523 U.S. at 7-12).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The court in <em>Nonnette </em>concluded that, under the circumstances of that case (i.e., the loss of 360 days of good-time credits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the exhaustion of administrative remedies, and the unavailability of federal habeas relief), \u201cjustice requires that we vacate the judgment of the District Court and permit Nonnette to proceed with his \u00a7 1983 claims here.\u201d 316 F.3d at 878. There does not appear to be any such justification presented by the circumstances of Chapman\u2019s case, especially given the fact that Chapman abandoned his pursuit of state remedies by failing to file a brief with the Superior Court and subsequently failing to appeal his new sentence. Even the subsequent dismissal of Chapman\u2019s habeas petition (which, despite a probationary sentence that ultimately extended three years into the future, was filed more than a year after he initiated his \u00a7 1983 action, more than three months after the entry of the dismissal order, and prior to exhaustion of state remedies) fails to tip the \u201cjustification\u201d scale in Appellant\u2019s favor. Aside from the mootness determination, the petition would have been subject to dismissal on the ground that Chapman failed to exhaust his state court remedies or procedurally defaulted the claims presented in the \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Chapman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action falls within the purview of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck </em>and the District Court properly dismissed the complaint for failing to satisfy the \u201cfavorable termination\u201d requirement. The District Court\u2019s order will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\">. The District Court's dismissal of Chapman\u2019s complaint was without prejudice. When a District Court has dismissed a complaint without prejudice, the dismissal is not immediately appealable unless the plaintiff cannot amend or declares his or her intention to stand on the complaint. <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951-52 (3d Cir.1976). Chapman contends that he expressed his desire to stand on the complaint as filed in both his objections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation and in his notice of appeal. Additionally, he has unequivocally stated in submissions to this Court that he wishes to stand on his amended complaint. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See Remick v. Manfredy, </em>238 F.3d 248, 254 (3d Cir.2001) (where appellant unequivocally states intent to stand on his complaint to appellate court, Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over the appeal); <em>see also Shapiro v. UJB Financial Corp., </em>964 F.2d 272, 279 (3d Cir.1992) (\u201ca plaintiff can convert a dismissal with leave to amend into a final order by electing to stand upon the original complaint\") (citing <em>Borelli, </em>532 F.2d at 951-52).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\">. There was no indication in the District Court record or in the parties' initial submissions to this Court as to the actual sentence Chapman received for his DUI conviction. The only period of custody referenced by Appellant was a short stay in jail (i.e., just over one week), and it was not clear whether this was immediately after his arrest, during the pendency of the criminal proceedings, or after his conviction. Moreover, no mention was made by the parties of the imposition of a probationary period. Thus, the issue suggested for supplemental briefing referred to a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff who received a short sentence or no sentence at all. It was not until the parties filed supplemental briefs and referenced Chapman's subsequently-filed habeas petition (discussed <em>infra) </em>that the details of his criminal convictions and sentence were made known.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-14\">. On June 21, 1999, three months after the District Court dismissed his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Chapman filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. However, because Appellant had been released from custody on October 8, 1999 and his probationary period expired on April 8, 2001, the District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation issued by the Magistrate Judge and dismissed the petition as moot in an order entered on July 11, 2001. <em>See Chapman v. Commonwealth of Pa., et al., </em>W.D. Pa. Civ. No. 99-CV-00979. It does not appear that Chapman ever appealed the District Court's dismissal order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b107-6\">. Counsel for Appellees St. Francis Central Hospital, Jane Doe Brown, and Dr. John Doe Minshull, incorrectly states that \"at the time Chapman initiated this action on April 19, 1999, he lacked a procedural vehicle to challenge his conviction [as] the Superior Court of Pennsylvania dismissed his appeal for failure to file a brief on March 10, 1999.\" As noted previously, Chapman filed his \u00a7 1983 action on March 10, 1998 (not April 19, 1999), while his direct appeal was still pending before the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
