Sammons appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application. Sammons argues that the prosecutor commented on his decision not to testify. Assuming that the argument was a comment on Sammons\u2019s failure to testify, the comment must be viewed in the context of the trial and reversal is not warranted unless the improper comment had a \u201cclear effect on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Montoya-Ortiz, </em>7 F.3d 1171, 1179 (5th Cir.1993). Curative instructions are considered in analyzing whether an improper remark constitutes reversible error. <em>See United States v. Anchondo-Sandoval, </em>910 F.2d 1234, 1237 (5th Cir.1990). The trial court sustained the objection to the argument and instructed the jury to disregard it. Juries are presumed to follow the instructions of the court. <em>See Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 540-41, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). Additionally, the evidence of Sammons\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. Sammons has not shown that the district court erred in concluding that the state court\u2019s denial of relief on this issue was contrary to clearly established federal law or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Beazley v. Johnson, </em>242 F.3d 248, 255 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Sammons moves for the appointment of appellate counsel. Sammons represented himself adequately in having this court grant his motion for a certificate of appeal-ability (COA). His brief on the issue of the prosecutor\u2019s comment regarding his failure to testify is more than adequate in presenting the claim. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir. 1985). Sammons\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5 th Cir.
