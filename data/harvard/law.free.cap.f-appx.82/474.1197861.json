The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Dominick\u2019s, concluding that Todd presented no direct evidence of discrimination and insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case under the burden-shifting approach in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">On appeal Todd principally argues that his trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance sabotaged his case. However, we need not address the merits of this argument, because ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be grounds for reversal in civil matters. <em>See United States v. 7108 W. Grand Ave., Chicago, III., </em>15 F.3d 632, 635 (7th Cir.1994). Todd\u2019s remedy for his counsel\u2019s allegedly unethical or grossly negligent behavior is a malpractice action against his counsel and not another shot at a trial against Dominick\u2019s. <em>Stanciel v. Gramley, </em>267 F.3d 575, 581 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-21\">Todd\u2019s only comment on the merits of the summary judgment ruling is that the district court\u2019s decision was \u201cincom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>p\u00edete, contaminated, and fraudulent.\u201d This bald assertion does not comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A), which requires that an appellant\u2019s brief \u201ccontain appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Todd does not explain his claim of trial court error and cites no authorities or parts of the record. Although we construe pro se briefs liberally, they still must contain \u201can argument consisting of more than a generalized assertion of error, with citations to supporting authority.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). Todd therefore forfeited appellate review of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Mathis v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>133 F.3d 546, 548 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
