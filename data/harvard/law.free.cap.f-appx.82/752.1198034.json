The District Court sentenced the Appellant to two hundred ten (210) months imprisonment. Dawara filed a notice of appeal, pro se, and we appointed Laurie M. Fierro, Esq., to assist with the appeal. Attorney Fierro filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d <em>493 </em>(1967). Counsel indicated that there are no issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-17\">We have carefully reviewed the Appellant\u2019s brief, along with the responsive brief of the United States and other matters of record. Dewara did not file a pro se brief. We conclude, after our own review of the entire record, that the District Court did not err. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">The motion of defense counsel to withdraw will be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
