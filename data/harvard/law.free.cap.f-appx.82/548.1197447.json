Because the BIA affirmed without opinion the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the opinion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii). The IJ\u2019s denial of relief was based on an adverse credibility determination. We review adverse credibility determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). Because we find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, we deny Mundi\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The IJ in this case pointed to a number of specific and cogent flaws in Mundi\u2019s testimony: (1) Mundi testified that his brother Sher was arrested and held for three days, while Sher stated in his Canadian asylum application that he was detained for seven months; (2) Mundi was inconsistent in his testimony about which sarpanehe<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> aided him in the release from his first arrest; (3) Mundi\u2019s testimony was inconsistent about the events leading up to his second arrest \u2014 he testified at one point that two persons were sent by his father to Mundi\u2019s farmhouse to visit two of Mundi\u2019s brothers when, according to other testimony, those brothers had departed the country months earlier; and (4) Mundi testified that his older brothers \u201cseparated\u201d from the rest of the family in 1970 due to police harassment, but also testified that neither he nor his family had ever been harassed by the police in 1970 or before. Each of these inconsistencies goes to the heart of Mundi\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal because they concern the alleged motivations for, and circumstances surrounding, Mundi\u2019s arrests. For these reasons, we deny Mundi\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">.
