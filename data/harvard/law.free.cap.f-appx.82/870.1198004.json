Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Garrett alleged that actor Chuck Norris and numerous employees of the television show \u2018Walker, Texas Ranger\u201d violated his civil rights by acting as federal law enforcement officers, arresting and harassing him on camera, and causing humiliating photographs of him to be published in <em>People </em>magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">Garrett\u2019s action is time-barred and was properly dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019-20 (5th Cir.1998). In addition, Garrett\u2019s attempts to argue on appeal for tolling the limitation period or beginning it at a later date lack any arguable merit. Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-23\">The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Garrett that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b912-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
