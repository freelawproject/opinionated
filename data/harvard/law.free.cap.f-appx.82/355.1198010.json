Gonzalez\u2019s federal-law claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and his state-law claims were dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy was less than $75,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gonzalez contends that the district court erred by dismissing his RICO claim for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted; that the district court erred by dismissing his state-law claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; and that the district court erred by dismissing his state-law claims with prejudice instead of dismissing them without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-19\">The district court did not err by dismissing Gonzalez\u2019s RICO claim for failure to state a claim. Gonzalez\u2019s factual allegations did not give rise to any of the offenses listed as predicate acts upon which a pattern of racketeering activity could be based.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, dismissal was proper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-20\">The dismissal of Gonzalez\u2019s state-law claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction was not erroneous, as the actual amount in controversy was less than $75,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, because Gonzalez\u2019s civil RICO claim failed on its face to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the district court need not have added the amount requested in conjunction with that claim to the amounts requested in the state-law claims to determine the amount in controversy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Second, Gonzalez\u2019s state-law tort claims were claims of attorney malpractice under Texas law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Gonzalez has failed to have his North Carolina federal conviction overturned; he thus may not pursue any state-law tort claims against the defendants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The amounts sought in conjunction with the state-law tort claims need not have been considered when determining the amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Third, Gonzalez may not obtain punitive damages for breach of contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Gonzalez alleged that he paid defendant de la Grana $10,000 to retain him, and the record from Gonzalez\u2019s North Carolina criminal case indicated that he paid his attorney there $2,000. Gonzalez cannot recover $75,000 in damages. The district court did not err by dismissing the state-law claims for lack of diversity jurisdiction because Gonzalez failed to satisfy the minimum jurisdictional amount.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Finally, the district court erred by dismissing Gonzalez\u2019s state-law claims with prejudice. Because the dismissal of those claims was jurisdictional in nature, we modify the judgment as to Gonzalez\u2019s state-law claims only to operate without prejudice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The district court did not err by dismissing Gonzalez\u2019s civil RICO claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
