Because the BIA summarily affirmed without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir. 2003). Gutierrez has abandoned the issue of the denial of his application for voluntary departure by failing to address that issue in his petition for review. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">Gutierrez argues that he is not subject to removal on grounds of inadmissibility as charged in the Notice to Appear. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). He contends that he was granted temporary resident status as a special agricultural worker (\u201cSAW\u201d) under 8 U.S.C. 1160(a) and that by operation of law, he thereafter became a permanent resident. In the removal proceedings before the IJ, Gutierrez had the \u201cburden of establishing\u201d that he was \u201cclearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and [was] not inadmissible.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A). The record does not compel a finding contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding that Gutierrez \u201cwas never granted [temporary resident] status.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). The IJ\u2019s decision that Gutierrez was inadmissable is not \u201cmanifestly contrary to law.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
