Kimble asserts on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to comply with Rule 8 because he alleges that his complaint stated a claim of racial gerrymandering. Although Kimble\u2019s amended complaint did not comply with the district court\u2019s instruction to set forth a short and plain statement of his claim and was not a model of clarity, it was adequate to inform Defendants of the nature of Kimble\u2019s racial gerrymandering claim and the factual basis for that claim. Such is all that is required under Fed. R. Civ.P. 8. <em>See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); <em>see also Duckworth v. State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws, </em>332 F.3d 769, 776 (4th Cir.2003) (noting that under <em>Shaw v. Reno, </em>509 U.S. 630, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993), \u201ccourts could adjudge a district\u2019s general appearance \u2018bizarre\u2019 in racial gerrymandering eases and from such bizarreness infer discriminatory <em>racial </em>effect\u201d). We also note that the district court did not warn Kimble of the consequences of his failure to comply with the court\u2019s order. <em>See Choice Hotels Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Goodwin &amp; Boone, </em>11 F.3d 469, 471-72 (4th Cir.1993); <em>cf. Doyle v. Murray, </em>938 F.2d 33, 34 (4th Cir.1991) (discussing factors to consider in evaluating involuntary dismissal under Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b), for failure to comply with court order). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal order and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b863-14\"> We express no opinion about the merits of Kimble's claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
