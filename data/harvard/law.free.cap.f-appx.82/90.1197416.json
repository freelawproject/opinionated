Lesesne seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss his successive petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000), for lack of jurisdiction. An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Lesesne has not made the requisite showing. To the extent Lesesne\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 motion, we deny such authorization. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 496, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
