He argues for the first time on appeal that the felony conviction that resulted in his increased sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was an element of the offense that should have been charged in the indictment and that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s felony and aggravated felony provisions are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As he acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b995-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
