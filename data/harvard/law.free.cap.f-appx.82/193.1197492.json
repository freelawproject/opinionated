Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Petitioner Ryan Alan Yocum appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which challenges the sentence imposed following his plea of guilty to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">1. Petitioner argues primarily that third-degree assault under Washington law, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.36.031, is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and therefore that his two convictions for third-degree assault may not serve as a predicate for application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). He also argues that one of his convictions for third-degree assault was \u201cexpunged\u201d and may not be counted for that reason. We need not reach those interesting issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Petitioner was convicted of theft from a person, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.56.030(l)(b), in 1995. That was a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Wofford, </em>122 F.3d 787, 793-94 (9th Cir.1997). For acts committed in a separate incident, Petitioner was convicted of residential burglary, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.52.025, in 1995. That was a violent felony under the ACCA, as Petitioner concedes on appeal and as this court held in <em>United States v. Yocum, </em>225 F.3d 666, 2000 WL 766486 (9th Cir. 2000) (unpublished decision). He was convicted of second-degree assault in 1993. That, as Petitioner has conceded throughout, is a violent felony under the ACCA. Those three violent felonies sufficed to allow the sentencing court to apply the ACCA enhancement. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">2. When considering a federal sentence for a federal crime, we look to federal law alone to determine whether a state crime falls within the federal statutory definition of a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Sherbondy, </em>865 F.2d 996, 1004-05 (9th Cir. 1988). Therefore, it does not avail Petitioner that the State of Washington labeled as \u201cnonviolent\u201d one or more of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty. In view of the settled law on this point, any reliance that Petitioner may have placed on the state-law label for his past crimes as binding the federal government was unreasonable. The ACCA sentence, thus, did not violate Petitioner\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">Petitioner\u2019s citation to <em>United States v. Herron, </em>45 F.3d 340 (9th Cir.1995), does not assist him. There, the defendant acted affirmatively in reliance on a state certificate providing that he lawfully could possess firearms. Here, however, the state never told Petitioner that he could possess the firearm at issue. Petitioner could be under no illusion that his conduct here was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">3. Because the ACCA sentence was proper, Petitioner\u2019s previous appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>argue that a 1994 conviction for third-degree assault did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b236-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
