Ortega contends that Border Patrol Agent Randy Betscher did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to warrant the investigatory stop of Ortega\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">A Border Patrol agent conducting a roving patrol may make a temporary investigatory stop of a vehicle if the agent is aware of specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicle\u2019s occupant is engaged in criminal activity. <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 884, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975). In determining whether a reasonable suspicion exists, the courts must look to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the stop. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273-76, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). Consideration of the relevant factors, viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances and in the light most favorable to the Government, indicates that the district court did not err in concluding that there was reasonable suspicion for the stop. <em>See United States v. Neufeld-Neufeld, </em>338 F.3d 374, 378-82 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1040-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
