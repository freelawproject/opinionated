(ICON) does not literally infringe The Nautilus Group, Inc.\u2019s (Nautilus\u2019s) U.S. Patent No. 4,725,057 (\u2019057 patent) and denied Nautilus\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and for summary judgment of literal infringement. <em>See The Nautilus Group, Inc. v. ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., </em>No. C02-2420P (W.D.Wash. May 16, 2003). Because the district court erred in construing the claims of the \u2019057 patent, this court <em>remands.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-27\">Nautilus owns the \u2019057 patent. The BowFlex\u00ae exercise machine is a commercial embodiment of the invention. The BowFlex\u00ae machine contains rods that bend to create resistance during physical exercise. The Bowflex\u00ae mounts these rods vertically, with one end fixed to a base, and the other end attached to a cable.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-28\">ICON makes a competing device called the CrossBow\u00ae. The CrossBow\u00ae mounts the rods horizontally with two free ends. The horizontal rod attach in their center to a \u201clat tower.\u201d Figure 14 of the \u2019057 patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>illustrates the BowFlex\u00ae machine, shown below alongside the accused CrossBow\u00ae device:</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In December 2002, Nautilus sued ICON for infringement. Nautilus moved for a preliminary injunction to prohibit ICON from making, using or selling the CrossBow\u00ae. In turn, ICON moved for summary judgment of non-infringement. Finally, Nautilus moved for partial summary judgment of literal infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Claim 12 is the only claim at issue in this appeal. Claim 12 states (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7F\">12. In an exercising machine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4U\">a base,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">a plurality for [sic] resilient rods mounted on the base <em>in cantilevered fashion with one end of each of the rods being free,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">a flexible cable adapted to be pulled upon by a person using the machine, and means for connecting the cable selectively to one or more of the rods so that the rods to which the cable is connected bend in bow-like fashion and thereby produce a force which opposes the pull on the cable, the magnitude of the force depending at least in part upon the number of rods to which the cable is connected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">The district court construed \u201ccantilevered fashion\u201d to mean mounted on a base with one fixed end and one free end, thereby excluding rods attached at their centers with two free ends. Based on that construction, the district court found that the CrossBow\u00ae did not satisfy the \u201ccantilevered fashion\u201d limitation of claim 12. On May 16, 2003, the district court granted summary judgment of literal non-infringement and denied Nautilus\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. Nautilus appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment without deference. <em>See Golan v. Pingel Enter., Inc., </em>310 F.3d 1360, 1367 (Fed.Cir.2002). Claim construction is a question of law that this court also reviews without deference. <em>See Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">The district court construed \u201ccantilever\u201d to mean: \u201cA beam or member securely fixed at one end and hanging free at the other end\u201d and stated that \u201ccantilevered fashion\u201d means that \u201cone end of the resil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ient rod is fixed and the other is free.\u201d The district court relied heavily on dictionary definitions in reaching its claim construction. The record contains the dictionary definitions shown below, although the district court considered only the first three:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">A beam or member securely fixed at one end and hanging free at the other end. <em>McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms </em>244 (3d ed.1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">1. A projecting beam or other structure supported only at one end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">2. A beam or other member projecting beyond a fulcrum and supported by a balancing member or a downward force behind the fulcrum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\"><em>Am. Heritage Dictionary </em>(Second College Ed.1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">A projecting beam or other structure supported only at one end. <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(1986). (Civ.Eng.). A beam or girder fixed at one end and free at the other. <em>The Wordsworth Dictionary of Sci. &amp; Tech. </em>(1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">A cantilever beam is fixed (no rotation) at one end. <em>Marks\u2019 Standard Handbook for Mech. Eng\u2019rs </em>(9th ed.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-11\">A beam supported at one end and supporting a load along its length or at its free end.... Familiar examples are the symmetrical paired cantilevers of a seesaw or teeterboard, the beam in a chemical balance, and the unsymmetrical cantilever in the overhang of a roof. <em>McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Sci. &amp; Tech. </em>(7th ed.1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">These definitions of \u201ccantilever\u201d include a beam fixed at one end and also a beam with two free ends in double (or \u201cpaired\u201d) cantilevers. The district court gave priority to the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms. The district court also considered the language of claim 15: \u201cThe exercising machine of claim 12 including a guide member for the cable mounted on the base near the fixed ends of the rods.\u201d The district court concluded that claim 15 supports an interpretation of claim 12 that requires rods with fixed ends. The district court did not rely on the record expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">At the outset, the district court erred by failing to recognize that the term at issue is not simply \u201ccantilevered\u201d but \u201cin cantilevered fashion.\u201d The latter phrase does not mean a literal cantilever, but only a structure that is similar to or in accordance with the principles of a cantilever. Thus the claim language does not require a literal cantilever. Even a literal cantilever, however, need not have only one fixed end.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-15\">In requiring the \u201cfixed end\u201d limitation, the district court erred by improperly importing that limitation from the specification and a few selected dictionaries. A cantilever with one fixed end is not the only possible cantilevered structure. The secondary definition in the American Heritage Dictionary is a \u201cbeam or other member projecting beyond a fulcrum and supported by a balancing member or a downward force.\u201d Drawings of a cantilevered bridge and a hammerhead crane, each showing a cantilever having two free ends, accompany that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-16\">If \u201cmultiple, potentially consistent, dictionary definitions exist for the claim terms in question,\u201d a court must consider \u201cthe rest of the intrinsic record for further context and guidance.\u201d <em>Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC. v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., </em>334 F.3d 1294, 1300 (Fed.Cir.2003). \u201cWhen a term has multiple dictionary definitions, we must consult the intrinsic record \u2018to identify which of the different possible dictionary meanings of the claim terms in issue is the most consistent with the use of the words by the inventor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tehrani v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>Hamilton Medical, Inc., </em>331 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Texas Digital Sys., Inc. v. Telegenix, Inc., </em>308 F.3d 1193, 1203 (Fed.Cir.2002)). A trial court must construe claims \u201c consistently] with the scientific and technical context in which it is used in the patent.\u201d <em>AFG Indus., Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co., </em>239 F.3d 1239, 1248 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The district court\u2019s construction is incorrect, based on the full context of the claim language. Taken in context, \u201cin cantilevered fashion\u201d includes the \u201cdouble cantilever\u201d definition, i.e., \u201ca structure in which a beam projects on both sides beyond its support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Claim 12 also has the limitation <em>\u201cone </em>end of each of the rods being free\u201d (emphasis added). This language may also encompass a rod with two free ends. A rod with two free ends literally includes \u201cone end ... free.\u201d Thus, this limitation requires only at least one free end.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The language of claim 15 does not suggest that claim 12 must include a fixed end limitation. Claim 15 states: \u201cThe exercising machine of claim 12 including a guide member for the cable mounted on the base near <em>the fixed ends </em>of the rods.\u201d In the first place, claim 15 does not explicitly add a limitation to claim 12 that one end of the rods is fixed. More important, claim 15 is a dependent claim with a narrower scope than claim 12 in any event. The trial court noted that the specification of the \u2019057 patent only contains embodiments with rods having one free end and one fixed end. The specification performs a different role from the claims. The specification, among other roles, describes an enabled embodiment of the invention. The claims, on the other hand, recite the outer boundaries of the scope encompassed by the invention. By definition, therefore, the claims may encompass more than the embodiment or embodiments described in the specification. The claims, after all, recite boundaries, not the only characteristics and features of the invention. Thus, a construing court may not limit the claims to the disclosed embodiments without a clear disclaimer in the intrinsic record that limits the invention to these embodiments and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The term cantilever appears only once in any form outside the claims: \u201cThese holes receive respective cantilevered resilient rods or arms 44, the free ends of which extend upward from retainer 36 and base 10.\u201d \u2019057 patent, col. 3, II. 43-45. That descriptive statement in the specification does not preclude a cantilevered structure with two free ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Claim differentiation also weakens any suggestion that claim 12 must include the \u201cfixed end\u201d limitation. While claim 12 contains no express \u201cfixed end\u201d limitation, \u201cfixed end\u201d limitations appear in independent claims 1, 19, and 25. Claims 1, 19, and 25 describe an end of the rod as \u201csecured in a fixed position\u201d or \u201crigidly affixed\u201d and the other end as \u201cfree.\u201d If \u201ccantilevered\u201d meant one fixed end and one free end, the recitations of fixed and free ends in claims 1, 19, and 25 would be surplusage. The district court\u2019s construction improperly renders claim terms superfluous and reads limitations of claim 15 and of the preferred embodiment into the claim. Although it is true that \u201cno canon of claim construction is absolute in its application,\u201d <em>Renishaw PLC, v. Marposs So</em>cieta\u2019 <em>Per Azioni, </em>158 F.3d 1243, 1248 (Fed.Cir.1998), and that surplusage may exist in some claims, <em>see Pickholtz v. Rainbow Tech., Inc., </em>284 F.3d 1365, 1373 (Fed. Cir.2002), these principles show error in the district court\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">This court therefore construes the limitation \u201cin cantilevered fashion with one end of each of the rods being free\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>mean that the rods are mounted with one or both ends free such that the rods have the structure of a single or double cantilever. In the circumstances, we think that the appropriate disposition of this case is to remand it to the district court for reconsideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
