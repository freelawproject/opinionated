Savage appeals the judgment of the district court convicting him on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>counts of a thirty-two count indictment for wire and mail fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering. Having reviewed Savage\u2019s claims in turn, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Savage first asserts that the district court erred in admitting evidence on the basis that its probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial value. We have reviewed the transcripts, the respective briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, and conclude that neither the testimonial nor the recorded evidence admitted at trial was unduly prejudicial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. Accordingly, we deny relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Savage next claims that the Government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by referring to his character and playing to the jury\u2019s emotions during closing argument. As noted by the Government, this court recognizes that \u201c[cjommitted advocates do not always present antiseptic closing arguments.\u201d <em>Bates v. Lee, </em>308 F.3d 411, 422 (4th Cir.2002). Instead, \u201cprosecutors enjoy considerable latitude in presenting arguments to a jury because the adversary system permits the prosecutor to prosecute with earnestness and vigor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). Our review of the prosecutor\u2019s summation, taken in its appropriate context, fails to disclose any inappropriate comment and, as a consequence, this claim warrants no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Savage also contends that the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury in regard to the charges of money laundering constructively and impermissibly amended the indictment. Savage has failed to carry his burden to demonstrate that the jury\u2019s verdict was the result of an erroneous understanding of the law. <em>See United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 243 (4th Cir.1998). Moreover, the record is devoid of any evidence tending to support Savage\u2019s claim that the jury could have expanded the scope of the indictment prior to finding him guilty. Accordingly, we deny relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Savage\u2019s final claim is that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level under the sentencing guidelines for violating a court order. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(4)(C) (2000). Our review of the August 1, 2000, district court order, the transcripts, and the findings of the district court leads us to conclude that the enhancement of Savage\u2019s sentence was amply supported. Accordingly, we deny relief on this final claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">We affirm Savage\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
