Winingear argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not depart downward by the amount of time Winingear already served in state prison for resisting arresting officers and threatening to murder them. Although we lack jurisdiction to review the decision of the district court not to depart downward, we affirm as reasonable the sentence imposed by the district court,</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-21\">In January 2004, Winingear was indicted in the Southern District of Alabama on nineteen counts of mail fraud. Winingear was arrested in Louisville, Kentucky, on the fraud charges and placed under noncustodial supervision of Pretrial Services. Shortly thereafter, Winingear was arrested by Kentucky police for several traffic violations, giving an officer a false name and address, and possession of a forged instrument. He was released on his own recognizance the next day. Because this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>arrest constituted a violation of Winin-gear\u2019s pretrial release, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">On February 18, 2004, a police officer in Clarkesville, Indiana, recognized Winin-gear as wanted and attempted to arrest him. After an altercation, Winingear fled. When pursuing officers cornered Winin-gear, he drew a knife and threatened to kill an officer. Winingear then attempted to steal a truck, failed, and entered a nearby business. The officers chased Win-ingear into the business, where Winingear sprayed an officer in the face with a fire extinguisher before the officers subdued him. Winingear pleaded guilty in Indiana state court to resisting law enforcement and was sentenced to a term of twelve months in prison. Winingear served six months of his sentence in Indiana before he was returned to federal custody for arraignment and plea in the Southern District of Alabama on the nineteen counts of mail fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Winingear pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment. Winingear admitted defrauding people by advertising laptops on eBay and Yahoo!, accepting payment from his victims, and never sending them the promised laptops or refunding their money. Winingear admitted that his fraudulent scheme cost his victims about $19,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">Winingear\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report recommended a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice based on Winingear\u2019s threats and assault on the arresting officers in Indiana. The PSI also recommended that Winingear not receive credit for acceptance of responsibility due to revocation of his bond and arrest for new criminal activity while awaiting trial. Although Winingear states, and the government does not dispute, that the PSI also recommended two criminal history points for his 2004 Indiana conviction, a close review of the PSI reveals that Winin-gear received no criminal history points for his 2004 Indiana conviction. Winin-gear received one criminal history point for a conviction for forgery in April 1998 in Marion County, Indiana, and another criminal history point for a conviction for domestic battery in January 2000 also in Marion County. He received two additional criminal history points because he carried out his mail fraud while under a sentence from the January 2000 conviction, for a total of four criminal history points. The PSI specifically stated that Winingear received no criminal history points from his 2004 Indiana conviction because the offense conduct underlying that conviction formed the basis for the obstruction of justice enhancement and was, therefore, related conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">At the sentencing hearing, Winingear moved for a downward departure to reduce his sentence by the six months he served in Indiana prison for his 2004 conviction. Winingear argued that his 2004 Indiana conviction had already been taken into account in determining his Guideline range, and that the district court could give him a downward departure to reflect that. The district court denied the motion: \u201cI understand that [the 2004 conviction was used in calculating Winingear\u2019s Guideline range]. But since I wouldn\u2019t be inclined to give him a concurrent sentence for that conduct, I don\u2019t feel inclined to give him a downward departure for that either.\u201d The remainder of the sentencing hearing focused primarily on Winingear\u2019s unsuccessful motion for a downward departure based on his health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">During the sentencing hearing, Winin-gear\u2019s counsel stated that she was \u201ctrying to get away from the guideline framework in light of the <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan </em>cases,\u201d and that she \u201cbelieve[d] it would be unreasonable in light of [Winingear\u2019s] medical situation.\u201d The district court responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>by stating that, \u201c[i]n the guideline realm, I don\u2019t believe that a downward departure is appropriate. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to find.\u201d The district court sentenced Winin-gear to twenty-four months of imprisonment. Winingear objected and argued that the sentence of the district court was unreasonable because it was based on an unreasonable and arbitrary element of the Guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-4\">[I]t was unreasonable not to credit Mr. Winingear with the six months that he served in Indiana based upon ... the mandate of 5G1.3(b) specifically indicating that because the conduct was taken into account in establishing his guideline range that it\u2019s mandatory that ... be sentenced. [I]n light of the fact that the Court did rely upon the guidelines in its framework, that ... establishes unreasonableness in the fact that mandatory concurrency was not followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">Although the district court concluded that Winingear\u2019s health problems did not warrant a decreased sentence, it arranged for his medical needs to be met while in prison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-6\">I do sympathize with your situation and I have no intention of allowing your health to be jeopardized by giving you-by sentencing you in any particular manner, and I\u2019m going to direct that the Bureau of Prisons put you in a facility where you can receive adequate treatment and that you get a designation as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-7\">The Court recommends that the defendant be imprisoned at an institution where his diabetes can be controlled and taken care of and also where a mental health treatment program is available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-8\">The Court further directs the Bureau of Prisons to get a designation to such an institution forthwith as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-9\">The district court explained that the Guideline range was appropriate under the facts of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-10\">[I]n a white-collar case when it comes time for sentencing everyone feels sorry for the person who did the crime. And you don\u2019t generally see the victims in here. There aren\u2019t any victims in here. They are all from places other than Mobile. But you affected 21 lives by basically stealing from them over the internet. Each one of those people were affected in a particular way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-11\">I\u2019ve read victim impact statements from some of them, not from all of them. And it\u2019s up to a sentencing judge to balance the harm you did to society with your particular needs at the time of sentencing. And one of the real effects of sentencing in a white-collar case is punishment. People whose lives have been affected-and there are 21 people in this case-they have a right to see you punished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-12\">I have considered the statutory sentencing in this case, I have considered the guideline range, and I find the guideline range is an appropriate range for sentencing in your case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-13\">The Court finds that the recommended sentencing range is appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-14\">And the sentence imposed does address the seriousness of the offense and the sentencing objectives of punishment, deterrence, and incapacitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-15\">Winingear appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-16\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-17\">After the district court has accurately calculated the Guideline range, it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence\u201d that we review for reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>ableness. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). Additionally, we review <em>de novo </em>our subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Webb v. Worldwide Flight </em>Serv., <em>Inc., </em>407 F.3d 1192, 1194 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-8\">Winingear argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because the district court did not decrease the sentence to reflect Winin-gear\u2019s time served in st\u00e1te prison. Winin-gear\u2019s argument has two components: first, he challenges the decision of the district court not to depart downward when calculating the appropriate Guideline range; and, second, he challenges the final sentence as unreasonable. Winingear\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">\n<em>A. We Have No Jurisdiction to Review the Decision of a District Court Not to Depart Downward.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-10\">Winingear argues that \u201cit was unreasonable for the district court to deny Winin-gear credit under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.23 for the six months he served in prison for the Indiana offense.\u201d Section 5K2.23 provides that a downward departure \u201cmay be appropriate\u201d if a defendant has completed serving a term of imprisonment and would be eligible for sentence adjustment under section 5G1.3(b) had his sentence been undischarged at the time of sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.23. The section also provides that, if the district court grants such a departure, the departure \u201cshould be fashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Winin-gear misunderstands our scope of reasonableness review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">We do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178 <em>(\u201cBooker </em>established a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard for the sentence finally imposed on a defendant.\u201d). We first rfeview decisions of the district court regarding Guideline calculations to ensure that the district court calculated the Guideline range.correctly. <em>Id. </em>In that light, we construe Winingear\u2019s challenge of the decision of the district court not to depart downward as a challenge of the preliminary application of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-13\">After <em>Booker, </em>our review of decisions regarding downward departures remains limited. Before <em>Booker, </em>we stated repeatedly that section 3742(a) \u00f3f Title 18 of the United States Code left us without jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s appeal of a discretionary decision of the district court to not apply a downward departure, so long as the district court did hot incorrectly believe that it lacked the authority to apply a departure. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hadaway, </em>998 F.2d 917, 919 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cWe may not ... review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure on the merits. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).\u201d); <em>United States v. Gomez-Villa, </em>59 F.3d 1199, 1202 (11th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Hadaway). </em>Although the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>excised section 3742(e), it left section 3742(a) intact. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765-66. We agree with the Eighth and Tenth Circuits that our precedent. similarly remains intact, and, therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the'decision of the district court not to apply a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Frokjer, </em>415 F.3d 865, 875 (8th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker </em>did not alter the \u201crule that a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart downward is unreviewable.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sierra-Castillo, </em>405 F.3d 932, 936 (10th Cir.2005) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>(same). The parties do not dispute that the district court recognized its authority to depart downward, and we may not review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\"><em>B. Winingear\u2019s Sentence </em>Was <em>Not Unreasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">Winingear\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable also fails. Before <em>Booker, </em>we reviewed departures from the Guidelines for reasonableness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Blas, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir.1999). That review required us to determine whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable in the context of the factors outlined in section 3553(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code. <em>Blas, </em>360 F.3d at 1274. Following <em>Booker, </em>these factors continue to guide our review: \u201cSection 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Booker, 125 S.Ct. </em>at 766. These factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline range, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, and provide the defendant with needed medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">The government urges us to hold that sentences within the Guideline range are per se reasonable, but we need not address whether or how much deference is owed sentences within the applicable Guideline range to determine that Winingear\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court imposed a sentence one-tenth the length of the twenty-year statutory maximum sentence for mail fraud that does not affect a financial institution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Winingear defrauded 21 people of a total of $19,600, had multiple previous convictions, committed this crime while still under sentence for a previous crime, violated his bond, and threatened to murder arresting officers as he fled from them. The district court took care that its sentence provided Winingear with needed medical care. In the light of the factors outlined in section 3553(a), the sentence of the district court was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\"><em>TV. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">The sentence of the district court was reasonable and is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
