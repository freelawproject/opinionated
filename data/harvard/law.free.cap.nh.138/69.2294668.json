The Derry Education Association (association) appeals, arguing that the impasse-resolution procedures set out in RSA chapter 273-A (1987 &amp; Supp. 1992) mandate the submission of the fact-finder\u2019s report to the legislative body of the school board for a binding vote, regardless of whether the fact-finder\u2019s report concerns purely non-cost issues. We agree in part and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The facts are not in dispute. The board and the association reached an impasse in their attempts to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for the 1991-92 school year. They were unable to settle their differences through mediation. <em>See </em>RSA 273-A: 12, I (1987). Pursuant to RSA 273~A:12 (1987), three non-cost items were submitted for fact-finding: (1) just cause/teachers\u2019 rights; (2) evaluation procedures; and (3) reduction in force. The association accepted the fact-finder\u2019s report, but the board rejected it. The association asked the board to submit the report to its legislative body, the school district, pursuant to RSA 273:A-12, III (1987). The board refused and successfully petitioned the PELRB for a declaratory judgment that it need not submit a fact-finder\u2019s report on only non-cost items to the school district for approval or rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">At the outset we note that the parties apparently have come to an agreement with respect to the 1991-92 contract. We go forward with a review of the issues, however, in the public interest. <em>See Basinow v. Manchester, </em>111 N.H. 184, 185, 278 A.2d 346, 348 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> While the PELRB is vested with the authority to initially define and interpret the terms of RSA chapter 273-A, this court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute. <em>Appeal of Manchester Bd. of School Comm., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>129 N.H. 151, 152, 523 A.2d 114, 115 (1987). We will reverse the findings of the PELRB only where they are erroneous as a matter of law, unjust or unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 152-53, 523 A.2d at 115. In this case, we find that the PELRB erred in its interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"> To determine legislative intent, we first look to the plain language of the provision, <em>City of Portsmouth v. Assoc. of Portsmouth Teachers, </em>134 N.H. 642, 648, 597 A.2d 1063, 1067 (1991), considered in the context of the statute as a whole, <em>Blue Mountain Forest Ass\u2019n v. Town of Croydon, </em>119 N.H. 202, 204, 400 A.2d 55, 57 (1979). Where reasonably possible, statutes should be construed as consistent with each other. <em>Swiezynski v. Civiello, </em>126 N.H. 142, 148, 489 A.2d 634, 639 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">At issue here is RSA 273-A:12, III:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201cIf either the full membership of the employee organization or the board of the public employer rejects the neutral party\u2019s recommendations, his findings and recommendations shall be submitted to the legislative body of the public employer, which shall vote to accept or reject so much of his recommendations as otherwise is permitted by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The association argues, and we agree, that the plain language of the statute requires that the entire fact-finder\u2019s report be submitted to the legislative body of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">We do not agree, however, with the association\u2019s assertion that the legislative body\u2019s vote on non-cost items can bind either the school board or the association. RSA 273-A:12, III requires the submission of the fact-finder\u2019s report, but only allows the legislative body to \u201cvote to accept or reject so much of his recommendations as otherwise is permitted by law.\u201d Basic statutory construction rules require that \u201call of the words of a statute must be given effect and that the legislature is presumed not to have used superfluous or redundant words.\u201d <em>Merrill v. Great Bay Disposal Serv., </em>125 N.H. 540, 543, 484 A.2d 1101, 1103 (1984). The association\u2019s argument that the legislative body\u2019s vote on the instant fact-finder\u2019s report would be binding ignores the phrase \u201cas otherwise is permitted by law\u201d contained in RSA 273-A:12, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">We read \u201cas otherwise is permitted by law\u201d to limit the legislative body\u2019s authority consistent with the remainder of RSA chapter 273-A. <em>See Swiezynski, </em>126 N.H. at 148, 489 A.2d at 639. School boards, not legislative bodies, have authority to negotiate and enter into collective bargaining agreements. <em>See Appeal of Sanborn Regional School Bd., </em>133 N.H. 513, 519-20, 579 A.2d 282, 285 (1990). Through<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>out RSA chapter 273-A the legislature described the responsibilities of legislative bodies only with respect to cost items. The chapter defines legislative bodies as the bodies \u201chaving the power to appropriate public money,\u201d RSA 273-A:l, VII (1987), and cost items as benefits requiring such an appropriation, RSA 273-A:l, IV (1987). In the context of impasse resolution, RSA 273-A: 12, V (1987) permits the parties to adopt various \u201clawful procedures ... as the parties may agree upon; providing that no such procedures shall bind the legislative body on matters regarding cost items.\u201d Further, the chapter expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cOnly cost items shall be submitted to the legislative body of the public employer for approval. If the legislative body rejects any part of the submission, or while accepting the submission takes any action which would result in a modification of the terms of the cost item submitted to it, either party may reopen negotiations on all or part of the entire agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">RSA 273-A:3, II(b) (1987); <em>see City of Portsmouth, </em>134 N.H. at 649-50, 597 A.2d at 1068 (interpreting section to allow legislative bodies authority only to review cost items in agreements reached through impasse resolution).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">RSA 273-A: 12, IV also supports this interpretation, for it provides that \u201c[i]f the impasse is not resolved following the action of the legislative body, negotiations shall be reopened.\u201d Had the legislature intended that the vote of the legislative body be binding on all issues, it could have so stated. As the school board argues, it could have provided for impasses to be resolved <em>by </em>rather than <em>following </em>action of the legislative body. Indeed, the two paragraphs previous to paragraph IV do speak more clearly about voting authority: \u201cIf either negotiating team rejects\u201d or \u201c[i]f either the full membership of the employee organization or the board of the public employer rejects\u201d the findings of the fact-finder, then the fact-finder\u2019s report is submitted to the next level for review. <em>See </em>RSA 273-A:12, II \u2014 III. Had the legislature intended that the legislative body\u2019s vote bind the parties, it could have used the same language in paragraph IV thus requiring that the negotiations be reopened only if the legislative body also rejected the fact-finder\u2019s report. The legislature, however, chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">We reject the school board\u2019s argument that requiring submission of a fact-finder\u2019s report to the legislative body for a non-binding vote on non-cost items is \u201cabsurd,\u201d and thus contrary to our rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>statutory interpretation. <em>See Kalloch v. Board of Trustees, </em>116 N.H. 443, 445, 362 A.2d 201, 203 (1976). On the contrary, according to a memorandum to the PELRB from the attorney assigned from the speaker\u2019s staff to assist the conference committee in negotiating and drafting RSA chapter 273-A:12, part of its purpose is \u201cto broaden participation in impasse negotiations\u201d and to make the parties vulnerable to \u201cthe publicity that will no doubt attend an impasse.\u201d Michael LaFontaine, Memorandum to Chairman of New Hampshire Public Employee Labor Relations Board (November 25, 1975) (unpublished memorandum, on file under legislative history with the PELRB). Submission of the fact-finder\u2019s report to the legislative body will likely heighten public scrutiny of the negotiations, and the expression of the legislative body\u2019s position on the report may increase the pressure on the parties to reach agreement. One of the legislative goals will thus be achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Accordingly, we hold that RSA 273-A:12, III requires that the fact-finder\u2019s report be submitted in its entirety to the legislative body for review, but that the legislative body may not bind the parties by a vote on non-cost items.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
