Gilpatric argues that the department erred in not accepting the dual diagnosis found in a previous superior court order, and in disregarding her expert\u2019s opinion as to impairment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Gilpatric had been employed at the International Packaging Corporation as a factory assembly-line worker for nearly fifteen years when, in early 1988, she began to experience tingling and numbness in both her hands and forearms. Her condition was diagnosed as car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>pal tunnel syndrome, which results from a narrowing of the space between the forearm and hand (carpal tunnel) or an enlarging of the structures within the wrist, causing compression of the median nerve. 3B R. Gray <em>&amp; </em>L. Gordy, Attorneys\u2019 Textbook Of Medicine \u00b6 100.54, at 100-72 to 100-73 (1988). After surgery on her right wrist in April 1988, Gilpatric returned to the factory. She stopped work at the end of 1988, however, because of problems in her left wrist that eventually led to surgery in March 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">After an August 22, 1990, hearing at the department concerning Gilpatric\u2019s cooperation with vocational rehabilitation under RSA 281-A:25 (Supp. 1989) (amended 1990) and the extent of her disability under RSA 281-A:48 (Supp. 1993) (paragraph V effective until Jan. 1, 1994) (amended effective Jan. 1, 1994), the department reduced Gilpatric\u2019s benefits from temporary total disability to the diminished earning capacity rate. The petitioner\u2019s <em>de novo </em>appeal to the superior court, pursuant to the then-existing appeal procedure under RSA 281-A:48, <em>V, </em>resulted in the reversal of the department\u2019s decision and the reinstatement of temporary total disability compensation. The court stated in its order of April 21, 1992, that the \u201cnature of Ms. Gilpatric\u2019s injuries is bilateral carpal tunnel/overuse syndrome . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The final hearing before the department was held on December 10, 1992, after Gilpatric made a request for a permanent impairment award pursuant to RSA281-A:32. In this proceeding, the petitioner\u2019s expert, Dr. Rex Carr, presented a rating of thirty-one percent impairment, based on a diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and overuse syndrome, while the insurance carrier\u2019s expert, Dr. Kenneth O\u2019Neil, whose diagnosis was solely bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, rated it as eight percent impairment. On December 21, 1992, the department determined that Gilpatric was entitled to an eight percent permanent impairment award. Her motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Prior to January 1, 1994, permanent impairment awards of the labor commissioner were final, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:32, XII (Supp. 1993) (effective until Jan. 1, 1994), and the appropriate remedy for a dispute was certiorari. <em>Petition of Blackford, </em>138 N.H. 132, 133, 635 A.2d 501, 502 (1993). <em>But see </em>Laws 1993, ch. 226 (effective Jan. 1, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Gilpatric first argues that the superior court\u2019s finding in the <em>de novo </em>appeal regarding her diagnosis is entitled to preclusive effect in this proceeding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">If a prior judgment is to estop a party in a later action from relitigating an issue, then at a minimum the issue subject to estoppel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>must be identical in each action, the first action must have resolved the issue finally on the merits, and the party to be estopped must have appeared in the first action, or have been in privity with someone who did so. <em>Petition of Breau, </em>132 N.H. 351, 360, 565 A.2d 1044, 1049 (1989). The party to be estopped must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the finding must have been essential to the first judgment. <em>Morin v. J.H. Valliere Co., </em>113 N.H. 431, 434, 309 A.2d 153, 155 (1973); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The issue in the prior hearing before the superior court was whether Gilpatric was sufficiently disabled to continue receiving temporary total disability benefits rather than diminished earning capacity benefits (for partial disability status). As to this issue of work capacity, Dr. Carr testified in his deposition that Gilpatric suffers from bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome which is \u201ca subset of overuse syndrome,\u201d plus a \u201csecond component of the muscular problem in the arms and wrist.\u201d Dr. Carr also stated that Gilpatric\u2019s total impairment was thirty-one percent. The superior court\u2019s order indicates that the court considered the deposition testimony useful \u201cin detailing Ms. Gilpatric\u2019s physical symptom[at]ology\u201d and in describing the \u201cnature of Ms. Gilpatric\u2019s injuries\u201d to be \u201cbilateral carpal tunnel/overuse syndrome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We question whether the threshold requirement for collateral estoppel, namely the existence of a finding by the trial court, is met by this casual language in the trial court order. Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the superior court made such a finding, the issues were not identical. The question before the department in December 1992 was whether the petitioner was entitled to a permanent impairment award. This issue is distinct from the issue raised in the superior court of the claimant\u2019s work capacity for purposes of temporary total disability compensation. Further, the issue before the superior court was one of Gilpatric\u2019s condition <em>at that time. </em>The court made no finding of permanency, but rather reinstated <em>temporary </em>total disability benefits. The issue before the department, however, was one of Gilpatric\u2019s condition some eight months later. <em>See Ainsworth v. Claremont, </em>108 N.H. 55, 56-57, 226 A.2d 867, 869-70 (1967). Gilpatric\u2019s diagnosis also was not essential to the superior court\u2019s judgment because a finding as to her work capacity did not depend upon the precise nature of her injuries, nor the exact scope of her medical diagnosis. <em>See Morin, </em>113 N.H. at 434, 309 A.2d at 155. In sum, the superior court\u2019s order did not compel the department to accept the court\u2019s description of Gilpatric\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Gilpatric next argues that the hearings officer erred by accepting the eight percent permanent impairment rating of the insurance carrier\u2019s expert, Dr. O\u2019Neil, whose analysis of her injury was solely bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Gilpatric contends that the hearings officer should have accepted the thirty-one percent permanent impairment rating of Dr. Carr because it better reflects the description of overuse syndrome <em>and </em>bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome mentioned in the superior court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u201cIn the event of a dispute as to the amount of compensation or the percentage of permanent partial loss or both, the commissioner shall determine the award to be made on the basis of competent medical evidence. The commissioner\u2019s findings shall be final.\u201d RSA 281-A:32, XII (Supp. 1993) (effective until Jan. 1,1994). <em>But see </em>Laws 1993, ch. 226 (effective Jan. 1, 1994). We will not disturb a hearings officer\u2019s factual findings or the decision based thereon if supported by competent evidence in the record. <em>Petition of Blake, </em>137 N.H. 43, 49, 623 A.2d 741, 745 (1993). When the record contains competent expert medical evidence that supports the determination, it is not ordinarily reversible even if contrary testimony in the record would support another result. <em>Id. </em>The hearings officer did not err in disregarding the testimony of Dr. Carr because we afford the hearings officer discretion to credit or discredit the testimony of expert witnesses. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We hold that Dr. O\u2019Neil\u2019s diagnosis and evaluation constitute competent medical testimony that supports the hearings officer\u2019s decision. Dr. O\u2019Neil\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cbilateral carpal tunnel syndrome with bilateral carpal tunnel releases\u201d matched the diagnoses of other physicians, including that of Gilpatric\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Noboru Murakami, who examined her and submitted reports to the department. Dr. O\u2019Neil\u2019s calculation of eight percent permanent impairment, following the \u201cGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment\u201d published by the American Medical Association, is also found to be reliable. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:32, XIV (Supp. 1993); N.H. Admin. Rules, Lab 514.03. Since the department based its decision on a competent diagnosis, we reject Gilpatric\u2019s contention that the American Medical Association guidelines were misapplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
