On appeal, the defendant asks us to clarify the procedure that appellate counsel and this court should follow in a criminal appeal when appellate counsel has reviewed the record and concluded that the appeal presents only \u201cfrivolous\u201d issues. The parties have briefed and argued the merits and drawbacks of the <em>Anders </em>brief, <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738 (1967), and the so-called \u201cIdaho rule\u201d spawned by <em>State v. McKenney, </em>98 Idaho 551, 568 P.2d 1213 (1977). We hold that the efficiency and integrity of the appellate process are better ensured by the adoption of a modified Idaho rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\n<em>I. The Anders Procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">In <em>Anders, </em>the defendant challenged California\u2019s then-existing appellate procedure. Appellate counsel had reviewed the record and informed the appellate court by letter that the appeal had no merit. 386 U.S. at 739. The court then denied the defendant\u2019s request for the appointment of another attorney, but allowed him to file a <em>pro se </em>brief, to which the State responded, and a reply brief. <em>Id. </em>at 740. The court examined the record and unanimously affirmed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that this procedure violated the defendant\u2019s right to full appellate review, <em>id. </em>at 742, because the defendant is entitled to counsel that \u201cacts in the role of an active advocate in behalf of his client, as opposed to that of <em>amicus curiae.\u201d Id. </em>at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">In an effort to ensure zealous appellate advocacy, <em>Anders </em>rejected the no-merit letter, favoring a two-step procedure instead. First, appellate counsel must make a \u201cconscientious examination\u201d of the record and, if the appeal is \u201cwholly frivolous,\u201d move to withdraw. <em>Id. </em>The motion should be \u201caccompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant is then provided a copy of the so-called <em>\u201cAnders </em>brief\u201d and allowed an opportunity to submit a <em>pro se </em>brief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Second, the appellate court undertakes an independent examination of the record to determine whether the appeal is \u201cwholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If it is, the court may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, if the court finds any of the legal points arguable on their merits, and therefore not frivolous, it must appoint new counsel to fully brief those issues. Id.; <em>see also Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83-85 (1988) (failure to appoint new appellate counsel after an independent review of the record had revealed non-frivolous issues violated <em>Anders).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Both the State and the defendant acknowledge that an independent judicial review of the record, as guaranteed by <em>Anders, </em>benefits a defendant because it protects him or her from inadequate representation by appellate counsel. As the defendant argues, however, such a review may be prejudiced by the fact that appellate counsel has already determined, after a \u201cconscientious examination\u201d of the record, that the appeal is wholly frivolous. <em>See McKenney, </em>98 Idaho at 552, 568 P.2d at 1214. In addition, the <em>Anders </em>approach puts counsel at odds with the client, forcing counsel into the awkward position of arguing against the client before the reviewing court, and leading the defendant to conclude that his or her interests have been compromised. <em>See State v. Gates, </em>466 S.W.2d 681, 684 (Mo. 1971) (citing ABA Advisory Committee commentary). Finally, the <em>Anders </em>procedure places the appellate court in the inappropriate role of defense counsel, forcing the court to devise and recommend viable legal arguments for subsequent appellate counsel. In making such recommendations, the appellate court may appear to have lost its impartiality, displaying a potential bias in favor of any arguments it recommends.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Although most States follow the <em>Anders </em>procedure, <em>see </em>75B Am. Jur. 2d <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 1950 (1992), the ABA Standards and several state courts have declined to conform with its guidelines. <em>See </em>ABA Standards For Criminal Justice, The Defense Function, Standard 4-8.3, <em>reprinted in </em>49 Crim. L. Rep. (BNA) No. 2, at 2020-21 (Apr. 10, 1991); <em>see also Commonwealth v. Moffett, </em>383 Mass. 201, 205-07, 418 N.E.2d 585, 590-91 (1981); <em>Gates, </em>466 S.W.2d at 683-84; <em>Sanchez v. State, </em>85 Nev. 95, 97-98, 450 P.2d 793, 794-95 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">This court, in the past, has utilized the <em>Anders </em>procedure to order counsel to file a brief on behalf of the defendant referring to matters in the record that might arguably support the defendant\u2019s appeal. <em>See State v. Fleury, </em>111 N.H. 294, 295, 282 A.2d 873, 874 (1971). We have also conducted an independent review of the record in a case in which defense counsel sought leave to withdraw, having found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>appeal to be without merit. <em>See State v. Richard, </em>109 N.H. 322, 322, 251 A.2d 326, 327 (1969). Nevertheless, it is our opinion that <em>Anders </em>presents the minimum level of protection to which a criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled on appeal. <em>See McKenney, </em>98 Idaho at 553, 568 P.2d at 1215. We therefore do not view <em>Anders </em>as having created a constitutional mandate not subject to any modification. As noted above, the <em>Anders </em>procedure entails serious drawbacks that warrant our review of alternative proposals, such as the so-called \u201cIdaho rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>II. The Idaho Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The Idaho Supreme Court, in <em>McKenney, </em>noted that during the years it adhered to the procedure set forth in <em>Anders, </em>it never granted an attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw on the basis that the client\u2019s appeal was frivolous and without merit. <em>McKenney, </em>98 Idaho at 552, 568 P.2d at 1214. The Idaho court held that \u201conce counsel is appointed to represent an indigent client during appeal on a criminal case, no withdrawal will thereafter be permitted on the basis that the appeal is frivolous or lacks merit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In another case, a District of Columbia Court of Appeals judge argued strenuously that the court should not have granted appellate counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw in a typical <em>Anders </em>situation, identifying at least two nonfrivolous issues that could have been raised on appeal. <em>Gale v. United States, </em>429 A.2d 177, 178-81 (D.C. App.) (Ferren, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 893 (1981). Interpreting <em>McKenney, </em>Judge Ferren stated a preference for the \u201cIdaho rule,\u201d which would require counsel to choose the appellant\u2019s strongest argument, however weak, and argue it to the court as forcefully as possible. <em>Id. </em>at 182. In doing so, according to Judge Ferren, appellate counsel would be compelled to investigate and brief an issue that \u201cmay be less frivolous than it initially appears.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The State would then respond to the argument, and the appellate court, rather than undertaking an independent review of the entire record, would decide the case on the merits of the issue or issues raised. Judge Ferren observed that the Idaho rule thus preserves the adversarial nature of criminal appeals, which \u201cis much to be preferred over [the <em>Anders] </em>process in which the appellate judge feels obliged to act as a lawyer and the appellate lawyer feels constrained to rule as a judge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\n<em>III. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The State insists that adoption of the Idaho rule in New Hampshire would lead appellate advocates to compromise their ethical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>duty \u201cnot [to] bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous.\u201d N.H. R. Prof. Conduct 3.1. We agree with the State that, on occasion, adherence to the Idaho rule may require appellate counsel to bring a frivolous appeal. <em>See generally State v. Blum, </em>132 N.H. 396, 401, 566 A.2d 1131, 1134 (1989) (defining \u201cfrivolous\u201d). Such instances, however, would be extremely rare, especially in light of the fact that it is not considered frivolous to make \u201ca good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d N.H. R. Prof. Conduct 3.1. In addition, the ABA Model Code Comments to Rule 3.1 state that \u201c[an] action is not frivolous even though the lawyer believes that the client\u2019s position ultimately will not prevail.\u201d An action cannot be considered frivolous, therefore, if the lawyer is able \u201ceither to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">An appeal need not be frivolous under the Idaho rule if, for example, appellate counsel argues in good faith to extend, modify, or reverse existing law. Provided that appellate counsel has a good faith basis for doing so, it would also not be frivolous, for example, to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict the defendant. <em>See Gale, </em>429 A.2d at 178-81 (Ferren, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We hold that the Idaho rule preserves the integrity of the attorney-client relationship better than a strict adherence to <em>Anders </em>does. In addition, the appellate process is better served by prohibiting the withdrawal of appellate counsel because the court will spend \u201cless time and energy . . . directly reviewing the case on the merits\u201d and, assuming a nonfrivolous argument exists, \u201crefusing to permit withdrawal would also obviate any need to substitute counsel to argue the appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Moffett, </em>383 Mass. at 206-07, 418 N.E.2d at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">We therefore adopt the following procedure, drawn largely from the ABA Standards. <em>See </em>ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, The Defense Function, <em>supra, </em>Standard 4-8.3; <em>see also </em>Sup. Ct. R. 32. Counsel first must discuss with the defendant whether to appeal. If, in counsel\u2019s estimation, the appeal lacks merit or is frivolous, counsel should so inform the defendant and seek to persuade the defendant to abandon the appeal. If the defendant chooses, notwithstanding counsel\u2019s advice, to proceed with the appeal, counsel must prepare and file the notice of appeal, including all arguable issues. For cases in which a transcript is required, <em>see Bundy v. Wilson, </em>815 F.2d 125, 135 (1st Cir. 1987); Sup. Ct. R. 7, a transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>shall be prepared and provided to the defendant. After appellate counsel is ordered to file a statement of reasons why the appeal should be accepted, <em>see Bundy, </em>815 F.2d at 135, or a brief, counsel must thoroughly examine the record and again determine whether any nonfrivolous arguments exist. If counsel concludes that the appeal is frivolous, counsel should again advise the defendant to withdraw the appeal. If the defendant decides not to withdraw the appeal, counsel must file a statement of reasons or a brief that argues the defendant\u2019s case as well as possible. Counsel cannot concede that the appeal is frivolous. If an appeal is truly frivolous, counsel\u2019s accurate summary of the facts and law will make that obvious. Thereafter, the appeal will proceed in the normal course.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">As we have noted, our adoption of this procedure may, on rare occasions, require appellate counsel to assert a frivolous issue before this court. Accordingly, we create an exception to New Hampshire Rule of Professional Conduct 3.1 for such conduct. We caution, however, that under the procedure we adopt today, appellate counsel is still otherwise absolutely obliged not to deceive or mislead the court. <em>See </em>ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, The Defense Function, <em>supra, </em>Standard 4-8.3 (c). Such deception would include a misstatement of the facts of the case, or a misapplication of the law to those facts. <em>Cf. McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, </em>486 U.S. 429, 438 n.10 (1988) (unifying the terms \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d and \u201cwithout merit\u201d under the rubric \u201clacks any basis in law or fact\u201d). In addition, counsel must not deliberately omit facts or authority that directly contradict the argument. <em>See id. </em>at 440-41 <em>&amp; </em>n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Although our holding today forecloses counsel\u2019s ability to withdraw on the basis of an appeal\u2019s perceived frivolousness, it is our view that the procedure we adopt here, while different than that adopted by <em>Anders, </em>does not diminish a defendant\u2019s right to zealous appellate advocacy. <em>See Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In the instant case, if the defendant chooses not to proceed with her appeal, counsel shall withdraw the appeal forthwith, and shall include the signature of the defendant on the motion to withdraw the appeal. On the other hand, if the defendant chooses to proceed with her appeal, counsel shall within thirty days file a brief in a manner consistent with this opinion. If the defendant files a brief, the State shall file its responsive brief thirty days thereafter. If the defendant neither withdraws the appeal nor files a brief within thirty days, the appeal will be deemed waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
