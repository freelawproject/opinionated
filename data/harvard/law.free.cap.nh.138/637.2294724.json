Meagher </em>on the brief and orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b652-6\"><em>Devine &amp; Nyquist, </em>of Manchester <em>(Merrick C.

We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">On September 23, 1988, Rooney was involved in a work-related automobile accident. As a result of the accident, Rooney collected approximately $100,000 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits under a policy issued by Fireman\u2019s Fund to Rooney\u2019s employer, Rooney Enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">At the time of the accident, Rooney was a named insured, along with Rooney Enterprises, under an automobile policy issued by Merchants Mutual Insurance Group (Merchants), which contained a $500,000 uninsured motorist endorsement. After settling with the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier in 1990 for $25,000, Rooney pursued an uninsured motorist claim against Merchants and separately filed a petition for declaratory judgment to determine whether Fireman\u2019s Fund would be entitled to a lien against any uninsured motorist benefits he might receive. On the uninsured motorist claim, Rooney was awarded $225,000, less the $25,000 collected from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier. Thereafter, the trial court granted summary judgment to Fireman\u2019s Fund on the question of the lien. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Rooney first argues that Fireman\u2019s Fund does not have a valid lien on the benefits of his uninsured motorist coverage because the workers\u2019 compensation insurance agreement between Rooney and Fireman\u2019s Fund contains no plain language that would support such a lien. We need not engage in an interpretation of the policy language at issue, however, because, as we have consistently held, the rights and remedies of parties under the workers\u2019 compensation law, RSA ch. 281-A (Supp. 1993), \u201care purely statutory. The nature and extent of compensation to the injured employee as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>extent and manner by which a compensation payor can be reimbursed is governed by the express statutory language and that which can be fairly implied therefrom.\u201d <em>Bilodeau v. Oliver Stores, Inc., </em>116 N.H. 83, 87, 352 A.2d 741, 744 (1976) (citation omitted); <em>see also Lakin v. Daniel Marr &amp; Son Co., </em>126 N.H. 730, 731-32, 495 A.2d 1299, 1301 (1985). Thus, even if Fireman\u2019s Fund had neglected to include expressly in its policy its right to assert a lien against Rooney\u2019s uninsured motorist benefits, its right to assert such a lien would nevertheless be governed and protected by an applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>Cf. Lakin, </em>126 N.H. at 731-32, 495 A.2d at 1301 (workers\u2019 compensation acts create rights all their own).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The statute applicable to this case, RSA 281-A:13, I (Supp. 1993), provides that the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier \u201cshall have a lien on the amount of . . . benefits recovered by the employee,\u201d RSA 281-A:13, I(b), under \u201ca contractual obligation to pay benefits under the uninsured motorist provision of any motor vehicle insurance policy.\u201d RSA 281-A:13, I(a)(2). We have already held that this provision expressly grants to the workers\u2019 compensation carrier exactly what it purports to grant; namely, a statutory lien on the employee\u2019s uninsured motorist recovery. <em>Carter v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>135 N.H. 406, 409, 605 A.2d 221, 222 (1992). As we noted in <em>Carter, </em>the statute upholds the principle that \u201c \u2018the injured work[er] should not be allowed to keep the entire amount of both his [or her] compensation award and his [or her] common law recovery which would amount to a double recovery.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bilodeau, </em>116 N.H. at 87, 352 A.2d at 744). Furthermore, the statute ensures that the right to assert a workers\u2019 compensation lien depends not upon the adequacy of the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance coverage, but upon the actual liability of the third party tortfeasor, which is the underlying predicate for the assertion of a workers\u2019 compensation lien. <em>See Bilodeau, </em>116 N.H. at 87, 352 A.2d at 744. Recognizing a carrier\u2019s right to assert a workers\u2019 compensation lien on an employee\u2019s uninsured motorist benefits thus avoids rewarding employees for the \u201cfortuity\u201d of experiencing a collision with an uninsured tortfeasor. <em>See generally Harris v. New Castle County, </em>513 A.2d 1307, 1309 (Del. 1986); <em>Midland Ins. Co. v. Colatrella, </em>102 N.J. 612, 616-18, 510 A.2d 30, 32-33 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Rooney correctly notes that a majority of jurisdictions disfavor workers\u2019 compensation liens on uninsured motorist benefits, allowing employees to retain both workers\u2019 compensation and uninsured motorist benefits. <em>See </em>2A A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Compensation \u00a7 71.23(a), at 14-28 to 14-33 (1993). We do not find such case law persuasive, as most of the relevant decisions from these jurisdictions are premised upon statutes that, unlike RSA 281-A:13,1, do not expressly provide for workers\u2019 compensation liens on uninsured motorist benefits. <em>See, e.g., March v. Pekin Ins. Co., </em>465 N.W.2d 852 (Iowa 1991); <em>Berna-Mork v. Jones, </em>165 Wis. 2d 661, 478 N.W.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Furthermore, Rooney\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Merchants Mutual Insurance Group v. Orthopedic Professional Association, </em>124 N.H. 648, 480 A.2d 840 (1984), does not compel a different result. <em>Merchants Mutual </em>was decided prior to the 1985 amendment to the workers\u2019 compensation statute (currently codified at RSA 281-A:13, I (Supp. 1993)) that expressly provides for a carrier\u2019s right to assert a lien against uninsured motorist benefits. <em>See Merchants Mutual, </em>124 N.H. at 657-59, 480 A.2d at 845-46 (analyzing the parties\u2019 rights under the statutory lien found in RSA 281:14 (Supp. 1983)). In light of the fact that <em>Merchants Mutual </em>was predicated on the interpretation of a statute that did not directly address the validity of a workers\u2019 compensation lien on uninsured motorist benefits, and because the legislature has now expressly provided for such a lien, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:13, I, <em>Merchants Mutual </em>cannot be relied upon as authority for denying a workers\u2019 compensation carrier the statutory right to assert a lien against an employee\u2019s uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Rooney next argues that RSA 281-A:13, I, unconstitutionally discriminates against the class of persons who purchase uninsured or underinsured motorist policy protection by unreasonably and arbitrarily interfering with their right to recover for personal injuries. Under our interpretation of the equal protection provisions of the New Hampshire Constitution, N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 2, 12, a statute whose classifications interfere with a person\u2019s right to recover for personal injuries must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. <em>Brannigan v. Usitalo, </em>134 N.H. 50, 55, 587 A.2d 1232, 1234 (1991); <em>Carson v. Maurer, </em>120 N.H. 925, 932, 424 A.2d 825, 831 (1980). In such cases, the legislative objective is presumed to be proper, <em>Carson, </em>120 N.H. at 933, 424 A.2d at 831, leaving two questions before the court: (1) whether the statute has a fair and substantial relation to the legitimate legislative objective; and (2) whether it imposes unreasonable restrictions on private rights. <em>Id. </em>at 933, 424 A.2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Rooney concedes that the object of the legislation is to place the ultimate loss for a wrongdoing upon the wrongdoer and to prevent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>double recovery. Regarding the first prong of the <em>Carson </em>test, however, Rooney cites <em>Merchants Mutual </em>for the proposition that an employee who receives both uninsured motorist proceeds and workers\u2019 compensation benefits has not received a double recovery. <em>Merchants Mutual, </em>124 N.H. at 658-59, 480 A.2d at 846. Thus, according to Rooney, granting the workers\u2019 compensation carrier a lien on the uninsured motorist proceeds cannot be said to have a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation because <em>Merchants Mutual </em>has rendered that object, the prevention of a double recovery, unattainable in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>Merchants Mutual </em>held that an uninsured motorist carrier cannot reduce the amount of its coverage by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation received by the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 480 A.2d at 844. We underscored the uninsured motorist carrier\u2019s irrevocable obligation to pay by noting that it had <em>\u201ccontracted to pay </em>the insured for injuries occasioned by an uninsured motorist. Under these circumstances, . . . there is no double recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 480 A.2d at 846 (emphasis in original). The legislature, apparently in response to <em>Merchants Mutual, </em>amended the workers\u2019 compensation statute, codifying the carrier\u2019s right to assert a lien against uninsured motorist benefits. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:13, I. Although the amended statute does not expressly connect this type of lien with the objective of avoiding a double recovery, we upheld this lien in <em>Carter </em>based on the principle that to hold otherwise would result in the employee receiving two awards for the same injury, which would amount to a double recovery <em>Carter, </em>135 N.H. at 409, 605 A.2d at 222; <em>see also Bilodeau, </em>116 N.H. at 87, 352 A.2d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">We now hold that when an employee receives uninsured motorist benefits including \u201ccompensation, medical, hospital, or other remedial care already paid or agreed or awarded to be paid ... under [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law],\u201d RSA 281-A:13, I(b), such a recovery is a double recovery. Thus, we reaffirm our decision in <em>Carter, </em>and resolve any inconsistencies between <em>Carter </em>and <em>Merchants Mutual </em>in favor of <em>Carter. </em>Consequently, RSA 281-A:13, I, granting a workers\u2019 compensation lien on uninsured motorist benefits, does have a fair and substantial relation to the legitimate legislative objective of preventing double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Regarding the second prong of the <em>Carson </em>test, Rooney argues that RSA 281-A:13,1, imposes unreasonable restrictions on his private contractual right to recover for his injuries from the uninsured motorist carrier. Rooney claims that to have the proceeds from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>this private contract flow to the workers\u2019 compensation carrier would amount to a windfall for Fireman\u2019s Fund, subsidized by his uninsured motorist premiums. We are not persuaded by this argument. Applied as written, the current statute preserves an employee\u2019s right to pursue a claim against the uninsured motorist carrier, and to keep from the award anything not covered by the workers\u2019 compensation lien. We hold, therefore, that Rooney\u2019s contract rights are not unreasonably restricted by the statutory workers\u2019 compensation lien on his uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\">Rooney finally argues that the statutory workers\u2019 compensation lien violates the due process protection of the New Hampshire Constitution. N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 14. According to Rooney, the statute deprives him, a personal injury victim, of a remedy, <em>i.e., </em>the recovery of the proceeds of-a private uninsured motorist contract, without correspondingly providing him with an adequate substitute remedy within the general workers\u2019 compensation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">We have held that there need not be a specific \u201cgive and take,\u201d or <em>quid pro quo, </em>each time a workers\u2019 compensation statute is amended. <em>Young v. Prevue Products, Inc., </em>130 N.H. 84, 88, 534 A.2d 714, 717 (1987). Instead, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cconsider the totality of benefits, not just those benefits received at the time the right was statutorily abridged, when evaluating whether the relinquishment of the right to a remedy has been adequately offset by workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Our inquiry is driven by analysis of the fairness of the compensation scheme as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\"><em>Thompson v. Forest, </em>136 N.H. 215, 218-19, 614 A.2d 1064, 1067 (1992), <em>overruling Estabrook v. American Hoist &amp; Derrick, Inc., </em>127 N.H. 162, 498 A.2d 741 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Fireman\u2019s Fund argues that the <em>Merchants Mutual </em>decision upset the general balance of the then-applicable statute, RSA 281:14 (Supp. 1983), by permitting the employee to enjoy a double recovery when the tortfeasor lacked adequate insurance, and by restricting the exercise of the workers\u2019 compensation lien to cases in which the tortfeasor, or the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier, actually paid on the employee\u2019s injury claim. <em>Merchants Mutual, </em>124 N.H. at 657-59, 480 A.2d at 845-46. According to Fireman\u2019s Fund, the present statute, RSA 281-A:13, I, restores balance and fairness to the compensation scheme as a whole by refocusing the inquiry upon the actions of the third-party tortfeasor and the actual damages suffered by the employee, rather than upon the ability of the tortfeasor to pay or the adequacy of the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>We are persuaded by Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s arguments. The present statute, RSA 281-A:13,1, ensures that the employee is not entitled to a double recovery and also ensures that the workers\u2019 compensation carrier is entitled to a lien on damages or benefits received by the employee based upon the negligence of a third-party tortfeasor. Although Rooney has paid a premium to protect against losses caused by drivers with inadequate insurance, he cannot fairly complain as long as he is fully compensated for his losses. Here, the assertion of a workers\u2019 compensation lien on Rooney\u2019s uninsured motorist benefits leaves Rooney fully compensated for his losses, prevents a double recovery, and maintains the general balance of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Thus, the statutory workers\u2019 compensation lien does not violate the due process protection of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b657-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
