We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">This claim arose out of a dispute over title to a triangular piece of land on Lake Wentworth in the Town of Wolfeboro. The parcel, described as lot 3, was carved out of a larger tract owned by Allen \u201cA\u201d Realty, Inc., a successor corporation to a limited partnership, Allen \u201cA\u201d Associates. Allen \u201cA\u201d Realty, Inc. conveyed lot 3 to Samuel Dame, a former limited partner in Allen \u201cA\u201d Associates, by warranty deed dated January 24, 1978. In May 1983, Dame transferred title to the Francoeurs by warranty deed. The metes and bounds description in the warranty deeds of the Francoeurs and Dame conformed to an earlier unapproved subdivision plan that described lot 3 as having frontage on Lake Wentworth. The deeds also referred to an approved and recorded subdivision plan that showed lot 3 as having no frontage on Lake Wentworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The Whites owned property adjoining lot 3 and entered into an agreement to sell the beach, abutting the Francoeur\u2019s property, to the town. A title search revealed the inconsistent descriptions in the Francoeur\u2019s deed. Nevertheless, title to the beach was transferred to the town with funds being held in escrow pending resolution of the cloud on the town\u2019s title. The Whites and the town filed a petition for declaratory judgment, injunction, damages and other relief against the Francoeurs, claiming ownership to the disputed frontage based upon the recorded subdivision plan. The Francoeurs defended the action, relying on the metes and bounds description in their deed, Dame\u2019s representations at the time of transfer that the property had frontage on Lake Wentworth, and their and their predecessor\u2019s use of the disputed frontage.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The superior court found that the conflicting metes and bounds description in the deed was \u201cthe result of a plain mistake,\u201d and only the recorded subdivision plan could have been conveyed by Allen \u201cA\u201d Realty, Inc. to Dame and subsequently to the Francoeurs. The court reformed the deed to comply with the recorded subdivision plan and awarded the Whites attorney\u2019s fees and the town costs, penalties, and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to RSA 676:17, II (1986). The Francoeurs filed a motion to set aside the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Whites and a motion to set aside attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and penalties to the town. The superior court denied the motions relying on our decision in <em>Keenan v. Fearon, </em>130 N.H. 494, 502, 543 A.2d 1379, 1383 (1988), and its power \u201cto award counsel fees in any action commenced, prolonged, required or defended without any reasonable basis in facts provable by evidence, or any reasonable claim in the law as it is, or as it might arguably be held to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">On appeal, the Francoeurs argue that their defense was not patently unreasonable and therefore the trial court abused its discretion in awarding counsel fees to the plaintiffs. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> The general rule in New Hampshire is that each party to a lawsuit is responsible for his or her own attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Guaraldi v. Trans-Lease Group, </em>136 N.H. 457, 462, 617 A.2d 648, 651 (1992); <em>Adams v. Bradshaw, </em>135 N.H. 7, 16, 599 A.2d 481, 487 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>112 S. Ct. 1560 (1992). Fees may be awarded to the prevailing litigant only by \u201cstatutory authorization, an agreement between the parties, or an established exception.\u201d <em>Maquire v. Merrimack Mut. Ins. Co., </em>133 N.H. 51, 55, 573 A.2d 451, 453 (1990). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>have recognized an exception for those who are \u201cforced to litigate against an opponent whose position is patently unreasonable.\u201d <em>Keenan, </em>130 N.H. at 502, 543 A.2d at 1383. Further, we have held that a court has the \u201cpower to award counsel fees in any action commenced, prolonged, required or defended without any reasonable basis in the facts provable by evidence, or any reasonable claim in the law as it is, or as it might arguably be held to be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Maguire, </em>133 N.H. at 54, 573 A.2d at 453. \u201cTo constitute an abuse, reversible on appeal, the discretion must have been exercised for reasons clearly untenable or to an extent clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 573 A.2d at 454 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In the present case, the trial court found that because the conflicting descriptions in the deed were a result of \u201cplain mistake,\u201d the conveyance to the defendants was invalid, and they had no reasonable basis to defend the action. Assuming that a mistake was made in drafting the deed, however, we note that the issue remained as to which of the inconsistent descriptions controlled: the metes and bounds description in the deed or the reference to the recorded subdivision plan. We have not previously decided this question, and the plaintiffs did not have such a \u201cclearly defined and established right\u201d that they should not have been forced to litigate the issue. <em>See Harkeem v. Adams, </em>117 N.H. 687, 691, 377 A.2d 617, 619 (1977). While we do not decide the issue in this case, there is authority for the proposition that \u201cif the [metes and bounds] description in the deed is intended to be superior to the plat, or is not intended to be a mere secondary restatement of the description in the plat, the deed description will prevail.\u201d R. Powell &amp; P. Rohan, 6A Powell on Real Property \u00b6 899[3] at 81A-113 to 81A-114 (1993). Accordingly, the defendants argued that the intent of the parties controlled the interpretation of the deed, and that evidence such as the conduct of the parties to the deed and of subsequent owners was admissible to determine which tract of land the parties intended to convey. <em>See MacKay v. Breault, </em>121 N.H. 135, 139-40, 427 A.2d 1099, 1101 (1981). The record contains the following evidence in support of the defendants\u2019 argument that the parties to the deed intended the lot to include the disputed shore frontage: Dame and the Francoeurs maintained and used the disputed area; Dame\u2019s use or ownership of the frontage was never disputed; Dame represented to the Francoeurs that the lot included the frontage; and Norval Smith, president of Allen \u201cA\u201d Realty, Inc., never objected to Dame\u2019s or the Francoeurs\u2019 use of the frontage during his ownership of the abutting property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The fact that the trial court found that the grantor intended the contrary does not alone warrant an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, </em>137 N.H. 572, 575, 630 A.2d 776, 777 (1993). Based upon our review of the law and the evidence, we cannot hold that the defendants\u2019 position \u2014 that the metes and bounds description in the deed controlled over the reference to the recorded subdivision \u2014 was patently unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The trial court also focused on the illegality of the metes and bounds conveyance. We agree that the conveyance violated the subdivision statute. The defendants, however, correctly argued that a conveyance in violation of a subdivision plat is not void. <em>See </em>P. Loughlin, 1 Land Use Planning and Zoning \u00a7 351, at 3-59 to 3-60 (1990). RSA 676:16 (1986 &amp; Supp. 1993) provides that the grantor who transfers or sells a lot in violation of a subdivision must pay a civil fine. The statutory history of RSA 676:16 buttresses the defendants\u2019 position. In 1969, the legislature expressly provided that a conveyance in violation of a subdivision was void. Laws 1969, 185:1. In 1970, the legislature repealed this provision. Laws 1970, 21:1. Therefore, only illegal conveyances made between July 27, 1969, and July 3, 1970, are void. <em>See </em>Loughlin <em>supra; </em>New Hampshire Bar Association Title Examination Standards \u00a7 5-14, at 7 (1988). The original conveyance from Allen \u201cA\u201d Realty, Inc. to Dame occurred in 1977. If the trial court had found that the metes and bounds description in the deed controlled, the Erancoeurs would have had title to the illegal, unapproved lot. Therefore, we conclude that the Francoeurs\u2019 defense was not \u201cwithout any reasonable basis in the facts provable by the evidence, or any reasonable claim in the law as it is, or as it might arguably be held to be,\u201d <em>Keenan, </em>130 N.H. at 502, 543 A.2d at 1383, and we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding counsel fees to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We turn now to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, costs and penalties to the town pursuant to RSA 676:17, II. A trial court may award attorney\u2019s fees, costs and penalties to a prevailing municipality in any legal action \u201cbrought ... to <em>enforce, </em>by way of injunctive relief as provided by RSA 676:15 or otherwise, any local ordinance, code or regulation adopted under this title, or to enforce any planning board . . . decision made pursuant to this title.\u201d RSA 676:17, II (emphasis added). RSA 676:15 (Supp. 1993) provides for injunctive relief where a \u201cbuilding or structure or part thereof is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, altered or reconstructed, or any land is or is proposed to be used in violation of . . . any provision or specification of an application, plat, or plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The Francoeurs challenge the fee award to the town on the basis that the substance of the town\u2019s case was a title action, not an enforcement action. In response, the town contends that it was entitled to fees under the plain language of RSA 676:17, II as it was successful in bringing an action to enjoin the defendants from <em>using </em>a lot in violation of the town\u2019s subdivision regulations. Because we find that the enforcement action was a <em>de minimis </em>portion of the town\u2019s case and the court\u2019s findings do not support an award of fees and costs under RSA 676:17, II, we reverse the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the town. We note that it is unclear from the record whether the trial court awarded the town penalties under RSA 676:17, II. To the extent that such an award was granted, we also reverse the award of penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In evaluating the trial court\u2019s award of statutory attorney\u2019s fees, the validity of the award is not determined by the form of the action but by its substance. <em>Cf. Belcher v. Paine, </em>136 N.H. 137, 149, 612 A.2d 1318, 1326 (1992); <em>Kantor v. The Norwood Group, </em>127 N.H. 831, 834, 508 A.2d 1078, 1081 (1986); <em>Lakeman v. LaFrance, </em>102 N.H. 300, 305, 156 A.2d 123, 127 (1959). This action arose when the town purchased the land abutting the defendants\u2019 property. The town sought to remove the cloud on its title created by the inconsistent descriptions in the Francoeurs\u2019 deed. Hence, the title dispute was the crux of this action. This is evident by the court\u2019s order: the town of Wolfeboro was declared to be the owner in fee simple absolute of the shore frontage, and the deed was reformed to comply with the recorded subdivision plan. We acknowledge that the court also enjoined the Francoeurs from using the property; however, once the town was declared the owner of the frontage, the injunction became unnecessary. In fact, the primary importance of the subdivision violation was that it constituted evidence in support of the town\u2019s title action: it was proof that the grantor intended to convey the lot as recorded on the approved subdivision plan. Upon review, we are convinced that this was not an enforcement action under RSA 676:17, II, but a title action. In seeking a declaratory judgment against the Francoeurs, the town was acting in the capacity of a land owner, contesting title for itself, rather than for the purpose of \u201cpromoting the health, safety, or the general welfare of the community,\u201d by <em>enforcing </em>its subdivision regulations. RSA 674:16, I (1986 &amp; Supp. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s findings also leads us to the conclusion that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to award fees, penalties, and costs under RSA 676:17, II. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>found that the Francoeurs owned the lot as approved and recorded on the subdivision plan. Therefore, there was no subdivision violation for the town to enforce. At most the Francoeurs could be accused of trespassing on their neighbor\u2019s property. In contrast, if the trial court had found that the metes and bounds description controlled and the Francoeurs prevailed, there would have been a subdivision violation for the town to enforce and injunctive relief would have been a necessary component of the town\u2019s claim. Because this was not the case, we hold that the trial court\u2019s findings do not sustain an award of attorney\u2019s fees under RSA 676:17, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">Accordingly, we reverse the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Whites and the award of attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and penalties to the town under RSA 676:17, II. This holding does not prejudice the plaintiffs\u2019 right to costs pursuant to Superior Court Rule 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-5\">THAYER, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
