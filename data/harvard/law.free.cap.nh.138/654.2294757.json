She argues that the trial court erred in ruling: (1) that workers\u2019 compensation benefits were \u201cequivalent medical coverage\u201d under RSA 264:16, 11(b) (1993); and (2) that <em>Jolicoeur v. Colonial Penn Insurance Company, </em>121 N.H. 793, 435 A.2d 514 (1981), is controlling. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The plaintiff was injured while driving her personal automobile in the course of her employment. Her employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation liability carrier paid the resulting medical expenses. The plaintiff subsequently sought payment for the same medical expenses from Metropolitan, her automobile liability insurer. Metropolitan denied coverage, citing the policy exclusion for \u201cthat portion of any medical expense for which benefits are available under any . . . law which provides workers [sic] compensation or disability benefits.\u201d The plaintiff filed a petition for declaratory judgment, arguing that RSA 264:16 and :17 (1993) required that Metropolitan\u2019s policy include medical payment coverage without the reservation of subrogation rights. After a hearing, the trial court ruled that the policy exclusion for medical expenses covered by workers\u2019 compensation benefits was valid and, therefore, denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">RSA 264:16, I, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201cAny motor vehicle liability policy . . . covering a private passenger automobile and issued with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state shall provide coverage therein or supplemental thereto in an amount equal to or greater than $1,000 per person for medical costs incurred as a result of injuries sustained in an accident involving the insured vehicle by the driver and passengers in said vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Paragraph II exempts \u201c[a]ny person having equivalent medical coverage\u201d from the statute\u2019s mandate. The question before us is whether workers\u2019 compensation benefits are \u201cequivalent medical coverage.\u201d In <em>Jolicoeur v. Colonial Penn Insurance Company, </em>121 N.H. at 796, 435 A.2d at 516, we held that Medicare benefits were \u201cequivalent medical coverage\u201d and that, consequently, the minimum coverage requirements of RSA 264:16\u2019s predecessor did not apply. Our decision hinged on an analysis of the relevant legislative history, as well as the determination that the exclusionary language of the policy was clear and unambiguous. <em>Id. </em>We discern no relevant difference between the Medicare benefits in <em>Jolicoeur </em>and the workers\u2019 compensation benefits here.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\">The plaintiff argues that RSA 264:17 requires a different result. RSA 264:17 states: \u201cThe right of subrogation against any third party shall not exist or be claimed in favor of the insurer, who has paid or reimbursed, to or for the benefit of the insured, medical costs under coverage provided for pursuant to RSA 264:16.\u201d Although section 17 was not discussed in <em>Jolicoeur, </em>Medicare coverage, like workers\u2019 compensation, provides for a right of subrogation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2) (1988); RSA 281-A:13 (Supp. 1993). Further, that the legislature may have weighed the public policy issues differently as between workers\u2019 compensation carriers and motor vehicle insurers in deciding who would benefit when the potentiality for multiple recoveries exists does not affect our construction of RSA 264:16,11(b), which seeks to prevent multiple recoveries in the first instance by affording persons the ability to avoid purchasing unnecessary coverage. We adhere to our holding in <em>Jolicoeur </em>and follow it here. <em>See Providence Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Scanlon, </em>138 N.H. 301, 303-04, 638 A.2d 1246, 1248 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b670-5\">Brock, C.J., and Thayer, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
