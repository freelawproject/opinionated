Besk appeals the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(Perkins, </em>J.) order, pursuant to the rape shield law, RSA 632-A:6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>(1986) (current version at RSA 632-A:6, II (Supp. 1993)), prohibiting him from cross-examining one of the boys, Stephen, about an allegation that Stephen had sexually molested Besk\u2019s son. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Prior to trial, the State moved to exclude any evidence that Stephen had molested Besk\u2019s son. Besk objected, arguing that the rape shield law did not apply to this evidence. Besk made an offer of proof that cross-examining Stephen was important to show Stephen\u2019s motive to contrive the charges against him. His attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">\u201c[Stephen] did molest [Besk\u2019s son], he was taken to the police about it. The police were given information about it and to a certain extent, I\u2019m not sure what extent, the boy, Stephen, received some difficulties for that..., so I think there is a potential for some vindictiveness and a motive to fabricate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">. . . [T]his boy has molested my client\u2019s son and was caught, and was caught perhaps with the help of my client and perhaps now he holds a grudge against my client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The superior court granted the State\u2019s motion to exclude the evidence, applying the rape shield law and finding that Besk \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the asserted sexual activity has probative value sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect.\u201d Following his convictions, Besk appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The framework for evaluating the admissibility of evidence subject to the rape shield law is well-established. RSA 632-A:6 provides, in part, that \u201c[p]rior consensual sexual activity between the victim and any person other than the [defendant] shall not be admitted into evidence in any prosecution under this chapter.\u201d In <em>State v. Howard, </em>121 N.H. 53, 426 A.2d 457 (1981), \u201cthis court held that the requirement of due process and the right of confrontation limit the application of the rape shield law when evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual activity with people other than the defendant has a \u2018probative value in the context of [a] particular case [that] outweighs its prejudicial effect on the [victim].\u201d\u2019 <em>State v. Goulet, </em>129 N.H. 348, 351, 529 A.2d 879, 881 (1987) <em>(quoting Howard, </em>121 N.H. at 58-59, 426 A.2d at 460-61).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Besk argues preliminarily that the rape shield law does not apply here because Stephen was under the age of thirteen at the time he supposedly molested Besk\u2019s son. The rape shield law applies only to \u201cconsensual\u201d sexual activity, <em>see State v. Cox, </em>133 N.H. 261, 264-65, 575 A.2d 1320, 1322 (1990), and, Besk contends, children so young are \u201cincapable\u201d of consenting to sexual acts for purposes of prosecutions under RSA chapter 632-A. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2, XI; <em>see also </em>RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>632-A:2, II (Supp. 1993). Were we to accept Besk\u2019s position, the protection now afforded to rape victims against exposure of their sexual histories would apply only to adults and adolescents, and not to the youngest, most vulnerable victims of all \u2014 prepubescent children. Such a construction of the rape shield law would run contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent \u201cto protect the victims of rape from . . . procedures that only serve to exacerbate the trauma of the rape itself.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>121 N.H. at 57, 426 A.2d at 459. For the reasons set forth below, we decline to adopt Besk\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">First, we note that the rape shield law itself makes no distinction among categories of victims. It precludes admission of \u201c[p]rior consensual sexual activity between <em>the victim </em>and any person other than the [defendant].\u201d RSA 632-A:6 (emphasis added). If the legislature had intended to deny young victims protection from cross-examination \u201cdesigned only to harass, annoy or humiliate,\u201d <em>Howard, </em>121 N.H. at 57, 426 A.2d at 460, it would have chosen words plainly conveying this meaning. <em>Cf. Appeal of City of Franklin, </em>137 N.H. 723, 727-28, 634 A.2d 1000, 1003 (1993) (\u201cA reviewing court may not add words to a statute that the lawmakers did not see fit to include.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Second, we disagree with Besk\u2019s contention that the word \u201cconsensual,\u201d as it appears in RSA 632-A:6, renders the law inapplicable to the sexual activity of children while under the age of thirteen. Citing RSA 632-A:2, XI, Besk assumes that a young child is incapable of consenting to these acts for purposes of the rape shield law. Although such a child\u2019s consent is legally irrelevant to a prosecution under RSA 632-A:2, see RSA 632-A:2, XI, nothing in RSA 632-A:2, XI renders these children \u201cincapable\u201d of consent. Significantly, the rape shield law makes no reference to RSA 632-A:2, XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Third, while this court has never specifically held that the rape shield law applies to the sexual activity of young children, it has operated under that assumption since the law was first interpreted. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>133 N.H. 562, 563-64, 578 A.2d 864, 864-65 (1990); <em>State v. Fennell, </em>133 N.H. 402, 407, 412, 578 A.2d 329, 332, 335 (1990); <em>Cox, </em>133 N.H. at 264-65, 575 A.2d at 1322-23; <em>Howard, </em>121 N.H. at 55, 61-62, 426 A.2d at 458, 462. For example, in <em>Cox, </em>this court evaluated the admissibility of a victim\u2019s sexual activity at age ten. <em>Cox, </em>133 N.H. at 264-65, 575 A.2d at 1322-23. The court assumed that the rape shield law applied to this activity, concentrating its analysis on whether \u201cthe victim\u2019s participation\u201d was, in fact, consensual. <em>Id. </em>at 265, 575 A.2d at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Based on the foregoing, we reject Besk\u2019s contention that RSA 632-A:6 does not apply to the sexual activity of rape victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>while under the age of thirteen. Our holding follows \u201c[t]he general consensus of the courts ... that rape shield statutes do apply to cases involving minor victims.\u201d Note, <em>State v. Oliver: Children With a Past; The Admissibility of the Victim\u2019s Prior Sexual Experience in Child Molestation Cases, </em>31 Ariz. L. Rev. 677, 685 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Besk\u2019s next contention is that the rape shield law does not apply to the allegation that Stephen sexually molested Besk\u2019s son because \u201c[m]olestation inherently is not a consensual activity.\u201d We agree that \u201cconsensual activity\u201d generally means an activity in which <em>both </em>parties agree to participate. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 482 (unabridged ed. 1961). However, even if we were to accept Besk\u2019s argument that the rape shield law should not apply here, we would nonetheless uphold the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the allegation against Stephen. The court found \u201cno nexus . . . between the alleged molestation incident and the victim\u2019s motivation to be untruthful.\u201d Without such a nexus, the allegation lacks relevance and is inadmissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We reject Besk\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s \u201cno nexus\u201d finding lacks support. As noted by the State, Besk\u2019s offer of proof was tentative and speculative. While Besk asserted that Stephen \u201cwas caught perhaps with the help of [Besk],\u201d Besk did not claim that Stephen knew of his role in the matter. Considering that the allegation against Stephen originated with Besk, the superior court would have been justified in assuming that any real nexus between the alleged molestation and a motive to lie would be clearly explained by defense counsel. <em>Cf. State v. Santana, </em>133 N.H. 798, 809, 586 A.2d 77, 84 (1991) (trial court\u2019s findings upheld unless unsupported by record or found clearly erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
