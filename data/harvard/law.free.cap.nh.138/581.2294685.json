Bouchard, appeals the verdict of the Superior Court <em>(O\u2019Neil, </em>J.) finding him guilty of the possession of cocaine. RSA 318-B:2 (Supp. 1993). On appeal, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion: (1) by ruling that he opened the door at trial to allow evidence of his alleged possession of marijuana, after granting the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude this evidence; and (2) by allowing the rebuttal testimony of a police officer regarding the defendant\u2019s self-incriminating statements, when the officer\u2019s report of these statements was not provided to the defendant\u2019s counsel until after the discovery deadline. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The defendant was operating his 1989 Baja motorboat on Lake Winnipesaukee at approximately 10:30 p.m. on July 17,1992, without its navigational lights illuminated, when he was stopped by a marine patrol officer. After administering a series of field sobriety tests, the officer arrested the defendant for boating while intoxicated. The defendant was escorted to the police cruiser of a marine patrol supervisor, who searched the defendant and inventoried his possessions. The supervisor found a green paper bindle containing white granular powder, later determined to be .22 grams of cocaine, among the contents of the defendant\u2019s pockets. Four baggies of marijuana were recovered from the defendant\u2019s pants and underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The misdemeanor offense of possession of marijuana and various boating violations were brought in the Laconia District Court, while the felony charge of possession of cocaine was tried in the superior court. Prior to the felony trial, the defendant successfully moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude from evidence the defendant\u2019s arrest for possession of marijuana under New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 402 and 403. On the day of trial, the defendant moved that Officer Race, who accompanied the defendant to his arraignment, be prohibited from testifying about self-incriminating statements that the defendant made just after his arraignment. Officer Race\u2019s report concerning those statements was sent to the defendant\u2019s counsel only one week before trial, at the direction of the county attorney. Because the report was provided five months beyond the court\u2019s discovery deadline, the court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">At trial, the prosecutor cross-examined the defendant about whether he was aware of the bindle of cocaine in his pants, to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the defendant responded that the pants, which he took from a cabinet in his boat, were not his. The following exchange regarding the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the bindle ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\u201cQ. And you said that you don\u2019t believe that it was yours?</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">A. No, it wasn\u2019t mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Q. Is it possible that could have been yours?</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">A. I don\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Q. You don\u2019t think so but is it possible? Is it possible you forgot that that was in your pocket?</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">A. No, I don\u2019t really think so. If I had known it was there, it wouldn\u2019t have \u2014 I would have gotten \u2014 if I had known, I would have thrown it out or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The prosecutor then sought permission to ask the defendant about the marijuana found on his person. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecutor was allowed to refer to the marijuana, but only as green vegetative matter. The defendant admitted to his knowledge of the baggies of green vegetative matter in his pants and underwear, but maintained that he was unaware of the bindle.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Officer Kace was called by the prosecution as a rebuttal witness. Officer Kace testified that after the arraignment the defendant said \u201cthat he couldn\u2019t understand why he was being charged with possession of cocaine with intent to sell because it was just a little bit of cocaine, and it was his.\u201d On cross-examination, Officer Kace testified that the defendant also asked the officer \u201cto cut [him] some slack\u201d and promised to \u201cget in some sort of rehab program.\u201d The trial judge instructed the jury to use Officer Kace\u2019s testimony solely to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility by prior inconsistent statement, not as substantive evidence. The defendant was found guilty of possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">On appeal the defendant first challenges the admission of evidence of his possession of marijuana. He contends that the trial court abused its discretion in applying the opening-the-door doctrine. He argues that he did not gain a misleading advantage through his testimony that if he had known there was cocaine in his pocket he would have gotten rid of it because his statement did not necessarily mean he would have thrown out the baggies of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\"> The defendant has the burden to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling is clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>State v. VanDerHeyden, </em>136 N.H. 277, 284, 615 A.2d 1246, 1249-50 (1992). \u201cOpening the door\u201d is often used \u201cto describe situations in which a misleading advantage may be coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tered with previously suppressed or otherwise inadmissible evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Crosman, </em>125 N.H. 527, 531, 484 A.2d 1095, 1097-98 (1984); <em>see State v. Patten, </em>137 N.H. 627, 628, 631 A.2d 921, 922 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The State argues that the testimony gave the impression that the defendant would not willingly or knowingly have possessed any illegal substance. Our review of the transcript indicates that the jury logically could have understood the defendant\u2019s statement as referring to any illegal substance. We have held that \u201c[t]he prejudicial impact, if any, of particular testimony ... can best be gauged by the trial court judge,\u201d <em>State v. Lemire, </em>130 N.H. 552, 555, 543 A.2d 425, 427 (1988), and therefore find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the door had been opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The defendant also argues that the questions focusing on his possession of \u201cgreen vegetative matter\u201d violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 608(b). We will not address the defendant\u2019s Rule 608(b) argument on appeal because the defendant failed to specifically argue Rule 608 in his motion <em>in limine, </em>which solely raised Rules 402 and 403, and he made no contemporaneous objection on such ground at trial. <em>See VanDerHeyden, </em>136 N.H. at 282, 615 A.2d at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The second issue on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Officer Kace to testify as a rebuttal witness when the defense was not provided a copy of the officer\u2019s police report until one week before trial, five months after the discovery deadline. The defendant cites Superior Court Rule 98, which requires the State to furnish to the defendant \u201ca copy of records of statements or confessions, signed or unsigned, by the defendant, to any law enforcement officer or his agent.\u201d The defendant alleges surprise and unfair prejudice: his counsel did not have time to depose Officer Kace in order to prepare a rebuttal to the officer\u2019s testimony establishing that the defendant knew he possessed cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">At the outset, we must address the State\u2019s argument that the defendant did not properly preserve the issue for appellate review because there is no record of an objection contemporaneous to Officer Race\u2019s testimony at trial. We find that the defendant\u2019s oral motion on the day of trial to exclude the evidence on the basis of the Rule 98 violation was adequate to preserve the issue, including arguments based on consequences of the violation, making a contemporaneous objection at trial unnecessary. <em>See State v. McLaughlin, </em>135 N.H. 669, 672, 610 A.2d 809, 811 (1992) (defendant\u2019s pretrial mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>tion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence adequate to preserve issue for appellate review, and contemporaneous objection at trial not required).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We hold that the State\u2019s violation of Superior Court Rule 98 does not bar Officer Kace\u2019s testimony from entering through an open door. <em>See State v. Nadeau, </em>126 N.H. 120, 124-25, 489 A.2d 623, 625-26 (1985). The defendant\u2019s testimony during direct examination that he was unaware that there was a bindle of cocaine in the pants he was wearing when arrested opened the door for Officer Kace\u2019s rebuttal testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s self-incriminating statements. <em>State v. Mello, </em>137 N.H. 597, 601, 631 A.2d 146, 148-49 (1993). That the testimony was admitted under the opening-the-door doctrine should have been manifest to the defendant since, after Officer Kace testified, the trial judge clearly explained that the testimony was admitted as a prior inconsistent statement for purposes of impeachment. Because we find no error in the trial court\u2019s application of the opening-the-door doctrine, <em>see Crosman, </em>125 N.H. at 531, 484 A.2d at 1097-98; <em>State v. Benoit, </em>126 N.H. 6, 21-22, 490 A.2d 295, 305-06 (1985), we reject the defendant\u2019s argument that Officer Kace should not have been allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The defendant also argues in his brief that the introduction of Officer Kace\u2019s testimony violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403 because its \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 403. First addressing the State\u2019s contention that the Rule 403 argument has not been properly preserved, we find that such allegation of unfair prejudice was implicit in the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion that the officer\u2019s report was provided outside the discovery deadline. We find that the trial court was adequately informed of the defendant\u2019s argument when it first arose in the pretrial motion. <em>See State v. Eldredge, </em>135 N.H. 562, 564, 607 A.2d 617, 618 (1992). Therefore, we will resolve this question on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The defendant has not met his burden of showing unfair prejudice. He argues that Officer Kace provided the critical link in establishing the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the cocaine, and that, because the officer was the final witness, he had an enormous effect on the jury. Since the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the probative value of this evidence is great, and the jury was instructed to use Officer Kace\u2019s testimony for the limited purpose of determining the defendant\u2019s credibility, <em>State v. Smart, </em>136 N.H. 639, 658, 622 A.2d 1197, 1210 (jurors presumed to follow instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tions), <em>cert. denied, </em>114 S. Ct. 309 (1993), we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-6\">Brock, C.J., with whom Thayer, J., joined, concurred specially; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b600-7\">BROCK, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZR\">concurring specially: I agree with the majority that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that the defendant\u2019s conviction should be affirmed. I write to express my belief, however, that the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the admission of Officer Race\u2019s testimony were not properly preserved for appeal. I would not, therefore, address those arguments in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to exclude any statements contained in Officer Race\u2019s report because the defense did not receive the report until well after the discovery deadline in violation of Superior Court Rule 98. The motion was granted. At trial, Officer Race was allowed to testify concerning the statements, as the defendant had opened the door to such testimony. In his brief, the defendant relies upon the Rule 98 violation, arguing that the statements caused both surprise and unfair prejudice. The State argues that the defendant did not preserve the issue for appeal as he did not contemporaneously object to the testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The majority states that a contemporaneous objection was unnecessary as the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion preserved the issue, including arguments based on consequences of the Rule 98 violation, citing <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>135 N.H. 669, 672, 610 A.2d 809, 811 (1992). The analysis fails to recognize that the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion was <em>granted. </em>At trial, the defendant raised no objection, contemporaneous or otherwise, to the testimony. <em>Cf. State v. Simonds, </em>135 N.H. 203, 205, 600 A.2d 928, 929 (1991). The trial court originally excluded the statements from the State\u2019s case in chief on the basis of a Rule 98 violation. The trial court did not reverse its Rule 98 ruling at trial. Rather, it admitted the evidence as prior inconsistent statements of the defendant after he opened the door. The defendant\u2019s pretrial motion did not abrogate his obligation to raise a contemporaneous objection in order to afford the trial court an opportunity to correct any error it may have made, <em>see State v. Eldredge, </em>135 N.H. 562, 564, 607 A.2d 617, 618 (1992), especially where, as here, the evidence was being offered on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">The defendant argues in his brief for the first time that the admission of Officer Race\u2019s statements violated New Hampshire Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Evidence 403. The State argues that the defendant did not preserve the issue for appeal as he did not make a Rule 403 argument in his pretrial motion nor did he make a contemporaneous objection on such ground at trial. I find this argument to be persuasive. I fail to see a difference between this situation and that concerning the defendant\u2019s Rule 608(b) argument. There, the defendant argued that questions focusing on his possession of \u201cgreen vegetative matter\u201d violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 608(b). The majority decided not to address this argument as the defendant failed to specifically argue Rule 608 in his motion <em>in limine, </em>and he made no contemporaneous objection on such ground at trial. The appropriate analysis here is identical to that employed earlier. The defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to exclude Officer Race\u2019s statements was based solely on Superior Court Rule 98. Rule 403 was not mentioned either at that time or during trial. Even if I were to agree that the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion preserved his Rule 98 argument on appeal, I do not agree that the defendant\u2019s pretrial argument based on Rule 98 \u201cimpliedly\u201d informed the trial court of, and preserved for appeal, an argument based on any other rule designed to prevent unfair prejudice. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.H. R. Ev. 608(b). I would not address the Rule 403 argument as the defendant has not preserved it for appeal. <em>See State v. VanDerHeyden, </em>136 N.H. 277, 282, 615 A.2d 1246, 1249 (1992).</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-3\">Thayer, J., joins in the special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
