Putnam, appeals the decision of the Superior Court <em>(Gray, </em>J.) dismissing his amended complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1986) because it did not allege that the defendant, the University of New Hampshire, acted with a discriminatory purpose or intent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-17\">The gravam\u00e9n of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint is that the university\u2019s policy regarding eligibility for in-state tuition discriminates against out-of-state students who later seek to change their residency status. The university moved to dismiss the civil rights claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that the plaintiff failed to allege either intentional discrimination or a discriminatory purpose. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The standard of review in considering a motion to dismiss is \u201cwhether the allegations [in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings] are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery.\u201d <em>Collectramatic, Inc. v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., </em>127 N.H. 318, 320, 499 A.2d 999, 1000 (1985) (quotation omitted). We assume the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and construe all reasonable inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>We need not, however, accept statements in the complaint that are merely conclusions of law. <em>Jay Edwards, Inc. v. Baker, </em>130 N.H. 41, 45, 534 A.2d 706, 708 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">The plaintiff argues that he was not required to allege intentional or purposeful discrimination in his section 1983 action and, even if he were, his amended complaint should be read to imply such a claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"> While the plaintiff contends that the university\u2019s actions violated the equal protection clauses of both the State and Federal Constitutions, a section 1983 action is available only for the violation of a federal constitutional or statutory right. <em>See, e.g., Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, </em>493 U.S. 103, 106 (1989); <em>Watterson v. Page, </em>987 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1993). His federal constitutional claim fails as well because his complaint does not allege intentional or purposeful discrimination, \u201can essential element of an equal protection claim,\u201d <em>Dickens v. State of Mo., by Ashcroft, </em>887 F.2d 895, 896 (8th Cir. 1989), where the statute or policy is facially neutral. <em>But see Gomez by Hernandez v. Comerford, </em>833 F. Supp. 702, 706 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (holding discriminatory intent not required in challenge to overt discrimination). He does not allege that the university engaged in discriminatory conduct \u201cin part \u2018because of,\u2019 not merely \u2018in spite of,\u2019 its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\u201d <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, </em>442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979); <em>see also Coyne v. City of Somerville, </em>972 F.2d 440, 444-45 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Nor can even an expansive reading of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint support his argument that intentional or purposeful discrimination is implied. The plaintiff\u2019s bald assertion that \u201c[the university] is discriminating against certain State residents for tuition purposes\u201d falls far short.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The plaintiff has not properly alleged deprivation of a federally secured right and, therefore, cannot recover under section 1983. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
