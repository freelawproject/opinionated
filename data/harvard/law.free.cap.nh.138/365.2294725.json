Castles had been driving his employer\u2019s car, which was insured by Universal Underwriters Group (Universal Underwriters), while Cannon had been driving his own car, insured by Maine Bonding <em>&amp; </em>Casualty Company (Maine Bonding). The Superior Court (Hollman, J.) ruled that Cannon\u2019s injuries did not arise out of any use of Castles\u2019 employer\u2019s car and, therefore, that Universal Underwriters is not obligated to provide Castles with liability coverage and that Maine Bonding is not obligated to provide James and Carol Cannon with uninsured motorist benefits. The Cannons appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>For purposes of this appeal, the parties agree to the following. Castles and Cannon were driving in separate cars on Interstate 93 in Manchester when Castles engaged Cannon in a \u201ccat-and-mouse\u201d game, alternatively accelerating and decelerating, and not letting Cannon pass. Castles used certain hostile hand signals to indicate that he wanted Cannon to pull over to the side of the road. Cannon refused and drove closely behind Castles to determine Castles\u2019 license plate number. Castles slammed on his brakes, causing Cannon to do likewise and stall his car. The cars came to a stop on the highway without touching. Castles then ran over to Cannon\u2019s ear, in which Cannon remained seated, smashed the driver\u2019s side window with his fist, and punched Cannon. This attack left Cannon with a severe eye injury. The Cannons sued Castles, and these declaratory judgment actions followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The narrow issue on appeal is whether the superior court correctly ruled that Cannon\u2019s injuries did not arise out of any use of the car Castles was driving. Universal Underwriters\u2019 contractual and statutory obligations to provide liability coverage for Castles depend on Cannon\u2019s injuries arising out of the use of this car. <em>See </em>RSA 259:61,1 (1993); RSA 264:20 (1993). Under the Maine Bonding insurance policy, uninsured motorist coverage depends on the same condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We recently explained in <em>Akerley v. Hartford Insurance Group, </em>136 N.H. 433, 616 A.2d 511 (1992), that \u201carising out of\u201d a car\u2019s use means \u201coriginating from, or growing out of, or flowing from the use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 616 A.2d at 515 (quotation omitted); <em>see also Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. King, </em>113 N.H. 39, 41, 300 A.2d 335, 336 (1973); <em>Carter v. Bergeron, </em>102 N.H. 464, 470-71, 160 A.2d 348, 353 (1960). To warrant coverage, the use need not be the proximate cause of the injuries, but the causal connection between the two must be more than \u201ctenuous.\u201d <em>Akerley, </em>136 N.H. at 439, 616 A.2d at 515. For example, in <em>Akerley, </em>where a police officer was injured while apprehending a suspect who had been firing a gun from his car, we denied coverage in part because the suspect was not \u201cusing his vehicle or behaving as a motorist\u201d <em>at the time the officer was injured. Id. </em>at 440, 616 A.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Similarly, at th\u00e9 time of Castles\u2019 assault on Cannon, Castles was no longer using his vehicle or acting as a motorist. Thus, under <em>Akerley, </em>the causal connection between use and injury here is tenuous. The Cannons counter that Castles used his employer\u2019s car to trap Cannon and render him helpless against Castles\u2019 attack. This argument, however, ignores the salient point in this fact pattern: Castles brought his employer\u2019s car to a stop and <em>left </em>it unattended before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>hurling his fist through Cannon\u2019s car window. Under similar facts, courts in other jurisdictions have come to the same conclusion as did the superior court. <em>See, e.g., Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brown, </em>779 F.2d 984, 986, 989 (4th Cir. 1985); <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. of New York v. Hall, </em>246 F. Supp. 64, 65, 66 (E.D.S.C. 1965); <em>Detroit Auto. Inter-Ins. Exch. v. Higginbotham, </em>95 Mich. App. 213, 215-16, 222, 290 N.W.2d 414, 416, 419 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">In the cases chiefly relied on by the Cannons, the assailant shot the victim <em>while driving or riding in a moving vehicle. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Davis, </em>937 F.2d 1415, 1417 (9th Cir. 1991); <em>Continental Western Ins. Co. v. Klug, </em>415 N.W.2d 876, 877 (Minn. 1987); <em>Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Howser, </em>422 S.E.2d 106, 107 (S.C. 1992). Significantly, two of these cases, <em>Davis </em>and <em>Howser, </em>specifically distinguish cases such as <em>Brown </em>and <em>Higginbotham, </em>whose facts so resemble ours. <em>Davis, </em>937 F.2d at 1422; <em>Howser, </em>422 S.E.2d at 108. The conspicuous difference is that in the cases where the courts have denied coverage, \u201cthe assailant left his vehicle before assaulting the other party.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>937 F.2d at 1422. This is precisely what happened here. We conclude that Cannon\u2019s injury did not arise out of Castles\u2019 use of his employer\u2019s car and, therefore, affirm the superior court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
