Burke &amp; Sons, Inc. (Burke), a general contractor, appeals from a jury\u2019s award of damages in Superior Court (Mohl, J.) to the plaintiff, Independent Mechanical Contractors, Inc. (IMC), for breach of contract and defamation. We affirm the award for breach of contract because IMC\u2019s injuries were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Burke\u2019s breach and because lost profits were proved with reasonable certainty. We reverse the verdict against Burke for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">On April 11,1980, the Bartlett School District engaged Burke as a general contractor at a cost of almost $900,000 to make additions and alterations to the Josiah Bartlett Elementary School. Burke subcontracted the project\u2019s plumbing, heating, and ventilation requirements to IMC. The contract between IMC and Burke targeted December 1, 1980, for completion and required Burke to supervise the project to prevent conflicts and delays. Burke, however, never devised a schedule allotting time for the work of the different trades on the job. Delays caused by other trades stalled IMC\u2019s progress for approximately one month during the summer of 1980 and compressed the already short period for its work. Despite this delay, IMC substantially completed its work and received \u201cpunch list\u201d assignments from Burke in the early spring of 1981. IMC notified Burke that certain items on the punch list were not within the scope of its contract. Burke nonetheless ordered IMC to work on the items. IMC refused, and school district officials ordered IMC off the site in February 1982. The record supports an inference that the officials acted according to Burke\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Litigation between the parties began in June 1981, when Burke filed a petition for declaratory judgment. IMC filed counterclaims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>seeking damages for loss of reputation, lost profits, and other economic hardships allegedly caused by Burke\u2019s breach of the contractual duty of supervision and by Burke\u2019s defamation of IMC. The trial court denied Burke\u2019s motion to dismiss, and a jury awarded IMC $100,000 for breach of contract and $150,000 for defamation. The trial court denied Burke\u2019s motions to set aside the verdict, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for remittitur. Burke appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\n<em>I. Breach of Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Burke does not deny that a breach occurred but contends there was insufficient proof that the breach was a proximate cause of IMC\u2019s injuries, or that these injuries were reasonably foreseeable. Because the test of proximate cause <em>is </em>foreseeability, 5 A. CORBIN, CONTRACTS \u00a7 1006, at 70 (1964), we address these two contentions together. Burke also argues that IMC\u2019s proof of lost profits was speculative. We view the evidence in a light most favorable to IMC and affirm the jury\u2019s verdict if there is sufficient evidence in the record to support it. <em>See Petrie-Clemons v. Butterfield, </em>122 N.H. 120, 124, 441 A.2d 1167, 1170 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The breach for which the jury awarded damages was Burke\u2019s failure to supervise the project. The construction project manual, which was incorporated into the parties\u2019 contract, provided that Burke \u201cshall coordinate and supervise the work performed by Subcontractors to the end that the work is carried out without conflict between trades and so that no trade, at any time, causes delay to the general progress of the work.\u201d A reasonable jury could find a breach of this provision in Burke\u2019s failure to schedule the job and to coordinate the work of different trades, resulting in a month-long delay during the summer of 1980. A reasonable jury could also determine that Burke misassigned punch list items to IMC and that this misassignment was a breach of Burke\u2019s duty of supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">At trial, IMC alleged that this breach caused it injuries, including loss of reputation, lost profits, and other economic harms. According to IMC, the delay during the summer of 1980 forced it to lay off employees. Moreover, IMC argued, it suffered a loss of reputation and a sudden drop in income coinciding with its involvement in the Bartlett school project. Finally, IMC stated that it subsequently lost its ability to obtain a line of credit and bonding, and failed to garner certain jobs, although its bids were competitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number> We first address whether there is a sufficient causal connection between Burke\u2019s breach and IMC\u2019s injuries to warrant holding Burke responsible for them; that is, whether IMC\u2019s losses were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the breach. <em>See </em>5 Corbin, <em>supra </em>\u00a7\u00a7 997-98, 1006-07. Damages are available only if the harm was a reasonably foreseeable result at the time the parties entered into the contract. <em>See Salem Engineering &amp; Const. Corp. v. Londonderry School Dist., </em>122 N.H. 379, 383, 445 A.2d 1091, 1094 (1982). One way a plaintiff may satisfy this requirement is by specifically proving that the defendant \u201chad reason to know the facts\u201d at the time the parties contracted and to foresee that the injury would be a probable consequence of a breach. <em>Petrie-Clemons v. Butterfield, </em>122 N.H. at 124, 441 A.2d at 1170 (quotation omitted). IMC satisfied this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We observe that when Burke engaged IMC in April 1980, construction work was scarce. The Bartlett school project promised to be high-profile work, especially because its progress would be discussed at local school board meetings. IMC, a family-run business, had been in business for less than a year. A jury could infer Burke was familiar with IMC\u2019s size and brief history at the time of contracting because Burke had previously worked with the father of IMC\u2019s principals and because a bidder\u2019s references, history, and qualifications are generally reviewed before a bid is accepted. Moreover, Burke should have known that an outsider might assume the punch list items were correctly assigned to IMC, thus making IMC\u2019s refusal to complete those items look like an unwillingness to perform its duties. Considering all these factors, we conclude that the record supports a finding that Burke had reason to foresee that misassigning punch list items would probably harm IMC\u2019s reputation and economic prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Similarly, the record reveals a significant causal connection between Burke\u2019s failure to coordinate the work of trades on the project and IMC\u2019s diminished profits. Given the paucity of construction work at the time of contracting and the relatively tight time schedule Burke demanded of IMC, it was likely that such a failure to supervise the project adequately would delay IMC\u2019s work, thus damaging its reputation, thereby lowering its profits. The evidence sustains a finding that Burke had reason to foresee that IMC\u2019s injuries would be a probable consequence of its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">These facts differ materially from those influencing our decision in <em>Salem Engineering, </em>on which Burke heavily relies. We reversed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>award of consequential damages in that case in part because the defendant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of contracting that the plaintiff general contractor would suffer a loss of reputation and a deterioration in its ability to remain a going concern if a fraction of the contract price were wrongfully withheld. <em>Salem Engineering, </em>122 N.H. at 384, 445 A.2d at 1094. The contractor\u2019s business had existed for years, employed forty to fifty people, had a value of approximately three million dollars, and had obtained projects worth more than five million dollars. <em>Id. </em>at 384, 445 A.2d at 1094. That contractor, unlike IMC, thus appeared well-established and immune from the losses alleged. In this case, the evidence indicates that Burke had reason to know of IMC\u2019s vulnerability.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Burke apparently argues that its breach did not justify the jury\u2019s award of damages because other events may have contributed to IMC\u2019s injuries. While we recognize the plausibility of Burke\u2019s premise, we point out that no one event is the sole cause of another. \u201cIn all cases involving problems of causation and responsibility for harm, a good many factors have united in producing the result....\u201d 5 Corbin, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 999, at 24. \u201cIn order to establish liability the plaintiff must [merely] show that the defendant\u2019s breach was \u2018a substantial factor\u2019 in causing the injury.\u201d 5 Corbin, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 999, at 25. IMC has done this. After carefully reviewing the transcripts and exhibits, we find no merit in Burke\u2019s suggestion that the jury\u2019s finding lacked a sufficient evidentiary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We next consider whether the record contains reasonably certain proof of IMC\u2019s lost profits to support the jury\u2019s award of $100,000 for the breach of contract. \u201cWhile the law does not require absolute certainty for recovery of damages, we will uphold an award of damages for lost profits only if sufficient relevant data support[] a finding that profits were reasonably certain to result\u201d in the absence of the breach. <em>Great Lakes Aircraft Co. v. City of Claremont, </em>135 N.H. 270, 296, 608 A.2d 840, 857 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">IMC\u2019s evidence on lost profits consisted of the expert testimony of Arthur Kenison. Kenison, an economics professor experienced in evaluating future profits, explained that he used a standard methodology to project IMC\u2019s lost profits from 1980 through 1985. He took into account IMC\u2019s revenues and operating costs for labor, materials, and subcontractors during the company\u2019s first year. His figures, drawn from cash revenue and expense reports, reveal that IMC had profits for its first year of operation, May 1979 through April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>1980, of $2,839, while its profits for the first <em>four months of </em>1980 were $4,930. The evidence supports his assumption that IMC\u2019s accounts were in balance in early 1980. Kenison chose to \u201cannualize\u201d IMC\u2019s profits for the period from January through April 1980, to create a hypothetical net \u201cincome potential\u201d for 1980 equal to $14,790, because he assumed that the losses from May to December 1979 reflected low start-up volume and did not represent the company\u2019s earning capacity. We are not persuaded by Burke\u2019s argument that choosing the <em>calendar </em>year 1980 as a base period would have yielded more reliable results, especially because the evidence suggests that Burke\u2019s breach caused a delay during the summer of 1980 and affected IMC\u2019s profits during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Comparing IMC\u2019s net \u201cincome potential\u201d of $14,790 with its actual profits according to its tax returns, Kenison calculated IMC\u2019s total lost profits for 1980 through 1985 at $203,680. He also testified that IMC\u2019s total lost profits would equal $230,036, if the rate of growth in construction industry employment throughout the State from 1980 through 1985 were factored in. Kenison further testified that his projections of lost profits would rise to $332,337 if IMC had invested its lost profits annually in three-month treasury bills through 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Burke argues that testimony of interest-inflated lost profits was improper and confusing to the jury. Because Burke failed to make a specific, contemporaneous objection to the admission of this testimony, our review of this issue is restricted to whether its admission rendered the evidence on lost profits uncertain. <em>Cf. State v. Ryan, </em>135 N.H. 587, 588, 607 A.2d 954, 955 (1992). The evidence indicates that Kenison included information on interest rates as a surrogate measure of the \u201ctime-value\u201d of the money IMC lost. We cannot conclude that the testimony on lost profits lacked a basis in sufficient relevant data merely because there is no evidence that IMC followed a strategy of investing in treasury bills. On this narrow question, we reject Burke\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Burke apparently contends that the evidence does not provide reasonably certain proof of lost profits because IMC did not, in fact, post a profit in 1980 or in any subsequent year. In <em>Restaurant Operators, Inc. v. Jenney, </em>128 N.H. 708, 519 A.2d 256 (1986), however, we upheld an award of lost profits even though the injured party\u2019s business posted losses every year it operated. The plaintiff in that case presented extensive financial data and uncontradicted testimony that the business had reached the break-even point shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>before the breach and \u201cgave every prospect of continued growth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 519 A.2d at 260. Kenison provided similar, uncontradicted evidence in this case. We decline to rule that IMC\u2019s evidence on lost profits was speculative on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Burke also contends that Kenison\u2019s testimony was speculative because it projected lost profits through 1985, three years after Burke had IMC evicted from the job site. Hounsell testified, however, that he never succeeded in ridding the industry of the perception that IMC was responsible for the shortcomings in the Bartlett school project. Curtis Burke, vice-president of the defendant, testified that a contractor\u2019s likelihood of placing an acceptable bid on a valuable project is determined in part by its past performance and references. Given this evidence, we are not persuaded that the projection of lost profits in this case constituted speculative proof of lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In its brief, Burke lists certain factors it contends Kenison should have analyzed, but did not: Burke\u2019s full payment to IMC for work completed in 1980; the \u201cparticular jobs IMC did\u201d from 1980 through 1985; \u201cthe degree of profitability in public works projects\u201d; and the availability of bidding opportunities in particular regions in the State. Burke\u2019s brief does not clarify how such factors might have affected Kenison\u2019s calculations, but merely asserts that Kenison\u2019s failure to take them into account rendered speculative the proof of lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">That Burke listed these factors without elaboration makes extensive consideration of them unnecessary. <em>See Keenan v. Fearon, </em>130 N.H. 494, 499, 543 A.2d 1379, 1382 (1988). We note that Kenison was familiar with the general nature of IMC\u2019s work. Kenison compared IMC\u2019s performance against growth in the construction business across the State because IMC engaged in a \u201cstatewide business.\u201d In addition, the availability of bidding opportunities is unlikely to have limited IMC\u2019s performance between 1980 and 1985 because the construction industry experienced dramatic growth during that period. We also note that the jury was apprised that Kenison\u2019s conclusions might have been weakened by his failure to account for each of these factors. In fact, the jury awarded only $100,000 on the breach of contract claim, although Kenison\u2019s lowest estimate was more than twice that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Proof of lost profits is not speculative as a matter of law simply because all conceivable factors have not been assessed. A de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>gree of uncertainty is inherent in any projection of future profits, <em>cf. Van Hooijdonk v. Langley, </em>111 N.H. 32, 34, 274 A.2d 798, 799 (1971); the essential issue is whether the evidence on lost profits provides enough information under the circumstances to permit the fact finder to reach a reasonably certain determination of the amount of gains prevented. <em>Cf. Fitz v. Coutinho, </em>136 N.H. 721, 727-28, 622 A.2d 1220, 1225 (1993). We conclude that Kenison\u2019s evaluation of IMC\u2019s financial records constituted an analysis of lost profits based on sufficient relevant data, and that the record contains sufficient evidence of lost profits to support the fact finder\u2019s assessment of damages. We hold that the trial court did not err in admitting Kenison\u2019s testimony or in denying Burke\u2019s motions to void the award of consequential damages for the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\n<em>II. Defamation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The next issue is whether the evidence supports the verdict that Burke defamed IMC. To establish defamation, there must be evidence that a defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in publishing, without a valid privilege, a false and defamatory statement of fact about the plaintiff to a third party. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 558 (1977); R. McNamara, 8 New Hampshire Practice, Personal Injury, Tort and Insurance Practice \u00a7 2 (1988). We will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the jury to find Burke liable for defamation if the jury\u2019s verdict is supported when the evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to IMC. <em>See Petrie-Clemons v. Butterfield, </em>122 N.H. at 124, 441 A.2d at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">IMC first contends that the jury\u2019s verdict is supported by evidence that Burke characterized IMC as in \u201cdefault,\u201d thereby suggesting that IMC was either unwilling or unable to perform its duties. We disagree with IMC\u2019s contention because there is no evidence that Burke published the term \u201cdefault\u201d to any third party. <em>See </em>Restatement (SECOND) OF Torts \u00a7 558(b). Although Burke threatened \u201cto default\u201d IMC in a letter to IMC, there is no evidence that any third party received this communication. In fact, no formal declaration of default ever occurred. Furthermore, the investigator for IMC\u2019s bonding company who testified that he had \u201cheard the word \u2018default\u2019 used\u201d in his interviews stated that he did not interview any Burke employees. Such evidence does not provide grounds for a reasonable jury to infer that <em>Burke </em>actually used the term \u201cdefault\u201d to describe IMC in any communication with a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>IMC\u2019s alternate theory for supporting the jury\u2019s verdict is that its summary discharge from the job site was a slanderous act that communicated to others that IMC had breached its contract with Burke. <em>See </em>RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 568(2); <em>see generally </em>Annotation, <em>Libel or Slander: Defamation by Gestures or Acts, </em>46 A.L.R.4th 403 (1986). We disagree. Although the evidence indicates that a general contractor\u2019s act of removing a subcontractor from a job site may impair the subcontractor\u2019s reputation, we note that a tort does not occur whenever a person\u2019s reputation is damaged. Proof of all the elements of defamation is still required. At trial, neither party produced any evidence from which a reasonable jury could have inferred that Burke\u2019s conduct was taken by any third party to mean that IMC had breached its contract. <em>See </em>RESTATEMENT (Second) of Torts \u00a7 558(a). No persons testified to understanding any information from Burke\u2019s discharge of IMC. There is no evidence indicating what statement of fact, if any, other parties gleaned from Burke\u2019s act. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 563, 614(2). Accordingly, IMC\u2019s claim of defamation was insupportable, and therefore, we must reverse the jury\u2019s verdict on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Because of this holding, we need not address the argument that the jury\u2019s award of damages for defamation lacked an adequate basis in the evidence. Furthermore, we need not address the argument that the damages awards were duplicative or manifestly exorbitant when added together. We do not find manifestly exorbitant the jury\u2019s award of $100,000 for the breach of contract claim, <em>see Steel v. Bemis, </em>121 N.H. 425, 428, 431 A.2d 113, 116 (1981), given the record in this case. We affirm the verdict and damage award for breach of contract, but reverse the verdict for defamation, and vacate the damages awarded for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; vacated in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
