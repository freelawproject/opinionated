Gray and Jean G. Edmundson, two of the beneficiaries under the Clayton J. Richardson trust (beneficiaries), appeal the decree of the Grafton County Probate Court <em>(Boyle, </em>J.) that \u201cClayton J. Richardson intended to benefit the issue of his deceased grandchildren in equal shares.\u201d They argue that the court erroneously interpreted the term \u201cissue\u201d to mean all descendants of the testator, thereby construing the trust as violating the rule against perpetuities. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-9\">The trust was established by Clayton J. Richardson\u2019s will, which was executed in 1932. It provided for payments to the testator\u2019s wife and, after his wife\u2019s death, to his only child, Verna. At Verna\u2019s death, the trustee was directed \u201cto pay the income of the trust equally to [Verna\u2019s] surviving children.\u201d Both the testator\u2019s wife and Verna are deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-10\">Verna had two children, Clayton Gray and Jean Edmundson. Both were alive at the testator\u2019s death; both also survived her. Following Clayton Gray\u2019s death, the trustee petitioned the probate court for instructions, asking who should receive income from the trust, how long distributions of income should continue, when the trust should be terminated, and who would be entitled to receive the principal of the trust. At that time, Clayton Gray was survived by two children and a grandchild; Jean Edmundson was alive and also had two living children and a grandchild.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-11\">The following three paragraphs are at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b16-12\">\u201c(f) If any such surviving child shall decease leaving issue surviving, to pay to such issue, equally, the income share provided for such deceased parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b17-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>(g) If any child of my daughter shall decease leaving no issue surviving, to pay her or his share to the surviving brothers and sisters, and in the event of their death, to their surviving children as provided in [paragraph] (f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b17-5\">(h) If upon entire failure of issue, the income of this trust cannot be distributed as herein provided, said trustees shall distribute the same to the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, located at Hanover, N.H.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">The probate court ruled that the trust income previously received by Verna\u2019s deceased child, Clayton Gray, should be distributed in equal shares to his issue until either no issue remain or the trust violates the rule against perpetuities. At that point, the principal of the trust is to be distributed pursuant to the provisions of intestate succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">On appeal, we are governed by the findings of fact of the probate court \u201cunless they are so plainly erroneous that such findings could not be reasonably made.\u201d RSA 567-A:4 (Supp. 1992); <em>see also In re Lisa H., </em>134 N.H. 188, 191, 589 A.2d 1004, 1006 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">Three well-settled rules govern our analysis of the matter at hand. First, the testator\u2019s intent is our principle guide in interpreting a will. <em>In re Estate of Sayewich, </em>120 N.H. 237, 241, 413 A.2d 581, 583 (1980). Second, if no contrary intent appears in the will, words within the will are to be given their common meaning. <em>In re Dumaine, </em>135 N.H. 103, 107, 600 A.2d 127, 129 (1991). Finally, the clauses in a will are not read in isolation; rather, their meaning is determined from the language of the will as a whole. <em>In re Segal Estate, </em>107 N.H. 120, 121, 218 A.2d 53, 54-55 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b17-9\">The gravamen of the beneficiaries\u2019 argument is the meaning of the word \u201cissue\u201d as used in the will. \u201cThe word \u2018issue\u2019 is not ordinarily the equivalent of the word \u2018child\u2019 or \u2018children.\u2019\u201d <em>Sylvester v. Newhall, </em>97 N.H. 267, 271, 85 A.2d 378, 381 (1952). Rather, \u201c[t]he word \u2018issue\u2019 means child, grandchild, or other lineal descendant.\u201d <em>Kimball v. Penhallow, </em>60 N.H. 448, 451 (1881); <em>see also Petition of Oliver Wolcott, </em>95 N.H. 23, 25, 56 A.2d 641, 642 (1948) (interpreting \u201cissue\u201d in will drafted in 1932 as \u201clineal descendants\u201d). This common definition was applied by the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-10\">The beneficiaries argue that the probate court erred in interpreting the word \u201cissue\u201d to include all the lineal descendants of the testator. In support of their argument, they direct us to paragraphs (f) and (g), which they assert use the term \u201cissue\u201d interchangeably with \u201cchildren.\u201d They contend, therefore, that \u201cissue\u201d should be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>strued to mean \u201cchildren.\u201d Our reading of the will as a whole, however, supports the probate court\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-3\">Although paragraphs (f) and (g) standing alone could be read as the beneficiaries maintain, paragraph (h) militates against the beneficiaries\u2019 argument. That paragraph provides for the distribution of trust income to the Mary Hitchcock Hospital \u201cupon entire failure of issue.\u201d Such language, frequently used in wills, supports the probate court\u2019s interpretation that \u201cissue\u201d should be given its common meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-4\">That the will was unartfully drafted is not contested. Faced with the task of interpreting a will where the testator\u2019s intent as expressed in the document was ambiguous, the probate court chose the commonly accepted legal meaning of \u201cissue.\u201d We find no error in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">The beneficiaries further argue that because the probate court\u2019s interpretation violates the rule against perpetuities, we should adopt their interpretation, which, they contend, does not violate the rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">In the absence of statute, the rule against perpetuities, as part of the common law, has been adopted in its modern English form. J. Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities \u00a7 200 (R. Gray ed., 4th ed. 1942). The statement of the rule, if not its application, is straightforward: \u201cNo interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 201. Verna\u2019s living child, Jean Edmundson, who was alive at the time of the testator\u2019s death, is the remaining \u201clife in being\u201d for purposes of the rule\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">Under paragraph (f), if one of Verna\u2019s children dies \u201cleaving issue surviving,\u201d the trustee is directed to \u201cpay to such issue, equally, the <em>income share </em>provided for such deceased parent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under the beneficiaries\u2019 interpretation, \u201cincome share\u201d should be read as \u201cprincipal,\u201d and one half of the trust proceeds should have been distributed outright upon the 1991 death of Verna\u2019s son Clayton Gray. Because the trust should, under this interpretation, be terminated on the death of Verna\u2019s remaining child, Jean Edmundson, the beneficiaries contend that the rule would not be violated. They argue that we must give the will this interpretation so as to avoid a clash with the rule. <em>See Citizens Nat. Bank v. St. Peters Lodge, </em>102 N.H. 352, 355, 156 A.2d 768, 770 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b18-8\">Even setting aside the difficulties paragraph (h) poses for this interpretation, we find no support for the contention that \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>come share\u201d means \u201cprincipal.\u201d \u201cShare\u201d is defined in WEBSTER\u2019S Third New International Dictionary 2087 (1961) as \u201cone\u2019s full or fair portion.\u201d Consequently, \u201cincome share\u201d means \u201cincome portion\u201d and does not in any sense refer to principal. We therefore reject the beneficiaries\u2019 attempt to read the will in a manner that does not violate the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">Determining that the will violates the rule against perpetuities does not mandate that its provisions must entirely fail, however. Although the rule prevails in this State, <em>see Gale v. Gale, </em>85 N.H. 358, 361, 159 A. 122, 124 (1932), it has never been \u201cremorselessly applied,\u201d <em>Merchants &amp;c. Bank v. Curtis, </em>98 N.H. 225, 229, 97 A.2d 207, 210 (1953) (quotation omitted). Hence the testator\u2019s intent, as determined by the probate court, will be carried out to the fullest extent possible. <em>Edgerly v. Barker, </em>66 N.H. 434, 475, 31 A. 900, 916 (1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The probate court directed the trustee to distribute income according to the provisions of the will until the rule against perpetuities is violated and, at such time, to distribute the trust principal according to the law of intestate succession. Accordingly, the testator\u2019s intent that the trust income should be distributed to his lineal descendants \u201cshall take effect as far as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find no error in the probate court\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">In their brief, the beneficiaries also argue that the probate court erred in ruling that the trust income should be distributed <em>per capita </em>rather than <em>per stirpes. </em>Because they failed to raise this issue in their notice of appeal, however, we do not address it. Sup. Ct. R. 16(3)(b); <em>Appeal of Toczko, </em>136 N.H. 480, 487, 618 A.2d 800, 804-05 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b19-9\">JOHNSON, J. , did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
