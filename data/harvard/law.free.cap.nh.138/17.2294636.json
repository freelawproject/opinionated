We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\">The parties\u2019 contract consists of five documents: (1) the application for coverage; (2) the declaration page; (3) the \u201ceasy reading\u201d policy; (4) the endorsement booklet; and (5) the revisions to the endorsement booklet. The parties agree that the endorsement booklet contains a clear and unambiguous \u201cantistacking\u201d provision, labeled \u201cPAC 2219A.\u201d The \u201ceasy reading\u201d policy states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\">\u201c[t]he endorsements are another part of this policy. <em>Only those endorsements whose numbers appear on the Declarations Page are a part of your policy. They add to or change parts of the policy. </em>These changes may be necessary to conform to the laws of your state or to new programs we\u2019ve implemented. Or they may provide optional coverages you\u2019ve paid for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">(Emphasis added.) The declarations page contains a section labeled \u201cEndorsements,\u201d in which the following numbers appear on a line: \u201c212 226 243 286 709 9032219A.\u201d The endorsement booklet contains a PAC endorsement \u201c903\u201d and a \u201c2219A,\u201d but not a PAC \u201c9032219A.\u201d Prudential asserts that the endorsement line should have read \u201c212 226 243 286 709 903 2219A,\u201d and that the lack of a space between the last two numbers resulted from a typographical error. The superior court ruled that this error created an ambiguity rendering the anti-stacking provision inapplicable. Prudential appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The defendant is correct that ambiguous policy language must be construed against the insurer. <em>See Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 771-72, 423 A.2d 980, 985 (1980). Language is ambiguous, however, only if \u201cthe contracting parties reasonably differ as to its meaning.\u201d <em>Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>130 N.H. 117, 121, 536 A.2d 164, 166 (1987) (quotation omitted). After reviewing the policy as a whole, we conclude that the parties cannot reasonably differ as to the meaning of \u201c9032219A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">First, we note that \u201c9032219A\u201d stands out from the other numbers listed on the \u201cEndorsements\u201d line of the declarations page. It is the last in the series, ends in a letter (the others do not), and is more than twice as long as any other. Thus, \u201c9032219A\u201d is not easy to ignore. Turning to the endorsement booklet, we find nineteen endorsement numbers listed in the table of contents, each preceded by \u201cPAC\u201d and followed by a brief, descriptive phrase. The numbers are listed in numerical order, just as on the \u201cEndorsements\u201d line. PAC \u201c2219A\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the last one listed. The table covers two facing pages, with PAC \u201c903\u201d appearing at the end of the first page and PAC \u201c2219A\u201d at the end of the second. Next to \u201c2219A\u201d are the words \u201cSTACKING OF COVERAGES PROHIBITED.\u201d As noted above, PAC \u201c9032219A\u201d does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\">A person looking for \u201c9032219A\u201d could not avoid noticing that a PAC \u201c903,\u201d but not a \u201c9032219A,\u201d exists. It is but a very small intellectual step to wonder if a \u201c2219A\u201d might be found. The layout of the table of contents makes it difficult to overlook the entry \u201c2219A.\u201d The eye is virtually drawn to it. We find it hard to believe that a policy holder wishing to discover the significance of \u201c9032219A\u201d would turn to the endorsement booklet\u2019s table of contents and not conclude that a simple typographical error had been made on the declarations page. Although we must view the parties\u2019 policy from the perspective of a lay person of average intelligence, <em>see Coakley v. Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>136 N.H. 402, 415, 618 A.2d 777, 785 (1992), it would be a sad indictment of our populace to assume that such a person, undertaking a \u201cmore than casual reading of the policy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 410, 618 A.2d at 781, could not figure out that the anti-stacking provision applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The defendant makes two other arguments we must address. First, she argues that a reasonable reading of the application for coverage would lead a policy holder to believe that stacking is permitted. She notes that the \u201ceasy reading\u201d policy expressly makes the application \u201ca part of the policy\u201d and that, when read in isolation, the application can be interpreted to allow stacking. We point out, however, that the \u201ceasy reading\u201d policy declares that endorsements \u201cadd to or change parts of the policy.\u201d Hence, endorsement 2219A added to or changed the policy \u2014 including the application \u2014 to prohibit stacking. We see no ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Second, the defendant argues that endorsement 2219A should not apply to prohibit stacking because the \u201ceasy reading\u201d policy does not clearly explain that an endorsement may restrict coverage, as well as expand it. To bolster this claim, she cites to policy language such as: \u201cThis [endorsement] booklet contains most of the endorsements we offer in your state .... [T]hey may provide optional coverages you have paid for.\u201d The \u201ceasy reading\u201d policy, however, also states that the endorsements \u201cmay be necessary to conform to the laws of your state or to new programs we have implemented\u201d and that \u201c[t]hese endorsements add to or change parts of the policy.\u201d These statements do not imply that an endorsement can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>only </em>expand coverage. We do not think that an ordinarily intelligent insured undertaking a more than casual reading of the entire policy would be led astray. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-6\">BATCHELDER, J., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b34-7\">BATCHELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7\">dissenting: I believe, as the trial court did, that the error in the policy created an ambiguity which rendered the anti-stacking provision inapplicable on the facts before us, and, accordingly, I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
