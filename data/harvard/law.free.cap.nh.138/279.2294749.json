They argue that the trial court erred: (1) in finding that the defendants\u2019 violation of RSA 485-A:39 (1992) did not provide the basis for a cause of action; (2) in failing to rule that the lack of signatures on the site assessment study constituted <em>per se </em>liability; (3) in finding that the realtor was acting as an intermediary, rather than as the bank\u2019s agent; and (4) because its findings on each theory of recovery were clearly erroneous. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>In July 1990, the plaintiffs, Peter Gray, his wife, Sandra, and his parents, Henry and Shirley, learned of the availability of a bowling alley, Lakeview Lanes, on the shore of Little Squam Lake in Holderness. Defendant First NH Banks, formerly First Central Bank (the bank), had acquired title to the bowling alley by virtue of a deed in lieu of foreclosure against the previous owner. Peter Gray contacted the bank about the property. Shortly thereafter, Rod Donaldson, a real estate agent associated with defendant La-Sal Properties of New Hampshire, Inc. (La-Sal) who had worked with Gray in unsuccessful negotiations for another property, became involved in the negotiations for Lakeview Lanes on Gray\u2019s behalf. After viewing the property with Gwendolyn Davis, a bank representative, Peter Gray offered to buy it for $225,000. The bank made a counteroffer of $325,000, and the parties failed to reach agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Following the initial offer, Peter Gray spoke with a co-worker, Philip Stone, who had worked for several summers at Lakeview Lanes. Stone told Gray that he \u201chad heard that there were problems with the septic system,\u201d that the son of a former owner had been deterred from purchasing the property because \u201cthere were significant problems with the septic system,\u201d and that he should have the system checked. Gray responded that he intended to use the septic problems \u201cas a negotiating tool with the bank to lower the purchase price.\u201d The system was never inspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On October 17,1990, Peter Gray offered $275,000 for the property, requesting a warranty deed. The proposal to purchase contained the following paragraph: \u201c4. Buyers and Sellers recognize that there is a present and potential problem with subject property\u2019s well and septic systems.\u201d The parties ultimately entered into a sales agreement on October 23, 1990, which provided that the property would be transferred by quitclaim deed and made no reference to the septic system. The Grays and the bank closed the sale and transferred title on November 16, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">When the Grays began operating the bowling alley and restaurant, the septic problems surfaced. The system needed frequent pumping and emitted noxious odors. After learning that RSA 485-A:39 (1992) (current version at RSA 485-A:39 (Supp. 1993)) required the preparation of a site assessment study evaluating the sewage system of developed waterfront property before it could be offered for sale, Shirley Gray contacted Donaldson and requested a copy of the document. Although the Grays maintain that they had no knowledge of the site assessment until Shirley Gray received a copy from Donald<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>son in January 1991, the bank contends that the Grays were given a copy of the document at the closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\">The Grays filed suit against the bank and La-Sal, contending that the bank\u2019s failure to procure a site assessment until the day before the closing violated RSA 485-A:39, entitling them to rescission of the contract, and that the negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations of the bank and La-Sal entitled them to money damages. The defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case in the jury-waived trial was granted, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In the ordinary course of jury-waived trials, the judge, as trier of fact, makes factual findings to determine whether the plaintiffs have proved their case by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Renovest Co. v. Hodges Development Corp., </em>135 N.H. 72, 78, 600 A.2d 448, 452 (1991). \u201cOn appeal, we will not overrule these findings of fact, unless they are clearly erroneous, nor will we reverse the dismissal based thereon unless it is inconsistent with the findings or otherwise contrary to law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first two arguments raise the consequences of a violation of the site assessment statute. RSA 485-A:39 requires the owner of developed waterfront property, prior to offering it for sale, to procure a site assessment study on the sewage disposal system. In this case, the site assessment study was dated the day before the closing and was not signed by the buyers as required. That the requirements of the site assessment statute were not met is not in dispute. Rather, it is the remedy for failure to strictly comply with the statutory mandate that is at stake. The plaintiffs contend that the failure to comply creates <em>per se </em>liability, entitling them to rescission of the purchase. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Although a violation of RSA 485-A:39 occurred, evidence at trial refuted the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the violation in any way caused their injuries. The trial court found that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs were aware of significant problems with the septic system prior to the sale.\u201d In addition to Stone\u2019s testimony that he had warned Peter Gray of the problems with the septic system, the initial proposal to purchase contained an express acknowledgement that there was \u201ca present and potential problem with subject property\u2019s well and septic systems.\u201d Further, Gray testified that this language was included because \u201cthe bank wanted to be sure that I wouldn\u2019t come back later on and say I\u2019ve got no water and my leach field is not working.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The evidence that is most damaging to the plaintiffs is Peter Gray\u2019s admission that he intended to use the septic problems \u201cas a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>negotiating tool with the bank to lower the purchase price.\u201d The purpose of the site assessment study is \u201cto determine if the site meets the current standards of sewage disposal systems established by the division [of water supply and pollution control, department of environmental services].\u201d RSA 485-A:39, I; <em>see </em>RSA 485-A:2, III. Thus the statute serves to inform a prospective buyer of the condition of the sewage system, information not readily apparent from a site inspection of the property. Here, however, the plaintiffs knew of the problems yet chose to utilize them as a bargaining chip in negotiations for the purchase of the property. Accordingly, because the plaintiffs failed to prove that the statutory violation, rather than their chosen negotiation strategy, caused their injuries, the trial court\u2019s ruling was not contrary to the evidence or erroneous as a matter of law. <em>See Renovest, </em>135 N.H. at 78, 600 A.2d at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We recognize that the material required by the statute to be disclosed to the potential purchaser is broader than the information that the plaintiffs acknowledged they received. The trial court specifically found, however, that \u201c[t]here was nothing new in the way of septic system information in the [site assessment] report.\u201d Because this factual finding was not clearly erroneous, <em>see Renovest, </em>135 N.H. at 78, 600 A.2d at 452, we will not overrule it. We note that in future cases, the lack of strict compliance with the statutory mandate may give rise to the remedy sought by the plaintiffs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The plaintiffs next argue that the trial court\u2019s finding that Donaldson acted as an intermediary and not as the seller\u2019s agent was not supported by the evidence. Donaldson, Davis, and Peter Gray all testified that Donaldson was acting as no one\u2019s agent during the negotiations and was merely an intermediary in some hybrid capacity, facilitating the property\u2019s transfer. We find ample support in the evidence for the trial court\u2019s finding of Donaldson\u2019s unique status. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The plaintiffs finally contend that the trial court\u2019s findings on each of its theories of recovery were so against the weight of the evidence as to constitute an abuse of discretion. With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 count based on negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation, \u201c[o]ne who fraudulently makes a misrepresentation ... for the purpose of inducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon it, is subject to liability to the other in deceit for pecuniary loss caused to him by his justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 525 (1976). Similarly, \u201c[o]ne who, in the course of his business . . . supplies false information for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552. The plaintiffs failed to meet their burden on both theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The trial court found that no misrepresentation occurred. Further, based on evidence that included Peter Gray\u2019s own testimony, the court found that the plaintiffs were aware of the problems with the sewer system early on in the negotiations, thus negating any argument that they relied on the bank\u2019s or realtor\u2019s statements. Finally, Peter Gray testified that he had no evidence that the value of the property is substantially less than that bargained for with the defendants. Because there was evidence on which the trial court could reasonably base its finding that no misrepresentation occurred, <em>see Quinlan v. City of Dover, </em>136 N.H. 226, 229, 614 A.2d 1057, 1058 (1992), it did not err in dismissing this count. <em>See Renovest, </em>135 N.H. at 78, 600 A.2d at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs maintain that the trial court erred in dismissing its count seeking restitution by rescission for mutual mistake. \u201cWhere a mistake of both parties at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 152(1) (1979). Because the trial court found that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs were aware of significant problems with the septic system prior to the sale\u201d and because there was ample evidence to support this finding, <em>see Quinlan v. City of Dover, </em>136 N.H. at 229, 614 A.2d at 1058, no mistake occurred. Consequently, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>Renovest, </em>135 N.H. at 78, 600 A.2d at 452; <em>see also Derouin v. Granite State Realty, Inc., </em>123 N.H. 145, 147, 459 A.2d 231, 233 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
