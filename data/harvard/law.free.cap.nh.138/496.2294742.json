(camp school), sought an abatement of real property taxes from the Town of Wolfeboro (town), alleging that it was entitled to an exemption as a school under RSA 72:23, IV (1991). The town denied the abatement and the camp school appealed. After a three-day trial, the Superior Court <em>(Mohl, </em>J.) granted a limited abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">On appeal before this court, the town argues that the trial court erred in ruling: (1) that the camp school is a school within the meaning of the exemption statute; (2) that even if the property is not fully taxable, the trial court should have allocated the property between taxable \u201ccamp\u201d property and exempt \u201cschool\u201d property; (3) that certain vacant and unimproved land designated by the camp school for future faculty housing is exempt from taxation; and (4) that other taxable land of the camp school should be valued at $1,500 per acre. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The camp school is a nonprofit corporation formed in 1977 \u201cexclusively for educational purposes, including the organization and operation of a summer school and related activities.\u201d Its articles of agreement require that upon dissolution its assets be distributed to a nonprofit organization established for similar purposes. The camp school\u2019s property consists of approximately 45.7 acres of land with frontage on Rust Pond in Wolfeboro. Seventeen acres contain nineteen buildings, ninety-seven tent sites, and a variety of recreational facilities. The trial court held this property to be tax exempt. The remaining 28.5 acres consist of vacant, unimproved land, of which 4.4 acres has been designated by the camp school as the future site of faculty housing. The trial court ruled that the 4.4-acre parcel is tax exempt and that the remaining acreage is taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The camp school program operates for seven weeks each summer. Approximately 200 children between the ages of twelve and eighteen attend, of whom the majority are boarders. The camp school employs over thirty faculty members, drawn mainly from a number of recognized independent schools, the majority of whom reside on the camp school grounds while the program is in session. Faculty members preside at meals, and supervise, tutor, coach, and otherwise assist the children as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\">The program offers courses of instruction in subjects including reading, writing, vocabulary, Latin, French, Spanish, English, United States and European history, mathematics, algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, biology, and chemistry. Classes meet for five fifty-minute periods a day, six days a week. Children are required to take three academic subjects and must attend supervised study periods for two hours, five evenings per week. Children are tested regularly, grades and written reports are given weekly, and final academic reports are forwarded to each child\u2019s parents and to the school the child attends during the academic year. Some children earn credit toward their high school diploma; whether credit is given is within the discretion of the child\u2019s secondary school.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The program also includes a variety of recreational activities. For two hours on weekday afternoons, children participate in such sports as volleyball, baseball, basketball, tennis, and swimming. Approximately once a week, the camp school has voluntary athletic matches against local camps. In addition, children fourteen years of age or younger are required to participate in a \u201cwater, land and mountains program\u201d that includes training in such areas as basic boating, water safety, and camping, culminating in one weekend camping trip in the White Mountains. Children ages fifteen and sixteen must attend one one-night camping trip during the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The town first argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the camp school is a \u201cschool\u201d within the meaning of RSA 72:23, IV. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cThe following real estate and personal property shall, unless otherwise provided by statute, be exempt from taxation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">IV. The buildings and structures of schools, seminaries of learning, colleges, academies and universities organized or incorporated or carrying on their principal activities in this state and owned, used and occupied by them for the purposes for which they are established ... and the land thereto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>appertaining but not including lands and buildings not used and occupied directly for the purposes for which they are organized or incorporated . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-3\">The town argues that the statutory exemption is available only to institutions that qualify as schools within the meaning of New Hampshire\u2019s education statutes and regulations and that are approved by the department of education. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 189 (1989 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 1993); N.H. Admin. Rules, Ed 306. Because the camp school\u2019s program does not, among other things, contain a sequence of courses, lead to a diploma, or operate for 180 days each year, the town contends that it cannot satisfy the laws governing schools and, therefore, is not entitled to a tax exemption as a school.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">A tax exemption statute is construed not with rigorous strictness but \u201cto give full effect to the legislative intent of the statute,\u201d and, absent formal legislative history, intent must be gleaned from the plain language of the statute. <em>In re Estate of Martin, </em>125 N.H. 690, 691, 484 A.2d 1183, 1184 (1984) (quotation omitted). Prior to 1957, the statute authorized a tax exemption to \u201cinstitutions devoted to educational purposes\u201d provided that \u201c[n]o institution shall be deemed an educational institution for the purpose hereof unless it conducts regular courses of instruction, under a curriculum approved by the state board of education, for at least six months of each calendar year.\u201d Laws 1955, ch. 157. These limitations were repealed when the statute was amended in 1957. <em>See </em>Laws 1957, 202:2. Legislative history of the 1957 revision is scant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The town argues that since 1957 the term \u201cschool\u201d has had a specific meaning in the New Hampshire education statutes and if the legislature meant the term \u201cschool\u201d in the tax exemption statute to mean something different, it would have made its intent clear. The language used in RSA 72:23, IX however, does not manifest the intent to restrict the operation of the statute so as to include only those schools established in compliance with the compulsory school attendance laws. The fact that the 1957 amendment eliminated the specific restrictions for qualifying educational institutions undermines the town\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The construction of a bright-line test for determining what constitutes an educational institution under the statute is impossible. <em>New Canaan Academy v. Town of Canaan, </em>122 N.H. 134, 137, 441 A.2d 1174, 1176 (1982). \u201c[E]ach case will necessarily depend on its own peculiar facts,\u201d aided by reference to four general guidelines: (1) whether the institution\u2019s purposes are \u201ceducational \u2014 i.e., intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>develop the faculties and powers and the expansion of knowledge through a systematic course of instruction or schooling as distinguished from the mere communication of facts or ideas\u201d; (2) whether the land and buildings in question are \u201cused and occupied directly\u201d for these educational purposes; (3) whether none of its income or profits may be divided among its members or owners or used or appropriated for any purposes other than its educational purpose, RSA 72:23, IV; and (4) how closely the instruction provided compares to \u201ctraditional educational methods and objectives.\u201d <em>New Canaan Academy, </em>122 N.H. at 137, 441 A.2d at 1176 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\">The town does not seriously contest that the camp school\u2019s purposes are, at least in part, educational. In addition, the town concedes that \u201cthe subject matter of the various courses taught at the camp school is substantially similar to the subject matter of the courses taught by the \u2018government\u2019 (i.e., by public high schools in New Hampshire).\u201d The town argues, however, that because the camp school\u2019s basic methods and objectives diverge \u201cgreatly\u201d from those of the government\u2019s schools, it fails to meet the fourth <em>New Canaan </em>guideline. In addition, the town contends that because the program consists of both educational and recreational activities, the land ought to be apportioned between the \u201cschool\u201d and the \u201ccamp.\u201d The implication from these arguments is that the camp school also fails the second and third <em>New Canaan </em>guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"> The camp school offers an intensive academic program designed to prepare students for work at a secondary school, to fulfill course credit at a secondary school, or to make up courses failed during the academic year. Standard textbooks are used, the instructors are qualified teachers, and the course of study fits into a scheme of traditional education including branches of instruction usually included in the academic course of secondary schools in New Hampshire, both public and independent. <em>See Warde v. Manchester, </em>56 N.H. 508 (1876); <em>cf. New Canaan Academy, </em>122 N.H. at 136, 441 A.2d at 1175 (\u201cschool\u201d for instruction in sitting meditation, Tai Chi, and Zen Basketball not entitled to exemption). As we stated in <em>New Canaan, </em>\u201cit is not necessary that the training be of the type that would otherwise be furnished by the government.\u201d 122 N.H. at 137, 441 A.2d at 1176. The record amply supports the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201c[t]he clear weight of the evidence shows [the camp school] to be a \u2018school\u2019 within the meaning of RSA 72:23, IV.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We likewise reject the town\u2019s argument that because the camp school has attributes common to a summer camp, <em>e.g., </em>the chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>dren live in tents and participate in recreational activities, the camp school\u2019s property should be apportioned between \u201ccamp\u201d property and \u201cschool\u201d property. The statute does not require that a school\u2019s property be used exclusively for educational purposes, so long as it is used directly by the school for those purposes. <em>See St. Paul\u2019s School v. City of Concord, </em>117 N.H. 243, 249-50, 372 A.2d 269, 273-74 (1977); <em>Appalachian Mountain Club v. Meredith, </em>103 N.H. 5, 15, 163 A.2d 808, 814 (1960). In an academic year boarding school program, recreational programs are considered an integral part of the educational program and do not affect the school\u2019s tax exemption. <em>See Duffley v. N.H. Interschol. Ath. Assoc., Inc., </em>122 N.H. 484, 492, 446 A.2d 462, 467 (1982); <em>St. Paul\u2019s School, </em>117 N.H. at 257-58, 372 A.2d at 278; <em>cf. Christian Camps &amp; Conferences v. Town of Alton, </em>118 N.H. 351, 388 A.2d 187 (1978) (religious activity slight and subordinate relative to camping activity). We agree with the trial court that the camp school \u201coperates a fully integrated academic program whose fundamental aims are educational. The fact that students are housed in canvas tents and follow their academic schedule in an outdoor atmosphere is immaterial .... It is the <em>use </em>of the facilities not their physical appearance that is determinative of their status for tax purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\">The town next argues that the trial court erred by exempting from taxation 4.4 acres of vacant, unimproved land designated by the camp school as the future site of faculty housing. To qualify for the exemption under RSA 72:23, iy land must be \u201cused and occupied\u201d by the exempt entity \u201cdirectly for the purposes for which [it is] organized or incorporated.\u201d RSA 72:23, IV. The camp school admits that \u201ca parcel of approximately 4.4 acres ... is presently essentially vacant but is in [the] process of being developed for future faculty housing.\u201d It notes that definite plans have been made to construct faculty housing, it has incurred expenses in conducting soil tests, surveying, and other pre-construction planning, and the only reason the plans are on hold is this litigation. The camp school contends that these facts establish a \u201cuse\u201d of the property sufficient to qualify for an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">This court has rejected similar arguments in cases decided under prior versions of the statute that contained a less restrictive standard. For example, in <em>Trustees of Phillips Exeter Academy v. Exeter, </em>90 N.H. 472, 27 A.2d 569 (1940), the exemption statute required that land be \u201cowned and occupied\u201d by the institution in order to qualify. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 27 A.2d at 590-91. We held that a \u201cdisused\u201d building that the school planned to convert into a student grill room, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>auditorium, and publication plant, was wholly taxable as not then being put to any use. We also held that unimproved lots having no present use were taxable. <em>Id. </em>at 506, 27 A.2d at 592. Likewise, in <em>Society of the Cincinnati in the State of New Hampshire v. Exeter, </em>92 N.H. 348, 350-51, 31 A.2d 52, 54 (1943), we held that despite the fact that a charitable organization had a plan and purpose of future use for an old building, the fact that the building at that time had no actual use rendered it taxable. \u201c[E]ven a probable occupancy in some manner of charitable use in the indefinite future is not a present one such as the statute demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 31 A.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\">The cases cited by the camp school in support of its position are not persuasive. <em>See Christian Science Pleasant View Home v. City of Concord, </em>117 N.H. 239, 241-42, 372 A.2d 267, 268-69 (1977) (special legislation allowed home for aged to qualify for tax exemption while home was vacant and for sale); <em>St. Mary\u2019s School v. Concord, </em>80 N.H. 436, 439, 118 A. 608, 609 (1922) (land held for future purpose of erecting a school was currently being cultivated for use by the school thereby constituting a sufficient occupation of the land). We hold that the 4.4 acres of land designated as the future site of faculty housing is not exempt from taxation under RSA 72:23, IV. It does not meet the statutory requirements that the land not only be occupied by the exempt institution, but also that it be used directly for educational purposes. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision exempting that land is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Finally, the town argues that the trial court erred by finding that approximately 24.2 acres of vacant back land should be valued at $1,500 per acre. The town contends that the parties \u201cstipulated and agreed to the accuracy of the Town\u2019s assessments,\u201d and that that assessment actually was $2,104.88 per acre. The record does not support a determination that the parties either stipulated or agreed to the value of the vacant back land.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The parties apparently did not dispute that if none of the camp school\u2019s property qualified for an exemption, the proper assessment for tax purposes would be $1,638,100. It does not follow, however, that the camp school thereby stipulated to the value of the components of that total. Indeed, the record indicates that the valuation of the vacant back land was in dispute. The trial court was presented with conflicting testimony on the issue and found \u201cthe vacant back land to be valued at $1500.00 per acre.\u201d Because this factual finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>is supported by the evidence, we will not disturb it. <em>See Guaraldi v. Trans-Lease Group, </em>136 N.H. 457, 461, 617 A.2d 648, 650 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
