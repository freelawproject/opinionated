NHIG argues that the trial court erred, <em>inter alia, </em>in allowing the plaintiffs to present theories that had been removed from the declaratory judgment ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>tion, in determining which coverage was in effect, and in applying the doctrine of estoppel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The pertinent facts follow. The Trefethens opened a convenience store known as Red\u2019s Variety in 1985 and through David Marston, of the Tobey &amp; Merrill insurance agency, purchased from NHIG a property owner\u2019s liability policy that included a standard liquor liability exclusion. On October 30,1987, Marston visited the store and, noticing that the Trefethens were selling homemade sandwiches, suggested that they get additional coverage. Mercer Trefethen testified at a hearing in the declaratory judgment proceeding that although there was no specific mention of liquor liability, he told Marston that he \u201cwanted to be covered [immediately] for everything,\u201d and that Marston responded that \u201che\u2019d put it on that day.\u201d The trial court found that Trefethen had \u201crequested additional coverage to include <em>every saleable item\u201d </em>(emphasis in original), and that, by agreement, \u201c[c]overage was to apply [as of] October 30, 1987.\u201d On November 27, 1987, two minors were killed in an alcohol-related car crash after allegedly purchasing beer at Red\u2019s Variety. After the accident, but without notifying NHIG of the accident, Marston submitted a request to NHIG for comprehensive general liability coverage retroactive to October 30, 1987. NHIG issued the retroactive comprehensive coverage, and although it contained the same liquor exclusion as had the property owner\u2019s coverage, no copy of the new comprehensive form was provided to the Trefethens. The minors\u2019 estates brought civil actions against the Trefethens. Pointing to the liquor exclusion, NHIG indicated it would neither provide coverage nor defend the lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The Trefethens filed a declaratory judgment action against NHIG, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Tobey &amp; Merrill was NHIG\u2019s agent and that NHIG was \u201clegally bound by the various representations, errors, and omissions\u201d of Tobey &amp; Merrill. NHIG moved to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 main claim was one against Tobey &amp; Merrill for failing to properly procure insurance, and that such a claim should be litigated in an action at law in contract or negligence rather than in a declaratory judgment action. NHIG withdrew its motion after the plaintiffs stipulated that they would sue Tobey &amp; Merrill (NHIG was also named as a defendant in the civil action under a theory of vicarious liability). After bringing the civil action, the Trefethens moved to amend the declaratory judgment petition to remove \u201call claims by the plaintiffs that the New Hampshire Insurance Group is <em>vicariously liable </em>for their agent, Tobey &amp; Merrill, Inc.\u2019s legal fault . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>An evidentiary hearing was held in the declaratory judgment action at which the Trefethens attempted to introduce evidence of an agency relationship between NHIG and Tobey <em>&amp; </em>Merrill, and to elicit testimony concerning their expectations of coverage based on the October 30, 1987, conversation with Marston. NHIG objected, arguing that the pretrial stipulation and the amended petition limited the scope of the declaratory judgment action to simply an interpretation of the written policy, and that the issues to which the Marston conversation was relevant \u2014 including questions of agency, estoppel and improper procurement of insurance \u2014 were part of the action brought against Tobey <em>&amp; </em>Merrill. The trial court disagreed and admitted the evidence. The trial court required NHIG to provide coverage and a defense, ruling that an oral contract for insurance had been formed on October 30, that based on the conversation the Trefethens reasonably expected that they had liquor liability coverage, and that the liquor exclusion under the comprehensive coverage was not effective because the Trefethens were not informed of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">NHIG first argues that the trial court erred in allowing the Trefethens to argue and present evidence on the issues of agency and estoppel because these issues had been removed from the declaratory judgment action by the stipulation and the amended petition. We disagree. First, although NHIG now argues that the stipulation removed from the declaratory judgment action all issues save interpretation of the written policy, NHIG\u2019s motion to dismiss (which precipitated the stipulation) and the stipulation itself specifically refer only to the separate litigation of the issue of improper procurement of insurance; neither specifically refers to severance of agency or estoppel theories. Second, consideration of the amended petition does not help NHIG because the Trefethens asked only that theories of <em>vicarious </em>liability against NHIG be stricken; theories of coverage based on contract principles of agency or estoppel, however, are theories of <em>direct </em>liability, and thus were unaffected by the amendment of the declaratory judgment petition. Third, NHIG should reasonably have been prepared for the possibility that the trial court would entertain agency and estoppel theories. When NHIG moved for summary judgment arguing that the only question before the court was one of interpretation of the written policy, the Trefethens objected, arguing that material issues of fact remained with regard to what representations were made by Marston and whether they received a copy of the new comprehensive policy. In denying NHIG\u2019s motion, the trial court noted that \u201cthe Trefethens maintain that there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>dispute ... as to what constitutes the insurance contract.\u201d Finally, we note that at the evidentiary hearing it was NHIG who, contrary to its current position that the stipulation restricted the declaratory judgment action to one of written policy interpretation, first elicited evidence on issues of agency and estoppel, including testimony from Mercer Trefethen about his October 30 conversation with Marston.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We turn now to NHIG\u2019s substantive arguments. NHIG first argues that the trial court erred in finding that comprehensive liability coverage was in effect at the time of the accident. According to NHIG, the property owner\u2019s policy was not supplanted because Marston\u2019s first formal request to NHIG for a coverage change was not made until after the accident and without notice of it. NHIG insists that \u201can agent cannot bind a carrier for a previously known loss without disclosing the loss.\u201d This argument is flawed inasmuch as there is no evidence in the record that the loss was \u201cknown\u201d to Marston when he made the formal request for coverage (Mercer Trefethen testified that he was not aware of the loss until January 1988). Further, even assuming that Marston failed to disclose a known loss, this is a much different case than one in which the <em>insureds </em>made misrepresentations on an application for insurance. Absent proof of some misrepresentation attributable to the insureds, we see no reason effect should not be given to NHIG\u2019s voluntary backdating of comprehensive coverage. The issue of voluntary backdating aside, the trial court could have properly found that comprehensive coverage was in effect at the time of the accident because Marston, as an agent for NHIG, created an oral binder by virtue of his October 30 discussion with Mercer Trefethen. <em>See Elliott v. Insurance Co., </em>92 N.H. 505, 510-12, 33 A.2d 562, 567 (1943) (finding oral contract for insurance notwithstanding fact that some essential contract terms, including duration and premium, were never expressed: \u201c[a]s to these [essential] elements implication is enough without expression\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">NHIG next argues that even if comprehensive coverage was in effect at the time of the accident, the trial court erred in not giving effect to the liquor liability exclusion contained in the written terms of the undelivered comprehensive form. The Trefethens disagree, arguing that the exclusion was not effective because it was never delivered to them, <em>see Green Mt. Ins. Co. v. Bonney, </em>131 N.H. 762, 767-68, 561 A.2d 1057, 1060-61 (1989), and that NHIG should be estopped from denying coverage because the Trefethens reasonably expected that they were covered based on the October 30 conversation with Marston. We need not reach the questions of (1) whether nondelivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>of the policy, without more, would render the liquor exclusion unenforceable, or (2) whether Marston\u2019s representations at the time a binder was created could serve to estop NHIG from denying coverage even after delivery of a written policy. Instead, in order to affirm, we need only hold that nondelivery of a written policy coupled with Marston\u2019s October 30 representations were sufficient to estop NHIG from denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">While \u201cthe general rule is that [an oral] binder provides only as much coverage as the policy would have provided,\u201d <em>see </em>A. WlNDT, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 6.34 (2d ed. 1988), as we explained in <em>Robbins Auto Parts, Inc. v. Granite State Insurance Co., </em>121 N.H. 760, 435 A.2d 507 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cWhere the terms of the [insurance] policy are clear and unambiguous, an insured may not reasonably expect coverage unless the parties\u2019 prior dealings would lead the insured to form a reasonable belief that the policy provided him the claimed coverage or unless the insured\u2019s reliance on the insurer\u2019s agent\u2019s assurances was reasonable so as to estop the company from denying coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 762-63, 435 A.2d at 509 (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also Olszak v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>119 N.H. 686, 690-91, 406 A.2d 711, 714-15 (1979) (agent\u2019s knowledge of an insured\u2019s needs and expectations are imputed to the insurance company so that it may be es-topped from denying coverage). NHIG argues, however, that the doctrine of estoppel cannot be used to bring within the coverage of the policy risks not included in its terms. <em>See Johnson v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>113 N.H. 8, 11, 300 A.2d 57, 59-60 (1973). Therefore, NHIG argues, it cannot be estopped from denying liquor liability coverage because not only did the Trefethens\u2019 comprehensive policy not cover that risk, NHIG did not even sell liquor liability policies at that time. Despite some early pronouncements to this effect, in more recent years we have applied the doctrine of estoppel even where written policies unambiguously did not extend coverage. <em>See Boyce v. Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>121 N.H. 774, 779-80, 435 A.2d 510, 514 (1981) (insured entitled to coverage for accident involving trailer notwithstanding that policy unambiguously did not cover trailer where insured reasonably believed coverage existed based on dialogue with agent); <em>Olszak, </em>119 N.H. at 690-91, 406 A.2d at 714-15 (insurer estopped from denying coverage for snowplower sued by person who slipped on icy parking lot notwithstanding that policy contained \u201ccompleted operations\u201d exclusion); <em>see also V &amp; V Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>American Policyholders\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>127 N.H. 372, 500 A.2d 695 (1985); <em>Karol v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>120 N.H. 287, 414 A.2d 939 (1980). We adhere to this line of cases and hold that the plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable expectations of coverage based on prior dealings with NHIG\u2019s agent may be enforced despite clear and unambiguous policy language to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\">Finally, NHIG argues that even if estoppel may be used \u201coffensively\u201d so as to create coverage not in the written policy, the dealings between the Trefethens and Marston were insufficient to create an enforceable specific expectation of coverage. <em>See Allen v. Sentry Insurance, </em>137 N.H. 579, 582, 630 A.2d 780, 782 (1993). NHIG points out that the Trefethens testified that they never specifically discussed liquor liability coverage with Marston. In order to find a reasonable expectation of coverage based on prior dealings, NHIG argues, we must impose on insurance agents the duty to know all the insured\u2019s needs, to procure appropriate coverage, and to inform the insured of every facet of the coverage. We need not recognize such a duty in order to affirm, however, and instead agree with the trial court that an enforceable specific expectation of liquor liability coverage arose from the Trefethens\u2019 request for coverage on every sale-able item coupled with Marston\u2019s knowledge that beer was one of those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">We have considered NHIG\u2019s other arguments and find them unpersuasive. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322, 627 A.2d 595, 596 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b729-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
