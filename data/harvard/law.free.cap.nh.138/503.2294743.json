On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his request for a mistrial based upon the comment of a witness and in limiting cross-examination of the minor victim regarding her prior sexual activity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The victim testified that the defendant sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions. Because the defendant wore a knife strapped to his belt on each occasion, the victim believed his threats to kill her if she did not submit. Before trial, the defendant successfully moved to exclude evidence of several other times that the defendant accosted young girls. During the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the police officer who questioned the defendant after his arrest testified to the exculpatory stories told by the defendant about the three charged incidents. He testified that the defendant admitted to carrying a single knife for utility purposes. The following colloquy then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">\u201cQ. After you went through the three incidents with him, did he say anything to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">A. Yes. During the conversation with him at one point he said something to the effect of, You\u2019ve got all the weapons \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">At this point the defendant objected and requested a mistrial, arguing that the statement, \u201cYou\u2019ve got all the weapons,\u201d related to the incidents that had been excluded from evidence, and that the statement taken out of context would appear to the jury as an admission of guilt to the three assaults charged. The judge denied the request for a mistrial and, instead, instructed the jury to disregard the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the refusal to grant a mistrial constituted reversible error. The State conceded at oral argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ment that the statement was inadmissible, but argues that the statement did not constitute sufficient prejudice to the defendant to require a mistrial because the statement was \u201cambiguous at best\u201d in the context made. We find the State\u2019s position more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u201cTo justify a mistrial, prejudicial testimony must be more than inadmissible, it must constitute an irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions.\u201d <em>State v. Ellison, </em>135 N.H. 1, 4, 599 A.2d 477, 479 (1991) (quotations omitted). Absent an abuse of the discretion afforded to the trial court because of its \u201coptimal vantage point for measuring prejudicial effect,\u201d we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to deny a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 599 A.2d at 480. Where the objectionable testimony is ambiguous in nature, the defendant is not so prejudiced that a mistrial is required. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 599 A.2d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Here, the \u201cweapons\u201d statement was elicited immediately after the police officer testified to the defendant\u2019s exculpatory statements regarding each of the incidents charged and to the defendant\u2019s statement that he carried a single knife for utility purposes. No one testified that multiple weapons were involved in the sexual assaults charged. Taken in light of the preceding denials of culpability and the explanation for the presence of a single knife, the \u201cweapons\u201d statement is ambiguous. The trial court itself noted that the statement \u201ccould have been referring to a number of things.\u201d Further, when the defendant cross-examined the police officer, the officer again testified to the defendant\u2019s denial of culpability for any of the incidents charged. Given the ambiguous nature of the statement in light of the context in which it was given, the statement was not so prejudicial as to constitute an irreparable injustice that could not be cured by jury instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 599 A.2d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial court violated his right of confrontation guaranteed by both the State and Federal Constitutions. He contends that by limiting his cross-examination of the victim, the trial court \u201cprevented defense counsel from inquiring of the complainant what [the defendant] had seen her doing with other boys, and how the disclosure of those activities to her mother would upset her,\u201d and thus prevented him from demonstrating her motive to fabricate charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">At an <em>in camera </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence regarding alleged prior sexual activity of the victim, the defendant made an offer of proof that he had seen the victim engaging in sexual relations with other men on five separate occasions, and that on one occasion the victim threatened the defendant that if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>told her mother of her sexual activity, she would \u201cget back at him.\u201d The trial court ruled that the defendant would be allowed to elicit testimony regarding the victim\u2019s prior sexual activity only in so far as it related to her motive to fabricate the charges against the defendant. In a chambers conference before this evidence was to be elicited, the trial court again made clear to the defendant that the inquiry would be restricted to evidence relevant to whether the defendant witnessed the prior sexual activity of the victim, and whether this gave the victim a motive to fabricate. The State and the minor victim\u2019s guardian ad litem at this time requested that the scope of the victim\u2019s cross-examination be carefully limited to protect her from any unnecessary prejudice. The trial court asked the State how it would like the relevant question worded. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201cThe Court: Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s phrase the question. How do you want it phrased? Let\u2019s write it down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Ms. Bolander [for the State]: Your Honor, what the State has come up with is the question: Has the defendant ever confronted you by saying he saw you having sex and was going to tell your mother. That goes right to the heart of the motive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">Mr. Lahey [for the defendant]: Judge, I\u2019ve made my argument, I\u2019ve indicated what I want to do, and I\u2019m not going to ask questions that have been drafted by the prosecutor in this case. I think I\u2019ve made the record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">The Court: What\u2019s the question you\u2019re going to ask?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">Mr. Lahey: I\u2019m not going to ask her anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">The Court: Okay. Well, I can tell you that you have the right to call her \u2014 recall her \u2014 for purposes of asking the question which has just been related by the prosecutor. But if you\u2019re going to get into the area of asking her whether she was having sex at any given place, I think that\u2019s a great problem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">New Hampshire\u2019s rape shield statute provides that \u201c[p]rior consensual sexual activity between the victim and any person other than the [defendant] shall not be admitted into evidence in any prosecution\u201d for sexual assault. RSA 632-A:6, II (Supp. 1993); <em>see also </em>N.H. R. Ev. 412. Despite the absolute terms of this statutory prohibition, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">\u201crequirement of due process and the right of confrontation limit the application of the rape shield law when evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the victim\u2019s prior sexual activity with people other than the defendant has a probative value in the context of [a] particular case [that] outweighs its prejudicial effect on the [victim].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>State v. Goulet, </em>129 N.H. 348, 351, 529 A.2d 879, 881 (1987) (quotation omitted). In cases where such evidence is relevant, it is admissible only where the trial court determines that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim, which determination we will not reverse absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Shute, </em>122 N.H. 498, 503, 446 A.2d 1162, 1165 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Here the trial court was well within its discretion in ruling that the defendant\u2019s proposed cross-examination of the victim be limited to only that evidence relevant to the alleged motive to fabricate charges, but that he could not inquire as to any particular sexual acts. This ruling protected the defendant\u2019s right to elicit proofs favorable to him by allowing evidence of the victim\u2019s potential motive to fabricate the charges, <em>see Olden v. Kentucky, </em>488 U.S. 227, 231 (1988), while properly protecting the minor victim from unnecessary harassment or embarrassment as the rape shield law requires. <em>Cf. State v. Howard, </em>121 N.H. 53, 62, 426 A.2d 457, 462 (1981) (admission of evidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct should be limited to the extent possible without unduly infringing upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights). Moreover, the defendant was able to bring forth evidence regarding the victim\u2019s supposed motive to fabricate the charges through the police officer, who testified that the defendant said he had seen the victim engaged in sex with another man on at least one occasion and that she \u201cthreatened him not to say anything or she would get him.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney spent much of his closing statement reminding the jury of this supposed motivation. Given these facts, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s limitation of the defendant\u2019s ability to question the victim regarding prior consensual sexual activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court limited him to only one question drafted by the prosecutor is not supported by the colloquy quoted above. After the State suggested a question for inquiry, the court asked the defendant for his proposed wording of an appropriate question. He refused to propound one, and stated before any comment by the court that he would not further question the witness. The court made no ruling that only a single question might be asked, but rather only reminded the defendant of his right to recall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the victim for proper inquiry, but not for the purpose of inquiring into specific sexual acts alleged to have taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b522-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
