The plaintiff claimed the tobacco or its value. The defendant alleged that he had purchased the tobacco from the consignees. A jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and there was judgment accordingly. The case turned upon the question of fact, whether there had been a purchase <em>tona fide. In regard to </em>the only question of law involved, the court, <em>per </em>Siibelu, J., say : On the-question of law the doctrine is well settled that a factor cannot pledge for hi\u00bb own debts, property consigned to him, nor can he give it in payment for his own. debts. The judgment below was affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b90-12\"><em>C. M.
