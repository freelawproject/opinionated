Since we doubt that he will ever return, we think not. We therefore reduce Edmond James Ramos\u2019s conviction of first degree burglary to second degree burglary and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">On November 23, 1994, Virgil Wagner died at home from natural causes. His daughter-in-law, Marilyn Ball, was notified of his death, and when she went to Wagner\u2019s house two days later, she found that a microwave and a VCR were missing. Although Ball locked the house when she left, there were at least two more unauthorized entries into the house and other items were taken. When the police investigated, they found Ramos\u2019s fingerprints inside Wagner\u2019s house. When he was arrested, Ramos told the police that he went to Wagner\u2019s house on November 23, knocked on the front door and, when no one answered, walked around to the back of the house. Since it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>appeared that no one was home, Ramos decided to go in and take something he could sell to obtain money to buy drugs. Ramos broke a window, entered the house, walked by Wagner\u2019s bedroom, looked in and saw a body on the bed. The body did not move, so Wagner entered the bedroom to get a closer look. When he saw Wagner\u2019s stiff body and his face \u201cturned to the left with the eyes open,\u201d Ramos ran out the door, grabbing the VCR on his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Ramos was charged with five counts of first degree burglary. At trial, the People presented evidence of the November 23 entry plus others occurring before and after Wagner\u2019s death. During argument, the prosecutor conceded the later entries were second degree burglaries but argued that the November 23 entry was a first degree burglary because the house was \u201coccupied\u201d until Wagner\u2019s remains were removed. The jury convicted Ramos of three counts, finding the November 23 entry was a first degree burglary and two other entries (after Wagner\u2019s death) were second degree burglaries. Ramos appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Ramos contends the evidence is insufficient to support his first degree burglary conviction because it shows that Wagner was dead at the time Ramos entered his house on November 23. We agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">To prove first degree burglary of an inhabited dwelling, the People must present evidence that the house is \u201ccurrently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> What this means is that a dwelling is inhabited if the occupant is absent but intends to return and to use the house as a dwelling. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 438, 442 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 739]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cardona </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 481, 483 [191 Cal.Rptr. 109]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 543, 546, 548 [245 Cal.Rptr. 85].) To put it plainly, a dead body is not using a house for a \u201cdwelling\u201d and there is no way to say that a dead man is going to return or that he has an \u201cintent\u201d of any kind. It follows that, at the time of Ramos\u2019s entry on November 23, the house was not occupied within the meaning of section 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>We reject as metaphysical sophistry the Attorney General\u2019s suggestion that the house was inhabited because Wagner \u201cwent to sleep, fully intending to remain in his house.\u201d By the time Ramos got there, Wagner was dead and, to the best of our knowledge, unable to entertain any intent of any kind. The house was no longer occupied. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hider </em>(1984) 135 Mich.App. 147, 152 [351 N.W.2d 905, 907] [\u201ca house left unoccupied by its occupant\u2019s death is not an \u2018occupied\u2019 dwelling\u201d]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1989) 93 N.C.App. 682, 686 [379 S.E.2d 251, 253] [the inhabitant\u2019s death renders a dwelling uninhabited \u201csince someone must \u2018live\u2019 in a dwelling for it to be \u2018inhabited\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Keel </em>v. <em>State </em>(1975) 165 Ind.App. 579 [333 N.E.2d 328]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1966) 188 So.2d 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">It follows that Ramos\u2019s first degree burglary conviction must be reduced to second degree burglary.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The judgment is modified by reducing Ramos\u2019s conviction of first degree burglary to second degree burglary and, as modified, is affirmed and remanded to the trial court for resentencing, with directions to not impose the two 5-year enhancements pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a), to reconsider Ramos\u2019s presentence conduct credits, to exercise the discretion granted by <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero) </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628] and, after resentencing, to issue a corrected abstract of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Ortega, Acting P. J., and Masterson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 23, 1997. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We reject as specious the People\u2019s argument that \u201cit is conceivable that Wagner may have passed away after [Ramos] broke into the house but before [Ramos] went into Wagner\u2019s bedroom.\u201d The only evidence about Wagner\u2019s condition was the description given by Ramos to the police\u2014that Wagner\u2019s body was \u201cstiff\u2019 when Ramos saw him. If the People wanted to contest this point, they could have presented expert testimony to establish the time of death. On this record, however, the <em>only </em>evidence is that Wagner was already dead when Ramos entered the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\">A11 section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 300.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
