Because the trial court refused to apply this statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>tolling rule to 17 counts of a criminal information charging violations of Corporations Code section 25110 (proscribing the offer or sale of unqualified securities), the People have sought relief in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">The People seek a writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its order dismissing certain counts of an information filed against defendants Jeffrey Alan Fine, Steven Bradley Fine and Stanley Isaac Glickman. On October 7, 1996, we issued an order to show cause as to why the relief requested by the People should not be granted, and we stayed all proceedings in the trial court pending our further order. On October 16, 1996, we granted the People\u2019s motion to consolidate the writ proceeding with a related appeal. The issue is one of first impression: whether offenses charged under sections 25110 and 25540 of the Corporations Code come within the statute of limitations tolling provision set forth in Penal Code section 803, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">For the reasons stated below, we conclude that they do. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s order and issue a writ of mandamus directing reinstatement of the dismissed charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">A 69-count information was filed on March 13, 1995, charging defendants with multiple felony offenses arising out of certain business activities generally involving the brokering of loans to lenders where lenders received interests in promissory notes secured by deeds of trust on California real property. The information was based on a preliminary hearing which was held on November 7, 1994, and January 4, 1995. A felony complaint had been filed on February 2, 1994.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">The alleged offenses include: offering to sell and issue, and selling and issuing, unqualified securities (Corp. Code, \u00a725110);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> offering to sell and selling securities by means of communications containing false material statements or omissions (Corp. Code, \u00a725401); grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7487); and money laundering (Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.10). Each count of the information contained the following allegation: \u201cIt is further alleged that this offense was not discovered, nor was it reasonably discoverable within the meaning of Penal Code Section 803(c) until on or about March 1, 1991. On February 14, 1991, the defendants\u2019 companies were put into bankruptcy. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>examiner was appointed and subsequently obtained the books and records of defendants\u2019 companies. The examination began on or about March 1, 1991. It was on this date (March 1, 1991) or after, that the victims first became aware that their investments were lost due to defendants\u2019 misrepresentations, omissions and theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">On February 27, 1995, the municipal court entertained defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the charges on various grounds, including a claim that the tolling provision of Penal Code section 803, subdivision (c), was inapplicable because the California Department of Real Estate \u201cwas auditing this company from 1983 on and was well aware of the financial condition of the company and most of the activities of this company and didn\u2019t allow them to have a permit that they requested.\u201d The court rejected this argument, holding sufficient evidence had been presented at the preliminary hearing to defeat a statute of limitations claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">On April 11, 1996, a motion was filed in superior court under Penal Code section 995 to set aside the information on statute of limitations grounds, among others. The trial court granted this motion on July 18,1996, as to the 17 counts in the information based on violations of Corporations Code section 25110. It concluded that the tolling provisions of Penal Code section 803, subdivision (c), do not apply to section 25110 violations because that offense (the offer or sale of unqualified securities) does not have as a \u201cmaterial element\u201d either fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court denied the section 995 motion as to the other 52 counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">By their appeal and the instant petition, the People seek to reverse and vacate the superior court\u2019s dismissal of the 17 information counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">\u201c[A]n information will not be set aside if there is some rational ground for assuming the <em>possibility </em>that an offense has been committed and the accused is guilty of it. <em>(Rideout </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 471, 474 [62 Cal.Rptr. 581, 432 P.2d 197].). . . Neither the trial court in a Penal Code section 995 proceeding [citations] nor a reviewing court on appeal therefrom may substitute its judgment as to the weight of evidence for that of the committing magistrate [citations]. . . . Every legitimate inference that may be drawn from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>information [citations].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Park </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 550, 560-561 [151 CaLRptr. 146].) \u201c[I]n order to hold a defendant over for trial the People bear the burden of producing evidence (either before the grand jury or at the preliminary hearing) which demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the prosecution is not barred by the statute of limitations. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zamora </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 538, 565, fn. 26 [134 Cal.Rptr. 784,557 P.2d 75].) \u201cBecause the bar of limitations upon a criminal prosecution is a jurisdictional defect, the evidentiary foundation for the indictment or information must include some evidence that the prosecution is not barred by limitations. [Citations] Lack of that evidence may be asserted, as here, by a motion to set aside the indictment or information; at that point, the court confronts the general rule permitting it to quash only if there is no evidence from which the essential elements of proof can be inferred. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Swinney </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 332, 336 [120 Cal.Rptr. 148], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Zamora, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 538, 564-565, fn. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Penal Code section 801 requires that prosecution of a violation of Corporations Code section 25110 must be commenced within three years after commission of the offense. There is no tolling or extension of the time limitation except as provided in Penal Code section 803. Subdivision (c) of that section provides that the limitation period does not commence to run until <em>discovery </em>of an offense <em>\u201ca material element of which is fraud or breach of a fiduciary </em>obligation.\u201d The question here is whether that tolling provision contained in Penal Code section 803,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is applicable to a violation of Corporations Code section 25110.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">At the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the trial court noted the recent decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Corey </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 717, 729 [41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 540], holding that Corporations Code section 25110 does not include a scienter element and is, therefore, a strict liability offense. Starting from that premise, the trial court pointed out an inherent tension between two parts of the tolling statute; although subdivision (c) of Penal Code section 803 initially states \u201c[t]his subdivision applies to\u201d felony offenses \u201ca material element of which is fraud or breach of a fiduciary obligation,\u201d it goes on to add the following language: <em>\u201cincluding, but not limited to, </em>the following offenses: [&lt;][]. . . [^Q (3) A violation of Section 25540, <em>of any type, </em>or Section 25541 of the Corporations Code.\u201d (Italics added.) Corporations Code section 25540 sets forth the punishment for violating provisions of the Corporate Securities Law of 1968. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 25000, et seq.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While acknowledging that the offenses charged here were grounded in allegations of fraud,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trial court believed that\u2014while subdivision (c) \u201cin terms of its statement of intent specifically includes [section] 25110\u201d\u2014in terms of \u201cthe provisions of its language,\u201d subdivision (c) excluded section 25110. As the trial court stated, \u201cAnd the problem that I have, is that if I were to say . . . the legislative intent is to protect the public against fraud, well that\u2019s [section] 25110, certainly. [Section] 803(c) is intended to delay or toll the statute of limitations until such time as the defrauded victim actually has an opportunity to find out that there is something wrong. On the other hand, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>statute in its language, not its stated purpose, but in its language clearly applies to elements\u2014only to those offenses where fraud or breach . . . of a fiduciary obligation is a material element of the crime.\u201d Thus, \u201cthere is a clear conflict in the statute. . . . And is not the court required in construing a conflicting statute to extend the benefit to the defendant?\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">After hearing further argument, the trial court ruled: \u201c[Section] 803(c) does not apply to violations of section 25110.1 would hope that you would seek a writ on that. HQ But the basic problem that I have is that there is ultimately a [sic] irreconcilable conflict in the language of the statute.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">We do not find an irreconcilable conflict in the statutory language. What the tolling statute provides for most clearly in this Case is that the sale or offer for sale of unqualified securities in violation of Corporations Code section 25110 is, by virtue of its coming within the ambit of section 25540, one of the criminal offenses to which Penal Code section 803, subdivision (c) is applicable. This undoubtedly is the effect of the phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to, the following offenses\u201d in subdivision (c). Although in the case of a strict liability offense such as section 25110, there may be a latent conflict between this clear directive and the phrase \u201c[t]his subdivision applies to an offense ... a material element of which is fraud,\u201d the statute cannot reasonably be read to exclude section 25110 offenses from its coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">While a violation of that section can be proven without evidence of a specific intent or motive to defraud, it nonetheless involves a deception upon the buyer by the unqualified securities seller. Such a seller is unlawfully obtaining funds from an investor who is entitled to assume that the sale of the securities is legally sanctioned. Moreover, the fundamental purpose of Corporations Code section 25110\u2019s qualification requirement is to ensure that a securities seller has made a full, complete and accurate disclosure of all information relevant and material to the buyer\u2019s decision to purchase. The unqualified seller\u2019s avoidance of that disclosure process necessarily makes fraud possible. In this case, the evidence presented to the magistrate established that the victims were innocent purchasers who would not have purchased had they known the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">In any event, once we look to the statute\u2019s legislative history it becomes clear that the tolling provision applies to Corporations Code section 25110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>offenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When the criminal statute of limitations scheme was recodified in 1984, the new legislation included language in subdivision (c)(1) extending the tolling provision to: \u201cGrand theft <em>of any type, </em>forgery, falsification of public records, or acceptance of a bribe by a public official or a public employee.\u201d (Italics added.) The Law Revision Commission Comment to the 1984 amendment stated: \u201cAlthough subdivision (c) generally governs crimes involving fraud or breach of fiduciary duty, all types of grand theft are included within subdivision (c) in order to avoid the need to characterize the material elements of the particular crime in every case.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 50 West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code, \u00a7 803 (1997 pocket supp.) p. 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">The following year, amending language was adopted that, in part, was meant to clarify precisely the particular aspect of the tolling provision being contested in this case. A report on this bill by the Senate Committee on Judiciary stated: \u201cSection 803(c) provides that violations of Sections 25540 and 25541 of the Corporations Code run from the date of discovery. However, the introductory language of subdivision (c) relating to crimes which contain fraud as a material element could be read to limit the date of discovery to only those security violations which necessarily involve fraud. [U The drafters of the revised statute agree that no such limitation was ever contemplated or intended. [\u2018\u00a1D This bill would provide that a violation of Corporations Code Section 25540 <em>\u2018of any </em>type\u2019 would run from the date of discovery. Similar language is presently used to make clear that all grand thefts run from the date of discovery whether or not fraud is involved.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 804 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 22, 1985, p. 7, italics added.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Given this clear manifestation of legislative intent, we have no trouble concluding that subdivision (c) of Penal Code section 803 extends the statute of limitations tolling provision to \u201cany type\u201d of violation of the Corporate Securities Law made punishable under Corporations Code section 25540. That expressly includes section 25110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Defendants also appear to be arguing that, even if subdivision (c) tolling does apply, there was insufficient evidence presented at the preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>hearing to sustain the Corporations Code section 25110 counts on a tolling theory. We note the municipal court has already rejected defendants\u2019 claim that the statute of limitations began to run sometime in the mid-1980\u2019s because the Department of Real Estate became aware of their illegal conduct at that time. Substantial evidence in the record supports that finding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cOnce the court determines that the facts stated in the pleadings are sufficient and do not show, as a matter of law, that in the exercise of reasonable diligence the plaintiff could have discovered the fraud at an earlier time then the reasonable diligence question becomes an issue for the trier of fact. [Citations].\u201d (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Zamora, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 562.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The trial court\u2019s order dismissing 17 counts of the information alleging violations of Corporations Code section 25110 is reversed. The order to show cause is discharged. A writ of mandamus shall issue directing the trial court to issue a new and different order denying the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the information pursuant to Penal Code section 995. The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Klein, P. J., and Kitching, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 20, 1997, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
