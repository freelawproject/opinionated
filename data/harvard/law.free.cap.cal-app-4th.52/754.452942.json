Defendant\u2019s lot is benefited by a deeded nonexclusive easement over plaintiffs\u2019 property for access purposes. Plaintiffs are required to keep the easement \u201cclear\u201d in order to ensure \u201cproper access\u201d for defendant. After years of dispute about the easement, plaintiffs obtained a judgment extinguishing defendant\u2019s easement, enjoining defendant from interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of their property and awarding plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages based on causes of action for nuisance, violation of conditions, covenants and restrictions (hereafter CC&amp;R\u2019s) applicable to defendant\u2019s property and interference with contract or prospective economic advantage. Defendant\u2019s appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support (1) the extinguishment of his easement, (2) the court\u2019s finding that he was liable to plaintiffs for interference with contract or prospective economic advantage, (3) nuisance liability, (4) damages for violation of the CC&amp;R\u2019s and (5) damages for emotional distress. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Defendant also claims that the punitive damages award was improper because plaintiffs failed to adduce evidence of his financial condition. Finally, defendant claims that the judgment must be reversed because the trial court conducted a \u201cview\u201d of the property while court was not in session without notifying the parties. We conclude that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s extinguishment of defendant\u2019s easement. Accordingly, we modify the judgment by striking the order extinguishing defendant\u2019s easement and affirm the modified judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In 1977, defendant paid $21,000 for a one-acre lot adjacent to the property now owned by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs\u2019 property already had a home on it at that time. The only use that defendant has ever made of his vacant lot has been as a place to store old trucks, a boat and other debris including roofing tile, beams, concrete blocks and fragments, a cement mixer, saw horses and lumber. Defendant\u2019s neighbors and the health department asked him to remove this debris, but he did not respond to these requests. Defendant kept a nonfunctional pickup truck on his lot for a decade even though he was cited in both 1987 and 1989 by the Monterey County Department of Health for storing this vehicle on his property and directed to remove this \u201chealth and safety\u201d hazard immediately. In 1989, defendant was cited by the California Department of Forestry for maintaining a fire hazard on his lot. Defendant has also been cited for illegally grading his lot without a permit. Less than a month before trial, defendant removed the nonfunctional pickup truck from his lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Defendant\u2019s grant deed states that he has a \u201cnon-exclusive easement for driveway purposes\u201d over a strip of land 25 feet wide and 80 feet long across the front of plaintiffs\u2019 property. Defendant\u2019s lot is not landlocked. It fronts on a public street. The front porch of plaintiffs\u2019 home encroaches a few feet into defendant\u2019s easement. Defendant became aware of this encroachment in the 1970\u2019s. In 1980, a variance was granted to previous owners of plaintiffs\u2019 property which permitted the house to violate the setback requirement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the condition that \u201cthe right-of-way be kept clear to provide proper access\u201d to defendant\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Plaintiffs purchased their property in June 1987. In August 1987, defendant first encountered plaintiffs when he found vehicles parked in the easement blocking his access to his lot on the day of plaintiffs\u2019 wedding. He knocked on plaintiffs\u2019 door, complained about the cars parked in front of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 house and told plaintiff Judith Reichardt (hereafter Judith) that \u201cthey weren\u2019t supposed to park\u201d in the easement. Judith had just gotten out of the shower and was wet and in her robe. She explained that this was their wedding day, and they were going to have a number of guests. She asked defendant if he was going to require access to his property again that day. Defendant told her \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether I will be back later today or not. No cars are ever to be parked there.\u201d Defendant insisted upon talking to \u201cthe groom,\u201d but he was not permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Through the years, defendant has consistently insisted that no cars are allowed to park anywhere in the easement area. He claims that there is not adequate room for a vehicle to pass if another vehicle is parked in the easement. However, he concedes that the easement area is at least 20 feet wide. Everyone other than defendant has concluded that there is plenty of room for two cars to pass one another in the easement area. A few days after the August 1987 encounter, while plaintiffs were away on their honeymoon, defendant returned and removed much of the vegetation and part of a tree that were growing on plaintiffs\u2019 property along the edge of the easement. He did not contact plaintiffs before doing so. Plaintiffs\u2019 friend, who was house-sitting for them while they were away, saw defendant doing this and asked defendant to stop, but defendant refused. Defendant\u2019s mutilation of this vegetation left a \u201cmud wall\u201d bare of vegetation in front of plaintiffs\u2019 house. The tree later died, and the vegetation never grew back.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In late 1987, plaintiff William Reichardt (hereafter William) first met defendant. Defendant told William that \u201cthis was his easement and we were to treat that easement area, the paved area, as if it were a street with no parking signs on it. . . .\u201d William asked defendant if it would be advantageous for defendant to have direct access to his property from the street. Defendant asked whether William had $50,000 \u201cto contribute to the possibility of putting in a new driveway.\u201d William replied that he did not. Around Christmas of 1987, defendant pounded on plaintiffs\u2019 front door very early on a Saturday morning and demanded that a car parked on the easement be moved. William moved the car so that defendant could get by, but he did not move the car off the easement. Defendant became irate and demanded that the car be removed entirely from the easement area. William did so, but defendant insisted that the car was still on the easement and became even more angry. He said \u201cyou just can\u2019t park in front [of your house] at all. This is my easement, you are never to park on it.\u201d William removed his car from the front of his house. William had a similar encounter with defendant in March 1988. These incidents were \u201congoing\" through early 1991 although William could not remember the dates of any other specific incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Plaintiffs had not been apprised of the existence of defendant\u2019s easement when they purchased their property. After learning of its existence, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>made a claim against their title insurer, the seller and the seller\u2019s real estate agent. This claim was settled in 1990. In 1991, plaintiffs tried to contact defendant in an attempt to convince him to sell them his easement. In May 1991, defendant told them that he had received their communications and \u201che was sure we could work something out.\u201d A month later, defendant told them that he \u201cwas still thinking about it\u201d but \u201chad been too busy to get to it.\u201d In the fall of 1991, Judith met with defendant and showed him plans that plaintiffs had had prepared for an alternative driveway access for defendant\u2019s property. Defendant orally agreed to accept a sum of money to cover the cost of an alternative driveway in exchange for giving up his easement. Based on this apparent agreement, Judith expended $1,750 for plans for the alternate driveway. However, defendant never agreed to a specific sum nor did he ever sign a written agreement to exchange his easement for a sum of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Plaintiffs moved to Oregon in January 1992 and rented out their property. In February 1992, Judith traveled to Monterey for the sole purpose of finalizing her agreement with defendant regarding the easement. The alternative driveway was estimated to cost about $23,000 so Judith borrowed $30,000 and placed this sum in escrow for defendant. After defendant failed to close the escrow, Judith contacted him and asked why he had not completed the transaction. Defendant said \u201cwhat\u2019s it worth to you.\u201d The transaction was never completed, and this was the last contact Judith had with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Defendant subsequently had heated encounters with plaintiffs\u2019 tenants in which he demanded that they move vehicles parked in the easement area. He also took a photograph of one of these tenants as he went to move his vehicle in his bathrobe. Defendant even called the police about one of plaintiffs\u2019 tenants on one occasion. When plaintiffs listed their property for sale, defendant attended several open houses held at plaintiffs\u2019 property. Defendant parked his truck with a garbage can in the back of it along the property line between his lot and plaintiffs\u2019 property. He took a camera with him, handed out fliers, posted a sign and wrote down the license numbers of the vehicles parked outside plaintiffs\u2019 home during these open houses. The sign and fliers said \u201ctake notice that there exists a recorded driveway easement . . . [which] might be subject to vehicular traffic at any time day or night seven days a week, 24 hours a day.\u201d Defendant also spoke with potential purchasers and potential renters attending these open houses. Plaintiffs\u2019 real estate agent observed this conduct and concluded that defendant was \u201cintimidating potential tenants or buyers.\u201d The agent herself felt intimidated by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Eventually, in October 1993, plaintiffs received an offer to purchase their property from Mark Porter. At this point, plaintiffs were in serious financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>difficulty and needed to sell their property to alleviate this financial crisis. \u201cOur whole lives were occupied with trying to sell that house.\u201d Porter\u2019s offer was contingent on Porter meeting with defendant to discuss the possibility of removing the easement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Porter contacted defendant to discuss the easement. He hoped that he would be able to \u201cestablish a comfort level\u201d with defendant by either putting in an alternative driveway for defendant or \u201csomehow working things out with the two owners . . . .\u201d They arranged a meeting. Defendant was aware at this time that plaintiffs were experiencing serious financial difficulties and were desperate to sell their property and that Porter had offered to buy the property. Defendant met with Porter at the property. When defendant arrived at the property, defendant immediately became upset when he discovered that one of plaintiffs\u2019 tenants\u2019 guests had parked his car in the easement area. Defendant parked his truck so that the guest could not drive his vehicle away while defendant met with Porter. Porter observed this encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Porter then spoke with defendant. Defendant told Porter that his easement \u201cwas the entire front yard\" of plaintiffs\u2019 property. He said that plaintiffs\u2019 front porch was \u201cthe first thing that\u2019s going to be tom off there the minute you buy the place.\u201d Porter told defendant that he hoped that they \u201ccould sit down and somehow work out a situation where we can be comfortable living next to you and sharing this easement or possibly just putting [in] a new driveway.\u201d Porter mentioned that he had children and a dog and he hoped to possibly put a dog mn in front of the house. Defendant said, \u201cthere will be nothing in the easement. If there is anything in the easement I will mn it over.\u201d Porter asked if he meant children, and defendant said \u201canything.\u201d Defendant refused to even discuss an alternative driveway unless Porter had \u201ceighty to a hundred thousand dollars\u201d to contribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Defendant also told Porter that Porter was paying too much for plaintiffs\u2019 property and that plaintiffs\u2019 house had \u201cseveral structural problems.\u201d Defendant informed Porter that plaintiffs had received $100,000 in compensation in their action involving their lack of notice of the easement. Defendant said that \u201cit was his money, not their money, it was his money. And that\u2019s why he has been fighting them for all these years because he felt all along it was his money.\u201d Porter decided not to buy plaintiffs\u2019 property because defendant \u201cis a complete basket case\" and \u201cI can\u2019t even reason with him.\u201d \u201c[T]he biggest thing is the fact that he mentioned that he would run over our kids or anything that was in the driveway, dogs, kids, bikes, anything.\" \u201cI couldn\u2019t live next to a man like that. He was too off the wall. I really felt very threatened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>After Porter decided not to purchase the property, plaintiffs\u2019 real estate agent concluded that the property was unmarketable because defendant intimidated people and interfered with attempts to market the property. Plaintiffs received no other viable offers to purchase their property. Had Porter completed the purchase, plaintiffs would have realized a net gain of $88,000. The loss of this potential sale was a \u201cdevastating\u201d blow to plaintiffs because it left them with \u201cno money,\u201d and a negative cash flow which placed them \u201cup against the wall.\u201d William \u201ccollapsed in tears\u201d and \u201c[i]t was very difficult\u201d for him to deal with this situation. Judith\u2019s emotional condition was also detrimentally affected. \u201cIt kind of meant the end for us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Plaintiffs filed an action against defendant in November 1993 seeking to extinguish his easement, obtain declaratory and injunctive relief and obtain compensatory and punitive damages for interference with contract or prospective economic advantage, nuisance and violation of the CC&amp;R\u2019s. After a court trial, the court issued a judgment extinguishing defendant\u2019s easement, enjoining him from interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 property and from violating a number of the CC&amp;R\u2019s and awarding plaintiffs $150,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages. The trial court issued an extensive statement of decision in support of its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The court made the following findings. The court concluded that defendant had created a nuisance and violated the CC&amp;R\u2019s. His conduct prevented plaintiffs from having \u201cfree use\u201d of their property and interfered with their \u201ccomfortable enjoyment\u201d of their property. Defendant\u2019s easement was \u201csubject to\u201d the CC&amp;R\u2019s. The various citations that defendant had received as a result of his use of his lot violated the CC&amp;R\u2019s. Defendant\u2019s demands that the easement be kept \u201ccompletely clear\u201d for his \u201cexclusive use\u201d were reflective of his belief that the easement was his exclusive property and his conduct was consistent with this belief. However, the easement area was wide enough to allow defendant access to his property even with another vehicle parked in the easement area. The agreement that the easement would \u201cbe kept clear to provide proper access\u201d did not convert the easement from a nonexclusive one to an exclusive easement. The purpose of this agreement was simply to ensure that defendant had \u201cadequate passage\u201d to his property. Defendant\u2019s conduct in connection with the easement was \u201cincompatible with both the nature and exercise\u201d of the easement. By treating the easement as exclusive, defendant had \u201csurcharged] the non-exclusive nature of it\u201d and used the easement to \u201charass and intimidate\u201d plaintiffs and their guests. Defendant\u2019s conduct prevented plaintiffs from \u201cmaking any use\u201d of the easement. Defendant had \u201charassed and frightened\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 tenants and their real estate agent in connection with the easement, and his conduct had caused Porter to decide not to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Since reasonable access to defendant\u2019s property could be obtained from the public street adjoining the lot rather than by way of the easement, the court concluded that it was appropriate to extinguish defendant\u2019s easement. The court awarded $88,000 in damages for defendant\u2019s interference with plaintiffs\u2019 economic relationship with Porter, $22,000 for defendant\u2019s creation of a nuisance and violation of the CC&amp;R\u2019s and $40,000 for plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress arising from defendant\u2019s interference, his creation of a nuisance and his violation of the CC&amp;R\u2019s. In addition, the court awarded $50,000 in punitive damages based on defendant\u2019s conduct in connection with the Porter offer. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied, and he filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A. <em>New Issues Raised in Reply Brief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In his reply brief, defendant makes a number of new contentions which he acknowledges he did not raise in his opening brief. Taken as a whole, defendant\u2019s reply brief reads like an entirely new opening brief rather than as a response to plaintiffs\u2019 brief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties disagree as to exactly how many of the issues raised in the reply brief are \u201cnew,\u201d but even defendant concedes that at least five issues are \u201cnew.\u201d Plaintiffs claim that there are 16 new issues. The truth is somewhere in between.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Defendant\u2019s opening brief raised seven issues. His reply brief appears to raise approximately 20 issues. Defendant concedes that his assertion that \u201cthe entire judgment is infected by the lower court\u2019s consideration of constitutionally impermissible factors and must be reversed\u201d is an entirely new issue which was not raised in his opening brief. Since defendant\u2019s opening brief simply challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support (1) the extinguishment of defendant\u2019s easement, (2) liability for interference with contract or prospective economic advantage, (3) nuisance liability, (4) damages for violation of the CC&amp;R\u2019s and (5) emotional distress damages, defendant\u2019s other challenges to the court\u2019s liability findings and compensatory damage awards are \u201cnew\u201d issues raised for the first time in his reply brief. Defendant\u2019s reply brief challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support an award of punitive damages is also new because his only challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>to this award in his opening brief was on the ground that it was invalid because plaintiffs had failed to introduce evidence of his financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The many new issues raised by defendant in his reply brief are not merely elaboration of issues raised in his opening brief or rebuttals to plaintiffs\u2019 briefing. For instance, defendant\u2019s reply brief assertion that the court erred in awarding <em>both </em>an injunction and damages for violation of the CC&amp;Rs was never even suggested in his opening brief. Defendant\u2019s reply brief challenge to the excessiveness of the compensatory damages award is also new. In his opening brief, defendant challenged the <em>emotional distress award </em>as unsupported by the evidence, and he claimed that the CC&amp;R violations did not cause plaintiffs any damage, but he did not pose a challenge to the excessiveness of the compensatory damages award as a whole. Similarly, defendant\u2019s reply brief challenge to the propriety of a <em>separate award </em>for emotional distress is also new because his opening brief challenge was simply to the sufficiency of the evidence to support any damages for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We refuse to consider the new issues raised by defendant in his reply brief.  \u201cPoints raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.\u201d <em>(American Drug Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stroh </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 432].) \u201cObvious reasons of fairness militate against consideration of an issue raised initially in the reply brief of an appellant.\u201d <em>(Varjabedian </em>v. <em>City of Madera </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 285, 295, fn. 11 [142 Cal.Rptr. 429, 572 P.2d 43].) \u201c\u2018Obvious considerations of fairness in argument demand that the appellant present all of his points in the opening brief. To withhold a point until the closing brief would deprive the respondent of his opportunity to answer it or require the effort and delay of an additional brief by permission. Hence the rule is that points raised in the reply brief for the first time will not be considered, unless good reason is shown for failure to present them before.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 335, fn. 8 [265 Cal.Rptr. 788].)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The California Supreme Court long ago expressed its hostility to the practice of raising new issues in an appellate reply brief. \u201cSome additional points are made for the first time in their closing brief. We are not disposed to look with favor upon a point so made, unless good reason appears for the failure to make it in the opening brief. This practice is not fair to a respondent, and tends to delay the final disposition of appeals. This court has heretofore said, that while it is undoubtedly at liberty to decide a case upon any points that its proper disposition may seem to require, whether taken by counsel or not, an appellant should, under the rules, make the points on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>which he relies in his opening brief, and not reserve them for his reply, and that the court may properly consider them as waived unless so made. [Citations.] This should undoubtedly be the rule where no good reason appears for the omission to make the point in the opening brief, and it does not appear that the appellant would be unjustly affected by a refusal to consider it.\" <em>(Hibernia Sav. and Loan Soc. </em>v. <em>Farnham </em>(1908) 153 Cal. 578, 584 [96 P. 9].) \u201cWe do not mean to say that an appellant might not be allowed in exceptional cases to discuss new questions in his final brief. He might be allowed to do so upon an application showing meritorious reasons why the points were not made in the opening brief. Such application might be based upon sickness, inadvertence, or other excusable neglect. But in the case at bar no reason whatever is given for this departure from the ordinary method of presenting a case in this court. If the practice were allowed without any substantial reason, it would lead to great irregularity and delay. In such event the respondent, of course, could justly demand the right to file an additional brief, and the course of the argument by brief would be radically changed.\u201d <em>(Kahn </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1898) 120 Cal. 643, 644 [53 P. 24].)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Defendant filed his opening brief in October 1995. Plaintiffs filed their brief in March 1996. Defendant filed his reply brief on June 10, 1996. On June 21, 1996, plaintiffs filed a motion to strike defendant\u2019s reply brief or portions thereof. On June 27, 1996, defendant filed a reply to plaintiffs\u2019 motion in which he claimed that there was no impropriety in raising new issues in the reply brief since the appellate court \u201cmay and should\u201d address these issues. Defendant made no showing of good cause in his reply to plaintiffs\u2019 motion. Plaintiffs responded to this reply by arguing that defendant was \u201cabusing the appellate process\u201d and noting that \u201cit would be oppressive and burdensome\u201d for plaintiffs to have to respond to what amounted to essentially a new opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Defendant filed an eight-page response to plaintiff\u2019s response to his reply to their motion. In this response, defendant for the first time attempted to demonstrate good cause for his failure to raise the new issues earlier. He stated that he had retained a new attorney after the opening brief had already been prepared and filed. This new attorney substituted in on December 5, 1995. Because the new attorney was allegedly busy familiarizing himself with the trial record and doing legal research, he was not able to take any action in this case before the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 brief in March 1996. This statement constitutes defendant\u2019s entire justification for his failure to raise these new issues prior to June 1996. In their reply to this statement, plaintiffs pointed out that they had limited means and \u201cshould not be saddled with the onerous burden of having to file additional briefing simply because Appellant retained new counsel after filing the Opening Brief.\" Plaintiffs asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>that \u201cthey should not be required to continually increase the resources devoted to defending this appeal every time Appellant briefs this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">We agree with plaintiffs that fairness supports their challenge to defendant\u2019s assertion that he has the right to continue to raise new issues in a reply brief filed eight months after his opening brief, six months after he obtained new counsel and three months after plaintiffs filed their brief. Defendant has singularly failed to demonstrate good cause for his failure to brief these issues earlier. Defendant, as the appealing party, had the opportunity to frame the issues in this appeal at the time he filed his opening brief. If he was dissatisfied with his counsel at that time, he should have sought an extension of time so that he could obtain new counsel prior to the filing of the opening brief. In addition, we are skeptical of defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s claim that the three-and-a-half-month period between his substitution in as defendant\u2019s attorney and the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 brief did not permit him enough time to review the record and the opening brief and discover that new issues would need to be addressed. The record in this case is not voluminous and the opening brief was not particularly lengthy. Had defendant\u2019s new counsel sought permission to file a supplemental opening brief in December or January, he might have been able to demonstrate good cause therefor. The mere fact that an appellant chooses to obtain new counsel two months after filing his opening brief cannot justify his contention that it is proper to raise new issues in a reply brief filed six months later. We refuse to consider the issues raised by defendant in his reply brief which were not raised in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\u201c \u2018When a finding of fact is attacked on the ground that there is not any substantial evidence to sustain it, the power of an appellate court <em>begins </em>and <em>ends </em>with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will support the finding of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362], italics in original; accord, <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Don Miller &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 498, 503 [198 Cal.Rptr. 551, 674 P.2d 253, 44 A.L.R.4th 763].) \u201c \u2018[W]e have no power to judge of the effect or value of the evidence, to weigh the evidence, to consider the credibility of the witnesses, or to resolve conflicts in the evidence or in the reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Leff v. Gunter </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 508, 518 [189 Cal.Rptr. 377, 658 P.2d 740], quoting <em>Overton </em>v. <em>Vita-Food Corp. </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 367, 370 [210 P.2d 757].) Our role is limited to determining whether the evidence before the trier of fact supports its findings. <em>(Reddy </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 118, 123 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 55].)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>1. <em>Extinguishment of the Easement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s extinguishment of his easement. He claims that his conduct was not \u201cincompatible\u201d with the \u201cnature or exercise\u201d of his easement. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s extinguishment of defendant\u2019s easement cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\u201cThe land to which an easement is attached is called the dominant tenement; the land upon which a burden or servitude is laid is called the servient tenement.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 803.) In this case, defendant\u2019s land was the dominant tenement and plaintiffs\u2019 land was the servient tenement. \u201cThe extent of a servitude is determined by the terms of the grant. . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 806.) The extent of the servitude benefiting defendant\u2019s land was described in the grant deed by which defendant obtained title as a \u201cnonexclusive easement for driveway purposes.\u201d  When an easement is \u201cnon-exclusive,\u201d the common users must accommodate each other. <em>(Scruby </em>v. <em>Vintage Grapevine, Inc. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 697, 703 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 810].) \u201c[T]he owner of a dominant tenement must use his easement and rights in such a way as to impose as slight a burden as possible on the servient tenement.\u201d <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1950) 100 Cal.App.2d 224, 226 [223 P.2d 286].) The owner of the servient tenement may use the burdened land in any way which does not \u201cinterfere unreasonably\u201d with the easement. <em>(Camp Meeker Water System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 845, 867 [274 Cal.Rptr. 678, 799 P.2d 758].)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Extinguishment of an easement is an extreme and powerful remedy which is utilized only when use of the easement has been rendered essentially <em>impossible. </em>\u201cA servitude is extinguished . . . [b]y the performance of any act upon either tenement, by the owner of the servitude, or with his assent, which is incompatible with its nature or exercise.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7811.) The California Supreme Court construed this statute more than a century ago as authorizing extinguishment of an easement only where the easement owner performs or authorizes an act which <em>permanently prevents </em>use of the easement. \u201cThis seems to be a recognition and statutory declaration of the rule . . . that if the owner of a dominant estate do acts thereon which <em>permanently prevent </em>his enjoying an easement, the same is extinguished, or if he authorize the owner of the servient estate to do upon the same that which prevents the dominant estate from any longer enjoying the easement, the effect will be to extinguish it.\u201d <em>(Lux </em>v. <em>Haggin </em>(1886) 69 Cal. 255, 292-293 [10 P. 674], italics added.) \u201cThe courts have interpreted this incompatibility as necessitating a <em>permanent interference </em>or an act of a nature such that thereafter exercise of the easement cannot be made without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>severe </em>burden upon the servient tenement.\u201d <em>(Buechner </em>v. <em>Jonas </em>(1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 127, 132 [39 Cal.Rptr. 298], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">We have not located any case in which an easement was extinguished in the absence of evidence that the owner of the dominant tenement had performed or authorized an act which resulted in a <em>physical change </em>which prevented continued use of the easement without imposing a severe burden on the servient tenement. <em>(Buechner </em>v. <em>Jonas, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.2d 127 [planting and maintenance of hedge across easement did not merit extinguishment of easement]; <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>Walton </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 39, 45 [27 Cal.Rptr. 792] [building of rock wall with gate in it did not merit extinguishment of easement]; <em>Crimmins </em>v. <em>Gould </em>(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 383, 390 [308 P.2d 786] [easement owner\u2019s dedication of land for construction of public street leading to easement causing the easement to be used by the general public did justify extinguishment of the easement].) In order to justify extinguishment of an easement, \u201c[t]he acts of the owner of the dominant tenement. . . must be of a character so decisive and conclusive as to indicate a clear intent to abandon the easement.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Worn </em>(1892) 93 Cal. 206, 213 [28 P. 944].) The interference with use of the easement must be material and permanent rather than occasional and temporary in order to justify extinguishment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ocean Shore Railroad </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 406, 418 [196 P.2d 570, 6 A.L.R.2d 1179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The record does not contain any evidence of a physical change which created a <em>permanent </em>and material interference which was <em>incompatible </em>with use of the easement. The trial court found that defendant\u2019s <em>conduct </em>in connection with the easement was \u201cincompatible with both the nature and exercise\u201d of the easement because, by treating the easement as exclusive, defendant had \u201csurcharg[ed] the non-exclusive nature of it\u201d and used the easement to \u201charass and intimidate\u201d plaintiffs and their guests. The court concluded that defendant\u2019s conduct prevented <em>plaintiffs </em>from \u201cmaking any use\u201d of the easement area.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">However, the critical question in determining whether extinguishment of defendant\u2019s easement was justified was whether defendant had performed or authorized an act which permanently and materially interfered with <em>his </em>continued use of the easement. The absence of any physical change was indicative of an absence of justification for extinguishment. While defendant\u2019s outrageous <em>conduct </em>prevented <em>plaintiffs </em>from making reasonable use of the easement area, such conduct simply cannot justify extinguishment of the easement. Preventing plaintiffs from using the easement area did not prevent <em>defendant </em>from using the easement. If anything, defendant\u2019s threatening conduct probably facilitated defendant\u2019s use of his easement. While plaintiffs were legally entitled to make reasonable use of their land even though it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>was burdened by defendant\u2019s easement, and defendant\u2019s unjustified interference with plaintiff\u2019s use of their land was a legal nuisance, this conduct could not justify extinguishing defendant\u2019s easement under Civil Code section 811 because the easement could only be extinguished if defendant\u2019s conduct interfered with his own use of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">There was no evidence that defendant\u2019s actions in connection with the easement materially or permanently prevented defendant from using the easement \u201cwithout <em>severe </em>burden\u201d on plaintiffs. While defendant\u2019s insistence that he had the right to exclusive use of the easement area was unwarranted and incorrect, his assertions did not result in any physical change which permanently burdened defendant\u2019s use of the easement and prevented its continued use. Evidence that defendant had threatened to run over anything in the easement area including children and animals also did not support the court\u2019s extinguishment of the easement. This threat did not <em>permanently </em>prevent defendant from using the easement or establish that defendant\u2019s continued use of the easement would put a <em>permanent and severe burden </em>on the servient tenement. An injunction requiring defendant to accommodate the servient tenement\u2019s use of the easement area would have been the appropriate remedy to eliminate the basis for such threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In the absence of evidence that defendant performed or authorized some act which resulted in a physical change that permanently and materially prevented defendant from using the easement or made his use of the easement severely burdensome on the servient tenement, the trial court was not authorized under Civil Code section 811 to extinguish defendant\u2019s easement. As the record contains no evidence of such an act, the extinguishment of defendant\u2019s easement cannot be upheld and must be stricken from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">2.-5.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">C., D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The trial court\u2019s order extinguishing defendant\u2019s easement is hereby stricken, and the trial court is ordered to modify the judgment to so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>reflect.
