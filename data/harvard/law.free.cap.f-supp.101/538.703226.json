Its actual appearance in that litigation alone will demonstrate that it is the real party in interest. Cofax Corp. v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., D.C., 79 F.Supp. 842; Zenith Radio Corp. v. Dictograph Products Co., Inc., D.C., 66 F.Supp, 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">When and if Kahn appears and defends the \u201cTexas\u201d suit, it should request a stay of proceedings there by demonstrating to the Texas District Court that it is the real party in interest and that a suit involving the same parties and issues is pending here.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">Injunction denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
