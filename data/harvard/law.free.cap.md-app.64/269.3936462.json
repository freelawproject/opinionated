Appellant raises three issues in this appeal from those convictions:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>1. whether the trial court erred in refusing to strike or to instruct the jury to disregard testimony to the effect that appellant had been arrested several times in the past on \u201copen warrants\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">2. whether the trial court committed plain error material to appellant\u2019s rights when it instructed the jury that it could find appellant guilty of theft even if its members could not agree on which form of theft;</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">3. whether, during the sentencing phase, the court erroneously considered prior arrests that did not result in convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The record reveals that the Montgomery County residence of William and Marjorie Campbell was broken into and ransacked on the morning of February 2, 1984, and that clothing, jewelry, and silverware valued in excess of $7,000.00 were reported missing. Kathy Bues, the Campbell\u2019s next-door neighbor, testified that on the morning of the theft she observed a white male wearing a black cap and carrying a black garbage bag walk down the Campbell\u2019s driveway and get into a small, \u201cdrab\u201d colored, 1976 or 1977 automobile occupied by two other individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">At about 5:00 p.m. that day, Officer Bruce Lewis of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department responded to a call regarding a fight at 5266 Marlboro Pike. There, Officer Lewis saw appellant walking away from a parked car and toward an apartment building, and also saw Tyson, appellant's codefendant, \u201cwalking around in a circle in the parking lot and mumbling to himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Lewis, observing that a knife was protruding from Tyson\u2019s back pocket, stopped and frisked him. The knife proved to be a stainless steel butter knife. The frisk also produced a camera with a Montgomery College sticker on it. Tyson then removed from his pockets several items of jewelry, including a high school ring with the inscription \u201cWWC.\u201d A skullcap was also removed from Tyson\u2019s back pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>A radio check then revealed that the car in which appellant and Tyson allegedly had been seen was reported to have been stolen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tyson was arrested there in the parking lot; appellant was arrested inside his adjacent apartment. A search of the car, a 1983 Dodge Colt, uncovered jewelry and coins. A search of appellant incident to his arrest in his apartment also uncovered numerous pieces of jewelry. Some of the jewelry taken from appellant, from Tyson, and from the car, was identified by the Campbells as having been among the items stolen from their home, as was the knife and camera taken from Tyson. The skullcap removed from Tyson\u2019s back pocket was identified by Bues, the Campbell\u2019s next-door neighbor, as the type of cap worn by the person she had observed walking down the Campbell\u2019s driveway on the morning of the housebreaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On direct examination, Officer Lewis testified for the State that he had observed appellant, whom he \u201cknew from previous contacts,\u201d walking away from the car and toward the apartment building. On cross-examination by Tyson\u2019s counsel, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">Q. You testified that you had had some contact with Mr. Craddock before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">Q. One of the other individuals. Was that contact with him involved in his selling items on the street previously?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">A. <em>I remember several times participating in arrests with him with open warrants. I can\u2019t remember selling on the streets.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">MR. LAMBETH [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I object to any further questions along this line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>MR. LAMBETH: And ask that the question and his response be stricken, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">THE COURT: That motion will be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">MR. LAMBETH: And the jury asked to ignore that, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">THE COURT: That will be denied also. Place another question to the witness. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Appellant urges that the lower court erred in refusing to strike the above underscored answer and in refusing to instruct the jury to disregard it. We agree, finding that the admission of Officer Lewis\u2019 answer violated the rule that \u201cevidence which in any manner <em>shows or tends to show </em>that the accused committed another crime wholly independent of that for which he is on trial, even though it be a crime of the same type, is irrelevant and inadmissible.\u201d <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 669, 350 A.2d 680 (1976) (emphasis added). It is not argued that this testimony was admitted under any of the well-recognized exceptions to the general rule excluding \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Thus, we must reverse \u201cunless the State can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674, 350 A.2d 680. The Court in <em>Ross </em>explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">\u201c[t]he essence of this test is the determination whether the cumulative effect of the properly admitted evidence so outweighs the prejudicial nature of the evidence erroneously admitted that there is no reasonable possibility that the decision of the finder of fact would have been different had the tainted evidence been excluded.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arc\">Applying this standard, the Court reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction for possessing heroin with intent to distribute. In that case, the two chief prosecution witnesses were a police detective who confiscated the drugs after observing the defendant deliver them, and the paid police informant who actually made the controlled buy and who testified that he and the defendant used to \u201cwork together selling narcotics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The Court of Appeals determined that the cumulative effect of the police detective\u2019s eyewitness testimony, together with the physical evidence and properly admitted portions of the informant\u2019s testimony, did not render the informant\u2019s improper allegations of prior criminal activity harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court concluded that, despite the strong nature of the properly admitted evidence of guilt, there remained \u201cat least a reasonable possibility that the improper testimony of prior criminal conduct contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674, 350 A.2d 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In the instant case, we find that the properly admitted evidence of guilt was at least as strong as that introduced in <em>Ross, </em>because appellant\u2019s possession of stolen property within seven hours of the theft was <em>undisputed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We also find the potential prejudice of the erroneously admitted evidence to be less in the instant case than it was in <em>Ross. </em>In <em>Ross, </em>the defendant complained of an in-court allegation that he had a history of committing specific and serious crimes, <em>i.e., </em>selling narcotics. In the instant case, by contrast, the appellant suffered from a somewhat vague reference to his having been arrested in the past on unspecified charges. We note that the State did not elicit this testimony and that it never referred to it at any point during the trial or closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">We hold that, although the trial court should have struck the inadmissible testimony and instructed the jury to disregard it, reversal is unwarranted because, on the facts of this case, there is no reasonable possibility that these errors affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Next, appellant urges that the trial judge committed \u201cplain error\u201d when he instructed the jury that it could find appellant guilty of theft even if its members could not agree as to what form of theft had been proven. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\"... For purposes of this case, you are instructed that the offense of theft occurs when a person either willfully or knowingly obtains control of or exerts control over the property of the owner without the owner\u2019s authorization, or possesses stolen property knowing or believing it probably has been stolen and the person has at least one of the following different types of intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">First, he has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property. Or, he willfully or knowingly uses, conceals or abandons the property in a manner which deprives the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">Third, he uses, conceals or abandons the property, knowing that his actions probably will deprive the owner of his property. These methods of theft may be proven in the alternative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">The State need not prove that the defendant acted in both of these fashions to commit theft. It need only prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all the elements of one or the other one, have been proven. Nor need all the members of the jury agree on which of these methods of theft were committed by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">All that is required is that all members of the jury are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, that all elements of one or the other form of theft have been proven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad5\">Appellant was charged in the second count of the indictment with unlawfully stealing personal property, including sterling silver and jewelry, belonging to William Walter Campbell, having the value of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) or greater, pursuant to one scheme and continuing course of conduct. In short, appellant was accused of violating Article 27, Sec. 342 of the Maryland Code; the theft statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">A brief review of the theft statute and its purpose is essential in deciding whether the trial court\u2019s instruction permitting a conviction without a unanimous verdict as to any particular form of the crime constitutes error. <em>See State v. McKay, </em>280 Md. 558, 375 A.2d 228 (1977). Effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>tive July 1, 1979, the Legislature combined a number of separate offenses, each involving some type of deprivation of one\u2019s property, into one statute. Currently, the offenses of larceny, embezzlement, false pretenses and receiving stolen property are combined into one theft statute. The purpose of the theft statute is to avoid the subtle distinctions that existed and had to be alleged and proved to establish the separate crimes under the former law.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Article 27, Sec. 341 of the present statute makes clear that theft constitutes a single crime embracing the former separate crimes of larceny, larceny by trick, larceny after trust, embezzlement, false pretenses, shoplifting and receiving stolen property. The statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201c... An accusation of theft may be proved by evidence that it was committed in any manner that would be theft under this subheading, notwithstanding the specification of a different manner in the information ..., subject only to the power of the Court to ensure a fair trial by granting a continuance or other appropriate relief if the conduct of the defense would be prejudiced by lack of fair notice or surprise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Article 27, Sec. 342 sets forth five different factual situations which, if proved, constitute the crime of theft. The categories are:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">(a) Obtaining or exerting unauthorized control over property of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">(b) Obtaining control over property of the owner by deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">(c) Possessing stolen personal property knowing that it has been stolen, or knowing that it probably has been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">(d) Obtaining control over the property of another knowing that it is lost or mislaid property.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">(e) Obtaining the services of another by deception, or knowing that the services are provided without the consent of the person providing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Clearly, the gravamen of the offense of theft is the depriving of the owner of his rightful possession of his property. The particular method employed by the wrongdoer is not material; \u201can accusation of theft may be proved by evidence that it was committed in any manner that would be theft under this subheading____\u201d Art. 27, Sec. 341; <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 428 at 442, 458 A.2d 905 (1983). <em>See Jones v. State, </em>303 Md. 323, 493 A.2d 1062 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Generally, jurors are not required to uniformly accept all of the evidence presented in order to arrive at a unanimous verdict. Some jurors unquestionably reject evidence that others accept in determining guilt or innocence. In short, the law requires unanimity only in the verdict, not in the rationale upon which the verdict is based. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the statute sets forth various acts that constitute the crime of theft. As long as jurors unanimously agree that theft in some form was committed, nothing more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Appellant\u2019s presentence report listed, <em>inter alia, </em>several arrests without indicating their ultimate disposition. He argues that because the State cannot prove that the judge did not rely on these arrests in fashioning his sentences, we must vacate these sentences. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">True, the sentencing judge would have erred had he considered a bare list of prior arrests that did not result in convictions. <em>See Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 147, 328 A.2d 293 (1974). The burden of proof on this issue, however, rested with the appellant, and not with the State. <em>Cf., United States v. Garcia, </em>693 F.2d 412 (5th Cir.1982) (defendant must show that judge relied on improper information).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">We find no evidence in the record to support an inference that the judge considered appellant\u2019s prior arrests in imposing the relatively light sentences of four years on the daytime housebreaking count (as compared to the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>tory maximum of ten years), concurrent with two years for theft (as compared to a statutory maximum of 15 years). Moreover, appellant\u2019s counsel explicitly reminded the judge that he could not consider the bare fact that appellant had prior arrests. We will not speculate as to whether the sentencing judge nevertheless relied upon these arrests. Judges are presumed to know the law. <em>Hebb v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 493, 499, 356 A.2d 583 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-13\">.
