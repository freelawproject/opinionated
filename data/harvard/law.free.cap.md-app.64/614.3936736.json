Wyatt<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attempted in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to make an end run around the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u2019s statutory employer provisions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so as to maintain an action of negligence against Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepeo). Wyatt\u2019s efforts failed in the circuit court (Levin, J.). Undaunted by that defeat, Wyatt has carried the fray to this Court where he again endeavors to avoid the statutory barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Wyatt was employed by Johnson Control, Inc., which had been hired by Pepeo as subcontractor to perform certain revamping and retrofitting of the electrical control instrument system at Pepco\u2019s Chalk Point Power Plant. During the course of the renovation work, Wyatt, an electrician and welder, slipped and fell down a staircase while he was carrying a roll of welding cable. Wyatt injured his left leg, and he asserts that injury occurred because Pepeo improperly designed or maintained the stair. As a result, Wyatt sued Pepeo for $1,000,000, which sum was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>raised to $1,050,000 when the loss of consortium claim was added. Pepeo asseverated that it was immune from a suit in negligence, inasmuch as it was the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of Wyatt at the time of the occurrence. Pepeo subsequently moved for summary judgment, which was granted. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Md.Ann.Code art. 101, \u00a7 62 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At2\">\u201cWhen any person as a principal contractor, undertakes to execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation which he has contracted to perform and contracts with any other person as subcontractor, for the execution by or under the subcontractor, of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by the principal contractor, the principal contractor shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the execution of the work any compensation under this article which he would have been liable to pay if that workman had been immediately employed by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Whenever \u00a7 62 applies, the principal contractor<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is considered the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of the subcontractor\u2019s employees. The employee\u2019s exclusive remedy is under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and the principal contractor is not liable in tort to the employee. <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Development Co., </em>285 Md. 216, 221, 401 A.2d 1013, 1016 (1979) <em>(Honaker </em>II).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\"><em>Honaker </em>made transpicuous that \u00a7 62 applies when four factors coalesce:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">1) A principal contractor</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">2) has contracted to perform work</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">3) that is part of his trade, business or occupation</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>4) and has contracted with a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of all or part of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><em>See Honaker </em>I, 278 Md. at 460, 365 A.2d at 291 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Wyatt\u2019s attack is focused on <em>Honaker </em>I\u2019s fourth element, there being no dispute as to the other three <em>Honaker </em>factors. The parties agree that Pepeo is a \u201cprincipal contractor\u201d who has undertaken to supply electricity to the public. Wyatt charges that the particular type of work that his immediate employer Johnson was performing for Pepeo did not constitute all or part of Pepco\u2019s business. In short, Wyatt argues that Pepco\u2019s business is furnishing electricity to the public, and that Johnson was not performing any part of that undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Wyatt avers that Pepco\u2019s business is limited to the everyday activities and operations of the power plant and its related equipment, all of which serve to provide electricity to Pepco\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">A reading of the decisions of the Court of Appeals makes pellucid that certain functions have been held, for the purpose of \u00a7 62, to be considered necessary and essential to the \u201cprincipal contractor\u2019s\u201d business. For example, in <em>State, Use of Reynolds v. City of Baltimore, </em>199 Md. 289, 86 A.2d 618 (1952), the work of erecting hoists was determined to be a necessary and essential part of the actual excavation of a water tunnel and, consequently, a part of the business of the defendant. Further, the <em>Honaker </em>II Court held that inasmuch as any structure must have a roof on it before it may be considered to be a house, the building of a roof was part of the business of a defendant who had contracted to build a house. <em>(See also W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Development Co. v. Honaker, </em>40 Md.App. 185, 190-94, 388 A.2d 562, 566-68 (1978) for a discussion by Judge Couch for this Court of the \u201cessential part\u201d test.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">No Maryland case appears to have decided whether the installation of an electrical conduit at an electrical generating plant is an \u201cessential part\u201d of a utilities business. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Nevertheless, several of our sister states have had the occasion to consider cases that are factually similar to that at bar. The Court of Appeals of Georgia has held that the installation of such a conduit was essential to the manufacture of electricity and, therefore, the utility was a statutory employer. <em>Johnson v. Georgia Power Co., </em>165 Ga.App. 672, 302 S.E.2d 417 (1983), <em>overruled on other grounds, Modlin v. Black &amp; Decker Manufacturing Co., </em>170 Ga.App. 477, 317 S.E.2d 255 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The Supreme Court of Kansas in <em>Lessley v. Kansas Power &amp; Light Co., </em>171 Kan. 197, 231 P.2d 239 (1951), had before it a matter in which an argument was advanced almost identical to that in the instant case. There, an employee of a subcontractor was injured in a job related accident arising out of the installation of a new turbo-generator, steam boiler, and other auxiliary equipment. The employee sued the defendant utility on the ground that the installation of the equipment was not part of the trade or business of the utility, <em>i.e., </em>transmission of electric power. The court said: \u201c[I]t is a matter of common knowledge that steam boilers, turbines, generators and other equipment, as well as a building in which to house them, are a part of the integral equipment necessary to the operation of the business of a public utility which is engaged in the production, transmission, and sale of electricity. New buildings and new equipment whether required for replacement purposes or for increased capacity are incidents essential to the proper maintenance of such business.\u201d The <em>Lessley </em>court concluded that the construction was part of the utilities business or that it was a statutory employer, and Lessley\u2019s remedy was limited to recovery of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In yet another electrical power plant case, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that work performed on electrical equipment that was designed to control a newly installed coal-loading apparatus, was part of the defendant\u2019s business. <em>MacMullen v. South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co., </em>312 F.2d 662 (4th Cir.1963). <em>(Cf. Western </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>Electric Co. v. Capes, </em>164 Ga.App. 353, 296 S.E.2d 381 (1982), however, where it was held that the installation and maintenance of vending machines was <em>not </em>part of the electric company\u2019s manufacturing process.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">We think that the renovation work undertaken by Pepeo at the Chalk Point Power Plant was essential to the operation of that plant in order to provide electricity to the public. In fact, the revamping was necessary in order for the plant to comply with federal and state pollution laws. As we see it, Pepeo was Wyatt\u2019s statutory employer at the time of the accident, and, therefore, Wyatt may not successfully maintain an action in tort against Pepeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Wyatt, additionally, asserts that the summary judgment entered against him was improper because of the existence of a genuine dispute of a material fact. Wyatt says that Pepeo had little or no control over Johnson\u2019s employees. Whether that issue is disputed by Pepeo matters not one whit because it does not affect the ultimate decision. Pepeo was the \u201cprincipal contractor\u201d within the purview of Md. Ann.Code art. 101, \u00a7 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We hold, therefore, that Judge Levin properly entered judgment in favor of Pepeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-11\">. In an amended declaration Wyatt\u2019s wife, Linda, was added as a party plaintiff for the purpose of joining her husband in a loss of consortium claim. Since the appeal is concerned primarily with Mr. Wyatt, we, for simplicity purposes, have used only his name in the text of the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\">.
