BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b650-16\">In this appeal, we decide whether the trial court, following a remand from the Court of Appeals, correctly applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the law in determining that the claimant acquired the disputed property by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Elmer V. Staubitz (appellee/claimant) acquired title to lot 232 located at Whitehall Beach in Anne Arundel County in 1955. Richard L. Peters (appellant/record owner) is the present owner of lot 233 at Whitehall Beach.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lot 233 is adjoined on the east by lot 232. Both lots 232 and 233 are bound on the north by Red Cedar Road and on the south by the Whitehall River.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In April 1980, the Costellos, Peters\u2019 predecessors in interest, employed a surveyor to determine the exact eastern boundary of lot 233 and to stake the deeded property line. The survey indicated that an existing barbed wire fence, erected around 1940 by the prior owner of lot 233, was not located along its eastern boundary. Instead, it crossed the southeastern corner of lot 233 and the northwestern corner of lot 232 forming two triangles \u2014 one on lot 232, the other on lot 233. The latter triangle, which constitutes the disputed property, is bound on the east by the staked property line, on the south by the Whitehall River and on the west by the barbed wire fence. This area is 270 feet deep and 14.53 feet wide at the Whitehall River.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Staubitz brought suit against the Costellos in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County in September 1980 to quiet title, claiming that he had acquired the strip of land by adverse possession. Following a bench trial, the court issued a memorandum opinion in which it found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axf\">\u201c[I]t is also uncontroverted that the fence upon which Mr. Staubitz bases his claim was originally erected as a boundary between lots 232 and 233. The testimony at trial revealed that the fence was installed by [the record owners\u2019 predecessors in interest] to keep their cows from going on to Mr. Staubitz\u2019s father\u2019s property. It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>revealed that the fence was intended, and did serve as the boundary of the two lots.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Based upon these findings it concluded that Staubitz had acquired title to the disputed strip of land by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The Costellos noted an appeal to this Court. In an unreported per curiam opinion, <em>Costello v. Staubitz, </em>No. 57, September Term, 1982, filed 16 November 1982, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. Subsequently, the record owners petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of certiorari which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Costello v. Staubitz, </em>300 Md. 60, 475 A.2d 1185 (1984), reversed. It held that where, as in the present case, a record owner or previous record owner erects a fence for his own purposes, within his land, its existence \u201cdoes not support an inference that the fence is a visible boundary delineating the extent of a claimant\u2019s adverse possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 475 A.2d 1185. The Court further explained that under these circumstances the fence \u201cdid not constitute evidence of adverse possession and was not an appropriate factor to be taken into account in determining the extent of the claimant\u2019s adverse possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 475 A.2d 1185. It then directed the case be remanded to the trial court to determine \u201cwhat, if any, land was actually occupied by the claimant for the statutorily prescribed twenty-year period.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">On remand, the court made detailed findings concerning Staubitz\u2019s acts of dominion over the disputed property and their duration. Based on these findings, it ruled that Staubitz \u201chas acquired title to the disputed strip of land between Lots 232 and 233 by adverse possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Peters then noted this appeal in which he raises the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">I. Did the court err, as a matter of law, in using the fence to delineate the extent of appellee\u2019s actual occupancy since it was erected by one of appellant\u2019s predecessors in title for his own purposes and within his own lands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>II. Was the court clearly erroneous in finding that all of the disputed property had been actually occupied \u2014 openly, exclusively, adversely and continuously, under claim of ownership for the statutorily prescribed period?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">L EXISTENCE OF THE FENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In <em>Costello v. Staubitz, supra, </em>the late Judge Davidson, writing for the Court of Appeals, set forth the principles applicable to a determination of whether a visible line of demarcation constitutes evidence of adverse possession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgqA\">\u201cThe following general principles emerge from this Court\u2019s previous decisions in adverse possession cases in which a visible line of demarcation was a factor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">1) The existence of a visible line of demarcation ordinarily does not constitute evidence of adverse possession when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">a) it was created by a record owner, for the record owner\u2019s own purposes, within the record owner\u2019s land ... or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">b) it was created by a party claiming title by adverse possession for the purpose of claiming the visible line of demarcation as a boundary only if it is in fact coincident with the actual boundary ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">2) The existence of a visible line of demarcation ordinarily constitutes some evidence of adverse possession when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">a) it was created by a party claiming title by adverse possession for the purpose of claiming the visible line of demarcation as a visible boundary delineating the extent of the claimed adverse possession ... or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">b) there is no evidence to show by whom and for what purpose the line of demarcation was created____\u201d (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-14\"><em>Costello, </em>300 Md. at 72-73, 475 A.2d 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-15\">Appellant asserts that even though the court, on remand, acknowledged the rule of <em>Costello, </em>\u201c[nevertheless, ... [it] once again improperly [relied] on the fence [and] proceeded to find ... that [the claimant] had acquired title, by adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>possession, to the entire parcel.\u201d In support of this argument he refers us to the following language in the court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201c[I]t does represent a visible border to the east of which the claimant, Mr. Staubitz, actually occupied the adverse property in a manner which comported with the ordinary management of similar lands by their owners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFoX\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that this statement shows the court attempted \u201cto make a distinction, not recognized by the Court of Appeals decision, between a \u2018boundary\u2019 and a \u2018border\u2019, in order to rely on the fence to delineate the extent of Appellee\u2019s possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In <em>Costello v. Staubitz, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that a claimant could not rely on the existence of a fence erected by the record owners or previous record owners to establish the extent of his claim of adverse possession. <em>Id. </em>Rather, he is required to demonstrate his acts of dominion over the disputed land for the required statutory period. <em>Id. </em>If he does so, the court need not totally ignore the fact that there is a fence in existence because it is evidence of the outer limit of physical property over which he could reasonably have exercised dominion.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Our review of the court\u2019s ruling demonstrates that it was based upon the chancellor\u2019s finding that appellee had satisfied the requirements of the doctrine of adverse possession through his acts of dominion over the disputed property. The chancellor merely referred to the fence for what it was \u2014 \u201ca visible border.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">II. ADVERSE POSSESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">To acquire title by adverse possession, a claimant must demonstrate that his occupation of the land has been actual, hostile, notorious, exclusive, under claim of title and continuous or uninterrupted for twenty years. <em>Costello v. Staubitz, </em>300 Md. at 67, 475 A.2d 1185; <em>Blickenstaff v. Bromley, </em>243 Md. 164, 220 A.2d 558 (1966); <em>Goen v. Salisbury, </em>219 Md. 289, 149 A.2d 17 (1959); <em>Miklasz v. G.W. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Stone, Inc., </em>60 Md.App. 438, 483 A.2d 382 (1984). Moreover, where, as here, adverse possession is not claimed under color of title, it extends only to the land actually occupied by the claimant. <em>Costello v. Staubitz, </em>300 Md. at 68, 475 A.2d 1185; <em>Miklasz v. G.W. Stone, Inc., </em>60 Md.App. at 445, 483 A.2d 382. Finally, in determining whether the claimant\u2019s acts of dominion constitute adverse possession, the court is to consider the character of the land and the uses and purposes to which it is adapted because \u201cthe type of possessory acts necessary to constitute actual possession in one case may not be essential in another.\u201d <em>Blickenstaff v. Bromley, </em>243 Md. at 171, 220 A.2d 558. <em>Goen v. Sansbury, </em>219 Md. at 296, 149 A.2d 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Appellant maintains that the court was clearly erroneous in finding that appellee acquired title to the entire strip of disputed property by adverse possession. He claims that the court \u201ccites various uses of the disputed property by the Appellee, but fails to make specific findings as to the location and duration of these uses or whether they were hostile, open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted and under claim of ownership ... for twenty years.\u201d He then asserts that since the court did not make the requisite findings \u201cthere is no basis for [its ruling] that all of the land was actually occupied by the claimant for the statutorily prescribed twenty year period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We agree with appellant, but not totally. Let us explain.</p>\n<p id=\"AxT\">The court found that appellee\u2019s possessory acts of dominion on the disputed land</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201crevealed a pattern of activity consistent with ownership. A bulkhead constructed of pipes and cement extended from Mr. Staubitz\u2019 record property into the adversed property. Mr. Staubitz and his then son-in-law built the bulkhead around 1955 ... Immediately to the west of the bulkhead was a boat landing built by Mr. Staubitz in the early 1950\u2019s ... This landing, known to the claimant as a railway, consisted of several logs arranged in a slide-like device, and was attached to a willow tree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>was on the westernmost border of the disputed property ... Directly behind the railway, inland, is a barbeque or fire pit ... [which] is made of concrete blocks stacked upon each other and once were mortared together ... The pit was constructed in 1957 ... Somewhat further inland from the pit a substantial building was constructed by Mr. Staubitz. This building, a combination privy and boathouse, was constructed, according to Mr. Staubitz, in the 1950\u2019s ... This boathouse was built on the site of an earlier constructed building ... A boat was stored and painted on the land by the west side of the boathouse ... Further inland, Mr. Staubitz planted a line of three poplar trees on the contested property and parallel to the wire fence. These trees, grown from cuttings were planted either in the 1940\u2019s according to Mr. Staubitz ... or in the early 1950\u2019s, according to Mr. McMullen who gave the cuttings to Mr. Staubitz ... These are the only poplars on the disputed property and are the dominent [sic] natural feature located there. The property, with the exception of the improvements already mentioned, was left in its wild state as Mr. Staubitz wished the land to be an animal sanctuary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Additionally, the court considered the character and location of the land and the uses for which it is naturally adapted. Finally, it took into account the attitudes of longtime and former residents \u2014 \u201cAll four of the residents testifying for the claimant, supported his assertions as to the improvements made and as to [appellee\u2019s] claim to the disputed property.\u201d Based upon all of these factors, it found that the claimant \u201cactually occupied all the contested property east of the barbed wire fence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The evidence amply supports the court\u2019s findings that appellee actually, exclusively, openly, notoriously and for the requisite statutory period occupied the portion of the disputed property where the fire pit, the boathouse and the poplar trees are located. Appellee testified about the nature and duration of each of these improvements and introduced family photographs from the 1950\u2019s to 1980 showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>his use of the areas in question. Mr. Hook, a fifty-three year old neighbor at Whitehall Beach, who had occupied a summer home next door to appellee since their childhood, substantiated appellee\u2019s testimony. Hook related that \u201csince [he] was old enough to remember\u201d appellee had utilized the fire pit on the disputed property \u201cfor burning trash and steaming crabs.\u201d He also stated that the shed had been on the property for more than thirty-four years and that it \u201cwas [a] combination privy and boathouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Appellant concedes that while these \u201ccombined alleged uses of the property\u201d may constitute \u201cunequivocal acts of ownership,\u201d appellee, nevertheless, failed to show that he used the entire property for the statutory period. We agree. Appellee seeks to acquire ownership of the disputed land without color of title; therefore, his adverse possession can extend only to that portion which he actually occupied. <em>Costello v. Staubitz, supra; Miklasz v. G.W. Stone, Inc., supra. </em>While there is no precise formula for determining what constitutes actual occupation, it would be virtually impossible to require that a claimant use every square inch of the disputed property for every moment of the statutory period to establish adverse possession. In determining whether the criteria for adverse possession have been satisfied, here, we must examine the nature of the property, its size and the type of uses for which it is suitable. <em>Blickenstaff v. Bromley, supra; Goen v. Sansbury, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">This particular property is triangular in shape, and is only 14.53 feet wide at its greatest width. Because of its size and shape, potential uses of it are limited. The chancellor\u2019s finding that appellee occupied the width and length of the triangle from the Whitehall River to the animal sanctuary is supported by the record. We hold that he was not clearly erroneous. Md.Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The evidence, however, does not support the court\u2019s finding that appellee acquired title to the remainder of the triangle where the animal sanctuary is located. Under some circumstances, a claimant\u2019s creation of an animal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>sanctuary might constitute an actual use for purposes of adverse possession. In this case, however, there is no evidence that appellee used the animal sanctuary. He merely allowed \u201c[a] large part of the disputed triangle ... to grow wild [because he] desires the wild nature of the ground as an animal sanctuary____\u201d This is not sufficient. We hold that the court erred in finding that appellee acquired title to that portion of the disputed land by adverse possession. On remand, the court must define the exact demarcation of the property actually occupied by appellee for the statutorily prescribed period.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE SHARED EQUALLY BY APPELLANT AND APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">. When this suit began, William and Janice Costello owned lot 233. In September 1984, Richard L.
