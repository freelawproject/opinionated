His victim was Paul Mann, an admitted homosexual. Hopper was found guilty by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of attempted robbery and sentenced to ten years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Mr. Mann testified that after meeting Hopper at a bar in the District of Columbia, Hopper agreed to accompany him to his Montgomery County apartment and provide sexual services in exchange for $30.00. According to Mann, that night Hopper rendered the services promised and \u201cwas a perfect gentleman.\u201d The next morning Mann paid Hopper $30.00 and gave him a ride to a nearby art gallery. That evening, however, according to Mann, Hopper telephoned him and asked if he could spend another night at the apartment, assuring Mann that this time he would not seek compensation. The victim testified that he agreed that Hopper could \u201ccome and stay and just sleep on the couch.\u201d Mann further stated that although Hopper tried to interest him in another sexual act, he replied, \u201c[n]o, I told you that I am not able to give you anything, and I don\u2019t feel that I want any second session with you. It does not interest me.\u201d The victim further testified, \u201cI slept for quite a while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>I know, and the next thing I knew something crashed and someone crashed down on top of me, the full weight of the body, and put his left arm around my neck and ... cut my throat.\u201d Mann managed to roll away from his assailant\u2019s grasp and then gird himself from further attack as he seemingly froze Hopper in his tracks with the reminder that mutual friends knew of Hopper\u2019s presence in the apartment. When Mann asked Hopper why he had cut him, the appellant replied that he needed money. Moments later, the victim was able to run out of the apartment, lock the door from the outside, and ask a neighbor to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Hopper testified, on the other hand, that he had spent three nights at Mr. Mann\u2019s apartment and provided sexual services each night before sleeping with Mann in the latter\u2019s bed. According to the appellant, after the third session, he awoke at about 5:30 a.m. When he awakened Mann and asked for a ride, Mann became \u201ccranky\u201d and an argument ensued. When Hopper demanded his money for the sexual services, Mann replied that he did not owe him anything inasmuch as the appellant had spent three nights in his apartment. Both men became \u201cangry\u201d and at one point in the argument, the appellant pulled out a knife and said, \u201c[jjust stay away from me. All I want is my money that you owe me.\u201d As the appellant turned and started to walk away, Mann grabbed him. In the ensuing tussle, both men fell to the floor and Mann was accidentally cut, according to Hopper. Hopper further testified that when he saw Mann bleeding, he told Mann that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to do it,\u201d and that he \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to hurt him.\u201d He then put the knife in his gym bag and telephoned the police for help. Hopper testified that he became \u201cscared\u201d and left the apartment through the sliding glass doors leading from the bedroom to the balcony, and drove to his home in Orlando, Florida, where he was arrested two weeks later. The appellant reiterated that Mann had been cut accidentally, and denied any intent to kill, injure or rob him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Mr. George Cornell, who also had had a sexual relationship with Hopper, testified that he had been a friend of Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Mann for fifteen years, that he had given the knife to Hopper about a week before the incident in question, and that Hopper had been polite with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\n<em>Curtailment of Cross-Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Prior to trial, defense counsel advised the court that Mr. Mann had filed a claim with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and that a single board member preliminarily had denied the claim under the \u201cfamily crime\u201d exclusion on the ground that Mr. Mann had been living with the assailant while maintaining a sexual relationship with him at the time of the occurrence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He further advised the court that Mr. Mann had been granted a reconsideration of this decision and was ultimately awarded his claim. At trial, when defense counsel sought to cross-examine Mann about the letter of reconsideration he had written denying that he had been maintaining a sexual relationship with the appellant, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">MR. DEAN: I am going to object to any at this point\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae1\">THE COURT: What in the world does Criminal Injuries Compensation have to do with this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">MR. COCKERILL: Your Honor, he applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">THE COURT: He was turned down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>MR. COCKERILL: He was denied benefits on the basis of the family exception that I read to you out of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">MR. COCKERILL: The other reason is, of course, being denied, he lost approximately $2,700.00 in benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">THE COURT: So?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">MR. COCKERILL: He has motivation to testify a certain way and I think it goes as to bias. If he were to testify that he had been over there and had sex more than once, he is imperiling his award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">THE COURT: He may well be, but we are not dealing with the award, we are dealing with the events of that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">MR. COCKERILL: I think it goes to interest or bias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARB\">THE COURT: How can that go to bias?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">MR. COCKERILL: If a man came in and said \u2014 let\u2019s pick out the most blatant example, Cockerill gave me $2700.00 to testify this way, you would say that goes in \u2014 he in effect has received $2700.00 to tell the story in the way that there was no sex on the night before the incident, but he is receiving $2700.00 by telling it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9-\">THE COURT: I will sustain the objection. That does not go to bias, it is purely to get in the fact that he is seeking compensation and has got compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">(Whereupon, the Bench Conference concluded).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">BY MR. COCKERILL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">Q. Mr. Mann, on November 11, 1983, did you write a letter in which you said, \u201cHopper was an overnight guest in my apartment\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">MR. DEAN: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-15\">MR. COCKERILL: (continuing) \u2014 and at no time did he ever have anything to do with me other than during the one night he stayed over due to father being in California for two days as he stated.\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-16\">THE WITNESS: What did I say, one night or two nights? What we talk about here is the night of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>incident, so we do not talk about the night before. It was not relevant to the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">I was interrogated by an investigator\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">THE COURT: All right. Ask another question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">BY MR. COCKERILL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">Q. Were you told\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">A. By whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">Q. <em>(continuing) </em>\u2014 were <em>you told that you would not be entitled to receive benefits if your injury </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">MR. DEAN: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">MR. DEAN: Move to strike any reference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">THE COURT: All right. The motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-15\">MR. COCKERILL: Your Honor, I will proffer the contents of Exhibits 2 and 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">We recognize that the decision to either allow or disallow questions on cross-examination is normally left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Caldwell v. State, </em>276 Md. 612, 618, 349 A.2d 623 (1976); <em>Milligan v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 588, 593, 308 A.2d 418 (1973). \u201cBut where limitations imposed by the court upon cross-examination are such as plainly inhibit the ability of the accused to obtain a fair trial, the general rule is manifestly inapplicable.\u201d <em>DeLilly v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 676, 681, 276 A.2d 417 (1971), citing <em>Shupe v. State, </em>238 Md. 307, 208 A.2d 590 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">The nub of the appellant\u2019s contention is that as a result of the trial court\u2019s ruling, he was unable to establish a record from which to argue to the jury why Mr. Mann might have been biased or otherwise lacked that degree of impartiality expected of a witness at trial. The appellant contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>on the basis of the limited cross-examination that was permitted as to the criminal injuries claim, the jury might well have thought that defense counsel was engaged in a speculative and baseless line of attack on the credibility of an apparently blameless witness. According to the appellant, Mann was accidentally cut when he grabbed Hopper during an argument about payment for sexual services. Moreover, the appellant argues that the trial judge\u2019s ruling actually allowed the prosecutor on rebuttal argument to state the following with impunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">Now, Mr. Cockerill has implied, suggested, stated that the victim is lying or something. Ladies and gentlemen, just ask yourselves \u201cWhy?\u201d Why would Paul Mann lie? There is no reason for Paul Mann to tell lies. There would be no benefit whatsoever accruing to Paul Mann to lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">It is well settled that the right of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the federal constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights includes the right to cross-examine about matters which affect a witness\u2019 bias, interest, or motive to falsify. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 468 A.2d 319 (1983); <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 349, 437 A.2d 901 (1981); <em>State v. DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. 212, 344 A.2d 446 (1975); <em>Rowe v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 486, 490 A.2d 278 (1985); and <em>Waldron v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 686, 491 A.2d 595 (No. 853, September Term, 1984, filed May 8, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In <em>Davis v. Alaska, supra, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahv\">A more particular attack on the witness\u2019 credibility is effected by means of cross-examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at hand. The partiality of a witness is subject to exploration at trial, and is \u201calways relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his testimony.\u201d 3A J. Wigmore Evidence Sec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>940, p. 775 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). We have recognized that the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination. <em>Greene v. McElroy, </em>360 U.S. 474, 496, 79 S.Ct. 1400 [1413], 3 L.Ed 2d 1377 (1959). 415 U.S. at 316-17, 94 S.Ct. at 1110. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Similarly, this Court concluded in <em>DeLawder:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">Defense counsel did his best to show the existence of possible bias, prejudice or ulterior motive of the prosecutrix, causing her to assert that DeLawder carnally knew her. We cannot speculate, more than the Court could in Davis, as to whether the jury, as the sole judge of the credibility of a witness, would have accepted this line of reasoning had counsel been permitted to present it fully. But we do conclude, as the Court concluded in <em>Davis, </em>that the jurors were entitled to have the benefit of the defense theory before them so they could make an informed judgment as to the weight to place on the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony which provided \u201ca crucial link in the proof ... of [the accused\u2019s] act.\u201d (Citation omitted). 28 Md.App. at 226, 344 A.2d 446.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Hopper testified that he had provided sexual services to Mann on three consecutive nights, that he accidentally cut Mann during an argument arising from Mann\u2019s refusal to pay him, and that he did not intend to injure or rob Mann. Defense counsel sought to establish through cross-examination of Mann that Mann had filed a claim with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board seeking an award for medical and related expenses; that his claim was initially denied on the ground that he had been living and maintaining a sexual relationship with the appellant; and that he had sought reconsideration. Counsel further sought to establish that in order to receive an award, Mann had to convince the fact finder that he neither had been maintaining a sexual relationship with the appellant, nor had he been in any way responsible for the crime or contributed to the infliction of his own injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>We believe that such evidence was germane to the issue of bias or pecuniary interest, and that the trial judge erred in curtailing cross-examination as to the relevant issue regarding the witness\u2019 possible motivation to fabricate his testimony. Furthermore, although the jury may very well have believed the victim despite the proffered motivation to fabricate in order to keep the award, that possibility is in the nature of mere speculation. In any event, as credibility had become a crucial issue, the inquiry had substantial probative force.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In our determination as to whether the error was harmless, we are guided by the Court of Appeals holding in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). In order to find that an error is harmless, we must \u201cbe satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Based upon our independent review of the record wherein the issue of credibility was particularly acute, especially so in light of the prosecutor\u2019s argument on rebuttal, we cannot declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in curtailing the inquiry as to the victim\u2019s pecunious motivation to falsify testimony, in no way influenced the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">As we believe that the proffered focus of cross-examination which had been excluded could have cast sufficient doubt on the victim\u2019s credibility to render him unworthy of belief in the mind of at least one juror, we deem the error to be prejudicial. <em>See Cox v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 271, 284, 443 A.2d 607 <em>affd, State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. at 185, 468 A.2d 319. As the evidence was sufficient to convict the appellant of attempted robbery, however, we shall remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">II. <em>Sufficiency of Indictment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">In the interest of judicial economy, we shall also resolve the second issue presented to us by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Count Three of the indictment charged the appellant with what turned out to be the sole surviving charge, attempted robbery. It alleged, in pertinent part, that Hopper \u201cunlawfully did attempt to commit a robbery upon Paul Mann ...\u201d. As the indictment failed to state that Hopper attempted to take or carry away the property, that he did so by the use of violence, or that he intended to permanently deprive Mr. Mann of his property, the appellant contends that the charging document was fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The Court of Appeals recently resolved the question in <em>Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 490 A.2d 1277 (1985). The Court held that \u201c[although the customary method of identifying the particular crime charged has been to aver its essential elements in the charging document, that is not the exclusive method, and the use of other words that sufficiently characterize the crime will satisfy jurisdictional requirements. <em>See Putnam v. State, supra, </em>234 Md. [537] at 541, 544-45 [200 A.2d 59 (1964)].\u201d We hold that the charging document was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">CASE REMANDED FOR NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\">. 3A J.
