BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">On May 4, 1984, Denise Lillian Parrish,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the appellant was convicted in a non-jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Hinkel, J.), of theft of goods valued over $300.00. At the conclusion of the trial she was committed to the custody of the Division of Correction for three years. Pursuant to a motion for post conviction relief, a hearing was held on January 3, 1985. She was granted the right to file a belated appeal on March 12, 1985. On appeal she contends that the court erred:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">1. in finding her guilty without first affording her the opportunity to make a closing statement; and;</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">2. in refusing to admit the statement given to the police by her alleged accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The record before us shows that at about 6:45 p.m. on January 19, 1984, appellant and a male companion entered a clothing store and removed clothing, which they placed in a bag. They were observed by the assistant manager and by an off-duty security guard. Subsequently, they were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">I. Opportunity to Make Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Appellant contends that the court erred in finding her guilty without first affording her the opportunity to make a closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Appellant renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the State did not present evidence of the value of the property. The prosecutor then responded, which prompted the court to ask the court stenographer to read back the pertinent testimony. Having determined that the value of the property had been proven, the court allowed the prosecutor to finish his statement. The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and declared her guilty. Appellant neither objected, nor protested; rather, her counsel requested, and was granted, the right to speak in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In <em>Cherry v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 425, 489 A.2d 1138 (1985), this court held that when a trial judge announces his verdict without first affording the defense an opportunity to present closing argument, in the absence of an objection, the right to present closing argument is waived. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the premature verdict issue has not been preserved for review. <em>Covington v. State, </em>282 Md. 540, 386 A.2d 336 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">II. Admissibility of Statement by Alleged Accomplice</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The appellant sought to introduce a statement given to the police by her male companion. Without having seen the statement, the court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection and refused to admit the statement because it was hearsay. Appellant now contends that it was error for the court to refuse to admit the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Although the statement was not signed, contained no acknowledgment from the declarant, and no evidence was proffered as to its accuracy, appellant asserts that the statement \u201cis plainly a declaration against [her male companion\u2019s] penal interest.\u201d She argues, therefore, that the statement should have been admitted unless shown to be untrustworthy, frivolous, or collusive. <em>Dyson v. State, </em>238 Md. 398, 209 A.2d 609 (1965); <em>Agnew v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 614, 446 A.2d 425 (1982); <em>Harris v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 58, 387 A.2d 1152 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The issue of the admissibility of appellant\u2019s male companion\u2019s statement as a declaration against his penal interest has not been preserved for appellate review. The trial transcript reflects the following regarding the subject statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>MR. LONGO: I would like to present at this time an investigation report which has Mr. Preister\u2019s statement on it. I would like to submit this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">THE COURT: As evidence in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">MR. LONGO: Yes. The State should have received a copy of this prior to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">MR. MOORE: I don\u2019t even know who this is from. It\u2019s not signed. Who authored it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">MR. LONGO: It should have been in your file from the Preister case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">MR. MOORE: It\u2019s obviously hearsay. I was going let him do the best he could. I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Following this colloquy, appellant\u2019s counsel proceeded to argue another, unrelated point. He did not request that the statement be marked for identification as a defense exhibit, thus making it a part of the record;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor did he proffer its contents or even state the reasons he concluded it was admissible. The statement not being a part of the record and no proffer as to its contents having been made, there is nothing for this Court to review. <em>Keys v. Keys, </em>251 Md. 247, 247 A.2d 282 (1968); <em>Hartsock v. Strong, </em>21 Md.App. 110, 318 A.2d 237 (1974). <em>See also Burke v. Burke, </em>204 Md. 637, 106 A.2d 59 (1954). Moreover, this issue is being raised for the first time on appeal; it was never presented to the trial court for decision and, in fact, the trial judge never decided it. We have consistently declined to \u201cdecide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>record to have been tried or decided by the lower court.\u201d Maryland Rule 1085. <em>See, Braxton v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 539, 549, 470 A.2d 1327 (1984). We perceive no basis for treating this case any differently. The parties\u2019 agreement, or, as in this case, the opposing party\u2019s acquiescence, does not provide a basis for our considering and deciding an issue not otherwise properly before us. <em>See, Brodak v. Brodak, </em>294 Md. 10, 447 A.2d 847 (1982); <em>Stewart v. State, </em>287 Md. 524, 413 A.2d 1337 (1980); <em>Ratcliffe v. Clarke\u2019s Red Barn, </em>64 Md.App. 293, 494 A.2d 983 (1985); <em>Zorich v. Zorich, </em>63 Md.App. 710, 493 A.2d 1096 (1985); <em>Russell v. Russell, </em>50 Md.App. 185, 436 A.2d 524 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-12\">. Although appellant is charged under the name, Denise Lillian Parrish, she signed her bail bond, Lillian D. Parrish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-12\">. Appellant concedes that the statement \u201cwas not formally placed in the record.\u201d The State, likewise, recognizes that it is not a part of this record although it did not move to strike it since \u201cits inclusion is harmless to Appellee\u2019s position.\u201d We do agree with the State that a consideration of the merits of the issue would be \"harmless\u201d to its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">The statement sought to be introduced into evidence appears to be an attempt by its author to exculpate himself by declaring that he had \"changed his mind and was returning the suits.\u201d The statement, thus, simply does not, as appellant would have it do, provide evidence that her male companion, and not she, was the thief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
