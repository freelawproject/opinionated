The interveners aver: That' the purchase price, to wit, $2,763,220, was entirely inadequate, and not more than one-eighth or one-ninth of the value'of the property sold, and said sale was so conducted that a greater amount could not be realized therefrom. That the sale was unfair, irregular, collusive, and fraudulent, in that by the terms of sale competitive bidding was prevented. That - said terms of sale destroyed all equity between the bondholders and all other persons, and were illegal, unfair, improper, and contrary to the justice of the court, and resulted in but \u25a0one bid for the property.

Great inadequacy of price at a judicial sale of real estate requires only slight circumstances of unfairness in the conduct of the party benefited by the sale to raise a presumption of fraud.\u201d Graffam v. Burgess, 117 U. S. 180, 192, 6 Sup. Ct. 686, 692, 29 L. Ed. 839. \u201cThe purpose of the law is that the sale shall be final; and to insure reliance upon such sales, and induce biddings, it is essential that no sale be set aside for trifling reasons, or on account of matters which ought to have been attended to by the complaining party prior thereto.\u201d Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, 145 U. S. 349, 12 Sup. Ct. 887, 36 L. Ed. 732; Ballentyne v. Smith, 205 U. S. 289, 27 Sup. Ct. 527, 51 L. Ed. 803.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">It is charged that by the terms of sale competitive bidding was prevented, that said terms destroyed equality between the bondholders and all other persons, and that they resulted in but one bid for the property. The only fact alleged to sustain this charge is the decree itself, and the court puts no such construction- on the decree. It provides, as is usual in such cases, for a certain amount of money to be deposited in cash or certified check with the special master, or, in lieu of a certain amount of cash, bonds of the railroad company. If any bondholder desired to bid, or other person, corporation, or syndicate desired to do so, and owned no bonds, but was financially able to buy a railroad of the size and character of the one in question, he could have raised the amount of money to make the necessary deposit; or if the objectors herein desired to do so, and were in fact bondholders, they had the right and opportunity to co-operate with their cobondholders in the matter. There was, in the opinion of the court, nothing in the decree to prevent their doing so. The decree did not, in the terms of sale provided therein, prevent competitive bidding or limit or restrict the bid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> It is charged by the objectors that the proceedings, from the time of the filing of the original bill to the final sale of the property, were \u201cconsent proceedings.\u201d Such proceedings are not necessarily fraudulent, collusive, or void. The bondholders had the right under the provisions of the mortgage to request the trustee to file a bill for a foreclosure of the mortgage in default of payment of interest on the bonds of the New Orleans, Mobile &amp; Chicago Railroad Company. This request was made by a majority of the bondholders. The trustee, the complainant in the cause, on the part of said bondholders, and as the representative of all the bondholders, filed a bill against said railroad company, the defendant. It was represented by counsel. No objection was made to the proceedings, and no defense as they progressed. This suit is characterized as one \u201cby consent,\u201d it was nevertheless a legal and proper proceeding and between the proper parties\u2014the trustee as the representative of all the bondholders and the defendant railroad company. The so-called \u201cconsent proceedings\u201d were more expeditious and less expensive than if a decree pro confesso had been taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">If the objectors herein were, in fact, stockholders or bondholders, they must surely have had knowledge of the proceedings taken and of their progress. If they were objectors to what was being done a.nd the purpose of the proceeding, and considered their interest jeopardized, why did they not by intervention or otherwise make known their grievance or complaint, if any, to the trustee or to their cobondholders for redress or protection during the pendency of the proceeding? Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason supra. There are no facts, alleged to sustain the charge of a collusive and fraudulent scheme to deprive the stockholders of said railroad of their alleged large and valuable equity in said property. None of said stockholders are named, and none are here mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ing any such claim. If it be a fact that the interveners were or are stockholders, that fact is not affirmatively alleged in their petition of intervention. That fact, if shown to exist, is by implication only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-4\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> The petition of L. S. Berg, as set forth in the sixth ground of the petition, has, in my opinion, no place in this proceeding. He is not a party to this proceeding, and the allegations made by him in his petition are not made or adopted by interveners as their allegations in their petition. Moreover, Berg\u2019s petition was not insisted on by him, but in fact it was withdrawn, or abandoned, and dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\"><bracketnum>[7, 8]</bracketnum> One of the counsel for the objectors stated in his brief that \u201cthe rule of inadequacy of price must be so gross as to shock the conscience of the court is not applicable to this cause.\u201d The court concurs with the learned counsel in this opinion, for the reason, as stated by him, that the decree of the court reserves the unconditional right to reject all bids, and for the further reason that, in the opinion of the court, the inadequacy of price has not been shown by sufficient or satisfactory legal evidence in the case to be so gross as to shock the conscience or excite the suspicion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">The evidence offered to prove the value of the property to sustain the charge of inadequacy of the price for which it sold is the estimated value at which'the reorganization committee proposes reorganization. There can be no reorganization until the purchasers have acquired the title and possession of the property. What they now propose or plan may be entirely changed before or when the reorganization is to be made effective. It is certainly not competent or sufficient. evidence to satisfy the court that the inadequacy of price is such as to justify it in refusing to confirm the sale, on the alleged estimate of said committee. The only other evidence on the subject that I find submitted by the objectors, likewise insufficient, is the testimony of T. F. Whittlesey. He shows that he had considerable experience as a railroad man, and might properly be consider\u00e9d generally as an expert. He testifies that from 1905 to 1907 he was general manager of the Mobile, Jackson &amp; Kansas City Railroad Company, now the New Orleans, Mobile &amp; Chicago Railroad Company. He states that he has just made an examination of the line of the said New Orleans, Mobile &amp; Chicago Railroad, and has visited and observed many improvements since he was an officer of the Mobile, Jackson &amp; Kansas City Railroad. He gives no opinion as an expert as to the value of said Mobile,- Jackson <em>&amp; </em>Kansas City Railroad at the time he was the general manager, and of the present value of the New Orleans, Mobile &amp; Chicago Railroad. He does not state that he has an opinion on the subject, but he does say it was his understanding that the cost of the Mobile, Jackson <em>&amp; </em>Kansas City Railroad and the Gulf &amp; Chicago, combined, was $8,000,000, arid that, taking into consideration the improvement of the property since he left it, he. is of the opinion that the price of approximately $2,750,000 for the property is wholly inadequate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-7\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> There is no advance bid on the price at which the property sold by any one, and none offered or suggested. \u201cTo warrant a court in disregarding the rule which precludes the intervention of an individual bondholder in foreclosure by the mortgage trustee as representative of all bondholders, the petition for intervention must allege traversable facts which, if true, show that the trustee occupies a hostile position, or other reason why he cannot fairly represent petitioner, and general allegations that the suit is fraudulent and collusive, and that the trustee is co-operating with bondholders in a reorganization scheme, are insufficient.\u201d \u201cThe petition must disclose facts bringing it within the principles governing the right to intervene; and in determining whether such facts are disclosed, the allegations of the petition must be subjected to, and must meet, the same tests as are applied to ordinary proceedings to determine whether a cause of action or defense is stated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-8\">General allegations that the trustee acted in bad faith and in opposition to petitioner\u2019s rights and interests, and characterizing his action and the situation resulting therefrom as \u201cfraudulent, collusive; and the like, are insufficient, in the absence of allegations of facts themselves giving rise to an inference of such partiality, fraud, or collusion.\u201d There must be an allegation of traversable facts sufficient for the court to determine whether a cause for intervention or a defense is stated.

Wholesale charges of wrongdoing, general allegations of fraud and collusion, without disclosing the.facts on which they are based, are insufficient. But counsel in his brief states that, \u201cif the facts alleged by the objectors, supported by the affidavit of Mr. Stallo, be proved, then the sale of certain stocks to the St. Louis &amp; Francisco Railroad was a fraud upon the-rights of the objectors.\u201d The converse of this proposition must also be true, to wit: If the facts alleged'by the objectors, supported by the affidavit of Mr. Stallo, be not proved, then the sale of the stocks referred to was not a fraud upon the rights of tire objectors. Fraud justifying relief in equity must be strictly proved. Rice v. Wilson, supra. There are at least three witnesses who, in their affidavits, contradict Stallo\u2019s statements, and declare them to be untrue. The evidence of these witnesses destroy the probative force of said Stallo\u2019s evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\"><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> The reorganization committee represents only the depositing bondholders, and is not the same party as the complainant trustee, representing all the bondholders. In the case of Investment Registry v. Chicago &amp; M E. R. Co., the court in the course of its opinion said that, \u201cwhen a nondepositing bondholder objects to confirmation solely oh the ground that the reorganization' committee\u2019s bid * * * was substantially short of the fair value, the answer is that his co-owners of the common mortgage and the common decree offered him the opportunity to deposit his bonds and to share equally with-them the benefits of the purchase.\u201d In the concurring opinion of Judge Seaman in the same case, he said: \u201cI believe it to be well recognized that reorganizations on the part of bondholders are needful and legitimate means for the purpose of purchasing the mortgaged property a.t foreclosure sales; that no bondholder can be brought into such reorganization without his consent; that bonds may be purchased of a nonassenting bondholder for the purpose-of foreclosing Ids objections or attempts to interfere with the reorganization-plans ; that equality in prices so paid is not, generally speaking, an essential requirement in such transaction; and that suppression of competition, either for reorganization or for the purposes of the sale, which may arise in such purchases or arrangements, neither disqualifies the purchasers to become bidders at the sale, nor per se invalidates the sale. Accordingly, in judicial sales of railroad properties these several elements are frequently involved, resulting in a single bid much below the estimated actual value of the properties, and the sale thereupon may rightly be confirmed by the court.\u201d 212 Fed. 594, 613, 129 C.

In addition to what I have already said in reference to the same, I will quote the language of Judge Hough of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, who said: \u201cI do not think that courts sit- to redraw, or move, or make suggestions, concerning such voluntary business arrangements as organization plans. * * * It is certainly a curious conception of practice which leads a small body of shareholders to seek to answer a foreclosure bill merely because they are dissatisfied with what the foreclosing complainant says it intends to do after the final decree is procured.\u201d Conley v.
