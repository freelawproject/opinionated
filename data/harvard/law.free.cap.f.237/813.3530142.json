The action was brought to recover damages for injuries received by reason of the alleged negligence of the defendant, who is a member of the firm of Arbuckle Bros., which firm employed the plaintiff. The accident occurred by reason of the falling of a hatch cover on the steamship Paloma of the Munson Dine while at the Ar-buckle -dock.

The plaintiff sues a member of the firm of Arbuckle Bros, for injuries sustained by reason of their alleged negligence while he was engaged, as the Arbuckles\u2019 servant, in unloading a cargo of their sugar from the Mun-son Dine steamship Paloma. It is alleged that while removing the hatch covers one of them gave way and the plaintiff was thrown into the hold and received the injuries complained of. It is not pretended that the defendant had any interest in the ship or authority over it or in the construction of the hatch or the removal of the cover. The plaintiff was .there as the servant of Arbuckle Bros, to unload their sugar. The defendant had no authority over the ship and is not responsible for its alleged faulty construction or dilapidated condition. He had nothing \"to do with the ship, its construction or its management. If a traveler gives his baggage check to his coachman with instructions to secure the trunk and deliver it at the owner\u2019s home and the coachman is injured by reason of a faulty construction of the baggage car, it seems too plain for argument that the traveler cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>be held liable. So in the present case Mr. Jamison is no more to blame for the injury than the bookkeeper in his office. If the defendant had been the charterer of the ship or charged with any duty regarding its construction, repairs or management, a different question might be presented. But we are unable to discover any duty which the defendant, as an individual or as a member of the firm of Arbuckle Bros., owed to the plaintiff or to any one else, to inspect the Munson Line\u2019s ships, their hatches, strongbacks or hatch cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The judgment is affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b826-5\">WARD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ASI\">(dissenting). The notice under the New York Employers\u2019 Liability Act (Consol. Laws, c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 200-204) in this case was fatally defective in not charging any negligence against the defendant (Rodzborski v. American Sugar Refining Co., 210 N. Y. 262, 104 N. E. 616), so that the plaintiff was left to his common-law rights. The defendant\u2019s firm was acting as stevedores in unloading the vessel and the plaintiff was employed by them in this work. The common law imposed upon them the duty of exercising ordinary and reasonable care to furnish the plaintiff a safe place in which to do the work. The hatch and also the hatch cqver which fell, resulting in injuries to the plaintiff, were in their custody and control for the purpose of the work they were doing. There was evidence that the place was unsafe and the employers were under the duty of exercising some care by inspection or otherwise in respect to it. Baltimore &amp; P. R. Co. v. Mackey, 157 U. S. 72, 15 Sup. Ct. 491, 39 L. Ed. 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">I think it was for the jury to say whether the defendant had exercised ordinary and reasonable care, and that therefore the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
