Thereafter .20 cars were shipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>before receipt of request, but delivered after defendant had requested that shipments be delayed, and the defendant, on August 29, 1911, repudiated the contract. This suit was thereupon instituted and the cause submitted to the court without a jury. By the special finding of facts made at defendant\u2019s request it appears that plaintiff, prior to such repudiation, had manufactured, and had taken and received, lumber theretofore bought by it from the'surrounding mills, until it had on hand, on and prior to August 29, 1911, 1,455,919 feet of lumber found by the court to comply with' the contract specification, and 903,600 feet of rejected lumber, in addition to the amount covered by the 32 and 20 car shipments\u2014or a total of 3,373,775 feet, besides certain Snyder lumber not inspected\u2014all of which, plaintiff claims, except 7,500 feet, was applicable on the contract. ~</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-4\">The court found as matter of fact that it was defendant\u2019s intention to sell the lumber in transit to avoid freight charges and handling expenses; that the lumber was shipped faster than defendant could-resell the same to its customers; and that some part of .the shipment of 32 cars became subject to demurrage and was by defendant reshipped to its Milwaukee yards, at an expense of several thousand dollars. The court further found that the 20 carloads rejected by the defendant were afterwards sold by the plaintiff, after using due diligence, for $2,351.97 less than the sum which should have been payable therefor under the contract, being $6.40 per thousand, on an average, less than the contract price, and that the lumber was up to grade; and that the remainder of the lumber was sold by the plaintiff between December 26, 1911, and July 18, 1912, at a heavy loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">The court further found that western pine shop lumber of the grade specified in the contract between plaintiff and defendant, had, during the months of August and September, 1911, particularly on August 29, 1911, an established market value; that the market price of each of the several grades of lumber mentioned in the contract during that time was $1.75 per M less than the price specified in the contract on each' such grade, and that the market prices remained the same as last above set forth up to July 1, 1912, increasing during the spring and summer of 1912; that western pine shop lumber such as that here in question should be manufactured during the months of March', April, May, June, and July of each year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">The total amount of lumber so manufactured and owned was largely in excess of the amount found by the court to be up to specifications on inspec-tion. As to this, it is the contention of plaintiff that the blue disfiguration which led to its rejection had arisen since its manufacture, by reason of the delay in disposing of the same. On the other hand, it is in evidence that that lumber was not up to the specification of the contract at the time it was manufactured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">The court'found as conclusions of law: (1) That defendant was estopped to deny the authority of McCauley to execute the contract in suit; (2) that said contract was void for want of certainty and mutuality as to all of the lumber for the season of 1911 owned by plaintiff, except the 32 carloads which were delivered and accepted, and dismissed the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-8\">Plaintiff assigns for error that the court held:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-9\">(1) The contract to be void for want of certainty and mutuality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-10\">(2) That defendant was ignorant of conditions as to volume of lumber which plaintiff could produce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-11\">(3) That certain of the lumber was not up to contract quality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-12\">(4) That said lumber was being shipped too rapidly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-13\">(5) That the difference between the contract price and the market price, when the lumber should have been taken, was only $1.75.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-14\">(6) That the lumber applicable on said contract, exclusive of the'52 cars shipped, was only 1,455,919 feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-15\">Other facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-16\">Fred C.

The District Court properly held that McCauley had authority to execute the contract. The sharp decline in the,price of lumber seems to have been the only excuse fox the suggestion. The correspondence appearing in the record, some of which we have recited, leaves no basis for this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\">The lumber was on hand, owned by plaintiff, at the time of the repudiation of the contract, and ready to be delivered. Defendant had accepted a part thereof which was shipped to it July 31, 1911. On August 5, 1911, defendant directed all shipments to be made to it at Minnesota Transfer until further notice. On August 9, 1911, objection was made by letter to drafts made on the Chicago office instead of the Milwaukee office. On the same day further directions were given by mail as to shipments. On August 14, 1911, defendant wired to discontinue shipments until instructed. Plaintiff replied that to stop shipments would be a great damage to it. On August 16, 1911, defendant notified plaintiff it should assume all collection charges. August. 16, 1911, defendant complained of the rush of cars of lumber, and renewed orders to stop shipments. On August 18th, further complaint was made on this score. Plaintiff replied to these requests that it did not receive notice in time, and that it had stopped, but complained that it would suffer injury therefrom. Then came a repudiation. It will be recalled that in the letter of January 6, 1911, the right to ship whenever ready was held out as an inducement, and the contract requires defendant to purchase, receive, and pay for the lumber so loaded. On September 8, 1911, defendant hints at the lack of authority of McCauley to execute the contract. We find in the record nothing to warrant the action of defendant in repudiating the contract. The plaintiff had this large amount of lumber on hand, and was anxious to avail itself of the opportunity to obtains cars before they would be required for grain shipment. So far as the record shows, it was in good.faith c\u00e1rrying out its part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> As to the defenses of uncertainty and want of mutuality, we are unable to concur in the decision of the trial court. The contract did not lack mutuality of obligation. While defendant promised to buy of plaintiff all the lumber of a certain quality that plaintiff might own during the season, plaintiff bound itself, if it did manufacture or acquire any such lumber, to sell all of it to defendant and to no one else. Thus plaintiff deprived itself of the right to sell lumber to whom it pleased. The promise to restrict its freedom by giving up its right to sell to others was real and definite. It was the substantial and contemplated consideration for defendant\u2019s promise to buy all that plaintiff might own during the season. There was the mutuality of obligation essential to a bilateral contract; there was the consideration essential to the validity of any contract. Conley Camera Co. v. Multiscope &amp; Film Co., 216 Fed. 892, 133 C. C. A. 96; Burgess Sulphite Fiber Co. v. Broomfield, 180 Mass. 283, 62 N. E. 367. That the plaintiff did not bind itself to acquire or manufacture any such lumber is, immaterial. Its promise to deal with defendant was the valid consideration for the obligation by defendant\u2014a consideration that made the undertaking of the other party binding and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> With regard to the question of uncertainty, a contract is void (save for the possibility of reformation in equity) because of uncertainty, only when it is so worded that the intention of the parties cannot be deduced therefrom. If the intention be clear, the mere uncertainty of the amount involved does not invalidate the obligation, however it may affect the possibility of proving damages for a breach. In the present case the preliminary negotiations demonstrate that defendant wanted to secure all such lumber that it could possibly obtain, without limit, and without binding plaintiff absolutely and under all circumstances to deliver any lumber. The parties had a right to make such a contract, even though the amount that would be deliverable thereunder was not specified, and was in a sense optional with the vendor; and this they did, in terms which are clear and certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The contract expresses without uncertainty the intention of obtaining all the lumber plaintiff might acquire and manufacture during that season. That plaintiff might take advantage of market conditions, and buy or refrain from buying heavily, was of the very essence of the agreement. Inasmuch as it gave a valuable consideration for this right, this case is distinguishable from Crane v. Crane, 105 Fed. 869, 45 C. C. A. 96; Tweedie Trading Co. v. Parlin &amp; Orendorff <em>Co., </em>204 Fed. 50, 122 C. C. A. 364; Oakland Motor Co. v. Indiana Automobile Co., 201 Fed. 499, 121 C. C. A. 319; and Velie Motor Car Co. v. Kopmeier Motor Car Co., 194. Fed. 324, 114 C. C. A. 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Moreover, there were definite limitations on the amount that could and must be tendered. While plaintiff had the option either to manufacture and to buy from others, or to refrain therefrom, it was absolutely obligated to sell all that it manufactured or owned during the season. When the contract was executed, the maximum amount that would be deliverable thereunder, while unknown to the parties, and ini that sense uncertain, was, under the finding of facts, the amount of specific grades of a definite kind of lumber that could be manufactured between March and July of the year 1911 either by plaintiff or others. So much thereof as plaintiff might own within a definitely limited time, the season of 1911,\u2022 was the amount that it had obligated itself to sell. This would necessarily have become certain during the season, even if the time limit for plaintiff\u2019s ownership included, not merely the manufacturing season, but also the short period thereafter within which delivery must be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">No claim, however, is made for any lumber not owned by plaintiff prior to defendant\u2019s repudiation of the obligation. The amount then owned, and as to which, by reason of plaintiff\u2019s ownership, both parties were bound, the one to sell, the other to buy, was necessarily certain, and the amount of lumber, in respect to which damages are claimed, was thus definitely.-fixed at the date of defendant\u2019s repudiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">We therefore conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to recover as its damages the loss it incurred from defendant\u2019s nonacceptance of the .20 carloads, and on account of the 1,455,919 feet on hand at time of repudiation of the contract. As to the 903,600 feet rejected as not grading up to contract, we conclude that the fact of its discoloration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>warranted the finding that it never was of the grade' deliverable under the contract, and that no damages are predicable thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">Plaintiff telegraphed defendant on September 18, 1911, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">\u201cRailroads insist upon disposition of the twenty cars immediately and unless you pay for them we will dispose of them to the best advantage possible, charging you with any loss in consequence and proceed to collect this loss from you through courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The 20 cars were shipped, as above stated, before plaintiff received notice not to ship, and were later delivered but rejected. In such case, the plaintiff might sell the 20 car lot and collect the loss from defendant, based on the difference between the'selling and contract prices. The court found that plaintiff, after due notice,' sold the 20 cars, and realized thereon $2,351.97 less than the contract price, and that plaintiff used due diligence in making the sale; and as to the 1,455,919 feet it found that, at the time of repudiation of the contract, its market price was $1.75 per M less than the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Giving to the findings of facts the weight properly accorded thereto, we find the recoverable loss 'to plaintiff through defendant\u2019s unjustified repudiation of the contract is, as to the 20 carloads, $2,351.97, with interest thereon at 6 per cent, per annum from August 29, 1911, and as to the 1,455,919 feet applicable on the contract, $1.75 per M, or $2,547.85, with interest thereon at same rate from November 17, 1914. The said sums, aggregating $4,899.82, together with interest as stated, under the facts as found, we find to be the amount for which the District Court should have ent\u00e9red judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded, with direction to the District Court to enter a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $4,899.82, together with interest as above stated to date of entry of judgment, and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
