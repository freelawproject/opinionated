McGown presented his exceptions and demurrers to the petition filed by the petitioning creditors, which exceptions were by the court overruled. - Whereupon petitioning creditors asked that the matter of adjudicating the Lamar-Wells Company a bankrupt be considered. This was done. Otis Malcolm, president of the Lamar-Wells Company, was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>courtroom at the time and heard the proceedings taken in the premises!
