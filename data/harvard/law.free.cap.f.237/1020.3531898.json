This fact renders unavailable many of the assignments of error which have been insisted 'on in argument. Our examination of the record in the light of the arguments and briefs has led us to the conclusion that it does not show that any reversible error was committed. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
