J. Langever filed his voluntary petition in bankruptcy, the record reveals he was the head of a family, residing in Ft. Worth, Tex. He possessed a diamond ring worth about $150, which he had long worn for ornament on a finger of his left hand. He claimed this ring as exempt to him. The trustee of the estate refused to set it off to him. The bankrupt excepted to the action of the trustee, and the referee overruled the exception and directed the delivery of the ring to the trustee. The question is now before me on certificate of the referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-13\">After considering the briefs of counsel, both for the claimant, the bankrupt, and the trustee, I am constrained to hold that the bankrupt is not entitled to have exempted to him and to retain possession of the diamond ring under any provisions of the exemption statutes of the state of Texas relating to and fixing exemptions to heads of families, or under any provisions of the common law applicable here. An order will therefore be entered,* approving and affirming the order heretofore entered herein by the referee. In event my engagements will permit, I reserve the right later to prepare and file an opinion-in this case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-14\">Chas. T.
