The bill was filed by Ethelbert A. Moore on letters patent, issued on April 23, 1907, No. 851,179, entitled <em>\u201cA </em>Machine for Bundling Scrap.\u201d The patent issued to David B. Marwick and another, and contained,- in all, 25 claims, of which only 4 were in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The first of these claims was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">\u201c1. A machine for bundling scrap, comprising a rotary mandrel, and a \u2018yoke\u2019 into which the mandrel passes, said \u2018yoke\u2019 serving to control the formation of the bundle and to compact the same upon the mandrel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The rest of the claims were in the same general terms, and we need not consider them further than to say that they fail to specifically deal with a combination of efficient elements, in such an original way as to justify a broad and sweeping construction. The pith of the decision of the District Court is in the following terms;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">\u201cThe claims in suit can be made to cover- the defendant\u2019s machine only by saying, as the plaintiff does say, that the ends, back and bottom of the defendant\u2019s housing form, together with the compacting roller, a \u2018yoke\u2019 into which the mandrel passes, serving to control the formation of the bundle and to compact the same <em>on the </em>mandrel, within the meaning <em>of </em>claim 1; or a device surrounding the mandrel, and co-operating therewith in the formation of the bundle, within the meaning of claim 9; or a \u2018yoke\u2019 supporting one end of th'e mandrel, whose inner wall serves to compact the bundle thereon, within the meaning of claim 15; or a \u2018yoke\u2019 into which the mandrel passes, within the meaning of claim 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">\u201cBut this is to make Marwick\u2019s patent cover all machines having rotating tapered shafts or mandrels for winding scrap into bundles, together with any means co-operating therewith, in any manner, to form the bundle, which can in any s\u00e9nse be said to \u2018surround\u2019 the mandrel, or into which the latter in any sense \u2018passes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">Then the opinion proceeds to say, in effect, that this would require, in order to justify a finding of infringement, a broader construction than can be believed warranted by the scope of any invention with which Marwick can be credited.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed, and the appellee recovers its costs of appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
