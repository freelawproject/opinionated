Orozco, the principal on the bail bond, died pending the suit, and upon suggestion of his death the court entered an order authorizing the plaintiff in error, Refugia C. De Orozco, to appear in the cause and make herself a party defendant, which she did. She was the widow of Pascual Orozco. The principal in .the bond, Pascual Orozco, was arrested on the 27th day of June, 1915, on a warrant issued upon a sworn complaint by George B. Oliver, who was the United States Commissioner at El Paso, on a charge of having conspired to violate the neutrality laws of the United States. Upon the same day, which was Sunday, he was brought before the commissioner and his bond was fixed at $7,500. On the same day he executed a bail bond in that sum, with the plaintiffs in error, other than Refugia F. De Orozco, as sureties, and secured his release thereby. The bond was conditioned to be void if the principal, who it recited was charged with a felony by complaint in writing and under oath before the United States commissioner for- the Western district of Texas, at El Paso, Tex., should personally appear before said commissioner at his office in El Paso at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning of the 1st day of July, 1915, and there remain from day to day and from time to time to answer said charge. The cause was continued verbally, and without affidavit being filed, and against the objection of the defendant, by the commissioner until July 12, 1915. On that day the principal, Orozco, failed to appear before the commissioner, as required, and his bondsmen failed to produce him, upon being called upon to do so. Thereupon a forfeiture was taken on the bond against the principal, Orozco, and his sureties. On July 12, 1915, suit was begun on the bond by the defendant in error against said Orozco and his sureties. Thereafter Orozco died, and his widow was made a party defendant to the suit. A jury was waived by written stipulation, and the cause was heard by the District Judge, who entered a judgment, on October 23, 1915, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>against all the then defendants for the amount of the penalty of the hond. All the defendants sued out a writ of error to thisi court. The plaintiff, upon the trial, introduced the complaint, the warrant, the return of the marshal thereon, and the bond shed upon. The plaintiff also Introduced in evidence a certified copy of the transcript from the proceedings of the commissioner upon the complaint, which recited the arrest of Huerta and Orozco, their arraignment before the commissioner, and plea of not guilty of the offense charged in it against them; the setting of the case for July 1, 1915, the fixing of the amount of Orozco\u2019s bond at $7,500; that on July 12th the case was called pursuant to continuance at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning; that, Orozco failing to appear, he and his sureties were called, and still failing to appear the bond was declared forfeited in the sum of $7,500. The oral evidence of George B. Oliver, the commissioner, was introduced to the effect that June 27, 1915, the day the bond was executed and approved, was Sunday; that the amount of the bond was fixed verbally, at the request of Orozco\u2019s attorney, and not during a session of court, at the office of the commissioner on Sunday; that the entries on the docket of the commissioner were written up on Monday morning ; that the case was continued on July 1,1915, on motion of the United States attorney and against the objection of Orozco\u2019s attorneys, till July 12th by him. It was stipulated into the record that Pascual Orozco, the principal on the bond, died September 1, 1915, in Culberson county, Tex., and before a grand jury was impaneled for that division, after his arrest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1023-4\">M.

The plaintiff in error assail the validity of- the judgment against them upon a number of grounds, which we will consider seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> 1. It is contended that the right to recover on the bond abated by the death of the principal before final judgment on the bond, and before he could have been indicted or tried for the felony charged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Section 1014, Revised Statutes, provides that, for any crime or offense against the United States, the offender may by certain named state or United States officers, and \u201cagreeably to the usual mode of process against offenders,in such state, be arrested and imprisoned or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United States as by law has cognizance of the offence.\u201d Section 500 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure .enumerates the causes which will exonerate a defendant and his sureties from liability upon a forfeiture taken. Death before\u2014but not after\u2014the forfeiture is taken is specified as one of them. The Texas procedure governs the federal courts in such matters pursuant to section 1014, Revised Statutes. United States v. Sauer (D. C.) 73 Fed. 671; United States v. Dunbar, 83 Fed. 151, 27 C. C. A. 488. In the case of United States v. Van Fossen, 28 Fed. Cas. 357, No. 16,607, the Circuit Court for the District of Kansas held, through Justice Miller and Circuit Judge Dillon, as a matter of general procedure, that it was a settled rule that death of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>principal after forfeiture, but before final judgment on the bond, did not relieve against the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> 2. It is contended that the bond is void because-not conditioned according to law.' Its condition was that the principal \u201cshall appear before the said United States commissioner at his office in El Paso on July 1, 1915, and there remain from day to day and from time to time to- answer said charge.\u201d Article 293, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the defendant \u201cshall in the meanwhile be detained in the custody of the sheriff or other duly authorized officer, unless he give bail to be present from day to day before the magistrate until the examination is concluded.\u201d The difference is one rather of words than legal effect. W~e think the condition was substantially as required by law. Certainly it is not the basis of such a plain error as this court would notice, when not made the ground of objection in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> 3. It is contended the continuance of the case from July 1st until July 12th, was unauthorized, because (1) made verbally by the commissioner, and not entered on his docket, and (2) made against the objection of the defendant and without the support of an affidavit as to the existence and contents of absent evidence, as required by article 205 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Article 293 of the same Code authorized the committing magistrate to- postpone for a reasonable time the examination. Continuances are discretionary, and the failure, to require the affidavit as to the nature of the .absent testimony could not authorize the defendant to decline to appear at the postponed hearing or release his bond, if he did so. The failure to enter the continuance on the docket could have no such effect. If the defendant was notified of the time' and place at which he was expected to appear, it was his duty to do so, despite such irregularities. Plis failure to appear would work a forfeiture of his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> 4. It is contended that the .sworn complaint, on which the warrant issued, failed to charge the defendant with an offense under the laws of the United States. The complaint charges Orozco and others with having conspired \u201cto begin, and set on foot and provide and prepare the means for a military expedition to be carried on from the territory and jurisdiction of the United States against the territory and dominions of the United States of Mexico, with whom the United States of America are at peace,\u201d and charges the purchase and shipment to and storage at a warehouse at Fifth and Santa F\u00e9 streets of military supplies as the overt act. The contention is that the preparation of such .a military expedition was not a violation of section 13 of the Penal Code, because the government of Carranza had not been recognized at that time as the legitimate government of Mexico. We think the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of The Three Friends, 166 U. S. 1, 17 Sup. Ct. 495, 41 L. Ed. 897, shows that neither prior recognition of legitimacy or of belligerency of the government or faction against which the expedition is directed, by this government, is necessary to make applicable the provisions of section 13 to such an expedition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> It is also contended that the overt act is not shown by' the complaint to have been done within the jurisdiction of the District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint fails to allege the name of the city where the supplies were shipped and stored.' The jurisdiction of the court may be determined by the place of the formation of the conspiracy, as well as that of the commission of the overt act. Th\u201ce complaint alleges the formation of the conspiracy to have been at El Paso, in the Western district of Texas. This was sufficient. Dealy v. United States, 152 U. S. 539, 14 Sup. Ct. 680, 38 L. Ed. 545; Hyde v. Shine, 199 U. S. 62, 25 Sup. Ct. 760, 50 L. Ed. 90. We do not think that the complaint showed on its face that no .offense of which the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Texas had jurisdiction had been committed, as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> 5. The fact that the amount of the bond was fixed and the bond executed and approved on Sunday does not make it invalid. In 37 Cyc. 581, the text reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that a bail bond or recognizance entered into on Sunday, for the purpose of releasing a person held in custody, is valid, the entering into such bond being considered as an act of necessity and charity and not judicial business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">This is the holding in Texas, whose decisions this court would follow, pursuant to the direction of section 1014, Revised Statutes. Ex parte Millsap, 39 Tex. Cr. R. 93, 45 S. W. 20; Lindsay v. State, 39 Tex. Cr. R. 468, 46 S. W. 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">The foregoing are the objections offered to the judgment on the bond by all the plaintiffs in error, none of which we think should avail to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> The judgment against the plaintiff in error, Refugia E. De Orozco, is in a different attitude. She did not execute the bond, either as principal or surety. Nor was she the legal representative of her deceased husband, who was the principal on the bond. She was therefore under no liability to the plaintiff for the breach of the bond, and no judgment could have rendered against her individually, based upon its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">The judgment against Refugia F. De Orozco will be reversed, and the^ cause as to her remanded, with directions that the suit as to her be dismissed. The judgment as to the other plaintiffs in error is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
