Worth Savings Bank &amp; Trust Company was a banking corporation within the meaning of the bankruptcy law of the United States (Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, \u00a7 4b, 30 Stat. 547 [Comp. St. 1913, \u00a7 9588]), and therefore not subject to be, adjudged a bankrupt. We have examined the record and evidence, and conclude that this finding was correct. The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
