Reg. 28,360 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">After the ITA published the Final Results for the second administrative review of imports of antifriction bearings from various countries, the ITA disclosed its calculations of the dumping margins to interested parties who requested access. After disclosure, the ITA accepted comments on alleged ministerial errors contained in the Final Results pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(f) (1988) and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.28 (1992). ITA analyzed the comments it received on alleged ministerial errors and determined which allegations were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-18\">ITA was able to publish amended final results correcting the ministerial errors it had found only for certain countries, companies and products. <em>Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom; Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, </em>57 Fed. Reg. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>32,969 (1992). ITA was unable to publish corrected final results for the errors now at issue before this Court because Federal-Mogul Corporation (\u201cFederal-Mogul\u201d), NTN Bearing Corporation of America, NTN Bearing Manufacturing Corporation and NTN Corporation, Nippon Pillow Block Sales Co., Ltd. and FYH Bearing Units USA, Inc. each filed a summons with this Court invoking this Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction before the errors could be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">Therefore, on September 1,1992, defendant filed a motion askingthis Court to grant defendant leave to correct certain ministerial errors and issue amended final results in these actions. <em>Defendant\u2019s Motion for Leave to Correct Ministerial Errors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">SKF USA Inc., SKF France S.A., SKF GmbH, SKF Industrie, S.p.A., SKF (U.K.) Limited and SKF Sverige, AB, NSK Ltd. and NSK Corporation, Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Corporation of U.S.A., Inoue Jikuuke Kogyo Co., Ltd. and Caterpillar Inc. support defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Response of SKF USA Inc., SKF France S.A., SKF GmbH, SKF In-dustrie, S.p.A., SKF (U.K.) Limited and SKF Sverige, AB, in Support of Defendant\u2019s Motion for Leave to Correct Ministerial Errors; Plaintiffs\u2019 (NSK) Reply Memorandum in Support of Defendant\u2019s Motion for Leave to Correct Ministerial Errors; Plaintiffs\u2019 (Koyo) Response to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Leave to Correct Ministerial Errors; Plaintiff\u2019s (Inoue Jikuuke Kogyo Co., Ltd.)

Specifically, the alleged error is the inadvertent omission of home market inventory carrying costs from the pool of home market indirect selling expenses subject to the ESP offset in cases where US price was compared to constructed value. <em>Response ofDefendant-Intervenorand Plaintiff, FAG, in Support of Government\u2019s Motion for Leave to Correct Ministerial Errors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Federal-Mogul and The Torrington Company (\u201cTorrington\u201d) oppose the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Federal-Mogul Corporation\u2019s Response to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Leave to Correct Ministerial Errors (\u201cFederal-Mogul\u2019s Response\u201d)-, Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Leave to Correct Ministerial Errors (\u201cTorrington\u2019s Opposition\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>ITA specifically requests leave to correct the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">I.

Supp. 819 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">Congress provided the ITA with authority to correct ministerial errors in the final results of administrative reviews in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(f) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-13\">The administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section. Such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors. As used in this subsection, the term \u201cministerial error\u201d includes errors in addition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical errors re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>suiting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Congress explained its rationale for granting the ITA authority to correct ministerial errors after the publication of final results in administrative reviews, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-5\">It has come to the Committee\u2019s attention that certain final determinations contain clerical and other errors which are not corrected, under current procedures, unless the parties to the proceedings resort to judicial review of the final determination. <em>The result is expensive litigation that unnecessarily burdens the court system, in order to correct essentially unintended errors. </em>Therefore, the Committee has adopted this provision to allow for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a limited time period after their issuance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">H.R. Rep. 100-40,100th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, at 144 (1987) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">ITA has promulgated regulations to implement Congress\u2019 mandate to correct ministerial errors which state in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-8\">\u00a7 353.28 Procedures for the correction of ministerial errors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-9\">(a) <em>In general. </em>The Secretary will disclose the calculations performed in * * * a final results of an administrative review of an an-tidumping duty order pursuant to \u00a7 353.22, to any party to the proceeding making a request in accordance with this section. A party to the proceeding must file such a request in writing with the Secretary within five business days of the date of publication of the relevant * * * final results of administrative review. A party to whom the Secretary has disclosed final calculations may submit comments concerning any ministerial errors in such calculations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-10\">(b) <em>Time limits. </em>Comments must be filed within five business days after the date of disclosure* * *. Interested parties may file replies to any comments submitted under paragraph (a) of this section. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-11\">(c) <em>Corrections. </em>The Secretary will analyze any comments received and, if appropriate, correct any ministerial errors by amending the * * * final results of administrative review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">However, the filing of a summons with this court challenging the final results of an administrative review vests this court with exclusive jurisdiction over the challenged administrative review. <em>Zenith Elecs. Corp. v. United States, </em>884 F.2d 556, 561 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Therefore, when a party, as here, files a summons challenging the final results of an administrative review before the ITA has an opportunity to correct ministerial errors in those final results, the ITA must obtain this courts permission to make such corrections and to publish amended final results. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>In this action, the ITA has followed its procedures for correcting ministerial errors by disclosing its calculations to all interested parties who requested access, accepting comments on alleged ministerial errors and analyzing these comments to determine what, if any, ministerial errors exist. The Court believes that the necessary corrections have already been prepared and ITA only needs this Court\u2019s permission to implement them and publish amended final results for the administrative reviews challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Federal-Mogul argues that the ITA has not sufficiently described the alleged ministerial errors or explained exactly how the ITA proposes to fix those errors. Federal-Mogul also argues that it was not provided sufficient time, pursuant to the ITA\u2019s regulations, to thoroughly analyze these Final Results for possible ministerial errors. As a result, the ITA\u2019s current motion may be one-sided. Finally, Federal-Mogul argues that the parties do not currently have access to the business proprietary version of the administrative record and so cannot fully respond to the ITA\u2019s motion. <em>Federal-Mogul\u2019s Response </em>at 2-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Torrington agrees with Federal-Mogul\u2019s arguments. <em>Torrington\u2019s Opposition </em>at 2-3. Further, Torrington disagrees with the ITA that each of the alleged ministerial errors cited by the ITA for correction are in fact ministerial errors. <em>Id. </em>at 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Federal-Mogul and Torrington\u2019s arguments miss the point. The ITA\u2019s goal in conducting an administrative review is to calculate dumping margins as accurately as possible. Federal-Mogul and Torrington had a full opportunity to review and comment on any ministerial errors in the ITA\u2019s Final Results pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.28. If certain parties had not filed summonses so rapidly after the publication of the Final Results in these reviews, there is no doubt that the ITA would have proceeded to make the corrections which it is now seeking the Court\u2019s permission to make. There also seems to be little dispute that most of the corrections the ITA wishes to make are indeed ministerial errors which deserve correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">It is clear that time and effort will be saved if the subject of the judicial challenges now before this Court are what the ITA considers to be the true and accurate final results from the second administrative reviews. Also, allowing the corrections may eliminate many of the issues raised in many of the complaints which have been filed with this Court challenging these Final Results. Allowing all parties in these actions freedom to file amended pleadings to take into account any changes made in the Final Results will prevent prejudice to any party and expedite resolution of these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">As for FAG\u2019s request that this Court order the ITA to correct an alleged ministerial error regarding FAG Cuscinetti SpA\u2019s home market inventory carrying costs, which is not included in defendant\u2019s motion, the ITA is instructed to determine if the alleged error is in fact a ministerial error which should be corrected. If the ITA determines that this is a ministerial error which should be corrected, the ITA is instructed to cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>rect it. FAG has already raised this issue in its complaint and can maintain its challenge on this issue in any amended pleadings which FAG may file if the ITA determines that the alleged error should not be corrected. <em>See FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schafer KGaA v.
