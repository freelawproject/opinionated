GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Mark Rotella sued a group of doctors and their related business entities under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-68, for improperly conspiring to admit, treat, and retain him at Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion for reasons related to their own financial interests rather than the patient\u2019s psychiatric condition. The defendants moved for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. United States District Judge John McBryde granted all motions for summary judgment, finding that Rotella\u2019s RICO cause of action accrued when he discovered his injury more than four years before he brought this action. <em>See Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp; </em>Assocs., 483 U.S. 143, 156, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987) (holding that civil RICO claims are subject to a four-year statute of limitations). Rotella brought this appeal from the district court\u2019s ruling, arguing that, for limitations purposes, a RICO cause of action does not accrue until a plaintiff discovers both the injury <em>and </em>the pattern of racketeering activity. Having reviewed the briefs, the summary judgment evidence, and the district court\u2019s opinion, we find that Judge McBryde applied the correct rule of law and, therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">Last year, the Supreme Court acknowledged, but declined to resolve, the split among the circuits regarding whether a RICO cause of action accrues upon the discovery of the injury alone, or upon the discovery of both the injury <em>and </em>the pattern of racketeering activity. <em>Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 1984, 1989, 138 L.Ed.2d 373, 384 (1997). The Court struck down only the Third Circuit\u2019s approach, which required discovery of the last predicate act for accrual of a RICO cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 1988, 138 L.Ed.2d at 381. As such, <em>Klehr </em>does not dictate our choice be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tween the injury discovery rule and the injury-pattern discovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">As this circuit has not expressly endorsed either approach in a published opinion, we take this opportunity to join the First, Second, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in holding that a RICO cause of action accrues upon the discovery of the injury in question. <em>See Grimmett v. Brown, </em>75 F.3d 506, 511 (9th Cir.1996), <em>cert. dism\u2019d as improvidently granted, </em>519 U.S. 233, 117 S.Ct. 759, 136 L.Ed.2d 674 (1997); <em>McCool v. Strata Oil Co., </em>972 F.2d 1452, 1464-1465 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Rodriguez v. Banco Central, </em>917 F.2d 664, 665-666 (1st Cir.1990); <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, </em>859 F.2d 1096, 1102 (2d Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 1642, 1643, 104 L.Ed.2d 158 (1989); <em>Pocahontas Supreme Coal Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>828 F.2d 211, 220 (4th Cir.1987); <em>see also Riddell v. Riddell Washington Corp., </em>866 F.2d 1480, 1489-1490 (D.C.Cir.1989) (assuming, but not deciding, that injury discovery rule applies). We must so hold in order to remain consistent with several of our prior unpublished decisions. Furthermore, this approach is also consistent with our published precedent related to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We have recently adopted the injury discovery rule in a string of unpublished decisions. In <em>Schwertz v. Zimburean, </em>No. 96-11155, 121 F.3d 703 (5th Cir. July 25, 1997) and <em>Cain v. Lawlis, </em>No. 96-11238, 121 F.3d 704 (5th Cir. July 15, 1997), we affirmed the district court\u2019s application of the injury discovery rule. <em>Schwertz </em>relied on <em>Cain </em>and on another recent unpublished decision, <em>Mitchell v. Bolan, </em>No. 96-11168, 120 F.3d 266 (5th Cir.1997). <em>Cain </em>relied on <em>SchweHz </em>and also on <em>Mitchell. Mitchell, </em>in turn, affirmed a summary judgment on RICO claims for statute of limitation purposes \u201cfor essentially the reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum order.\u201d The district court in <em>Mitchell </em>expressly adopted the injury discovery rule. <em>Mitchell v. Bolan, </em>No. 4:95-CV-528-A (N.D.Tex. July 2, 1996) (McBryde, J.). Judge McBryde cited cases from the First, Second, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits, and noted that he was \u201cparticularly impressed\u201d with the reasoning employed by the First and Second Circuits in <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Bankers Trust. Mitchell, </em>No. 4:95-CV-528-A, slip op. at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Contrary to Rotella\u2019s argument, our holding today does not conflict with our decisions in <em>Daboub v. Gibbons, </em>42 F.3d 285 (5th Cir.1995) and <em>La Porte Const. Co. v. Bayshore Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>805 F.2d 1254 (5th Cir.1986). Although <em>La Porte </em>mentions accrual upon discovery of \u201cthe fraud,\u201d 805 F.2d at 1256, and <em>Daboub </em>speaks in terms of the defendant\u2019s conduct, 42 F.3d at 291, neither case mentions or even implies a requirement of discovery of a pattern of racketeering activity with regard to the accrual of a civil RICO cause of action. As such, these cases are fully consistent with our adoption of the injury discovery rule of accrual for civil RICO actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Accordingly, we hold that Judge McBryde applied the correct rule of accrual in granting summary judgment based on the expiration of the statute of limitations. In so holding, we place the Fifth Circuit on record as in line with the First, Second, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits\u2019 choice of the injury discovery rule of accrual for civil RICO causes of action. As such, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
