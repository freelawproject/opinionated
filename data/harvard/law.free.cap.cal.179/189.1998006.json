Lacey, for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b232-6\">MELVIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">Upon petition of his brother, Salvador Espinosa was adjudged incompetent, and George S. Gould, Jr., was appointed guardian of his person and estate. From the order and decree adjudging him incompetent Espinosa appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">There is neither a reporter\u2019s transcript nor a bill of exceptions on file, the record consisting of the clerk\u2019s transcript alone. In appellant\u2019s brief appears a purported \u201cStatement of the Case,\u201d which we must ignore except where it finds support in the clerk\u2019s transcript. Appellant makes three contentions in his brief. These are as follows: 1. The court failed to acquire jurisdiction of the matter. 2. There was no formal adjudication of incompetency. ' 3. The court abused its discretion in appointing Mr. Gould.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Under the first head appellant contends that service of the citation on February 23, 1918, did not give the court the right to hear the matter on the 28'th of the same month. Section 1763 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the alleged incompetent person must be given notice of the time and place of the hearing \u201cnot less than five days before\u201d the appointed time. Appellant\u2019s counsel assert the rule to be that where a statute requires an act to be done a given number of days <em>before </em>an event, the time must be reckoned by excluding the day of the act and the day of the event. Whatever may be the law in other jurisdictions it is settled in California adversely to appellant\u2019s contention. <em>(Cosgriff </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commrs., </em>151 Cal. 407, [91 Pac. 98].)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Appellant also denies the court\u2019s jurisdiction because of the alleged insufficiency of the citation to inform him of the contents of the petition. The citation'designated a time and place for appellant to appear before the court \u201cthen and there to show cause \u2019 \u2019 why Manuel Espinosa, or some other fit and proper person, should not be appointed guardian of his person and estate, according to the \u201cpetition on file.\u201d This was a sufficient compliance with section 1707 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that the citation shall contain \u201ca brief statement of the nature of the proceeding.\u201d But even if a more formal notice were required under our law, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>would be bound to hold that it had been given and that jurisdiction had been obtained for all purposes, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, because in the order appointing a guardian there is a recital that the matter \u201ccame on regularly to be heard.\u201d <em>(Estate of Schulmeyer, </em>171 Cal. 340, [153 Pac. 233].)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">There is no merit in the contention that the jurisdiction of the court depends upon compliance with the requirements of section 1747 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That section relates to guardians of minors. The law on'the subject of guardians of incompetent persons is set forth in section 1763 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. <em>(Matter of Coburn, </em>165 Cal. 202, [131 Pac. 352]; <em>Estate of Schulmeyer, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Appellant\u2019s theory that error was committed by the court in omitting to make formal findings is not correct. There is sufficient finding of the ultimate fact in the recital contained in the order appointing the guardian that \u201csaid Salvador Espinosa is an incompetent person as alleged in the petition and that the allegations of the petition are true.\u201d Authority last cited above isi conclusive upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">There is absolutely no support for the appellant\u2019s final\" assertion that the court abused discretion in the appointment of Mr. Gould instead of the petitioner, who was appellant\u2019s brother. In the absence of a transcript of the testimony and proceedings before the court, of course, there corvid be no successful attempt to establish abuse of discretion, because all intendments and\u2019 presumptions are in favor of the regularity and propriety of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The judgment and the order appointing a guardian are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Wilbur, J., and Angellotti, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
