Lindlaw, and as guardian <em>ad litem </em>and trustee of her infant son, John Robert Lindlaw. The writ is prayed for on the ground that the evidence does not justify the findings of fact or the order of award.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Substantially stated, the facts are these: John R. Lindlaw was employed as a waiter in a caf\u00e9 at Venice, California. On a September afternoon in 1917, one E. E. Rice, accompanied by his wife, entered the caf\u00e9. He was joined some little while later by his son. After the party had been served, Rice got into an altercation with one Sullivan, a waiter attending an adjoining table, during the course of which he threatened picturesquely to make Sullivan \u201cjump over the house tops,\u201d and drew a revolver. Sullivan grappled with Rice, as did the latter\u2019s son, and one Ealand, another waiter, called by Sullivan to help disarm Rice. Lindlaw, serving other tables in the caf\u00e9, started for the scene at this juncture, calling \u201cCome on, Brown,\u201d to yet another waiter. As Lindlaw approached the scuffle, the revolver, still in Rice\u2019s hand, was discharged, the bullet striking Lindlaw and killing him. Brown, following Lindlaw, caught him as he fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The paramount point, presented for review is whether or not Lindlaw, in starting for the scene of altercation, was performing a duty incident to his employment as a waiter in the caf\u00e9. In a word, if it was incumbent on Lindlaw, as a part of his duties as a waiter in the caf\u00e9, to help keep order and suppress commotion, then he was killed in the performance of his duties and the award must stand; and it needed only to be shown that the hazard was one to which deceased was exposed by his employment to warrant the award. <em>(Western Indemnity Co. </em>v. Pillsbury, 170 Cal. 686, [151 Pac. 398].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>On this point the evidence seems crystal clear. One of the. owners of the caf\u00e9 testified that it was a part of the duties of Waiters in his employ to assist in keeping order, to quell disturbances, and eject unruly persons. It was also admitted to be a fact in the case that the employees in the caf\u00e9 had instructions to keep order. The waiter Brown testified, in effect, that relative to an altercation arising in the caf\u00e9 it was as' much the duty of the waiters as any other part of their waiters\u2019 business to go there and try to stop it as quickly as possible. Considered in connection with the testimony o\u00a3 the witness McFadden, identified with caf\u00e9 life for a period of twenty-five years, to the effect that the caf\u00e9 in question was what is known as a cabaret house, \u201ccatering to a class of people that are subject more or less to brawls and things of that kind that will cause trouble, and especially where there is dancing,\u201d and that this particular caf\u00e9 was \u201ca type of house that would be in trouble quicker than any average house at the beach,\u201d it follows that the.employer\u2019s business in the instant case was such as to expose his employees to the danger of bodily injury ensuing upon altercations by disorderly patrons. What Lindlaw\u2019s intentions were as he started toward the altercation must, of course, remain unknown, but it is obvious he was not intending to start the fight, since it was already started, and it is reasonable to assume, therefore, that he was intending only to,assist in stopping it, and that, as an employee of the caf\u00e9, it was his duty to assist in stopping it, seems from the uncontradicted evidence to admit of little doubt and less speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Petitioners \u2019 citations relied on in support of the petition for the writ are not sufficiently analogous in point of principle or of fact to warrant discussion, nor do they at all cover and control the situation presented here, namely, one in which an attendant is charged as part of his duties to quell or assist in quelling disturbances and to eject disorderly persons in a cabaret house where alcoholic liquors are sold and is injured in the course of a.brawl started by a disorderly patron.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It follows from what has been said that it does not appear as a matter of law that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant and sustain the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Melvin, J., Wilbur, J., Richards, J., <em>pro tem., </em>Shaw, J., and Angellotti, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
