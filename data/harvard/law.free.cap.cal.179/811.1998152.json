Warren. Petitioner failed to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>the highest number of votes for the Republican nomination, being defeated therefor by said Warren. He, however, received the highest number of votes for the nomination of the Democratic party, defeating said Warren therefor. He therefore claims to be the nominee of the Democratic party for such office and has demanded of respondent, Secretary of State, that he certify his name as that of the nominee of the Democratic party fob such office at the coming general election, and respondent, basing his action on provisions of our primary law, has refused to so certify, hence this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">What we have said as to the question presented by these facts in the matter of <em>Heney </em>v. <em>Jordan, ante, </em>p. 24, [175 Pac. 402], disposes of the claim of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">It is ordered- that the order to show cause be discharged and the proceeding dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
