The correctness of the decree depends upon whether or not, by the provisions of the third division of the will, the deceased intended to deal with the entire community property, or only with that portion thereof (one-half) over which he had the power of testamentary disposition. (Civ. Code, sec. 1402.) The provision in question reads as follows (italics ours) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">\u201cI hereby certify and declare that at the time of my marriage with my wife Erminia Peralta Dargie, I owned and <em>possessed </em>in my own right, property of the then value of about one hundred thousand dollars, and which said property is still owned and <em>possessed </em>by me, and is a part and portion of my estate, but that for the purpose of this my said will, <em>all of the property of which I am noto possessed </em>may be considered as community property, and I do hereby give, bequeath, devise, and <em>confirm </em>unto my said wife Erminia Peralta Dargie, <em>one-half of all the </em>property, real, personal or mixed, <em>of which I may die </em>seised or <em>possessed, </em>being the same portion thereof to which she would be <em>entitled </em>in the event of all of my said property being community property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">It will be observed that the decree stated that certain property was \u201cowned and possessed\u201d by him at the time of his marriage, and was still \u201cowned and possessed\u201d by him, but directs that such property and all other property \u201cpossessed\u201d by him be considered as community property. He then bequeaths and devises and <em>confirms </em>to his wife one-half of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>property \u201cpossessed\u201d by him at the time of his death. He evidently considered that the entire community was \u201cpossessed\u201d by -him, as it was, in fact, and deals with it as a whole. The deceased does not bequeath one-half of \u201cmy property,\u201d or of \u201cmy interest in the community property,\u201d or of the \u201cproperty over which I have testamentary power,\u201d but one-half of all the property \u201cpossessed\u201d by him. To make assurance doubly sure, he adds, \u201cbeing the same portion to which she would be <em>entitled </em>in the event of all of my property being community property\u201d\u2014not, be it observed, the same portion she would receive in the event that deceased left no will (three-fourths, there being no father or mother or brothers or sisters, secs. 1402, 1386, subd. 2, Civ. Code), but the portion of the community property she is \u201centitled to\u201d as of right, namely, one-half. (Civ. Code, sec. 1402.) During the lifetime of the husband, he is the owner and entitled to the possession of all the community property. Upon his death the surviving wife becomes entitled to one-half of the community property as the survivor of the marital community, regardless of the existence of other heirs or of a will, but the other half passes by will, or, in case of intestacy, by the laws of succession, to his heirs, including the surviving wife in certain eases. <em>(Dargie </em>v. Patterson, 176 Cal. 714, [169 Pac. 360].) One-half, then, is the \u201cportion\u201d of the community property, to which the widow is entitled, by virtue of its community character. That the testator was referring to this half of the property to which she is entitled of right is also further indicated by the use of the word \u201cconfirm\u201d in the following clause: \u201cI do hereby give, bequeath, devise' and <em>confirm </em>unto my said wife Erminia Peralta Dargie one-half of all the property ... of which I may die seised or possessed.\u201d It is true that the additional words, \u201cI do hereby give, bequeath and devise . . . unto my said wife,\u201d etc., import more than a mere recognition of the right over which the testator had no control. But the words are appropriate to the purpose of the testator, which was to \u201cgive, devise and bequeath\u201d to his wife one-half of all of Ms separate property, which, for convenience, he directed to be considered as a part of the community property. WMle it is true that the direction that the separate property should be treated as a part of the community property was, by implication, a devise and bequest to his wife of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>a one-half interest therein, it was more appropriate that this should be done, at it was, by express bequest and devise. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In the argument, counsel treat the will as, in effect, stating that decedent\u2019s separate property consisted of one hundred thousand dollars. If, however, at the time of his marriage, the deceased owned a hundred thousand dollars\u2019 worth of property, that property, with all the rents, issues, and profits thereof, continued to be his separate property. (Civ. Code, sec. 163.) The marriage occurred December 15, 1881. The will was drawn twenty-nine years thereafter (1910). The deceased died in 1911, at which time his estate was appraised at nine hundred and thirty-three thousand nine hundred dollars. It might be exceedingly difficult to determine what portion of the property left by him was derived from his separate property, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, and what portion, if any, constituted community property. It is quite conceivable that,1 if the source of all the property left by the deceased could have been ascertained, it would have been discovered that it was largely separate property. It is, therefore, evident from the will that the deceased intended to prevent the difficulty of ascertaining what portion of his property was community, and what portion separate property, and that he desired his wife to have one-half, and no more, of all the property left by him, whether community or separate property. The will is not susceptible of the construction that the testator was therein dealing with only his separate property and the one-half of the community property over which he had testamentary control, for he expressly provides to the contrary. The court was in error in allowing the surviving wife three-fourths of the property of the deceased. She is entitled to one-half of the separate property of the deceased and to one-half of the community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Decree reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Shaw, J., Richards, J., <em>pro tem., </em>and Lorigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b463-8\">SLOSS, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AKo\">I concur in the judgment. The question is one of interpretation, simply, and I agree with Justice Wilbur\u2019s conclusion that a reading of all the provisions of the will discloses the testator\u2019s intent that the entire estate possessed by him in his lifetime should be regarded as community property, and that the widow should receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>only one-half of that entire estate. In other words, the testator in speaking of \u201cthe property, real, personal, or mixed of which I may die seised or possessed,\u201d had in mind the whole of the community property, and not merely the part of it which was subject to his power of testamentary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">It should, perhaps, be added that no member of the court, as I understand, is disposed to depart in the slightest degree from the familiar and well-settled rules governing the construction of wills made by married men possessed of community property. This court has consistently ruled that such a testator is presumed to know that his power of disposition by will does not extend to the surviving wife\u2019s half interest in the community property, and that the will is ordinarily to be read as covering, by its dispositions, only the property which the testator had the right to devise or bequeath, i e., his separate property and an undivided half of the community property. The gift to the widow of \u201chalf of my estate\u201d would, therefore, in the absence of words indicating a contrary intent, carry to her one-half of the estate subject to testamentary disposition, and she would take, in addition, one-half of the community property as survivor. A few citations will suffice. <em>(Beard </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>5 Cal. 252, [63 Am. Dec. 125]; <em>Estate of Silvey, </em>42 Cal. 210; <em>Estate of Smith, </em>108 Cal. 115, [40 Pac. 1037]; <em>Estate of Vogt, </em>154 Cal. 508, [98 Pac. 265]; <em>Estate of Prager, </em>166 Cal. 450, [137 Pac. 37].) In the present case, however, the wording of the will is such that the presumptions referred to cannot be applied without doing violence to the testator\u2019s declared intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Angellotti, C.
