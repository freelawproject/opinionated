We have determined that the appeal must be dismissed and the case remanded to the Fifth Judicial District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">\u00b62 This appeal arises out of a matter concerning grandparent-grandchild visitation. In August of 2010, the District Court entered an order for grandparent contact between Linda Larson and her granddaughter, M.M. The court\u2019s order was entered over the mother\u2019s objection. In that order, the court found that both of M.M.\u2019s parents were incarcerated and M.M. was currently under the guardianship of the Benjamins. The court found no evidence that the Benjamins were not currently able to care for M.M. It also found that it was in M.M.\u2019s best interest to have contact with Larson. The court ordered visitation between Larson and M.M., to take place at the Benjamins\u2019 home on the first, second, and fourth Saturday of every month.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">\u00b63 In November of 2010, Larson filed a petition for additional grandparent contact. The District Court held a hearing on that petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>on April 20, 2011. Larson\u2019s May 10, 2011 notice of appeal states this appeal is taken from \u201cthe final judgment entered in such action on the 20th day of April, 2011.\u201dNo written judgment or order disposing of the issues raised at the April 20 hearing appears in the District Court record. Larson has, however, filed a transcript of the April 20 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AQi\">\u00b64 The controlling statute is \u00a740-9-102, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">Grandparent-grandchild contact. (1) Except as provided in subsection (7), the district court may grant to a grandparent of a child reasonable rights to contact with the child, including but not limited to rights regarding a child who is the subject of, or as to whom a disposition has been made during, an administrative or court proceeding under Title 41 or this title. The department of public health and human services must be given notice of a petition for grandparent-grandchild contact regarding a child who is the subject of, or as to whom a disposition has been made during, an administrative or court proceeding under Title 41 or this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">(2) Before a court may grant a petition brought pursuant to this section for grandparent-grandchild contact over the objection of a parent whose parental rights have not been terminated, the court shall make a determination as to whether the objecting parent is a fit parent. A determination of fitness and granting of the petition may be made only after a hearing, upon notice as determined by the court. Fitness must be determined on the basis of whether the parent adequately cares for the parent\u2019s child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">(3) Grandparent-grandchild contact may be granted over the objection of a parent determined by the court pursuant to subsection (2) to be unfit only if the court also determines by clear and convincing evidence that the contact is in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">(4) Grandparent-grandchild contact granted under this section over the objections of a fit parent may be granted only upon a finding by the court, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that the contact with the grandparent would be in the best interest of the child and that the presumption in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes has been rebutted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">(5) A person may not petition the court under this section more often than once every 2 years unless there has been a significant change in the circumstances of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">(a) the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">(b) the child\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>(c) the child\u2019s grandparent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-3\">(6) The court may appoint an attorney to represent the interests of a child with respect to grandparent-grandchild contact when the interests are not adequately represented by the parties to the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">(7) This section does not apply if the child has been adopted by a person other than a stepparent or a grandparent. Grandparent-grandchild contact granted under this section terminates upon the adoption of the child by a person other than a stepparent or a grandparent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">(8) A determination pursuant to subsection (2) that a parent is unfit has no effect upon the rights of a parent, other than with regard to grandparent-grandchild contact if a petition pursuant to this section is granted, unless otherwise ordered by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b65 Larson raises three issues on appeal. Her first issue relates to a motion she filed before the April 20 hearing, asking the court to allow her expert witness to observe M.M. during her interactions with Larson during one of their weekend visits. In relation to this motion, Larson\u2019s counsel stated at the hearing that they wished to present expert testimony on \u201cwhat was appropriate at what age with the child in terms of visitation, and what the child would be able to handle and would not be able to handle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b66 During the April 20 hearing, the District Court hypothesized that, under \u00a740-9-102, MCA, if it found M.M.\u2019s mother fit, there would be no need for the expert testimony \u2018because mother\u2019s objection would trump.\u201d Neither party disputed that statement. At the end of the hearing, the court orally stated Larson had failed to establish that M.M.\u2019s mother was unfit. However, the court never expressly ruled on Larson\u2019s motion to present expert testimony. Nor did the court address \u00a740-9-102(4), MCA, which allows grandparent contact even over the objection of a fit parent, if clear and convincing evidence supports findings that contact with the grandparent would be in the child\u2019s best interests and that the presumption in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes has been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u00b67 The second issue Larson raises on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it found the incarcerated parents were fit. In a lengthy, self-described attempt at the April 20 hearing \u2018to think through this as I\u2019m discussing it with you,\u2019\u2019the District Court reasoned that M.M.\u2019s parents, although not in a position to provide for her hands-on care, had made arrangements to provide care for her through the Benjamins. Although the court stated at one point that \u201cthe proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>order for the Court to issue here, that grandmother\u2019s motion to ... find mother unfit must fail,\u201d our review of the record does not reveal an express finding by the District Court that M.M.\u2019s parents are fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b68 The third issue on appeal is whether the District Court was prohibited by res judicata from rescinding its previous order granting visitation to Larson. The parties disagree as to whether the court did, in fact, rescind its prior order for grandparent contact, and the record presents good cause for confusion on that point. At one point during the April 20 hearing, the court stated grandparent visitation \u201cshould be reasonable\u201d and \u2018I\u2019m hopeful that the parties can then work out something that would be reasonable without a specific order on a date and time schedule.\u201d While it appears no change was made, the District Court\u2019s oral statements at the hearing were meandering, at best, as to whether the court was altering the status quo as to visitation between Larson and M.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b69  In summary, this Court is left with a record that is impossible to properly review as to all three issues raised on appeal. Not only does the District Court\u2019s practice of neglecting to file written findings of fact and a written order render appellate review impossible, but the parties clearly are left without the ability to discern and thereby enforce or comply with such \u201corders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b610 IT IS ORDERED that this appeal is DISMISSED and this matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order. On remand, the District Court is directed to enter written findings, conclusions, and an order addressing the issues raised by Larson\u2019s petition and at the April 20, 2011 hearing as necessary, following consideration of whether the provision of \u00a740-9-102(5), MCA-which addresses the filing of petitions under the statute more often than once every 2 years-applies to this particular petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AkV\">DATED this 30th day of December, 2011.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-7\">/s/ CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH</judges>\n<judges id=\"AoF\">/s/JUSTICE NELSON</judges>\n<judges id=\"AMF\">/s/JUSTICE BAKER</judges>\n<judges id=\"A3C\">/s/JUSTICE COTTER</judges>\n<judges id=\"AHa\">/s/JUSTICE MORRIS</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
