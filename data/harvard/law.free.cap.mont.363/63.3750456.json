We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether the District Court improperly imposed restitution for Dodson\u2019s felony criminal endangerment conviction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in imposing a 10-year sentence with all but 180 days suspended.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">\u00b65 Dodson crashed into a car driven by 17-year-old Suzanna Lackner (Suzanna) at approximately 4:35 a.m. on April 11, 2010, on Highway 93 near Missoula. A state trooper found several empty alcohol containers in Dodson\u2019s car. Dodson refused a breathalyzer test at the hospital. Extensive damage forced law enforcement to rescue Suzanna from her car. Suzanna shattered her ankle, among several injuries that she suffered. Dodson claimed he had no memory of what happened after 9:30 p.m. the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">\u00b66 The State of Montana (State) charged Dodson with felony criminal endangerment, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA, and negligent vehicular assault, resulting in bodily injury, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-205(1), MCA. Dodson entered a guilty plea to felony criminal endangerment and the State in turn dropped the other charge. The District Court committed Dodson to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for 10 years, with all but 180 days suspended. The court ordered Dodson to pay restitution of $2,800 for Suzanna\u2019s lost summer wages, $2,500 for Suzanna\u2019s father\u2019s lost wages, and $1,339 for unpaid medical expenses. The court based the restitution amount on the facts set forth in the presentence investigation report (PSI) and the testimony at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">\u00b67 The PSI contained a letter from Larry Lackner (Larry), Suzanna\u2019s father, in which Larry claimed lost wages and vacation time due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>injuries that Suzanna suffered in the collision. Larry explained that he had missed work and burned vacation days to transport Suzanna to medical appointments. Larry testified at the sentencing hearing that Suzanna, due to her injuries, could not find summer employment. Suzanna testified that she could not join the Air National Guard as she had planned. Suzanna\u2019s parents further testified that Dodson had failed to assist Suzanna after seeing her injured in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b68 We review for clear error findings of fact regarding the amount of restitution. <em>State v. O\u2019Connell, </em>2011 MT 242, \u00b6 7, 362 Mont. 171, 261 P.3d 1042. We find clear error if the findings are not supported by substantial evidence. Evidence is substantial if \u201ca reasonable mind might accept it as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>\u00b6 7. \u00b69 We review a criminal sentence for legality. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 37, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. We review a sentence for abuse of discretion only if an offender is ineligible for sentence review. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6 22, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017. An offender sentenced to less than one year of actual incarceration is ineligible for sentence review. Section 46-18-903(1), MCA. A court abuses its discretion if it acts \u201carbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Henson, </em>2010 MT 136, \u00b6 19, 356 Mont. 458, 235 P.3d 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court improperly imposed restitution for lost wages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b611 Dodson argues that the District Court improperly considered Suzanna\u2019s loss of summer wages in its restitution calculation. Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA, states that a district court\u2019s measure of a pecuniary loss includes what \u201ca person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender's criminal activities..\u201d Loss of income constitutes an appropriate element of a pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. \u00b612 A court may use \u201c\u2018reasonable methods based on the best evidence available under the circumstances\u2019 \u201d to calculate uncertain losses. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 29, 310 Mont. 449, 51 P.3d 495). These methods can include a \u201c \u2018reasonably close estimate of the loss.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Benoit, </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting <em>Hostetter v. Donlan, </em>221 Mont. 380, 383, 719 P.2d 1243, 1245 (1986)). The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ordered that the PSI include documentation of the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. Dodson argues that the court acted speculatively in estimating the lost wages for Suzanna\u2019s summer employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b613 The Court has determined that \u201cspeculative calculations\u201d will not suffice to draw findings of facts to support an order of restitution. <em>State v. Coluccio, </em>2009 MT 273, \u00b6 45, 352 Mont. 122, 214 P.3d 1282. The victim\u2019s wife in <em>Coluccio </em>had calculated nearly $3 million as restitution for her deceased husband\u2019s lost wages. <em>Coluccio, </em>\u00b6 43. The wife could not explain at the sentencing hearing, however, how she had calculated the lost wages. <em>Coluccio, </em>\u00b6 45. The Court concluded that \u2018ta]ssumptions, ballpark figures from friends, and purely speculative calculations\u201d could not substantiate findings of fact regarding amounts of restitution owed. <em>Coluccio, </em>\u00b6 45. Larry\u2019s testimony at the sentencing hearing regarding Suzanna\u2019s lost wages differs.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b614  Larry explained his calculation based upon Suzanna earning minimum wage for a 40-hour workweek during the 10-week summer vacation. Dodson\u2019s claim of speculation relates more to whether Suzanna could have found a minimum wage job for the summer than to the amount that Suzanna would have earned at a job. Dodson failed, however, to present any contrary arguments regarding Suzanna\u2019s ability to find a minimum wage job. Dodson failed entirely to cross-examine Suzanna at the sentencing hearing regarding her ability to find a minimum wage job for the summer. He limited his cross-examination of Larry regarding Suzanna\u2019s lost wages to the question of whether Suzanna had a summer job to which she would have been returning. Dodson opted to forgo the opportunity to present a different estimate regarding the amount that Suzanna could earn or her likelihood of finding a minimum wage job for the summer. The statements within the PSI and the sentencing hearing testimony sufficiently support the amount of restitution. The District Court acted reasonably, based on the best evidence available, when it included Suzanna\u2019s lost potential summer earnings in its restitution calculation. \u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in imposing a 10-year sentence with all but 180 days suspended.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b616  The Court generally upholds a legal sentence if it falls within statutory limits. <em>State v. Habets, </em>2011 MT 275, \u00b6 13, 362 Mont. 406, 264 P.3d 1139. Section 45-5-207, MCA, lays out the criminal endangerment statute. The law provides that a person convicted of criminal endangerment \u201cshall be fined an amount not to exceed $50,000 or imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed 10 years, or both.\u201d Section 45-5-207(2), MCA. The District Court legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>imposed a 10-year DOC commitment with all but 180 days suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"ATJ\">\u00b617  Dodson argues that the District Court should not have considered the testimony at the sentencing hearing regarding Dodson\u2019s lack of apology to Suzanna before the hearing. A district court cannot punish a defendant for a lack of remorse if it implicates the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>State v. Morris, </em>2010 MT 259, \u00b6 22, 358 Mont. 307, 245 P.3d 512. The District Court did not list Dodson\u2019s lack of remorse as a reason for its sentence. The District Court instead cited Dodson\u2019s prior drunk-driving infractions. The court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Suzanna\u2019s family to testify regarding Dodson\u2019s failure to apologize when it did not rely on this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b618  Dodson further contends that he should have received a shorter sentence due to his status as a first-time felon. The District Court provided sufficient justification for the legal sentence as required by \u00a7 46-18-102(3)(b), MCA. Dodson had a prior record involving several drunk-driving infractions. The court considered properly Dodson\u2019s \u201cextensive driving record\u201d and \u201calcohol-related driving offenses\u201das the reason for the sentence. <em>State v. Gordon, </em>1999 MT 169, \u00b6 43, 295 Mont. 183, 983 P.2d 377. The court admittedly imposed the maximum length sentence allowed under the statute. Section 45-5-207, MCA. The court suspended over nine years of the DOC commitment. The District Court did not exceed the bounds of reason or act arbitrarily under these circumstances. <em>Henson, </em>\u00b6 19. \u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b89-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
