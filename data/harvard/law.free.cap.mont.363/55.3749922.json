On appeal, we consider whether the WCC properly applied retroactivity principles in formulating a definition of \u201cpaid in full.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">\u00b62 We begin by summarizing the protracted history of this matter. This opinion marks the Court\u2019s third decision since 2002, complementing several other cases that have outlined the parameters for retroactive application of new judicial decisions in workers\u2019 compensation cases. Flynn initially filed a petition in the WCC, alleging Respondent State Compensation Insurance Fund should pay a proportionate share of the attorney fees he incurred to recover social security disability benefits. <em>Flynn v. St. Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>2002 MT 279, \u00b6 1, 312 Mont. 410, 60 P.3d 397 (Flynn I). Applying the common fund doctrine, we held that if a claimant successfully recovers social security disability benefits, thereby allowing the workers\u2019 compensation insurer to offset benefits paid the claimant, the insurer must bear a proportionate share of the costs and attorney fees incurred by the claimant in pursuing the social security benefits. <em>Flynn I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>18.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b63 On remand, the WCC determined <em>Flynn I </em>applied retroactively and Flynn\u2019s attorney was entitled to common fund attorney fees from claimants who benefitted from the decision. <em>Flynn v. Mont. St. Fund, </em>2008 MT 394, \u00b6 7, 347 Mont. 146, 197 P.3d 1007 (Flynn II). Shortly thereafter, this Court decided <em>Schmill v. Liberty N.W. Ins. Corp., </em>2005 MT 144, \u00b6 28, 327 Mont. 293, 114 P.3d 204 (Schmill II), concluding that our decision in <em>Schmill v. Liberty N.W. Ins. Corp., </em>2003 MT 80, 315 Mont. 51, 67 P.3d 290 (Schmill I) applied retroactively. Relying on previous case law and reiterating the importance of finality, we held the retroactive effect of a decision \u201cdoes not apply to cases that became final or were settled prior to a decision\u2019s issuance.\u201d <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Dempsey v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 391, \u00b6 31, 325 Mont. 207, 104 P.3d 483). We left the determination of what is considered \u201cfinal or settled\u201d to the WCC. <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b64 Heeding this command, the WCC issued the <em>Flynn Order, </em>which was intended to be used as a general model for determining whether a claim is final or settled and the effect of retroactivity on each type of claim. <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9. In its order, the WCC defined a \u2018final\u201d claim as a \u201cclaim in which a final judgment has been entered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court only if the claim is not currently pending on appeal.\u201d <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 9. The WCC relied on \u00a7 39-71-107(7)(a), MCA (2005), to define \u201csettled\u201d as \u201ca department-approved or court-ordered compromise of benefits between a claimant and an insurer or a claim that was paid in full.\u201d <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b65 Shortly following the WCC\u2019s order, we decided Stavenjord <em>v. Mont. St. Fund, </em>2006 MT 257, 334 Mont. 117, 146 P.3d 724 (Stavenjord II). In <em>Stavenjord II, </em>we determined there is no \u2018legal authority for \u2018partial\u2019 retroactive application\u201d of a judicial decision and found that judicial decisions apply retroactively to \u201cany and all <em>open </em>claims . ...\u201d \u00b6 15 (emphasis in original). Moreover, we defined \u201copen claims\u201d as those \u201cstill actionable, in negotiation but not yet settled, now in litigation, or pending on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Stavenjord II, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b66 In <em>Flynn II, </em>we clarified several points arising from the intersection between the <em>Flynn Order </em>and <em>Stavenjord II </em>and the definition of \u201cfinal,\u201d \u201csettled,\u201d and \u201copen.\u201d First, the language of <em>Stavenjord II </em>discussing \u201copen claims\u201d did not change previous retroactivity rules or create new law. <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 21. Reaffirming prior case law, we confirmed that retroactivity principles apply to cases not \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201csettled.\u201d <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 21. We held a \u201csettled\u201d claim is \u201ca department-approved or court-ordered compromise of benefits between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>a claimant and an insurer or <em>a claim that was paid in full\u201d Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 26 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b67 The WCC subsequently requested briefing on the definition of \"paid in full.\u201d Or. Re: Paid in Full, <em>Flynn v. Mont. St. Fund, </em>2010 MTWCC 20, \u00b6 1 (July 1, 2010). After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the WCC defined \u201cpaid in full\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">A claim in which all benefits to which a claimant is entitled[,] pursuant to the statutes applicable to that claim, are paid prior to the issuance of a judicial decision. If any benefits are paid on the claim after the issuance of a judicial decision, the claim can no longer be considered \u201cpaid in full\u201d and is subject to retroactive application of the judicial decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Or. Re: Paid in Full, \u00b6 17. Thus, according to the WCC\u2019s Order, a \u201csettled\u201d claim for purposes of retroactivity is either (1) a department-approved or court-ordered settlement agreement or (2) a claim in which the claimant received all applicable benefits prior to a new judicial decision and has not received subsequent benefits on his or her pre-judicial decision claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b68 Flynn appealed, challenging the WCC\u2019s decision on the definition of \u201cpaid in full.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u00b69 \u2018We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness.\u201d <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the WCC properly applied retroactivity law in formulating a definition of \u2018paid in full.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">\u00b6 11 The general rule favors retroactive application of new rules of law. <em>Stavenjord II, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 29. We continue to recognize, however, that \"truly compelling\u201d cases merit application of a new rule prospectively only. <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 29. This Court\u2019s approach to retroactivity was thoroughly analyzed in <em>Dempsey. </em>There, we considered whether our decision in <em>Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 85, 315 Mont. 107, 67 P.3d 892, applied prospectively only, or applied retroactively to require payment of certain insurance coverages in qualifying circumstances to open claims arising before <em>Hardy </em>was issued. <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 3. In keeping with our prior rulings, we held the <em>Hardy </em>decision applied retroactively to cases pending on direct review or not yet final. <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 4. We concluded that \u201cthe retroactive effect of a decision does not apply <em>ab initio, </em>that is, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>not apply to cases that became final or were settled prior to a decision\u2019s issuance.\u201d <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b612 Citing <em>Dempsey, </em>we reiterated the importance of finality in <em>Flynn II. </em>We stated, \u201cthe interests of fairness and finality are not generally served by drawing \u2018an arbitrary distinction between litigants based merely on the timing of their claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b613  Here, we conclude the WCC properly applied retroactivity analysis in the unique field of workers\u2019 compensation law. The workers\u2019 compensation system is by nature open-ended; in some cases, benefits may continue for the life of a claimant, or a claimant may be eligible for new benefits upon aggravation of a prior injury. Sections 39-71-710, 39-71-739, MCA. Despite the potentially indefinite length of a party s claim, principles of finality still must be incorporated. As explained below, the WCC\u2019s decision properly gives credit to the necessary balance between finality and fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b614 In its order, the WCC recognized four types of claims that would be considered \u201copen\u201d and subject to retroactivity: (1) claims where the claimant was still receiving benefits at the time <em>Flynn I </em>was decided; (2) claims where the parties were still negotiating the amount of indemnity to be paid; (3) claims where settlement negotiations had broken down and the claim was subject to litigation or appeal at the time <em>Flynn I </em>was decided; and (4) claimants whose benefits may have terminated prior to the issuance of <em>Flynn I, </em>but received further benefits on their claim after the issuance of <em>Flynn I. </em>Or. Re: Paid in Full, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b615 Urging reversal, Flynn argues a claim is \u201cpaid in full\u201d only if the applicable statutory rules bar the disabled worker from seeking further benefits. Flynn\u2019s proposed definition fails in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">\u00b616 First, Flynn\u2019s position gives no independent meaning to \u201cpaid in full\u201d because he essentially argues the only claims truly \u201cpaid in full\u201d are those stemming from a settlement agreement. Flynn cites \u00a739-71-739, MCA, for the proposition no claim really can be \u201cpaid in full\u201d because though a claim may be \u2018temporarily dormant,\u201d a claimant later may receive benefits for aggravation of a disability. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">If aggravation, diminution, or termination of disability takes place or is discovered after the rate of compensation is established or compensation is terminated in any case where the maximum payments for disabilities as provided in this chapter are not reached, adjustments may be made to meet such changed conditions by increasing, diminishing, or terminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>compensation payments in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Section 39-71-739, MCA. Flynn\u2019s interpretation essentially nullifies the inclusion of the term \u201cpaid in full\u201d in \u00a739-71-107(7)(a), MCA (2005). We already have applied that section\u2019s definition of \u201csettled\u201d as \u201ca department-approved or court-ordered compromise of benefits between a claimant and an insurer <em>or </em>a claim that was paid in full.\u201d <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 26 (emphasis added). Flynn\u2019s position would simply omit the latter clause. The legislature purposely distinguished between claims resolved by settlement agreement and those that have been \u201cpaid in full.\u201d Defining \u201cpaid in full\u201d as a settlement agreement is redundant. We must construe statutes to give effect to all language contained therein and we cannot omit what has been inserted by the legislature. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Flynn\u2019s argument asks us to do the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"AWi\">\u00b617  Flynn argues the potential for a future benefit precludes any claim from being \u201cpaid in full\u201d if there has been no judgment or approved settlement. This argument fails because it ignores that a final judgment or settled claim can be re-opened in some circumstances. See M. R. Civ. P. 60; <em>Kruzich v. Old Republic Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 205, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47, 344 Mont. 126, 188 P.3d 983 (recognizing settlement agreements can be re-opened when there is a mutual mistake of fact). If we were to accept Flynn\u2019s argument, all \u201csettled\u201d cases or \u2018final\u201djudgments could be subject to retroactive application of new law merely because the potential existed for the claim to be reopened. The potential for future change does not impact the claim\u2019s finality. The WCC correctly observed, \u2018it is the <em>actual </em>payment of benefits, as opposed to the <em>potential </em>payment of benefits, that renders a claim no longer \u2018paid in full,\u2019 and subject to retroactive application of Flynn I.\u201d Or. Re: Paid in Full, \u00b6 9 (emphasis in original). Flynn\u2019s position would mean all claims, whether final, settled, or \u201cpaid in full\u201d would be subject to retroactive application merely because of the potential to be re-opened. This clearly deviates from the important principles of finality we discussed in <em>Dempsey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b618 We also reject the State Fund\u2019s position that the second sentence of the WCC\u2019s Order is invalid. State Fund argues that excluding from the definition of \u201cpaid in full\u201d those claims where benefits are paid after the issuance of a judicial decision creates uncertainty and a \u201cmonumental lack of necessary finality.\u201d State Fund contends the WCC\u2019s definition swallows the \u201cpaid in full\u201dexception to retroactivity. In reliance on <em>Dempsey, </em>State Fund contends \u201cfinality cannot be breached by subsequent events, but this is exactly what the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sentence of the WCC\u2019s conclusion allows.\u201dFurther, State Fund argues the fact a subsequent benefit could \u201cun-finalize\u201d a claim undermines finality principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b619  <em>InDempsey, </em>we specifically drewthe retroactivity line between claims that were final and those that were not. \u00b6 28. In the workers\u2019 compensation context, if compensation payments are adjusted upon aggravation of the original injury, the claim is not \u2018final.\u201d Section 39-71-739, MCA. State Fund would have us breathe new life into the arguments we rejected in <em>Flynn </em>//-that \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201csettled\u201d should include claims that were \u201cclosed\u201dor \u2018inactive\u201d! <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 30), or that judicial decisions can only apply retroactively to those claims that are \u201ccurrently in active litigation\u201d! <em>Flynn II, </em>\u00b6 19). Simply put, a case is not final if a benefit is later paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b620 As noted above, it is not the potential for a future benefit that makes a claim outside the scope of \u201cpaid in full.\u201d Rather, it is the actual payment of a benefit, following the issuance of a judicial decision, that results in a claim not being \u201cpaid in full.\u201dAt the moment the latter benefit is paid, it becomes clear the claim was not \u201cpaid in full.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b621 State Fund argues this qualification permits the claimant to control application of substantive law by seeking a benefit under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Flynn also refers to this possibility, noting the WCC\u2019s ruling gives disabled workers an incentive to obtain some type of benefit in order to trigger the retroactive application of <em>Flynn I, </em>and likewise creates an incentive for insurers to deny benefits. We decline to engage in speculation as to what might occur in the inventive minds of those inclined to thwart the law. The potential for fraudulent or wrongful behavior currently exists. Montana law addresses unreasonable denial of claims by an insurer, \u00a7\u00a739-71-611, 39-71-612(2), MCA; forfeiture of fees by an attorney who violates the workers\u2019 compensation statutes or rules, \u00a7 39-71-613(3), MCA; wrongful practices by health care providers, \u00a7 39-71-315; and fraudulent or deceptive claims for benefits, \u00a7\u00a739-71-316,39-71-613(4), 45-6-301(5), MCA; <em>Taylor v. St. Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>275 Mont. 432, 436, 913 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1996). The WCC\u2019s order does nothing to undermine the lawful filing and processing of workers\u2019 compensation claims. As acknowledged by Appellee Common Fund Insurers, the WCC\u2019s definition of \u201cpaid in full\u201d provides a pragmatic and workable solution to ensure the policy of finality has meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b622 Finally, we decline to consider the argument of Amicus that \u201cpaid in full\u201d only applies to expired medical claims under \u00a739-71-615, MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>This Court generally declines to address separate arguments raised by an amicus which are not raised by the parties. <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing <em>Dep\u2019t of Health v.
