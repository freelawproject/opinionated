We dismiss the City\u2019s appeal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-19\">\u00b62 On November 9, 2010, following a jury trial in City Court, Hall was sentenced on her conviction of charges of obstructing a peace officer, disorderly conduct, and assault with a bodily fluid. Hall timely appealed to the District Court for a jury trial de novo. At the conclusion of the City\u2019s case, out of the presence of the jury, the District Court Judge expressed her concern that the City had not presented sufficient evidence to meet its burden of proof. Defense counsel moved that the case be dismissed. The trial court entertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>oral argument on Hall\u2019s motion, and at the conclusion of the argument, the court granted Hall\u2019s motion to dismiss from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b63 The City timely appealed to this Court and filed its brief. Hall did not file a brief. Basically, the City argues that the prosecution did present sufficient evidence on each charge and that the case should not have been dismissed. The City discusses each charge and the evidence pertaining to that charge in arguing that the District Court erred. The City\u2019s argument is beside the point, however. Regardless of the merits of the City\u2019s analysis, and regardless of whether the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss the case was correct, the fact that the trial judge ordered the City\u2019s case dismissed for insufficient evidence is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b64 In <em>State v. Cool, </em>174 Mont. 99, 568 P.2d 567 (1977), we held that a dismissal of a criminal case based on insufficient evidence is an acquittal in substance as well as in form-whether the trial court was correct or not-and that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution bars retrial under double jeopardy principles. We ruled that the State has no appeal from such a decision under \u00a7 95-2403, R.C.M. (1947)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, the statute which allowed the State to appeal from a dismissal of a case. <em>Cool, </em>174 Mont. at 101-02, 567 P.2d at 568-69. We reaffirmed this decision in <em>State v. Greenwalt, </em>204 Mont. 196, 200-03, 663 P.2d 1178, 1180-82 (1983), and we recently referred to both <em>Cool </em>and <em>Greenwalt </em>in <em>State v. Finley, </em>2011 MT 89, \u00b6 24, 360 Mont. 173, 252 P.3d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b65 We held in <em>Finley, </em>however, that neither <em>Cool </em>nor <em>Greenwalt </em>applied to the facts in that case because the Double Jeopardy concerns found in <em>Cool </em>and <em>Greenwalt </em>were absent in <em>Finley </em>since the State\u2019s appeal did not subject Finley to retrial. We concluded in <em>Finley </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdJ\">the State is not precluded from appellate review when a district court, acting as an intermediate appellate court, sets aside a guilty verdict entered by a justice court of record. Should the State prevail, the tangible effect is reinstatement of the trier of fact\u2019s guilty verdict. Such circumstances do not subject defendants to impermissible retrial, further prosecution or double punishment for the same offense. Moreover, such an appeal comports with this Court\u2019s power and obligation to provide final appellate review of district court decisions when the district court has functioned as an intermediate appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing State <em>v. Seaman, </em>2005 MT 307, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 429, 124 P.3d 1137). Thus, the situation would be different in the case <em>sub judice </em>if the District Court was acting in an appellate capacity rather than as the trier of fact. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b66  In the instant case, inasmuch as the District Court dismissed the City\u2019s case against Hall for insufficient evidence, Hall stands acquitted and cannot be retried. Moreover, the City has no appeal from the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>Cool, </em>174 Mont. at 101-02, 567 P.2d at 568. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b67 IT IS ORDERED that the City\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b68 The Clerk of this Court is directed to provide a copy of this Opinion and Order to counsel of record and to the Hon. Laurie McKinnon, District Court Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">DATED this 31st day of January, 2012.</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-8\">/S/ JUSTICE JAMES C.
