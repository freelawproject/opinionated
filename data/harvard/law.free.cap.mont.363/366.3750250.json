We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b62 In June 2008, the Krutzfeldts and Pinnacle Bank entered a loan agreement in which the Bank agreed to lend the Krutzfeldts $5 million to develop a subdivision in Billings, Montana. Pinnacle Bank retained the Crowley Fleck law firm (\u2018Crowley\u201d) to represent it in connection with the transaction. In August 2009, Pinnacle Bank refused to disburse further funds under the loan, asserting the Krutzfeldts had not satisfied certain obligations under the agreement. In February 2010, the Krutzfeldts, represented by Don Harris, sued Pinnacle Bank alleging breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud. Crowley continued to represent Pinnacle Bank in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b63 In June 2010, Harris retained attorney Lance Hoskins of Brekke &amp; Hoskins, PLLC, to advise Harris and the Krutzfeldts on issues concerning liability, settlement, and tax ramifications of their case against the bank. Harris had retained Hoskins in a previous matter for advice on potential settlement and verdict options to prevent exposing Harris\u2019s clients to unnecessary tax liability. In the previous case, Hoskins drafted portions of the settlement agreement at the conclusion of the suit. Harris stated that Hoskins\u2019s involvement in that matter, while dormant for intermittent and lengthy periods, ultimately extended over several years of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b64 Prior to retaining Hoskins in the Krutzfeldts\u2019 suit, Harris informed Hoskins that Pinnacle Bank was represented in the litigation by Jeff Oven of Crowley. Harris provided Hoskins with the pleadings, motions and briefs that had been filed and also discussed with Hoskins his view of the Krutzfeldts\u2019 liability claims and Pinnacle Bank\u2019s defenses. Hoskins was not disclosed as an expert to Pinnacle Bank or Crowley. On July 13, 2010, Hoskins sent Harris an e-mail that addressed liability issues and indicated Hoskins had conducted some preliminary research on the tax issues. Hoskins stated, <em>\u201cL </em>have some theories that may have some merit after further research. I hate to scorch the earth yet. Let\u2019s talk via phone or in person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b65 On July 19,2010, Harris and Mr. Krutzfeldt met with Hoskins and discussed the liability claims, defenses, damages, settlement options, and the results of Hoskins\u2019s initial tax research. Both Harris and Mr. Krutzfeldt understood that Hoskins would provide assistance as needed, such as drafting appropriate language for a settlement or verdict form. Harris advised Hoskins the trial date was set for February 28, 2011, and a settlement conference would take place in late 2010 or early 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u00b66 On July 21,2010, Hoskins sent Harris an engagement letter which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>set forth the terms of Hoskins\u2019s work. The document appeared to be a standard engagement form and indicated the continuing nature of Hoskins\u2019s involvement in this matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A02\">Thank you for asking Brekke &amp; Hoskins PLLC (the \u2018Firm\u201d) to represent and advise your firm regarding income tax issues for Butch Krutzfeldt discussed below. Because clear and timely communication is important for serving clients well, we want to begin by stating certain mutual understandings about our services and charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">Services. Our engagement is to assist your firm in reviewing income tax issues related to Butch Krutzfeldt\u2019s lawsuit against Pinnacle Bank and for such other matters as are agreed to in the future....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">Completing Our Services. We intend and expect to complete our services to your satisfaction. However, we will withdraw from representation if so requested by you. We <em>may also withdraw </em>if our fees are not paid timely <em>or for a reason required or permitted by professional rules. </em>At the conclusion of representation you may have on request a copy of any client files or papers, for which we would charge a reasonable copying cost. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">We appreciate the opportunity to be of service. If you have any questions about our services, or the fee and billing arrangements, please contact me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The engagement letter did not state Hoskins\u2019s representation had concluded with the meeting held days earlier. Although not offered into evidence, the parties agreed the letter was sent with a bill of $2,375.00 for Hoskins\u2019s services thus far in the Krutzfeldt case. Both parties acknowledged the document did not say \u2018final bill\u201d or otherwise indicate Hoskins had completed his services in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u00b67 On December 20, 2010, the parties conducted a settlement conference. Harris called Hoskins more than once the week before the conference and left a message informing Hoskins his help would be necessary if the parties neared resolution of the lawsuit. Hoskins did not return the call. The case did not settle and his expertise was not required at that juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\u00b68 On January 5, 2011, Harris received a \u2018Dear Client\u201d letter from Brekke &amp; Hoskins announcing that the two partners had joined Crowley effective January 1, 2011. The letter stated, Tw]e feel we will be more responsive and efficient to your needs and the ever changing tax and regulatory world by utilizing the resources that Crowley Fleck has to offer.\u201d Hoskins had not mentioned to Harris and the Krutzfeldts his plans to take the position with Crowley, nor did he take any steps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>formally to terminate his representation pursuant to M. R. Pro. C. 1.16.</p>\n<p id=\"AG7E\">\u00b69 Upon receiving the letter, Harris called Crowley to inform Oven of the conflict. On January 7, 2011, at 3:16 p.m., Harris sent Oven an email stating the conflict could not and would not be consented to or waived, and Crowley thus would need to withdraw as counsel for Pinnacle Bank. Harris asked Oven to notify him if Crowley voluntarily would withdraw, or if Harris would need to file a Motion to Disqualify. Crowley responded by letter that same day, stating, \u2018tp]ursuant to Rule 1.10(c), we have established an ethical screen\u201d to prevent both Hoskins and Brekke from having any involvement in the Krutzfeldt case or receiving any fee earned by the firm in that matter. The letter enclosed an e-mail Crowley sent to its employees on January 7, 2011, at 4:23 p.m., informing them of the screen and directing that \u201call staff, lawyers, and other employees of the firm are prohibited from discussing this matter\u201d with either Brekke or Hoskins.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b610 On January 14,2011, the Krutzfeldts moved to disqualify Crowley from representing Pinnacle Bank in this case. The Krutzfeldts followed with a motion seeking to permanently enjoin Crowley from proceeding in the litigation. Crowley opposed the motion on the ground that, when Brekke and Hoskins moved to Crowley on January 1, 2011, all of their clients, including the Krutzfeldts, became \u2018former clients\u201d governed by M. R. Pro. C. 1.9. The trial court heard argument on the matter and subsequently denied the Krutzfeldts\u2019 motion to disqualify and for an injunction. In its order, the District Court noted, \u2018tajlthough Mr. Harris may have subjectively felt that Mr. Hoskins was retained throughout the entire litigation, there was no written agreement between the parties to support this position.\u201dThe court concluded the attorney-client relationship between Hoskins and the Krutzfeldts ended in July 2010, following submission of Hoskins\u2019 s bill. The District Court reasoned that, because the Krutzfeldts were former clients before Hoskins joined Crowley, the ethical screen was sufficient to allow Crowley to continue to represent Pinnacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b611 Following receipt of the court\u2019s order, the Krutzfeldts renewed their Motion for Permanent Injunction and included a copy of the engagement letter, which had not previously been supplied to the District Court. In their brief to this Court, the Krutzfeldts stated they did not initially submit the engagement letter to the trial court because it was not relevant to Pinnacle Bank\u2019s argument that the Krutzfeldts became former clients as of January 1, 2011, when Hoskins joined Crowley.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b612 On April 7, 2011, the District Court entered a nunc pro tunc order again denying the Krutzfeldts\u2019 motion. The court did not mention the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>engagement letter in its second order. The Krutzfeldts appeal the court\u2019s denial of the motion for a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b613 A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to disqualify is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 26, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002. While the denial of a temporary or permanent injunction is reviewed for \u201cmanifest abuse of discretion,\u201d deference is not applied to the district court\u2019s conclusions of law, which are reviewed de novo to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>City of Whitefish v. Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs of Flathead Co., </em>2008 MT 436, \u00b6 7, 347 Mont. 490, 199 P.3d 201; <em>Jefferson Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>2011 MT 265, \u00b6 16, 362 Mont. 311, 264 P.3d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b614 The existence of an attorney-client relationship generally is a question of fact. <em>See Iowa Supreme Ct. Atty. Disc. Bd. v. Netti, </em>797 N.W.2d 591, 600 (Iowa 2011); <em>Int\u2019l Tele-Marine Corp. v. Malone &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>845 F. Supp. 1427, 1431 (D. Colo. 1994). We review a district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error. <em>In re Estate of McDermott, </em>2002 MT 164, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 435, 51 P.3d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b615 Application of the law concerning the termination of an attorney-client relationship to a given set of facts is a question of law. <em>Coyle v. Battles, </em>782 A.2d 902, 906 (N.H. 2001). Ultimately, it is this Court\u2019s \u201cconstitutional mandate to fashion and interpret the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d <em>In re Rules of Prof'l Conduct, </em>2000 MT 110, \u00b6 9, 299 Mont. 321, 2 P.3d 806. A district court therefore commits reversible error if it misapplies those rules. <em>See Schuff, </em>\u00b6 176, (Day, Dist. J., dissenting) (district court abuses its discretion by applying the rules governing former clients to a situation involving a current client).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Krutzfeldts\u2019 motions to disqualify Crowley Fleck and to enjoin Crowley from representing Pinnacle Bank in this action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\u00b617  In order to succeed on a motion to disqualify opposing counsel, a party \u201cmust offer sufficient proof that the continued representation of one party by the attorney or firm will prejudice or adversely impact the rights of another party in the matter pending before the court.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36. While violation of a rule of professional conduct is not alone sufficient to justify disqualification of counsel, it serves as \u201cadditional weight that may tip the scales in favor of disqualification.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"AQF\">\u00b618 Application of the Rules of Professional Conduct in this case turns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>on whether the Krutzfeldts were current or former clients of Hoskins at the time he joined Crowley. Rule 1.7(a) states in pertinent part, \u201ca lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if: (1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client[.]\u201dRule 1.10(a) imputes the conflict to other lawyers in the same firm and provides that \u2018hone of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so ....\u2019\u2019The District Court denied disqualification because it determined Hoskins did not have a concurrent conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b619 Under M. R. Pro. C. 1.9(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person\u2019s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">While this rule prohibits a lawyer from representing an adverse party against a former client, the lawyer\u2019s disqualification is not imputed to other members of the firm if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">(1) the personally disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">(2) written notice is promptly given to any affected former client to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">M. R. Pro. C. 1.10(c). Since the District Court found the Krutzfeldts were former clients, it concluded Crowley\u2019s screen of Hoskins and Brekke satisfied the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">\u00b620  Crowley argued in the District Court that the Krutzfeldts were former clients because all of Hoskins\u2019s current clients necessarily became former clients when Hoskins joined Crowley. The District Court rejected this contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">Part of Mr. Hoskins\u2019 value, in addition to his legal skills, was his client base that he built up over years of practice. If that wasn\u2019t intuitively clear, the \u2018Dear Client\u2019Tetter certainly made it so. That client base did not somehow morph instantly when he joined Crowley Fleck, transforming all of his clients at his former firm into former clients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">We agree. The attorney-client relationship is not automatically terminated when a lawyer joins another firm. The \u201cpresent-client standard continues <em>even though the representation ceases prior to filing of the motion to disqualify.\u201d Schuff, </em>\u00b6 45 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Unified Sewerage Agency of Wash. Co. v. Jelco Inc., </em>646 F.2d 1339, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>1344-45 (9th Cir. 1981)). An attorney \u201ccannot avoid the automatic disqualification rule applicable to concurrent representation by unilaterally converting a present client into a former client prior to the hearing on the motion for disqualification.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>72 Cal. App. 4th 1422, 1431 (1999); <em>see also In re Agway, Inc., </em>2005 Bankr. LEXIS 2945 *8 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (\u201ca law firm cannot avoid [its fiduciary duties] by abandoning the client and transforming a continuing relationship to a former relationship.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\">\u00b621 The critical fact here is that, even if grounds for withdrawal existed under the terms of his engagement letter, Hoskins did not withdraw from his representation of the Krutzfeldts prior to accepting his new position. He never informed the Krutzfeldts that his work for them had concluded, never terminated his representation of them, and never advised them he was contemplating joining Crowley. The \u2018Dear Client\u201d letter gave no indication the Krutzfeldts were no longer Hoskins\u2019s client. To the contrary, the letter contemplated future legal services: \u201cWe feel we will be more responsive and efficient to your needs and the ever changing tax and regulatory world by utilizing the resources that Crowley Fleck has to offer.\u201d \u2018Withdrawal is effective to render a representation \u2018former\u2019 for the purposes of this Section if <em>it occurs </em>at a point that the client and lawyer had contemplated as the end of the representation.\u201d <em>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a7 132 cmt. c (2000) (emphasis added). In the absence of any affirmative steps by Hoskins prior to his transition, if the Krutzfeldts were Hoskins\u2019s current clients on December 31,2010, they remained in an attorney-client relationship at the time he signed on as a member of the Crowley team.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b622 The District Court nonetheless determined the Krutzfeldts became Hoskins\u2019s former clients in July 2010, well before he moved to the Crowley firm. The court reached this conclusion because Hoskins met with the Krutzfeldts then, was paid for work he performed, and had not spoken with the Krutzfeldts since. The Krutzfeldts argue that absent termination of the relationship, they remained Hoskins\u2019s current clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b623 Based on the objective evidence; a compelling piece of which apparently was not considered by the District Court, we conclude Hoskins had a concurrent conflict of interest at the time he took the job with Crowley. After the July 19 meeting, Hoskins sent Harris a formal engagement letter indicating the prospective nature of his services. Hoskins\u2019s bill for his services did not indicate it was a \u2018final\u201dbill, nor did he take any steps to conclude his relationship with the Krutzfeldts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>That he was not consulted for the next several months was simply a matter of timing. Consistent with Harris\u2019s previous engagement of Hoskins, Hoskins\u2019s services only would be needed for particular components of the case. Following Harris\u2019s call to advise Hoskins of the upcoming settlement conference, Hoskins did nothing until sending Harris the form letter that advised all of Hoskins\u2019s clients he had joined Crowley. At no time did Hoskins advise Harris of any notice or intent to withdraw as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b624  In concluding the attorney-client relationship had terminated, the District Court emphasized Hoskins\u2019s testimony: \u2018Mr. Hoskins stated in his affidavit that he believed the relationship ended in July, 2010.... Following the payment, it was reasonable for Mr. Hoskins to assume that his representation of the Krutzfeldts terminated....\u201d We have held, however, that the existence of an attorney-client relationship hinges on the client\u2019s reasonable belief that it exists. <em>Pro-Hand Servs. Trust v. Monthei, </em>2002 MT 134, \u00b6 14, 310 Mont. 165, 49 P.3d 56. The District Court failed to consider the impact of the engagement letter. It also failed to view that letter\u2019s prospective nature together with the equally prospective tenor of the \u2018Dear Client\u2019Tetter. Hoskins had an \u201cobligation to show\u201d the Krutzfeldts \u201cdid not believe that [he] continued to represent [them].\u201d <em>In re Rossana, </em>395 B.R. 697, 702 (Bankr. D. Nev. 2008). Although the \u2018Dear Client\u201d letter, standing alone, may not be sufficient to confer upon the Krutzfeldts the status of a present client, <em>Heathcoat v. Santa Fe Int\u2019l Corp., </em>532 F. Supp. 961, 963 (E.D. Ark. 1982), when viewed in light of the additional evidence discussed above, Hoskins\u2019s correspondence supports the Krutzfeldts\u2019 reasonable belief that the attorney-client relationship continued to exist after the July 2010 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b625 Crowley makes much of the fact that Hoskins had only a limited involvement in the Krutzfeldt matter. It points out that Hoskins did not participate in many important stages of the litigation, including an argument on a motion for summary judgment, the depositions of critical witnesses, and a settlement conference. We find this distinction irrelevant. Hoskins had been retained for a limited purpose, as stated in his engagement letter. The limited scope of Hoskins\u2019s engagement in the matter was authorized by M. R. Pro. C. 1.2(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An attorney\u2019s duty to his client, however, is not dependent on the purpose for which he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>been engaged. \u201c[T]he mere fortuity that [the client] did not require more extensive or frequent services than he did cannot be the [attorney\u2019s] escape hatch!.]\u201d <em>Manoir-Electroalloys Corp. v. Amalloy Corp., </em>711 F. Supp. 188, 194 (D.N. J. 1989). Hoskins was retained for his expertise in tax matters. Although the specific tasks in which a lawyer was engaged might make the access to confidential client information insignificant in subsequent representation of an adverse party, the lawyer bears the burden of persuasion on that issue. <em>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a7 132 cmt. h. No one contends Hoskins was not privy to confidential information. His limited specific role in the case does not diminish his professional obligations to the Krutzfeldts.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">\u00b626  Crowley\u2019s argument that Hoskins was an undisclosed consulting expert in the Krutzfeldt case likewise is unavailing. As discussed above, Hoskins was not an expert witness, but was acting as legal counsel for the Krutzfeldts, albeit for a limited purpose. The duty to check for a conflict of interest fell on Crowley and Hoskins, not on Hoskins\u2019s clients. That Crowley\u2019s procedure for ascertaining conflicts failed to turn up the problem in this case is unfortunate, but it-not the Krutzfeldtsmiust bear the consequence. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of the evidence, the District Court\u2019s finding that the Krutzfeldts were former clients when he joined Crowley was clearly erroneous. Because they were current clients, M. R. Pro. C. 1.7(a)(1) and 1.10(a) govern Crowley\u2019s obligations in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b627 Our conclusion that Rule 1.10(c) may not be invoked to effectively screen Crowley from the imputation of Hoskins\u2019s conflict of interest does not end the inquiry. We have held a party must show \u201csufficient proof that the continued representation of one party by the attorney or firm will prejudice or adversely impact the rights of another party in the matter pending before the court.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b628 In <em>Schuff, </em>we affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of Klemens\u2019s motion to disqualify Schuff s counsel on the ground that the same law firm previously had represented Klemens. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 53. One factor in our decision was Klemens\u2019s failure to follow up on the District Court\u2019s denial by requesting injunctive relief. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48-49. After resolution of the case six years later, Klemens sought a new trial based on the \u2018tainted\u201d legal proceedings. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 53-54. We noted Klemens had never requested a new trial from the district court and had not sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>an injunction, supervisory control, or certification of the disqualification order for interlocutory appeal. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40, 50. We concluded that a new trial was unwarranted, assuming there was a violation of Rule 1.7, because Klemens failed to substantiate prejudice \u201cthrough the course of litigation[.]\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 55. We also advised that future conflict issues \u201cshould be brought up as early as possible so that a determination may be made that does not unduly prejudice any party.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 46 (quoting <em>In re Guardianship of Mower, </em>1999 MT 73, \u00b6 23, 294 Mont. 35, 979 P.2d 156). We noted this could be accomplished by attaching a request for injunctive relief to the motion to disqualify, which would allow us to review the district court\u2019s denial of disqualification via interlocutory appeal. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b629 Based on our admonishment in <em>Schuff, </em>the Krutzfeldts filed their motion to disqualify within days of discovering the conflict, and coupled it with a motion for injunctive relief. When the District Court denied both, the Krutzfeldts appealed to this Court for a final determination on the merits of disqualification before trial. The Krutzfeldts acted promptly and diligently in response to the conflict of interest, in the manner this Court directed for pursuing disqualification of opposing counsel. The required showing of prejudice is necessarily less when prompt action is taken to address the conflict, as opposed to after trial on the merits has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b630 The Krutzfeldts have made a sufficient showing of prejudice in this case. They lost the time and money they invested in Hoskins. They lost their trial date because Hoskins\u2019s abrupt move rendered them without expert assistance just weeks before trial and prompted the need for their motion to disqualify. Without prior notice of Hoskins\u2019s move, they did not have an opportunity to elect to seek new tax counsel or to determine how to address the impending conflict. Aside from these setbacks, the Krutzfeldts assert the most damaging loss was that of their attorney\u2019s loyalty. They argue that to ignore a lawyer\u2019s duty of loyalty in this case effectively would sanction the opportunistic hiring of an adverse party\u2019s attorney to weaken and derail the adverse party\u2019s claim against the hiring client.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b631 An attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty is \u201cperhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties.\u201d <em>State v. Jones, </em>278 Mont. 121, 125, 923 P.2d 560, 563 (1996) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2067 (1984)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">So inviolate is the duty of loyalty to an existing client that not even by withdrawing from the relationship can an attorney evade it.... Nor does it matter that the intention and motives of the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>are honest. The rule is designed not alone to prevent the dishonest practitioner from fraudulent conduct, but as well to preclude the honest practitioner from putting himself in a position where he may be required to choose between conflicting duties, or be led to attempt to reconcile conflicting interests, rather than to enforce to their full extent the rights of the interest which he should alone represent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><em>In re Johnson, </em>2004 MT 6, \u00b6 16, 319 Mont. 188, 84 P.3d 637 (quoting <em>Flatt v. Superior Court, </em>885 P.2d 950, 957-58 (Cal. 1994)). A \u2018lawyer owes the client \u2018undivided loyalty\u2019 at least until the litigation is at an end.\u201d <em>Agway, Inc., </em>2005 Bankr. LEXIS 2945, at *7. The duty of loyalty is also a critical factor when analyzing concurrent conflicts. \u2018Representation adverse to a <em>present </em>client must be measured ... \u2018against the duty of undivided loyalty which an attorney owes to each of his clients\u2019 ....\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 45 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Unified Sewerage, </em>646 F.2d at 1344-45).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b632 In addition to the dangers posed to clients, allowing attorneys to switch sides in the middle of litigation threatens the public\u2019s trust in the legal profession. We have noted \u201cthe public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the Bar lies in the enforceability of the rules designed to protect the public from unprofessional behavior.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 17. \u2018Every lawyer is responsible for observance of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201dM. R. Pro. C. Preamble, \u00b6 13. When lack of observance leads to breach of the duty of loyalty and resulting prejudice, disqualification is required. To hold otherwise would allow attorneys to continue representation in the face of a conflict of interest, leaving the client without meaningful recourse for protection against noncompliance with the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b633  We acknowledge that disqualification has a significant effect on litigation and should be imposed sparingly. Disqualification burdens the judicial system with delays and it burdens the party that must retain and reeducate new counsel in the proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">If there are good reasons to disqualify counsel, then we accept the burdens that disqualification imposes. But there should be good reasons. If the legal system can respect the client\u2019s legitimate expectation of loyalty without disqualifying the law firm, then disqualification becomes unnecessary and expensive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Ronald D. Rotunda &amp; John S. Dzienkowski, <em>Legal Ethics: The Lawyer\u2019s Deskbook on Professional Responsibility </em>352 (West 2011). Given that Hoskins never informed the Krutzfeldts of his prospective employment with Crowley or withdrew from representation prior to the move, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>was no opportunity to implement a screen before Hoskins began working at Crowley. Accordingly, there is no course short of disqualifying Crowley which would respect Hoskins\u2019s duty of loyalty to the Krutzfeldts. Disciplinary action, which occurs subsequent to the violation and resulting harm, is an inadequate remedy for a party who, like the Krutzfeldts, had no prior notice and acted diligently under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b634 Crowley nonetheless asserts the prejudice to the Krutzfeldts, if any, is minimal compared to Pinnacle Bank losing Crowley as counsel. The hardship to Crowley\u2019s existing client is most regrettable, particularly since it could have been avoided. However, once it is determined that Rule 1.7 applies, the Rules do not contemplate a balancing of hardships. \u2018Rule 1.10 imposes imputed disqualification automatically... without requiring any showing of either actual leakage or even actual access to confidential information; these are conclusively presumed.\u201d <em>In re Marra, </em>2004 MT 8, \u00b6 9, 319 Mont. 213, 87 P.3d 384 (quoting Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. &amp; W. William Hodes, <em>The Law of Lawyering </em>\u00a714.4 (3d ed., 2003)). \u201c[E]ven if... a balancing [of equities] could be made[, s]omething more important is also at stake here: the public perception oflawyers and ofthe administration of justice.\u201d <em>Picker Int\u2019l Inc. v. Varian Assocs., </em>670 F. Supp. 1363, 1367 (N.D. Ohio 1987). \u2018It is true that the requirements of Rule 1.10 are exacting, but there are good reasons for this stringent rule.\u201d <em>Marra, </em>\u00b6 9. The Rules exist for the protection of clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b635 Ultimate authority over the legal profession is vested in the courts, but the Rules are crafted to facilitate the profession\u2019s self-governance. \u201cSelf-regulation helps maintain the legal profession\u2019s independence from government domination. An independent legal profession is an important force in preserving government under law, for abuse of legal authority is more readily challenged by a profession whose members are not dependent on government for the right to practice.\u201d M. R. Pro. C. Preamble, \u00b6 12. Neglect of an attorney\u2019s responsibilities under the Rules \u201ccompromises the independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.\u201dM. R. Pro. C. Preamble, \u00b6 13. Forcing a client to resort to the courts when the Rules compel withdrawal of counsel only adds to the client\u2019s litigation costs, increases delay in the proceedings, and furthers dissatisfaction with the profession and the system of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b636 Adherence to the Rules of Professional Conduct, on the other hand, does not bar attorneys from pursuing new employment while they are currently serving clients. Rather, an attorney may terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>representation when \u201cwithdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client[.]\u201dM. R. Pro. C. 1.16(b)(1). Ordinarily, when a lawyer leaves a firm, the client can choose whether to be represented by that lawyer, by lawyers remaining at the lawyer\u2019s former firm, by neither, or by both. <em>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a731 cmt. f. In this case, since the Brekke &amp; Hoskins firm appears to have disbanded, the Krutzfeldts were not presented with that choice. Hoskins, however, could have delayed his move to Crowley until after the trial or could have discussed with the Krutzfeldts his wishes to join the firm prior to doing so and taken appropriate steps to withdraw from their representation. In that case, a proper screen could have been implemented to protect the Krutzfeldts\u2019 confidences.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">\u00b637 When a lawyer is engaged in concrete discussions of future employment with an adversary\u2019s law firm, the lawyer must promptly inform the client. \u2018Without effective client consent... the lawyer must terminate all further discussions concerning the employment, or withdraw from representing the client.\u201d <em>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a7 125 cmt. d. Unfortunately, neither protocol was followed in this case. By the time the conflict was disclosed, it was too late. The conflict was concurrent and thus imputed to Crowley. And, even had the Krutzfeldts become Hoskins\u2019s former clients, the measures Crowley took were inadequate to preserve the Krutzfeldts\u2019 confidences. \u201cWhere screening mechanisms are not immediately implemented, and are instead instituted only after the conflicted attorney\u2019s former client asserts the existence of a conflict, the ethical screen is not timely implemented.\u201d <em>Stimson Lumber Co. v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3769 **13-14 (D. Mont. 2011). Finally, although the Rules are not to be \u2018invoked by opposing parties as procedural weapons[,]\u201d M. R. Pro. C. Preamble, \u00b6 21, there has been no such manipulation in this case. The conflict was not manufactured by the Krutzfeldts and, as noted, they took prompt action once it became known.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b638  The District Court erred in denying the Krutzfeldts\u2019 motions. The Crowley Fleck law firm is disqualified from continuing as counsel for Pinnacle Bank in this action. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, MORRIS, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> Although Rule 1.2(c) was amended in October 2011, the prior version also permitted attorneys to limit the scope of representation with the client\u2019s informed consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\"> Crowley acknowledged during oral argument that Mr. Krutzfeldt\u2019s name appeared on Hoskins\u2019s client list, but that for some reason it was neglected to be \u2018flagged\u201d as a potential conflict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
