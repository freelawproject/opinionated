We affirm in part, and remand for the limited purpose of striking the sentencing condition requiring T.M.L. to register as a sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b62 In 2009, seventeen year old T.M.L. was charged in Youth Court with felony burglary, misdemeanor criminal trespass to vehicles, and misdemeanor theft from a vehicle. Based upon T.M.L.\u2019s admissions of entering a house and car without permission, and stealing women\u2019s undergarments, T.M.L. pled guilty to felony burglary and misdemeanor criminal trespass to vehicles on March 5, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u00b63 The Youth Court entered a Dispositional Order on March 26, 2010, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">1. That the Youth, [T.M.L.], be placed on probation to the Juvenile Probation Department of the First Judicial District until he reaches the age of 18 years old and for the balance of said term, be under the control, abide by, and carefully follow the instructions of said Juvenile Probation Department. Upon reaching the age of 18, the Youth will appear before the Court for the purpose of a Transfer Hearing pursuant to \u00a741-5-208, MCA, to transfer supervision and responsibility to the District Court and the supervision to the Adult Probation and Parole Department and to determine conditions of his probation with the Adult Probation and Parole Department....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">T.M.L. turned eighteen on April 30, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">\u00b64 On November 5,2010, the State filed a Motion to Reinstate Youth Court Petition and transfer from youth court to district court pursuant to \u00a741-5-208, MCA, and \u00a741-5-1501(4), MCA. In response, T.M.L. filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because the State failed to file the motion prior to T.M.L. turning eighteen. The Youth Court denied T.M.L.\u2019s motion to dismiss on January 11, 2011. On March 7, 2011, the Youth Court transferred T.M.L.\u2019s matter to district court, and transferred T.M.L.\u2019s supervision to adult supervision under the Department of Corrections. As part of its March 7, 2011, Order, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>District Court required T.M.L. to register as a sexual offender. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b65 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b66 <em>Issue One: Did the Youth Court err when it retained jurisdiction over T.M.L. ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b67 <em>Issue Two: Did the Youth Court err when it required T.M.L. to register as a sexual offender?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b68 A youth court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Youth Court Act is reviewed for correctness. <em>In re J.A., </em>2011 MT 132, \u00b6 5, 361 Mont. 16, 255 P.3d 150 <em>(citing In re Cascade Co. Dist. Ct., </em>2009 MT 355, \u00b6 10, 353 Mont. 194, 219 P.3d 1255). We review criminal sentences for legality, to determine whether they are within the parameters set by statutes as a matter of law. <em>State v. Grana, </em>2009 MT 250, \u00b6 11, 351 Mont. 499, 213 P.3d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">\u00b69 <em>Issue One: Did the Youth Court err when it retained jurisdiction over T.M.L. ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">\u00b610 T.M.L. argues the Youth Court lost jurisdiction when T.M.L. turned eighteen because T.M.L.\u2019s probation ended upon T.M.L. reaching the age of eighteen. The State argues the Youth Court retained jurisdiction because the Dispositional Order extended jurisdiction past T.M.L.\u2019s probationary period in order to conduct a transfer hearing. The Youth Court agreed with the State and retained jurisdiction because the Youth Court had not terminated its jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a741-5-205(1), MCA, and because \u00a741-5- 208(1), MCA, permits a youth court to transfer a matter to district court \u201cat any time after a youth reaches 18 years of age but before the youth reaches 21 years of age.\u201d We agree with the Youth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">\u00b611 Generally, a youth court\u2019s jurisdiction ceases when the youth reaches the age of twenty-one. <em>In re J.A., </em>\u00b6 9. Section 41-5-205(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-13\">The court may dismiss a petition or otherwise terminate jurisdiction on its own motion or on the motion or petition of any interested party at any time. Unless terminated by the court and except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), the jurisdiction of the court continues until the individual becomes 21 years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8N\">Pursuant to \u00a741-5-208(1), MCA, a youth court retains jurisdiction to transfer a matter to the district court \u201cat any time after a youth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>reaches 18 years of age but before the youth reaches 21 years of age.\u201d \u00b612 If the exceptions found in \u00a741-5-205, MCA, are inapplicable, a youth court may continue to exercise jurisdiction over an individual until he or she reaches 21 years of age. <em>In re K.D.K., </em>2006 MT 187, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 100, 141 P.3d 1212. In K.D.K., the Youth Court required K.D.K. to compensate the victim for any therapy costs associated with K.D.K.\u2019s crime against the victim. <em>K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 4. The Order further provided that K.D.K.\u2019s probation would end on February 27, 2005, when K.D.K. turned eighteen. K.D.K., \u00b6 4. The Youth Court also stated it would \u201cretain jurisdiction over the youth until the age of twenty-one for financial purposes such as payment of fees/fines, attorney fees and/or restitution.\u201d K.D.K., \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b6 13 In June 2003, K.D .K. executed a restitution agreement and agreed to pay $4,507.53 to the victim. <em>K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 6. On February 11, 2005, the State moved to modify the Youth Court\u2019s Order and requested additional restitution. <em>K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 7. Two days before K.D.K. turned eighteen, on February 25,2005, the Youth Court held a hearing on the State\u2019s motion and required both parties to submit post-hearing briefs. <em>K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 9. In K.D.K.\u2019s brief, K.D.K. asserted that the Youth Court could no longer exercise jurisdiction over K.D.K. because K.D.K.\u2019s probation ended on February 27, 2005. <em>K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 11. More than three months after KD.K\u2019s probation ended, on June 9, 2005, the Youth Court granted the State\u2019s motion to modify its Order and impose additional restitution. <em>K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b614 K.D.K. appealed the imposition of additional restitution, arguing that the Youth Court was without jurisdiction to order additional restitution after K.D.K.\u2019s probation ended on February 27, 2005. K.D.K., \u00b6 17. On appeal, this Court held that the Youth Court lost jurisdiction-except in relation to the financial obligations outlined in the original Order and the restitution agreement-pursuant to \u00a741-5-205, MCA, on February 27,2005, and thereby lost its ability to impose additional financial obligations on K.D.K. <em>K.D.K., </em>\u00b6 20. This Court further noted that in a different case a youth court may \u201cretain jurisdiction over a youth until he or she reaches 21 years of age.\u201d <em>K.D.K. </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b615  In this case, unlike K.D.K., the Youth Court did not terminate its jurisdiction under \u00a741-5-205, MCA, once T.M.L. turned eighteen and T.M.L.\u2019s probation ended. Instead, the Youth Court purposefully retained jurisdiction over T.M.L. when it required T.M.L., upon turning eighteen, to appear before the court for the purpose of a transfer hearing. It is irrelevant that the State did not request the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>transfer hearing until approximately six months after T.M.L. reached the age of eighteen. Further, \u00a741-5-208, MCA, contemplates this exact situation and provides youth court jurisdiction over a transfer proceeding once a youth reaches eighteen, but before the youth turns twenty-one. Since the exceptions to \u00a7 41-5-205(1), MCA, are inapplicable, the Youth Court had jurisdiction over T.M.L. and properly denied T.M.L.\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b616 <em>Issue Two: Did the Youth Court err when it required T.M.L. to register as a sexual offender?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b617 The appropriate remedy for an illegal sentencing condition hinges on the ability of the lower court to correct the illegal sentencing condition on remand. <em>State v. Olivares-Coster, </em>2011 MT 196, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 380, 259 P.3d 760. To determine the appropriate remedy, we utilize the following approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">TW]hen a portion of a sentence is illegal, the better result is to remand to the district court to correct the illegal provision. Remand to give the district court the opportunity to correct the illegal provision should be ordered unless, under the particular circumstances of the case, the illegal portion of the sentence cannot be corrected. If so, the case should be remanded to the district court with instructions to strike the illegal conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9H\"><em>Olivares-Coster, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting <em>State v. Heafner, </em>2010 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087). A sentencing condition imposed without statutory authority is illegal. <em>See Olivares-Coster, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b618 As a condition of T.M.L.\u2019s probation, the Youth Court required T.M.L. to register as a sexual offender pursuant to Title 46, Chapter 23, Part 5, MCA. According to this part, a person who has been convicted of, or in youth court, found to have committed or been adjudicated for a sexual offense is a sexual offender and shall register as such. Section 46-23-504(1), MCA. This registration requirement applies to a discrete list of sexual offenses found in \u00a746-23-502(9), MCA. Neither felony burglary, \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA, nor misdemeanor criminal trespass to vehicles, \u00a745-6-202, MCA, is a sexual offense for which registration is required. An individual may nevertheless be required to register as a sexual offender for a non-delineated offense if it is part of a plea agreement. Section 46-23-512, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b619  It is clear that the Youth Court did not have the power to require T.M.L. to register as a sexual offender. T.M.L. did not commit a delineated sexual offense, and signed no plea agreement requiring registration. The State concedes the Youth Court exceeded its statutory authority by requiring T.M.L. to register as a sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>offender. We agree with T.M.L. and the State, the Youth Court had no statutory authority to require T.M.L. to register as a sexual offender as a condition of T.M.L.\u2019s sentence, therefore this condition is illegal. Accordingly, we remand this matter for the limited purpose of striking the condition that T.M.L. register as a sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b620 For the reasons stated above, we affirm in part, and remand for the limited purpose of striking the sentencing condition requiring T.M.L. to register as a sexual offender.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-6\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
