The sole issue on appeal is whether there was substantial credible evidence to support the WCC\u2019s conclusion that Banco was not last injuriously exposed to the hazard of the OD at her employment with Liberty\u2019s insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b62 Banco worked concurrently at 4B\u2019s Restaurant and the Child Development Center on Malmstrom Air Force Base (CDC). 4B\u2019s is insured by Liberty, and CDC is insured under the federal workers\u2019 compensation system. At the time she filed her claim for Montana workers\u2019 compensation benefits, Banco had worked for twenty-eight years as a cook at CDC, preparing hundreds of meals a day. Banco\u2019s job required stirring large quantities of food and lifting heavy pots and pans; slicing and cutting meat, vegetables and fruit; doing dishes; helping serve the meals; and putting away \u2018freight.\u201d Her shift at CDC typically ran from 6:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on weekdays. Banco also had worked for many years as a server at 4B\u2019s three nights a week and from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. There, she waited tables and carried food trays, ice buckets and bus tubs. Between the two jobs, Banco worked fifty-five to sixty hours a week for more than twenty years. Banco quit her job at 4B\u2019s on or about April 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b63 Banco filed a report of a shoulder injury on June 10, 2005, naming 4B\u2019s as her employer. She stated her shoulder condition developed over time and no particular incident caused it. She continued to work full-time at CDC after she left 4B\u2019s. Banco told Jack Randolph, an investigator from Liberty, she quit working at 4B\u2019s but stayed on at CDC because she thought \u2018If I give up one that it might be a little easier on me.\u201d She also told Randolph her job duties at CDC were \u201cdefinitely\u201d more strenuous than at 4B\u2019s, as they required \u201cconstant\u201d kitchen work. During her deposition, Banco stated the two jobs involved \u201cequal lifting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b64 Dr. Keith D. Bortnem, Banco\u2019s treating physician, testified she suffered from a degenerative tendinosis of her shoulder that is multifactorial in origin. He stated activities which involve repetitive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>overhead and chronic uses of the arms away from the body predispose people to developing the condition. Dr. Bortnem performed arthroscopic shoulder surgery on Banco on June 21, 2005. Banco subsequently underwent an independent medical evaluation by Dr. John C. Schumpert, who concluded that Banco\u2019s shoulder condition was more related to her work at CDC and likely would have occurred had she never worked at 4B\u2019s. Dr. Aimee V. Hachigian examined Banco in July 2006, and opined that Banco\u2019s shoulder complaints were triggered equally by her work at CDC and 4B\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b65 The parties dispute Banco\u2019s duties at CDC after she left 4B\u2019s and before her surgery. Banco contends the record does not show she returned to work at CDC after quitting 4B\u2019s until after her surgery, at which time she did \u2018ho lifting and [] only paperwork.\u201d Liberty claims the evidence showed she continued to work at CDC under the same conditions that could have caused her shoulder condition. Banco\u2019s interview with Randolph on June 20, 2005, indicates she continued with the same cooking and cleaning duties at CDC after leaving 4B\u2019s, but prior to her surgery. Dr. Bortnem, who testified he had no knowledge of Banco\u2019s work at CDC, wrote her a note four weeks after her surgery, indicating \u201cshe can work doing paperwork only at her request.\u201d Banco advised Dr. Schumpert she continued to work at CDC full-time after she left 4B\u2019s. She testified at her deposition in April 2006 that she still worked at her CDC job, but did \u201cmore paperwork,\u201d and that \u201cthe other girls\u201d did any lifting for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b66 Liberty denied Banco\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Banco and Liberty then brought the matter before the WCC on a stipulated record. Witness testimony was provided solely by deposition. The court was persuaded that Banco was exposed to working conditions of the type and kind giving rise to her shoulder condition at both 4B\u2019s and CDC. Since her last day of work was in April 2005, the court applied the 2003 statute, \u00a739-72-303(1), MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b67 The WCC relied on our prior case law interpreting the statutory standard for determining liability when a worker has been exposed to hazards at more than one place of employment. <em>Liberty N. W. Ins. Corp. v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2009 MT 386, \u00b6 19, 353 Mont. 299, 219 P.3d 1267 <em>(In re Mitchell). </em>\u201c[F]or purposes of the initial liability determination of an OD where two or more employers are potentially liable, the \u2018last injurious exposure\u2019 to the hazard of the OD occurs during the last employment at which the claimant was exposed to working conditions of the same type and kind which gave rise to the OD.\u201d <em>In re Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 26. The WCC found Banco was last exposed to work \u201cof the same type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and kind\u201d that gave rise to her shoulder condition while she was working at CDC. Thus, since she was not last exposed at 4B\u2019s, Liberty was not liable under the \u2018last injurious exposure\u201d rule. Banco appeals the WCC\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b68 We review the WCC\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence, and we review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Fleming v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>2008 MT 327, \u00b6 17, 346 Mont. 141, 194 P.3d 77. The Court will not resolve conflicting evidence, nor do we consider whether evidence supports findings different from those made by the WCC. <em>Wright v. Ace Am. Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 43, \u00b6 14, 359 Mont. 332, 249 P.3d 485. Since we are in the same position as the WCC to assess deposition testimony, we review deposition testimony de novo. <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 14. However, \u201ceven where we conduct de novo review of deposition testimony, we are ultimately restricted to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 14 <em>(quoting Harrison v. Liberty N.W. Ins. Corp., </em>2008 MT 102, \u00b6 13, 342 Mont. 326, 181 P.3d 590).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b69 Was <em>there substantial credible evidence for the WCC to conclude Banco\u2019s \u2018last injurious exposure\u201doccurred at CDC?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b610 An \u201coccupational disease\u201d means \u2018harm, damage, or death ... arising out of or contracted in the course and scope of employment and caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift.\u201d Section 39-72-102(10), MCA (2003). Under the Occupational Disease Act of Montana, \u201c[wjhere compensation is payable for an occupational disease, the only employer liable is the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease.\u201d Section 39-72-303(1), MCA (2003). This case turns on application of that statute to an OD claim where multiple employers may have contributed to the condition. Although \u00a739-72-303 was part of the since-repealed Occupational Disease Act of Montana, we apply it here since an employee\u2019s last day of work is \u201cthe point in time from which [an] occupational disease claim [will] flow.\u201d <em>Fleming, </em>\u00b6 27. The language of the current statute, \u00a739-71-407(13), MCA (2011), is identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b611  In <em>In re Mitchell, </em>we considered the standard for liability when an employee\u2019s work for multiple consecutive employers may have contributed to a claimant\u2019s OD. \u00b6 14. We adopted the \u201cpotentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>causal\u201d standard, finding a claimant who was \u201carguably exposed to the hazard of an OD among two or more employers is not required to prove the degree to which the working conditions with each given employer have actually caused the OD in order to attribute initial liability [between the employers\u2019 insurers].\u201d <em>In re Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 24. Instead, the claimant must prove only that she was exposed to working conditions of the same type or kind that gave rise to the OD. <em>In re Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 26. Under the last injurious exposure\u201d rule, therefore, \u201cwhere two or more employers are potentially liable,\u201d liability for the OD is borne by the insurer providing coverage for the last employment at which the claimant was exposed to working conditions of the same type and kind which gave rise to the OD.\u201d <em>In re Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b612 Banco first argues the WCC erred because there was no evidence of an aggravation or any change to Banco\u2019s shoulder after she quit 4B\u2019s. We declined in In <em>re Mitchell, </em>however, to adopt the insurer\u2019s proposed standard under which the last injurious exposure\u201d rule would immunize a subsequent insurer unless a permanent aggravation of or contribution to the OD is established. <em>See In re Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 33 (J. Rice, concurring). Rather, we made clear that an insurer\u2019s liability is based on the working conditions present in the employment and whether they are of the same type and kind as those that led to the development and diagnosis of the OD, even if the subsequent employment \u201cwas not the major contributing cause of his OD ....\u201d <em>In re Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b613 Secondly, Banco argues the evidence and the WCC\u2019s findings focused on which of the two employment positions caused her shoulder injury, not on whether she continued to be exposed to the same conditions while maintaining her position with CDC. She contends the lack of analysis or evidence of her specific duties at CDC <em>after </em>she left 4B\u2019s is a fatal flaw in the WCC\u2019s analysis and requires remand for further consideration. The WCC found Banco quit working at 4B\u2019s on or around April 29, 2005. She continued to work at CDC after she quit 4B\u2019s because she believed giving up one job might make things easier for her. Under <em>In re Mitchell, </em>the WCC is not required to find whether the conditions at CDC actually were \u201ca substantial contributing cause\u201d of Banco\u2019s condition. \u00b6 24. Instead, the WCC applies the \u201cpotentially causal\u201d standard. <em>In re Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 24. Thus, the issue to be reviewed is not whether contribution to the OD is established, but whether her working <em>conditions </em>at CDC were of the same type and kind after she left 4B\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b614 In its order, the WCC described in detail Banco\u2019s duties at CDC and 4B\u2019s. It found \u201cthat Banco worked two physically demanding jobs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>seven days a week, and well in excess of 40 hours per week, for over 25 years.\u201d The court found that she was exposed to working conditions of the type and kind which would give rise to her shoulder condition both at 4B\u2019s and at the CDC, where she continued to work after leaving employment with 4B\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">\u00b615 Our review of the depositions in light of the deference owed to the WCC\u2019s findings of fact leads us to conclude the court had substantial credible evidence upon which to make these findings. Banco admitted she continued to work at CDC after she left 4B\u2019s. Banco described her duties at CDC in the June 2005 Randolph interview, and did not indicate any of those duties had changed since the time she worked both jobs. She was still responsible for making breakfast and lunch daily, requiring constant \u201cmulti-tasking\u201d to have the meals ready on time, afternoon snacks prepared, and everything cleaned up to be out by three o\u2019clock. She told Randolph, \u201cthen I have paperwork[,] which I don\u2019t have time to do.\u201d Though she testified in her deposition that her work at CDC had changed so that she did \u2018inore paperwork\u201d and coworkers assisted with the lifting, this testimony occurred long after her last day of work at 4B\u2019s and nearly a year following surgery. Dr. Bortnem\u2019s records show it was not until July 2005, nearly three months after she quit 4B\u2019s and a month after surgery, that he wrote an order permitting Banco to change her duties to paperwork only. The evidence in the record, though limited, supports the WCC\u2019s finding that prior to her surgery, Banco continued to work at CDC in the same capacity before and after she quit work at 4B\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b616  Banco finally contends the \u2018last injurious exposure\u201drule should not apply here because she worked the two jobs concurrently and was exposed to conditions giving rise to her OD at both places of employment. Had the WCC not made an express finding that Banco was last injuriously exposed to the hazard at CDC, this argument might require further consideration. Given the WCC\u2019s findings, however, which we have found to be substantiated by the record, the law precludes imposition of liability on 4B\u2019s. The WCC properly applied the statute to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b617 We conclude the WCC had substantial credible evidence upon which to find Banco was \u2018last injuriously exposed\u201d at CDC to working conditions of the type and kind that led to her OD. Accordingly, we affirm its judgment that Liberty is not liable for Banco\u2019s OD.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
