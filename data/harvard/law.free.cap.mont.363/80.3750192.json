Ervin (Ervin) appeals from an order of the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Sanders County, declining to exercise further jurisdiction over Ervin\u2019s child support case and relinquishing jurisdiction to the Mohave County Superior Court of Arizona (\u201cArizona Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u00b62 Although Ervin appeals several issues, the dispositive issue is whether the District Court correctly declined to exercise jurisdiction on the basis that Montana is an inconvenient forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\u00b63 We reverse and remand to the District Court to conduct further findings regarding the appropriate forum for this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">\u00b64 In May 2007, Ervin\u2019s marriage to Lisa M. Ervin, now known as Lisa M. Estopare (Estopare), was dissolved in Jackson County, Mississippi. Two children, a son (T.E.) and a daughter (B.E.), were born during the marriage. The Mississippi decree awarded Ervin custody of T.E. and Estopare custody of B.E. Neither party was awarded child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">\u00b65 Subsequently, Ervin and T.E. moved to Montana, and Estopare and B.E. moved to Arizona. In August 2007, Ervin petitioned the Arizona Court to modify child custody of B.E. In December 2007, Ervin petitioned the District Court in Montana for an amended parenting plan concerning T.E. In April 2008, the Arizona Court relinquished jurisdiction over T.E. to the Montana District Court, but retained jurisdiction over B.E. In October 2008, the District Court ordered an amended parenting plan for T.E., which modified the parenting plan in place and awarded child support. Estopare appealed to this Court in February 2009. We dismissed Estopare\u2019s appeal months later after she failed to participate in mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">\u00b66 In August 2009, Ervin petitioned the District Court to further modify the child support award for T.E. that it had ordered in October 2008. The following month, Ervin provided notice to the District Court that he and T.E. intended to move back to Mississippi within a month. In October 2009, the District Court denied Ervin\u2019s petition and declined to exercise further jurisdiction on the basis that it was an inconvenient forum because Ervin and T.E. were residing in Mississippi and Estopare and B.E. were residing in Arizona. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>District Court relinquished jurisdiction of T.E. to the Arizona Court and rescinded all previous orders it had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b67 Ervin petitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control. This Court granted Ervin\u2019s petition for a writ of supervisory control in December 2009, ordering the District Court to reinstate its previous orders. This Court did not address the future jurisdiction of the matter. <em>See Ervin v. Twentieth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2009 Mont. LEXIS 706 at *6 (Dec. 9, 2009). Following this Court\u2019s order, the District Court reinstated its previous orders, but ratified and confirmed the portion of its October 2009 order declining and relinquishing jurisdiction of T.E. to the Arizona Court on the basis that Montana was an inconvenient forum \u201cunder the [then] present circumstances of the parties\u201d-namely, their absence from Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b68 Ervin and T.E. moved back to Montana in January 2011. In March 2011, Ervin petitioned the District Court to reduce accrued child support to a money judgment. The District Court, relying solely upon its previous orders of October 2009 and December 2009, noted jurisdiction had been relinquished to the Arizona Court, declined to exercise further jurisdiction on the basis that it was an inconvenient forum, and refused to accept filings by either party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b69 Ervin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction is a conclusion of law that this Court reviews for correctness. <em>Burchett v. Mastec N. Am., Inc., </em>2004 MT 177, \u00b6 9, 322 Mont. 93, 93 P.3d 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court correctly decline to exercise jurisdiction on the basis that Montana is an inconvenient forum ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u00b612 In declining to exercise jurisdiction over Ervin\u2019s March 2011 motion to modify child support on the basis that Montana is an inconvenient forum, the District Court relied upon \u00a740-7-108, MCA, of the Montana Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that \u201c[a] court of this state that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>jurisdiction ... to make a <em>child custody determination </em>may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum ....\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b613 On appeal, Ervin argues the District Court erred in relying upon \u00a7 40-7-108, MCA, for its jurisdictional determination because the UCCJEA applies to child custody matters, not child support matters. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b614  Child custody jurisdictional determinations are separate from child support jurisdictional determinations. Jurisdiction over child custody matters is governed by the UCCJEA, codified at Title 40, chapter 7, MCA. Jurisdiction over child support is governed by the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), codified at Title 40, chapter 5, MCA. <em>See e.g. Erler v. Erler, </em>261 Mont. 65, 68, 862 P.2d 12, 13 (1993) (illustrating that a district court\u2019s jurisdictional determinations regarding child custody matters and child support matters are separate).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b615 Ervin\u2019s March 2011 motion pertains only to child support enforcement. Therefore, the UIFSA, not the UCCJEA, applies. While \u00a740-7-108, MCA, which the District Court relied upon here to decline and relinquish jurisdiction, provides that a district court may decline jurisdiction over a child custody determination on the basis that it is an inconvenient forum, the UIFSA does not contain a comparable \u2018inconvenient forum\u201d counterpart. <em>See </em>Title 40, chapter 5, MCA. Instead, relevant to the present case, it provides that \u201c[a] tribunal of this state issuing a support order consistent with the law of this state has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order ... as long as this state remains the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee, or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued.\u201d Section 40-5-149(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b616  The District Court improperly applied the UCCJEA in determining it did not have jurisdiction over this child support matter. Therefore, we must reverse the District Court\u2019s determination and remand this case to the District Court to assess whether, in light of the fact that Ervin and T.E. have returned to Montana, it has jurisdiction over this matter under the UIFSA, specifically Title 40, chapter 5, part 1, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b617 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-12\"> The District Court stated: \u2018Pursuant to the October [23], 2009 and December 11, 2009 Order[s] of this Court which [remain] in full force and effect, this Court has declined to exercise further jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum and jurisdiction has been relinquished to the Superior Court of the State of Arizona.\u201d The District Court\u2019s December 11, 2009, order ratifies and confirms the first paragraph of the October 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>2009, order, which declines to exercise further jurisdiction based upon a determination that Montana was an inconvenient forum under \u00a740-7-108, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
