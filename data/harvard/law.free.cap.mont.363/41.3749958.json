(the \u2018Farm\u201d) and Riley Styren (\u2018Riley\u201d) (collectively \u201cStyren\u201d), appeal from various rulings of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Pondera County, and a subsequent jury verdict finding Defendant Sherry Ann Roos (\u2018Roos\u201d) not negligent after an automobile collision with Riley. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">\u00b62 On the morning of May 8,2006, both Roos and Riley were on their way to school. Roos was driving, with her younger brother, Brandon, and younger sister, Tamara, from their home in Conrad, Montana, to school in Power, Montana, an approximately 30 minute drive. The car Roos was driving was owned by her mother, Julia Roos (\u201cJulia\u201d) and Curtis Stordahl (\u2018Stordahl\u201d). At the time of the collision, Roos was heading east on Midway Road (part of Highway 91). Riley was driving to school in Conrad. The car Riley was driving was owned by the Farm. Riley was traveling north on the Brady Frontage Road (also part of Highway 91). The Brady Frontage Road meets Midway Road southeast of Conrad, forming a T intersection. There is a stop sign on the Brady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Frontage Road at this intersection. Midway Road does not have a stop sign. See diagram below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b63 The parties do not agree on whether Riley stopped at the stop sign before turning left onto Midway Road toward Conrad. After the</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">collision, at the hospital, Riley told a sheriffs deputy that he did not stop at the stop sign. At trial, Riley testified that he did stop, as did another witness, Ozzy Samsal. Roos and her brother, Brandon, testified that Riley did not stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b64 The parties do agree that Riley\u2019s vehicle was struck by Roos\u2019 vehicle in the westbound lane of Midway Road, at the approximate location of the \u201cK\u201din the above diagram. Riley\u2019s car ended up facing northwest in the ditch on the north side of Midway Road, represented by the \u201cY\u201d in the above diagram. Roos\u2019 car ended up facing east, in the westbound lane of Midway Road, represented by the \u201cZ\u201d in the above diagram. The rear driver\u2019s side passenger door and rear quarter panel of Riley\u2019s vehicle were damaged, and the front end of Roos\u2019 car was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u00b65 In October 2007, Styren filed a complaint against Roos, Julia, and Stordahl. The complaint alleged claims of negligence against Roos, and negligent entrustment and liability under the family purpose doctrine against Julia and Stordahl. Styren sought damages for personal injury, property damage, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">\u00b6'6 Julia and Stordahl sought summary judgment on the claims against them, which was granted. The case proceeded to trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>negligence claim against Roos. The jury trial began on December 6, 2010. The jury returned its verdict on December 9, 2010, finding Roos was not negligent. Judgment against Styren was entered on December 17, 2010. Styren filed a motion for a new trial; however, the District Court failed to rule within 60 days, thus the motion was deemed denied. This timely appeal followed. We will discuss further facts, as necessary, below.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b67 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b68 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment to Julia?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b69 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err when it did not grant a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">\u00b610 We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same M. R. Civ. P.56 criteria used by the district court. <em>PPL Montana, LLC v. State of Montana, </em>2010 MT 64, \u00b6 84, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>PPL, </em>\u00b6 84. Once the moving party has met its burden, the non-moving party must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of the case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>PPL, </em>\u00b6 84. Conclusory statements are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>PPL, </em>\u00b6 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u00b611 When the basis of a motion for a new trial is insufficiency of the evidence, we review the denial of the motion de novo. <em>Fish v. Harris, </em>2008 MT 302, \u00b6 8, 345 Mont. 527, 192 P.3d 238; <em>Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6 27, 338 Mont. 19, 162 P.3d 134 (announcing the de novo standard and overruling a host of cases that stated the standard of review for a ruling on a motion for a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence was for a manifest abuse of discretion). We determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the verdict. <em>Fish, </em>\u00b6 8. Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it may be less than a preponderance of the evidence, but must be more than a \u2018inere scintilla.\u201d <em>Fish, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">\u00b612 When the basis of a motion for a new trial is an irregularity in the proceedings or surprise, we review the denial of the motion for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Westmark International Corp. v. Gold Hill Placers, Inc., </em>2003 MT 119, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 14, 315 Mont. 492, 70 P.3d 731. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>A manifest abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident, or unmistakable. <em>Benefis Healthcare v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2006 MT 254, \u00b6 11, 334 Mont. 86, 146 P.3d 714. The manifest abuse of discretion standard requires that the abuse of discretion be so significant as to materially affect the substantial rights of the complaining party. <em>Cooper v. Hanson, </em>2010 MT 113, \u00b6 28, 356 Mont. 309, 234 P.3d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b613 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment to Julia?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b614 Julia moved for summary judgment on the only claims against her-negligent entrustment and vicarious liability via the family purpose doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court granted Julia\u2019s motion, finding \u201cthere is no evidence to indicate that Julia Roos should have known Sherryann was not a competent driver.\u201d Further, the District Court found Tt]here is similarly no evidence of an agency relationship [regarding the family purpose doctrine].\u201d In reaching this ruling, the District Court disregarded \u201c[m]ost of the affidavit of Delbert Styren... because no foundation of personal knowledge for the statements is set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u00b615 Styren argues on appeal that, based upon the Tacts\u201d in Delbert Styren\u2019s (Delbert) affidavit, Julia was negligent in sending Roos and her siblings \u201cdown the highway\u201din her (Julia\u2019s) car.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">A. Negligent Entrustment</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">\u00b616  Generally, a parent is not liable for the tortious acts of his or her child, except under limited statutory circumstances. <em>Crisafulli v. Bass, </em>2001 MT 316, \u00b6 16, 308 Mont. 40, 38 P.3d 842. That said, a parent can be liable, <em>not for the tortious acts of his or her child, </em>but for the parent\u2019s <em>own </em>failure to exercise reasonable care. <em>Crisafulli, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 27 (emphasis added). In other words, the parent is not liable for the alleged tortious act of the child-negligent entrustment is a standalone tortious act of the parent. For liability to be imposed under this limited circumstance, the parent must (1) \u201cknow that he or she has the ability to control the child[;]\u201d (2) \u201cthe parent understands the necessity for doing so[;]\u201d and (3) the parent\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care \u201cunder these circumstances create[s] an <em>unreasonable </em>risk of harm to a third person.\u201d <em>Crisafulli, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u00b617 Negligent entrustment requires more than simply allowing a young person to operate a vehicle. <em>McGinnis v. Hand, </em>1999 MT 9, \u00b6 29, 293 Mont. 72, 972 P.2d 1126; <em>Smith v. Babcock, </em>157 Mont. 81, 88-89, 482 P.2d 1014, 1018 (1971). In <em>McGinnis, </em>we concluded that even evidence showing that a driver was \u201cunderage for driving purposes or that she was not licensed to drive\u201d would \u2018be insufficient[,]\u201d without more, \u201cto establish lack of competence\u201d as a reasonable and prudent driver. <em>McGinnis, </em>\u00b6 29. In <em>McGinnis, </em>the plaintiff did not provide any evidence that the driver was not competent, or that she had a reputation for driving negligently, or that the defendant (for the negligent entrustment claim) should have known the driver was not competent to drive or would drive in a manner creating an unreasonable risk to others. <em>McGinnis, </em>\u00b6 29. Because the plaintiff did not meet his burden, summary judgment against him was upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">\u00b618 Similarly, in <em>Smith, </em>we found the record devoid of any indication the minor driver (16 years old) was incompetent or that Smith (the minor driver\u2019s uncle) should have \u2018foreseen the accident.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>157 Mont. at 89, 482 P.2d at 1018. The minor driver was \u201cduly licensed by the State of Montana to operate a vehicle after fulfilling the various legal requirements, and there is no evidence on the record to indicate he was other than a competent driver.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>157 Mont. at 89, 482 P.2d at 1018. Based upon these facts, we held, as a matter of law, that Smith was not negligent in entrusting his vehicle to his minor nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b619 In this case, the undisputed facts compel the same conclusion as in <em>McGinnis </em>and <em>Smith. </em>There is absolutely no evidence that Julia knew, or should have known, that Roos was an incompetent driver, or that Julia knew Roos would drive in a manner that created an unreasonable risk to others. At the time of the collision with Riley, Roos had a valid Montana driver\u2019s license, had received no traffic citations, and was involved in no accidents as a driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b620 To refute these facts, Styren relies on Delbert\u2019s affidavit. However, as the District Court correctly pointed out, nowhere in Delbert\u2019s affidavit does it state Delbert had personal knowledge of the matters asserted in the affidavit. Further, it contains statements that Delbert could not have personal knowledge of, such as: Julia\u2019s knowledge about Roos\u2019 thoughts on May 8, 2006, Julia\u2019s knowledge about Roos\u2019 driving capabilities on May 8, 2006, what time Roos left home for school, and that Roos \u201cwas traveling over the speed limit\u201d on May 8, 2006. Delbert was asked about the basis for his statements in the affidavit at his deposition. He admitted that he learned some of the information \u2018through my attorney[,]\u201d that he had no knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Roos\u2019 driver\u2019s training or driving experience, and that he had never spoken to Julia.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b621  We agree with the District Court that Styren did not meet its burden of proof to avoid summary judgment. Nothing in Delbert\u2019s affidavit creates a genuine issue of material fact. The District Court properly granted summary judgment in Julia\u2019s favor on the negligent entrustment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">B. Family Purpose Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b622 The family purpose doctrine holds the owner of a family vehicle liable for the negligence of a member of the family. <em>Smith, </em>157 Mont. at 86, 482 P.2d at 1016-17. This Court has rejected the family purpose doctrine several times; <em>Smith, </em>157 Mont. at 86, 482 P.2d at 1017; <em>Castle v. Thisted, </em>139 Mont. 328, 332, 363 P.2d 724, 726 (1961); <em>Clawson v. Schroeder, </em>63 Mont. 488, 499, 208 P. 924, 927 (1922); and we reject it again in this case. Simply because Julia gave Roos permission to use a vehicle titled in Julia\u2019s name does not make Julia liable for Roos\u2019 alleged negligence. <em>Clawson, </em>63 Mont. at 499, 208 P. at 927. The only relationship in the present case was one of family-mother and daughter-and that alone cannot create liability in Julia; there must have been an agency relationship. <em>Castle, </em>139 Mont. at 332, 363 P.2d at 726; <em>Clawson, </em>63 Mont. at 494-95, 208 P. at 926; <em>Smith, </em>157 Mont. at 86, 482 P.2d at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b623 We agree with the District Court that Styren presented no evidence regarding agency. Again, Delbert\u2019s affidavit will not suffice for the reasons stated in \u00b6 20, and bare allegations that Roos was driving herself and her siblings to school \u201cat the express request and direction of her mother\u201d cannot defeat Julia\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>PPL, </em>\u00b6 84. The cases regarding agency cited by Styren are inapposite. <em>Williams v. State Medical Oxygen &amp; Supply, Inc., </em>265 Mont. 111, 874 P.2d 1225 (1994), deals with teenage employees of a company moving mattresses at the request of Cloutier, an officer and director of that company, using a truck belonging to another of Cloutier\u2019s companies. <em>Williams </em>has nothing to do with the familial relationship in the present case. Nor does <em>Vollmer v. Bramlette, </em>594 F. Supp. 243 (1984) (U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24427), in which the agency relationship between an employer and employee was not contested.</p>\n<p id=\"AJp\">\u00b624  In sum, we agree with the District Court that Styren did not meet its burden to raise genuine issues of material fact in opposition to Julia\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Julia was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both the negligent entrustment and family purpose doctrine claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u00b625 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err when it did not grant a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b626 After the jury returned its verdict finding Roos was not negligent, Styren sought a new trial pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(a) and \u00a725-11-102, MCA. The bases for the motion were: (1) an irregularity in the proceedings occurred when Styren was not allowed to introduce evidence of Trooper Duram\u2019s \u2018improper\u201d investigation, and when Trooper Duram was not required to give live testimony; (2) an irregularity in the proceedings and surprise occurred when Roos\u2019 counsel \u201cmisstated the evidence[;]\u201d and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and the verdict was against the law. The District Court failed to rule on the motion, and it was deemed denied pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b627 M. R. Civ. P. 59(a) provides, in relevant part, \u201cA new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues for any of the reasons provided by the statutes of the state of Montana.\u201d Section 25-11-102, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">Grounds for new trial. The former verdict or other decision may be vacated and a new trial granted on the application of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of the party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">(1) irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">(2) misconduct of the jury. Whenever any one or more of the jurors have been induced to assent to any general or special verdict or to a finding on any question submitted to them by the court by a resort to the determination of chance, the misconduct may be proved by the affidavit of any one of the jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">(3) accident or surprise that ordinary prudence could not have guarded against;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">(4) newly discovered evidence material for the party making the application that the party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">(5) excessive damages appearing to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">(6) insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision or that it is against law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">(7) error in law occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u00b628 The arguments Styren makes on appeal are substantially similar, if not identical, to the arguments made in District Court. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">A. Did the District Court err in its rulings on Trooper Duram\u2019s \u2018improper\u201d investigation and the reading of his deposition into evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b629 A bit of background on this issue is necessary. Trooper Duram was the Montana Highway Patrol Trooper who investigated the collision between Roos and Riley. His investigation consisted of taking measurements at the scene, contacting those involved in the collision, and making a drawing of the scene. The end result was his three page report and a citation issued to Riley for failure to yield. That citation was later dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b630 Styren makes two arguments on appeal in relation to Trooper Duram, although rather inartfully. First, Styren argues it was error to prohibit the admission of the \u2018facts of [Trooper] Duram\u2019s improper investigation\u201d at trial. This is presumably the report and related \u201cevidence\u201d gathered by the Montana Highway Patrol (\u2018MHP\u2019]) in response to a complaint made against Trooper Duram by Styren\u2019s counsel. Second, Styren argues it was improper to read Trooper Duram\u2019s deposition in lieu of his live testimony. We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">1. The Montana Highway Patrol Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\u00b631 Counsel for Styren filed a formal complaint against Trooper Duram in 2009, alleging his \u2018field notes and sworn testimony are clearly incorrect.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel wanted the \u201centire investigation\u201d to be \u201creviewed, corrected, and amends made to the parties who have improperly relied upon the training, honesty and reputation of the Montana Highway Patrol.\u201d According to a letter from the MHP, after an investigation, the complaint was sustained and some undisclosed disciplinary action was taken against Trooper Duram.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">\u00b632 At the pretrial conference, Roos moved to exclude evidence of the complaint, the report, and the conclusions of the investigation conducted by the MHP. The District Court ruled that \u2018ho mention of [formal complaints] is going to come in.\u201d Further, the District Court ruled that Styren was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>entitled to bring up inconsistencies that [Trooper Duram] may have made or mistakes he may have made in the investigation. There is to be no mention of any complaints or investigation by his-by the [MHP], no reference at all. The jury is to make a decision regarding his credibility and the valuation of the investigation he conducted, based on the evidence that\u2019s presented in this courtroom, and based on witnesses who can testify based on their own knowledge, not an investigation that was done subsequent by [the MHP].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b633 Styren called Sergeant Bender (Sgt. Bender) of the MHP to testify. Sgt. Bender was the person who investigated the complaint against Trooper Duram. He testified to the various measurements he made at the scene, which differed from Trooper Duram\u2019s measurements. Sgt. Bender did not testify about the complaint, but did say he was assigned to re-measure the scene by his captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b634 \u201c[F]actual findings resulting from special investigation of a particular complaint, case, or incident\u201d are inadmissible hearsay. M. R. Evid. 803(8)(iv); <em>Stevenson v. Felco Industries, </em>Inc., 2009 MT 299, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 352 Mont. 303, 216 P.3d 763. Our rulings on this issue have been \u201cunequivocal.\u201d <em>Stevenson, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b635 Styren has cited no authority to support its argument that the District Court erred in excluding the MHP report or its factual findings. Styren simply alleges it was an irregularity pursuant to \u00a725-11-102(1), MCA. However, conclusory allegations of error do not suffice. It is not our obligation to conduct legal research to support Styren\u2019s argument. <em>In re J.D.N., </em>2008 MT 420, \u00b6 16, 347 Mont. 368, 199 P.3d 189; M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f) (the argument shall contain citation to authorities.) Styren has not met its burden on appeal to demonstrate that the District Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">2. Trooper Duram\u2019s Deposition</p>\n<p id=\"AMf\">\u00b636 Styren alleges the District Court erred when it allowed Trooper Duram\u2019s deposition to be read into evidence at trial instead of requiring Trooper Duram to be personally present. Roos argues the District Court correctly concluded that Trooper Duram was not required to be personally present because he was unable to attend and testify because of illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b637 M. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3)(C) provides, in relevant part, that the \u201cdeposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds: ... (C) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment[.]\u201d Similarly, M. R. Evid. 804(b)(1) provides, in relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>part, that if a witness is unavailable, testimony given in a deposition may be used \u201cat the instance of or against a party with an opportunity to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination, with motive and interest similar to those of the party against whom now offered[.]\u201d Under that rule, a witness in unavailable when the witness \u2018is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity[.]\u201d M. R. Evid. 804(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b638 The District Court did not require Trooper Duram to be present because, according to a letter from his doctor, \u2018[Trooper Duram] is unable to sit for long periods of time due to recent surgical intervention\u201d on his back, and his doctor disqualified him \u2018from appearing in court for at least the next 6 months.\u201d The District Court said T am, in no way, going to require [Trooper] Duram to be present against medical advice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b639 Again, Styren has cited no authority to support its argument that the District Court erred in allowing Trooper Duram\u2019s deposition to be read in lieu of live testimony. For the same reasons stated in \u00b6 35, we conclude Styren has not met its burden on appeal to demonstrate that the District Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">B. Should a new trial be granted based upon defense counsel\u2019s misstatement during his closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b640 Styren argues that defense counsel \u201cmisstated the evidence by referencing false statements in his closing argument.\u201d The statement they argue was false was that Roos\u2019 brother Brandon spoke to Trooper Duram at the hospital and told Trooper Duram that Riley did not stop at the stop sign. They argue Brandon does not remember speaking to Trooper Duram at the hospital. This, according to Styren, constitutes surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">\u00b641 Roos argues that, while it is technically true that defense counsel misspoke, the nature of the mistake cannot constitute surprise. According to Roos, counsel simply referred to the wrong law enforcement officer in his closing argument-Brandon told a sheriffs deputy, rather than Trooper Duram, that Riley did not stop at the stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">\u00b642 A party seeking a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(3), MCA, must demonstrate: (1) the moving party was actually surprised; (2) the facts causing the surprise had a material bearing on the case; (3) the verdict or decision resulted mainly from these facts; (4) the surprise did not result from the moving party\u2019s negligence or inattention; (5) the moving party acted promptly and claimed relief at the earliest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>opportunity; (6) the moving party used every means reasonably available at the time of the surprise to remedy it; and (7) the result of a new trial without the surprise would probably be different. <em>Clark v. Bell, </em>2009 MT 390, \u00b6 30, 353 Mont. 331, 220 P.3d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b643 Styren\u2019s arguments in this regard are wholly without merit. While it is true that Roos\u2019 counsel said the wrong name, that does not in any way change the content of Brandon\u2019s statement. Brandon testified in his deposition, which was read to the jury, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">Q: Do you remember a sheriffs deputy coming?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">A: Yeah, I remember him showing up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Q: Do you know who it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">A: I can\u2019t remember who it was, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">Q: Do you remember what he asked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">Q: Do you remember what anybody said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">A: To the sheriff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">Q: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">A: I told him-he asked me what happened, and I told him that the other car drove through the stop sign and we were coming down the road and we hit him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-17\">Q: Did the officer talk to Sherry also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-18\">A: I\u2019m pretty sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-19\">Q: Do you remember the highway patrolman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-20\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-21\">Q: Do you remember seeing or talking to the highway patrolman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-22\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-23\">Q: Have you ever known [Trooper Duram]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-24\">A: Huh-uh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-25\">Q: Never talked to him, never seen him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-26\">A: Nope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-27\">\u00b644 The surprise argued here is that Roos\u2019 counsel got the name of the law enforcement official wrong. It is inconceivable that the name of the law enforcement official had any bearing whatsoever on the verdict. No matter who Brandon made the statement to, Brandon in fact made the statement. That is a point that Styren cannot, and does not, argue. It strains credulity to argue that the jury would have decided the case differently had defense counsel said \u201csheriffs deputy\u201d versus \u2018Trooper Duram.\u201d Styren has not met the elements under <em>Clark. </em>We agree with the District Court that a new trial should not have been granted due to surprise under \u00a725-11-102(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>C. Was the jury\u2019s verdict legal and supported by substantial evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b645 Here Styren argues that because the collision occurred in Riley\u2019s lane, there is no possible way the jury could have found that Roos was not negligent. Further, Styren argues the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cagainst the law\u201d because Roos failed to drive on the right side of the road in violation of \u00a761-8-321, MCA (Jury Instruction 25), or made an unsafe lane change in violation of\u2018Montana law\u201d (Jury Instruction 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b646 Roos argues that Styren ignores facts that were, and still are, in dispute to reach these conclusions, and that substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. Further, Roos argues that Styren\u2019s reading of Montana law is extreme.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b647  We agree with Roos and conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Roos was not negligent, and the verdict was not contrary to Montana law. While Styren alleges both errors of fact and law, the only real issues are issues of fact. Styren does not argue that the District Court erred in instructing the jury, but rather that the jury\u2019s conclusions under certain instructions violated the law. However, whether a legal duty was breached is a question of fact for the jury to decide. <em>Estate of Strever v. Cline, </em>278 Mont. 165, 175, 924 P.2d 666, 672 (1996). Similarly, whether Roos violated the statutes included in Jury Instructions 25 and 33 is also a question of fact left for the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6 31, 321 Mont. 210, 90 P.3d 394 (discussing evidence presented to the jury regarding sheriffs failure to comply with various statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b648  It was for the jury to decide between two competing sets of facts presented, both with evidentiary support in the record. Styren presented testimony that Riley stopped at the stop sign, then proceeded through the intersection and was not blocking Roos\u2019 path of travel in the eastbound lane of Midway Road. Styren wanted the jury to conclude that Roos was driving east in Riley\u2019s westbound lane, and therefore she was negligent. However, Roos presented testimony that Riley did not stop at the stop sign, but rather proceeded through the intersection where Roos, in an attempt to avoid hitting him, swerved into the westbound lane because Riley was blocking her path of travel in the eastbound lane. Roos wanted the jury to believe that Riley caused the collision by running the stop sign and obstructing her lane. The jury chose to believe Roos\u2019 evidence, which is precisely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>function of a jury. <em>Delaware v. K-Decorators, Inc., </em>1999 MT 13, \u00b6 50, 293 Mont. 97, 973 P.2d 818 (resolving conflicts in the evidence, judging the credibility of witnesses, and finding the facts are uniquely within the province of the jury). We find nothing in the record to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury\u2019s. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 62. There is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b649 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b76-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-11\"> The diagram is not drawn to scale, and is for illustrative purposes only.
