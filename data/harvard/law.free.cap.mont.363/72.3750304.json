Ward (Jack) appeals from an order of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, reducing Jack\u2019s one-half share of the Marjorie Q. Ward Revocable Trust by $298,356.16. Jack appeals two issues, which we have restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u00b62 Issue One: Did the District Court comply with the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (2009) by orally stating its findings of fact and conclusions of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">\u00b63 Issue Two: Did the District Court err in ordering that Jack\u2019s share of the Marjorie Q. Ward Revocable Trust be reduced by the amount he owed his stepsister, when that debt was previously discharged in bankruptcy proceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">\u00b64 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">\u00b65 In 1989, Jack, acting individually and on behalf of JW Enterprises, Inc., executed a promissory note in favor of his stepsister Joan M. Camp (Joan) for the amount of $100,000, plus interest at a rate of ten percent per year until paid. Although the promissory note was due within six months, neither Jack nor JW Enterprises, Inc., ever made a single payment to Joan.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">\u00b66 In 1992, Marjorie Q. Ward (Ms. Ward), Jack\u2019s mother and Joan\u2019s stepmother, executed a trust agreement, establishing the Marjorie Q. Ward Revocable Trust (Trust). Subject to certain smaller specific devises, including a $100,000 devise to Joan, the Trust provided that Trust residue be distributed in equal shares to Ms. Ward\u2019s two sons, Jack and James G. Ward (James).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">\u00b67 Ms. Ward amended the Trust in 1998 to provide that before Jack would receive any distributions from the Trust, his share would be decreased, and Joan\u2019s increased, by the amount he owed Joan under the promissory note at the time of Ms. Ward\u2019s death. Specifically, Section 4(c)(iii) of the Trust provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-16\">The residue of all trust income and principal, after the satisfaction of the specific bequests and devises above, shall at my death be distributed outright and free of trust to my sons, JACK L. WARD and JAMES G. WARD, in equal shares, if living. <em>Before </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>any distribution is made to my son, JACK, however, my Trustee is directed to first reduce JACKs share by any amounts he owes to my stepdaughter, JOAN, at the time of my death. </em>JOAN must provide written documentation to my Trustee of the exact amount owed by JACK, including any accrued but unpaid interest. My Trustee is then directed to pay that amount over to JOAN outright and my Trustee may then distribute to JACK the balance of his share.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b68 In 2005, Jack filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and received a discharge of his debt. Ms. Ward died on March 3, 2009. On that date, Jack owed Joan principal and interest under the promissory note totaling $298,356.16. Joan confirmed this amount to her stepbrother J ames, who is the Trustee of the Trust. In April 2010, the Trustee filed a petition in the District Court to determine the appropriate distributions under the Trust. Ruling from the bench, the District Court concluded Jack\u2019s share should be reduced by the amount he owed Joan on the date of Ms. Ward\u2019s death-$298,356.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b69 Jack appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b610 The interpretation of a trust agreement is a question of law that this Court reviews for correctness. <em>In re Bair Family Trust, </em>2008 MT 144, \u00b6 32, 343 Mont. 138, 183 P.3d 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">\u00b611 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court comply with the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (2009) by orally stating its findings of fact and conclusions of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">\u00b612 As an initial matter, we must address Jack\u2019s argument that this Court has to remand this matter because additional findings are required under M. R. Civ. P. 52(a), since the District Court\u2019s written order does not contain specific findings of fact or conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">\u00b613 M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (2009)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that \u201c[i]n all actions tried upon the facts without a jury ... the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon ....\u2019\u2019The requirement that a district court set forth the essential and determining facts upon which its conclusions rest aids not only a district court\u2019s process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>adjudication, but also this Court\u2019s appellate review. <em>In re Marriage of Lawrence, </em>2005 MT 125, \u00b6 15, 327 Mont. 209, 112 P.3d 1036. Rule 52(a) is met when the District Court orally states it findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record. M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (2009). Where the record does not contain sufficient findings of fact to support the underlying decision, this Court cannot conduct a meaningful review on appeal and must remand the matter to the district court to make additional findings. <em>In re Marriage of Banka, </em>2009 MT 33, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 349 Mont. 193, 201 P.3d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b614  We agree with Jack that the District Court\u2019s <em>written </em>order does not contain specific findings of fact or conclusions of law. However, our review of the record leaves us convinced that the District Court\u2019s <em>oral </em>findings of fact and conclusions of law are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 52(a) and to afford this Court the opportunity to conduct a meaningful review. Accordingly, we turn our discussion to Issue Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b615 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in ordering that Jack\u2019s share of the Marjorie Q. Ward Revocable Trust be reduced by the amount he owed his stepsister, when that debt was previously discharged in bankruptcy proceedings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b616 In construing the terms of a trust, the trustor\u2019s intent is the controlling consideration. <em>In re Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. 114, 120-21, 943 P.2d 981, 985 (1997). Both parties agree the Trust is clear: Ms. Ward intended both of her sons to share the Trust residue equally; however, if Jack owed money to Joan at the time of Ms. Ward\u2019s death, then Jack\u2019s share would be reduced by that amount. This dispute, then, centers upon whether Jack owed Joan money at the time of Ms. Ward\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b617 Jack argues he did not owe Joan any money at the time of Ms. Ward\u2019s death because any debt he owed to Joan was discharged in bankruptcy four years before Ms. Ward passed away. Jack relies upon a portion of the bankruptcy code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7524(a)(2) (2006), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">(a) A discharge in a case under this title [11USCS \u00a7\u00a7101 et seq.]-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">(2) operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Jack claims the bankruptcy statute is clear that his debt to Joan is discharged and, thus, if no liability exists under the bankruptcy code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>there can be no amount owing under the Trust. Jack further argues 11 U.S.C. \u00a7524(a)(2) prohibits Joan from pursuing any effort to collect on the debt and, similarly, enjoins the Trustee\u2019s efforts to distribute Trust residue to Joan.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b618 The District Court ordered that Joan be paid the money Jack owed her on the basis that Ms. Ward\u2019s intent controlled over any bankruptcy provision. We agree. The injunction provided for by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2) does not prevent a trustor from distributing trust property as he or she deems appropriate. <em>See In re Estate of Watson, </em>965 P.2d 409, 412 (Okla. Civ. App. 1998) (\u201cA testator is free to fashion bequests based upon previous gifts or loans[] and is free to reduce bequests in the amount of such loans, whether they are enforceable!] or unenforceable via discharge in bankruptcy or barred by limitations.\u201d). Thus, a court \u201cmay determine the indebtedness of a distributee and order a deduction of the debt from his [or her] share even though an action to recover the debt might be barred by a discharge in bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Estate of Watson, </em>965 P.2d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b619 Previously, in <em>Estate ofFirebaugh, </em>this Court similarly affirmed that a devisee\u2019s debt may be appropriately offset against his or her share of the estate, despite a prior discharge of the debt in bankruptcy. <em>In re Estate of Firebaugh, </em>271 Mont. 418, 422, 897 P.2d 1088, 1091 (1995). There, Kenneth Firebaugh was indebted to his mother Winifred. Kenneth filed for bankruptcy and received a discharge of his debt. However, Winifred\u2019s will provided that Kenneth\u2019s debt, if it exceeded the amount of her other son\u2019s debt, should be offset in order to treat her sons equally. <em>Estate of Firebaugh, </em>271 Mont. at 419-20, 897 P.2d at 1089-90. On appeal, Kenneth argued his share should not be offset by any debt because his debt was previously discharged in bankruptcy. <em>Estate of Firebaugh, </em>271 Mont. at 421, 897 P.2d at 1090. This Court concluded Kenneth\u2019s share should be offset by debts he owed his mother because to ignore the debt would thwart Winifred\u2019s clear intent, as reflected in her will, that her sons be treated equally. <em>Estate of Firebaugh, </em>271 Mont. at 421-22, 897 P.2d at 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b620 Further, to accept Jack\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cowes\u201d would defy this Court\u2019s rules of interpretation and would improperly impose a technical, legal definition upon the Trust terms, contradicting the clear intent expressed by Ms. Ward. It is well accepted that this Court looks to the language of the trust and interprets the Tw]ords used in the instrument ... in their ordinary and grammatical sense unless a clear intention to use them in another sense can be ascertained.\u201d <em>Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 121, 943 P.2d at 985 (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>quotations omitted). Jack\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cowes\u201d violates this principle, as it defies the word\u2019s ordinary and grammatical use, improperly injects technical bankruptcy principles, and defeats Ms. Ward\u2019s intent that Joan be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b621  The District Court did not err in reducing Jack\u2019s share pursuant to Ms. Ward\u2019s instructions contained in the Trust. The plain language of the Trust controls, and the bankruptcy provisions upon which Jack relies are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b622 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-12\"> All references herein to M.R.Civ.P. 52 are to the 2009 version, which was in effect during the time period relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b99-8\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AEn\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u00b623 For the same reasons I did <em>in In re Estate of Firebaugh, </em>271 Mont. 418, 423-24, 897 P.2d 1088, 1091-92 (1995) (Nelson &amp; Gray, JJ., specially concurring and dissenting), I dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">\u00b624 In pertinent part, Marjorie Ward\u2019s trust provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">Before any distribution is made to my son, JACK, however, my Trustee is directed to first reduce JACK\u2019S share <em>by any amounts he owes to my stepdaughter JOAN, at the time of my death. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">The simple truth is that, \u201cat the time of [Ms. Ward\u2019s] death,\u201d Jack did not <em>owe </em>\u201cany amounts\u201d of money to Joan. The very debt that Ms. Ward was referring to in the trust document had been fully discharged in United States Bankruptcy Court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2) (2006), which is set out in full at \u00b6 17 of the Opinion. Jack did not <em>owe </em>that debt to Joan at the time Ms. Ward died.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">\u00b625 Pursuant to the plain and unambiguous language of the Trust quoted above, it is irrefutable that because Jack did not <em>owe </em>Joan any money at the time of Ms. Ward\u2019s death, her trustee was-and in my view is-without any legal authority to deduct the amount of the discharged, and thus nonexistent, debt from Jack\u2019s share of the trust before distributing Jack\u2019s entitlement to him. Whatthe trustee is doing blatantly violates federal bankruptcy laws inasmuch as the trustee is refusing to honor the discharge order.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">\u00b626 If, <em>after </em>Jack\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy, Ms. Ward had determined to give Joan out of her estate a sum of money equal to what Jack had owed her stepdaughter <em>prior </em>to the discharge, then this would be a different case. But that did not happen here. Ms. Ward did not change the language of the Trust. And it is undisputed that, at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Ms. Ward\u2019s death, and by virtue of the order of the United States Bankruptcy Court, \u201cany amounts [JACK] owes to my stepdaughter JOAN\u201d simply did not exist. Jack had no legal obligation whatsoever to repay Joan the money he had borrowed from her. His debt to her had been discharged in bankruptcy. He did not \u201cowe\u201d Joan anything. \u00b627 When interpreting a trust, Montana courts \u201cmust look to the language of the trust agreement itself to ascertain [the trustor\u2019s] intent.\u201d <em>Cate-Schweyen v. Cate, </em>2000 MT 345, \u00b6 21, 303 Mont. 232, 15 P.3d 467 (citing <em>In re Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. 114, 120-22, 943 P.2d 981, 985 (1997)). Here, Ms. Ward\u2019s intent was clear: If,ai <em>the time of my death, </em>Jack <em>owes </em>Joan the money he had borrowed from her, then the trustee is to offset Jack\u2019s debt against his share of the trust, with the offset paid to Joan. If Ms. Ward had wanted to give Joan a post-discharge gift, she could have. For that matter, Ms. Ward could have given Joan a pre-discharge gift equal to the amount of money Jack owed his stepsister. The fact of the matter is, however, that Ms. Ward did neither. And the Court\u2019s present attempt to achieve what it considers to be a more equitable result not only replaces Ms. Ward\u2019s stated intent with its own, but, worse, reads out of Ms. Ward\u2019s trust the plain language she used and replaces that language with words of the Court\u2019s own choosing. It is neither this Court\u2019s job nor its prerogative to rewrite the unambiguous language of trusts and wills, even if the terms of the trust or will might seem inequitable to one of the parties. <em>Cf. In re Estate of Lucile B. Snyder, </em>2009 MT 291, 352 Mont. 264, 217 P.3d 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b628 As Jack correctly argues, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2) operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of any attempt to recover or offset the debt he at one time owed to Joan. This means that judgment creditors-here, the trustee on behalf of Joan-are prohibited \u2018from taking any action against debtors to collect the discharged debts.\u201d <em>In re Clowney, </em>19 B.R. 349, 353 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1982) (holding that the plaintiffs liability to the defendant was absolved as a result of the bankruptcy order and the defendants were barred from collecting debts from property of the plaintiffs). The granting of a discharge releases the debtor from personal liability on the discharged debt. <em>See Assocs. Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Cowen, </em>29 B.R. 888, 895 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 1983) OtA] discharged debt which was not properly reaffirmed is not cognizable as \u2018debt\u2019 in a subsequent proceeding without either a novation of the prior obligation or the creation of an entirely new debt.\u201d). Thus, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2) effectively and legally bars the trustee from paying over trust money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>to which Jack is legally entitled, to another-Joan-who is not legally entitled to receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b629 The bankruptcy discharge is designed to provide broad comprehensive relief to the debtor and to assure the debtor a \u2018fresh start.\u201d <em>Clowney, </em>19 B.R. at 353; <em>accord In re Holzapfel, </em>2011 MT 257, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 251, 262 P.3d 1114 (Wheat &amp; Nelson, JJ., dissenting) (\u2018People who are forced to file for bankruptcy are entitled to a fresh start.\u201d). \u2018This fresh start provides the debtor with a \u2018new opportunity in life and clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.\u2019 <em>\u201dClowney, </em>19 B.R. at 353 (quoting <em>Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, </em>292 U.S. 234, 244, 54 S. Ct. 695, 699 (1934)). This \u2018fresh start\u201d is assured. <em>Clowney, </em>19 B.R. at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b630 Finally, it is not clear what authority the Court relies on for the proposition that it need not give full faith and credit to the discharge order entered by the United States Bankruptcy Court and may instead do by way of \u201cequity\u201d what federal bankruptcy laws specifically prohibit. Indeed, were I the trustee in this matter, I would not be in a big hurry to pay more than a quarter of a million dollars to Joan, without first having the federal court put its own imprimatur on this Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b631 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
