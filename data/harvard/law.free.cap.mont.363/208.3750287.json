LMCC cross-appeals from the denial of statutory attorney fees. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err in ordering foreclosure of the construction </em>lien?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err in denying attorney fees to the parties?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">\u00b64 Martin owns land near Roy, Montana. Martin hired Baywood Homes (Baywood), a professional design and building company, to create a design concept for a dwelling to be constructed on his property. This dwelling was designed with a three-car garage on the lower level and upper living quarters. Custom dog kennels, similar to those Martin had constructed on three of his other properties, were also designed. Martin described the dwelling as a \u2018hunting cabin.\u201d Baywood helped Martin solicit bids from contractors for construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>of the dwelling, and LMCC was one of three contractors that submitted a bid. The bid request required an immediate start. Richard Miller, sole shareholder of LMCC, testified that he felt rushed when he calculated the bid but acknowledged that he could have declined to submit a bid. LMCC\u2019s bid was for $338,400.00, and Martin accepted the bid. LMCC and Martin then entered into a written contract that incorporated by reference the \u2018Bid and Specifications\u201d provided by LMCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b65 The exact costs of labor and materials on some components of the building were undetermined at the time the parties entered into the contract. Rather, LMCC included estimates of product and installation costs of these components. The estimates are called \u201callowances.\u201d Included in the contract price were the following allowances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">(a) Plumbing: $4,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">(b) Cabinets, counter tops, and vanities: $7,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">(c) Walk doors, handles, and locks: $500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">(d) Wood stove: $3,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">(e) Lighting fixtures: $5,000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">If actual costs exceeded these allowances during construction, such overruns were considered to be in excess of the agreed contract price of $338,400.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">\u00b66 The contract required that changes must be in writing (referred to herein as \u201cthe change order process\u201d). The contract included the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">(5) In the event Owner desires materials which exceed the specifications and drawings attached thereto, such materials shall be the subject of a separate written agreement in the form of a Change Order between the parties with respect to additional compensation due Contractor for the purpose and installation of such items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">(6) It is expressly understood that any changes, additions and deductions from the drawings and specifications herein must be agreed upon in writing by both parties hereto before the same can be effected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-14\">(7) Attached hereto and by this reference fully incorporated herein, is the Bid and Specifications which, unless specifically altered in writing between the parties hereto and unless contrary to the express provisions of this agreement, are binding and controlling upon the parties with respect to design and materials to be used. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>As the project progressed, many changes were made. According to the parties, the written change order process was used only once, adding the installation of cultured stone on the walls behind the stove, a 30-inch raised hearth, a one-ton capacity electric hoist and railing, and application of epoxy on the new concrete garage floor. These changes increased the bid price by $5,145.00. However, this \u201cchange order\u201d was attached to and signed at the same time as the construction contract. The contract price for the cabin was $343,545.00, which is the sum of the bid price ($338,400.00) plus the cost of the additions specified in the change order ($5,145.00). Thus, the \u201cchange order\u201d was in name only, and in reality constituted additional negotiation of the terms of the original contract, not a modification of it. Because the original contract incorporated these requests and increased the price accordingly, the actual change order process was never used.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\">\u00b67 Martin requested many changes, which LMCC implemented during construction. Although not in the Bid and Specifications, Martin requested that the handles on the cabinets and doors be changed to special deer antler handles, made by hand. Martin testified, \u2018I saw some of the antler work ... and I got the idea for antler pulls on the cabinets and doors. I asked [Miller] if he could have those made....\u201d Martin requested that LMCC install a water filtration system. He testified, \"... I wanted a five micron filter and a UV and ultraviolet light to make sure the water was pure that I would be consuming in the house.\u201d Martin requested that LMCC line the closets with cedar, install Plexiglas on the railings on the deck to reduce the wind, install log handrails on the stairs, and install a painted air conditioning unit because \"... the air conditioning unit, as purchased, was white and I wanted it to match the d\u00e9cor in the room ....\u201d Martin requested installation of a \u201cbuck pole\u201d for hoisting game, which required a pulley system, the pouring of a concrete base, and finishing to match the pole to the other wood used in the construction. Martin requested additional tile work that was not included in the allowances. Martin testified that he selected lights and heaters that exceeded the allowances. Other changes or additions that LMCC implemented included the use of hand-pounded, blacksmithed bolts on the decorative trusses along the cathedral ceiling, additional materials for the dog kennels, a firewood pulley system that was changed from bid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>to antique,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> revising the wiring for the lighting, decorative outlets and light switches, a different wood stove, and the addition of ghost wood wainscoting on the bedroom walls, among other items. Martin testified that he made payments above the contract price for some of these changes, but LMCC disputed the sufficiency of the payments. The change order process was never used.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b68 In addition to the changes Martin acknowledges, LMCC claimed that Martin requested further changes, which Martin disputed. One item was a custom cupola for the top of the cabin. LMCC claimed the original cupola was to be a standard structure but that Martin required LMCC to custom-build the cupola, which was installed. LMCC claims it had to custom-build wooden vents for placement on the dormers to match the wood used for the siding. LMCC argued that the contract called for wooden garage doors but that Martin requested the doors be the same as those installed at his Canadian home, which were steel. LMCC\u2019s bid states, \u2018Garage Overhead Doors Number 3 Size 9\u2019x9\u2019 Type Wood (See Plan),\u201d but Martin testified, \u201c[o]ur intent or, my intent, was to replicate exactly the garage door system and garage doors that we used in our Canadian home.\u201d The change order process was not used for these matters, and Martin made no payments for what LMCC claimed in additional construction and labor costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b69 The contract specifications called for skip-sawn cypress flooring, but Miller could not locate this material. After discussion, LMCC suggested Martin use a product called ghost wood as a substitute, to which Martin agreed. Again, neither party used the change order process. Installation of the ghost wood required planing and application of a gym-floor finish to counter the floor\u2019s tendency to give off slivers. Martin objected to additional labor costs, stating Miller \u201cshould have been diligent enough in the choice of ghost wood to have learned that it was going to require additional finishing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b610 Miller testified to his belief that the contract had been changed during the course of construction to a \u201ctime and materials\u201d contract, rather than a firm-price contract, because of the numerous changes Martin requested. He acknowledged that the parties did not create any writing that would indicate this change had taken place. Martin strongly disagreed, believing the contract remained one for a firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>price, subject only to his alterations.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">\u00b611 Throughout the course of construction, LMCC sent itemized invoices detailing costs and labor to Martin. Martin would make payments on these invoices. Martin sent several e-mails to LMCC requesting \u201ca reconciliation\u201d of the costs of the project. Miller responded once, telling Martin he would do his best to put something together, but he did not provide anything further. Miller testified, \u20181 was just confused with these e-mails because I knew we were working on a time and material basis and I was already sending him itemized costs with the billings of everything that was in it.\u201d When construction was completed, LMCC sent a final bill to Martin in the amount of $79,293.01.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b612 Martin refused to pay additional amounts, and LMCC filed a construction lien on the property. LMCC filed suit, seeking damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure of the lien. Martin counterclaimed for declaratory relief that the lien is invalid, to quiet title, for slander of title, for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction, fraud, and a request to pierce LMCC\u2019s corporate veil. Martin also filed a third-party complaint against Miller personally, alleging constructive fraud and actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"ASd\">\u00b613 The District Court held a bench trial. It granted foreclosure of LMCC\u2019s construction lien and awarded $62,649.51. It also ruled in favor of Martin on his counterclaim for LMCC\u2019s installation of a faulty roof and leaky windows and garage doors, awarding $10,260.20. The court denied LMCC\u2019s request for statutory attorney fees for prevailing on the construction lien foreclosure and denied Martin\u2019s request for contractually-based attorney fees for prevailing on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahn\">\u00b614 Martin appeals from the court\u2019s grant of the lien foreclosure and denial of contractual attorney fees, and LMCC appeals from the court\u2019s denial of statutory attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b615 We review the findings of a trial court sitting without a jury to determine if the findings are clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), M. R. Civ. P. Findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>substantial credible evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake. <em>Norwood v. Serv. </em>Distribg., Inc., 2000 MT 4, \u00b6 21, 297 Mont. 473, 994 P.2d 25 (citation omitted). In determining whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence, we will view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Norwood, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b616 A district court\u2019s determination of damages is a factual finding that must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. We will not overturn a district court\u2019s determination of damages unless it is clearly erroneous. Speculative damages are not recoverable. <em>Watson v. West, </em>2009 MT 342, \u00b6 18, 353 Mont. 120, 218 P.3d 1227 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b617 We will review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Norwood, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b618 <em>1. Did the District Court err in ordering foreclosure of the construction lien?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b619 The District Court did not enter findings that the contract was for a firm price rather than for time and materials, but that finding is clearly implicit in its ruling. \u201cAny findings not specifically made but necessary to the judgment are deemed to have been implied if supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Berry v. Romain, </em>194 Mont. 400, 407, 632 P.2d 1127, 1132 (1981). However, the District Court held that Martin waived the contractual provisions in the contract requiring changes to be in writing. In the District Court\u2019s words, \u201cthe evidence before the Court is unequivocal that Defendant made oral requests for change knowing that such changes were to be in writing. He requested a customized sink, antler door/cabinet handles, dog kennel water system, blacksmithing, patio decking, cedar-lined closet, etc., etc., etc.\u201d It further held that Martin\u2019s requests for additions and changes constituted executed oral modifications to the contract because LMCC had performed the changes at Martin\u2019s request, and Martin had already paid for many of the changes. The District Court found that Martin sent several e-mails that sought \u201cto indicate the contract price is determinative,\u201d but that these e-mails also demonstrated that Martin understood he had made changes to the project that affected the firm contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b620 Martin asserts the District Court misapprehended the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>evidence, and therefore its findings are not supported by substantial credible evidence. He argues the court misunderstood the effect of the e-mails, which then led the court to the incorrect conclusion that he waived the provisions requiring contract changes to be in writing, offering that he should \u2018hot [be] responsible to pay the alleged additional costs based upon the clear fact that Mr. Martin was continually holding Lewistown Miller to the Firm Contract Price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axq\">\u00b621  With regard to construction contracts, we have stated that \u2018Tw]aiver may be proved by express declarations or by a course of conduct so as to induce the belief that the intention and purpose was to waive.\u201d <em>Mathis v. Daines, </em>196 Mont. 252, 258, 639 P.2d 503, 506 (1982) (citing <em>Northwestern Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. </em>Pollard, 74 Mont. 142, 149, 238 P. 594, 596 (1925)). The District Court determined that Martin had waived the provisions requiring a writing because of his repeated oral requests for changes without himself complying or requiring LMCC to comply with them, as well as Martin\u2019s payments for some of the requested changes, giving LMCC the reasonable belief that it would be paid for all of the changes requested by Martin. We cannot disagree. As Williston has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-3\">In a basic sense, the concept of \u2018waiver\u2019 as an excuse for nonperformance is an equitable doctrine, designed to prevent the waiving party from lulling another into a belief that strict compliance with a contractual duty will not be required, and then either suing for noncompliance or demanding compliance for the purpose of avoiding the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Samuel Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>vol. 13, \u00a7 39.15, 564, (4th ed., West Group 2000). Martin cannot Tull[]\u201d LMCC \u2018into a belief that strict compliance with a contractual duty will not be required, and then... demand[] compliance for the purpose of avoiding the transaction.\u201d Williston, vol. 13, \u00a739.15,564. By his actions, Martin waived the right to require that changes be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b622 Alternatively, Martin argues that, if he waived the contract provisions requiring a writing, he only did so as to those changes for which he had already paid, citing <em>Matos v. Rohrer, </em>203 Mont. 162, 661 P.2d 443 (1983). Referencing \u00a728-2-1602, MCA, which provides that \u201c[a] contract in writing may be altered by a contract in writing or by an executed oral agreement, and not otherwise,\u201d Martin argues that the District Court erred by enforcing the changes as oral modifications to the contract because the modifications were not fully executed by both parties, in that he did not pay for all of them. Martin relies on <em>Winkel v. Family Health Care, P.C., </em>205 Mont. 40, 45, 668 P.2d 208, 210 (1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>and <em>Westfork Const. Co. v. Nelcon, Inc., </em>265 Mont. 398, 402-03, 877 P.2d 481, 484 (1994), for the proposition that \u2018ta]n oral agreement altering a written agreement is not an executed oral agreement within the statute authorizing modification of written contracts by an executed oral agreement unless its terms have been fully performed, and performance on one side is not sufficient.... An executed contract is one where nothing remains to be done by either party.\u201d <em>Winkel, </em>205 Mont. at 45, 668 P.2d at 210. In sum, Martin\u2019s argument is that, because he has not paid for many of the changes, despite LMCC\u2019s full performance, performance on both sides has not occurred, and therefore, the modifications are executory rather than executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b623 Martin does not cite authority demonstrating that a party\u2019s failure to make payment for requested services, provided by the other contracting party, renders such contract modification merely \u201cexecutory\u201d in all cases. Such a proposition would allow the party requesting changes to avoid the obligation to pay by simply refusing to pay after the changes were provided. While the payment is executory, the modification is supported by consideration and has been performed. Performance by the contractor has been obtained upon the owner\u2019s request and promise to pay. As stated in <em>Corbin on Contracts, </em>which discusses Montana\u2019s modification statute as well as similar statutes from California and New York:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">One party should not be deprived of a remedy when it performs in reliance on an oral promise of other [sic], A building contractor that performs extra work at the oral direction of the owner or the architect in reliance on an oral promise of compensation should be granted a remedy even though <em>the owner\u2019s promise of compensation </em>is still \u201cexecutory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Arthur L. Corbin &amp; Sarah Howard Jenkins, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>vol. 13, \u00a771.2 (3), 425 (Joseph M. Perillo, ed., rev. ed., Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. 2003) (emphasis added). This approach is supported by previous decisions of this Court. The footnote to the above-cited section of <em>Corbin </em>cites our decision in <em>Dalakow v. Geery, </em>132 Mont. 457, 318 P.2d 253 (1957). <em>See also Haines Pipeline Constr., Inc. v. Mont. Power Co., </em>251 Mont. 422, 830 P.2d 1230 (1991) (overruled on other grounds by <em>Porter v. Galarneau, </em>275 Mont. 174, 911 P.2d 1143 (1996)); <em>Matzinger v. Remco, Inc., </em>171 Mont. 383, 558 P.2d 650 (1976) (written contract modified by oral agreements and plaintiff entitled to compensation for work performed pursuant to oral modifications); <em>Gramm v. Ins. Unlimited, </em>141 Mont. 456, 378 P.2d 662 (1963) (written change order provision waived by defendant\u2019s conduct and plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>entitled to compensation because defendant cannot take advantage of his own omission to escape liability for work substantially performed); <em>Dalakow, </em>132 Mont. at 464, 465, 318 P.2d at 257, 258 (\u201cIn <em>Roberts v. </em>Sinnott... it will be noted that defendant did not in effect execute his part of the agreement, i.e., payment. This court however did not deny that an oral modification had been effected merely because of that fact ... in cases where there is adequate consideration for the oral modification and the party relying thereon has fully performed, the written contract will be enforced as modified whether or not the other party has fully performed on his part.\u201d) (citations and quotations omitted); <em>Roberts v. Sinnott, </em>55 Mont. 369, 177 P. 252 (1918) (written change order provision waived, oral modifications are valid despite defendant\u2019s failure to perform, i.e. pay, for the work performed by plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b624  <em>Westfork </em>does not stand for the proposition that a subsequent oral agreement is not fully executed and does not modify a prior written agreement if payment has not been made. In <em>Westfork, </em>we determined there was no subsequent agreement, not that the agreement had not been executed. <em>Westfork, </em>265 Mont. at 404-05, 877 P.2d at 485 (\u2018The evidence within the record provides only one reasonable conclusionAhat the written subcontract provided the terms of the agreement between the parties.\u201d). Martin also heavily relies on <em>Matos, </em>203 Mont. 162, 166 P.2d 443, but the facts there were different. The owners in <em>Matos </em>requested changes, but in so doing, \u201ctold [the contractor] Matos if he couldn\u2019t finish the house for between $ 90,000 and $ 91,000, then \u2018he and the workmen should just quit, and we would finish it as we could afford to.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Matos, </em>203 Mont. at 166, 166 P.2d at 445-46. However, the contractor continued to work. The trial court found that a firm ceiling on cost had been set, which the contractor had violated, and we affirmed. <em>Matos, </em>203 Mont. at 171, 166 P.2d at 448. Here, Martin attached no such ceiling to his requests. We conclude that Martin was obligated to pay for the changes he ordered during construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b625 Martin also challenges the District Court\u2019s calculation of the amounts he owed because LMCC\u2019s invoices submitted for materials and labor for the project did not indicate \u201cthe additional cost for each change in plans, and the costs for additional labor beyond the labor Lewistown Miller figured in its Bid and Specifications.\u201d Martin points to the District Court\u2019s reduction of LMCC\u2019s damage claim by the figure of 20% for LMCC\u2019s responsibility in causing the overages, which Martin says is illustrative of the speculative nature of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b626 The District Court did describe the evidence and testimony concerning damages as \u201cdisheveled.\u201dOur review of the record confirms this assessment, as the evidence concerning the communications and changes made during the course of construction did not lay a clear and concise story. However, it is evident that the District Court carefully considered the evidence, and, as the trier of fact, it was in the best position to assess the testimony and make ultimate determinations about each party\u2019s contributions to the overages. About Miller\u2019s bid, the court found that \u201c[b]y submitting a bid under rushed conditions, Miller admitted that LMC assumed the risk of under-estimating the costs of construction of the cabin,\u201d and that Miller \u201cadmitted he had some responsibility for the higher cost resulting from these problems because he did not have time to engineer the necessary support system.\u201d The court found that \u2018Miller admitted that he did not accurately bid either the decorative beams and trusses and the costs required to build the dog kennels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b627  Ultimately, good sense, rather than mechanical application of formulas, must be applied to determine damages. <em>Kebschull v. Nott, </em>220 Mont. 64, 66, 714 P.2d 993, 994 (1986). Based on our review of this record, we conclude the amount of damages determined by the District Court on the lien foreclosure matter was not clearly erroneous. The District Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence, and the conclusions of law are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b628 <em>2. Did the District Court err in denying attorney fees to either of the parties ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b629 Both parties argue they should have been awarded attorney fees. LMCC argues it is entitled to attorney fees on the lien foreclosure pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA. Martin argues he is entitled to contractually-based attorney fees for prevailing on his counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"Am1\">\u00b630  Whether or not a party is entitled to attorney fees is strictly a question of law, and we will review the district court\u2019s grant or denial of attorney fees for correctness. <em>Avanta Fed. Credit Union v. Shupak, </em>2009 MT 458, \u00b6 22, 354 Mont. 372, 223 P.3d 863. Section 71-3-124(1), MCA states, Tn an action to foreclose [a construction lien], the court <em>shall </em>allow as costs the money paid and attorney fees incurred for filing and recording the lien and reasonable attorney fees in the district and supreme courts. The costs and attorney fees <em>must </em>be allowed to each claimant whose lien is established ....\u201d (Emphasis added.) As noted by LMCC, the language of the statute is mandatory. The courts do not have discretion in determining when a party, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>has established its lien, is entitled to these mandatory attorney fees. <em>See Matzinger, </em>171 Mont. at 389, 558 P.2d at 653; <em>Hanzel v. Marler, </em>237 Mont. 521, 524, 774 P.2d 426, 427-28 (1989). Because LMCC established its lien, it is entitled to the statutorily mandated attorney fees, and the District Court erred in failing to award them.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">\u00b631 Martin argues he is entitled to attorney fees for prevailing on his counterclaim. Ordinarily, attorney fees are not awarded in contract disputes absent contractual or statutory authority. <em>Boehm v. Cokedale, LLC, </em>2011 MT 224, \u00b6 26, 362 Mont. 65, 261 P.3d 994. The contract between Martin and LMCC contains the following provision: \u201c15. If the institution of legal action by either party is necessary to enforce the provisions of this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs reasonable [sic] incurred relative thereto, including attorney s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b632  Generally, the party obtaining a net judgment is considered the prevailing party in an action involving a counterclaim. <em>Avanta Fed. Credit Union, </em>\u00b6 49 (citing Nod <em>and Rifle Inn, Inc. v. Giltrap, </em>273 Mont. 232, 235, 902 P.2d 38, 41 (1995)). \u2018The party that survives an action involving a counterclaim, setoff, refund or penalty with the net judgment should generally be considered the successful or prevailing <em>party.\u201d E.C.A. Envtl. Mgt. Servs. v. Toenyes, </em>208 Mont. 336, 345, 679 P.2d 213, 218 (1984) (citations omitted). Although Martin won on his counterclaim, he did not \u201csurvive[] [the] action ... with the net judgment.\u201d <em>Toenyes, </em>208 Mont. at 345, 679 P.2d at 218. As such, Martin is not the prevailing party and is not entitled to contractual attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b633 We reverse the denial of LMCC\u2019s attorney fees on the foreclosure and remand this matter to the District Court to determine the reasonable attorney fees due LMCC in conformity with the test for reasonableness set forth in <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, 314 Mont. 101, 64 P.3d 984. Because Martin\u2019s damages for LMCC\u2019s breach of the contract will be deducted from the damages and attorney fees Martin owes LMCC, we find it unnecessary to address Martin\u2019s request to pierce LMCC\u2019s corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b634 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> The District Court found that the \u2018hoist system for big game processing ... was changed from Bid to antique,\u2019\u2019but this is inconsistent with the testimony of the parties, both of whom stated that it was the firewood pulley system (sometimes referred to by the parties as the \u2018hay trolley\u201d) that was changed from bid to antique.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> The record reflects some discrepancy on the amount LMCC claimed. At trial, LMCC submitted evidence claiming it was owed $30,000 for labor and $48,311.89 for material costs in excess of the allowances, which totals $78,311.89 over the contract price, rather than the $79,293.01 stated in its final bill.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
