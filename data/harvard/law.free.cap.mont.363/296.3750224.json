We affirm. We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by imputing $90,000 in annual disposable income to Tony for purposes of calculating his child support obligation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it delegated the duty to appoint a parenting coordinator?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u00b64 <em>3. Did the District Court err when it did not follow the recommendation of the parenting evaluator that Tony be allowed\",'make up\u201dvisitation days for those days he missed visitation while working out of town?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">\u00b65 Sarah and Tony were married in 2002. They have two children together. In 2007, the couple separated, and in 2008, Tony filed for dissolution. Sarah is employed at a dental office, earning $17 per hour. Tony is self-employed and owns businesses that operate under the names \u2018Cowboy Junk\u201dand \u2018Sticker Dude.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Through these businesses, Tony sells apparel, accessories, and seasonal items at state and county fairs, concerts, festivals and other public events across the country. Tony travels from event to event and sets up booths from which he sells his wares. The District Court found that Tony was also \u201cengaged in various odd jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">\u00b66 Because Tony lives on the road when conducting business, he is able to take tax deductions from his gross income for many of his living expenses, such as lodging, vehicle payments, and meals. Because of these business deductions, Tony\u2019s annual taxable income from 2002-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>2009 ranged from around $11,000 to $26,000, although his businesses earned gross income during this time that ranged from $197,821 to $432,199.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b67 After Tony filed for dissolution, Sarah applied for child support services through the Montana Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED). CSED determined that Tony earned or was capable of earning $90,000 per year for child support purposes despite his relatively low taxable income and issued a temporary order requiring him to pay child support based on that amount. The temporary order was in place during the pendency of the dissolution action. The District Court likewise adopted CSED\u2019s imputation of $90,000 in annual income to Tony for child support purposes, declining Tony\u2019s request that his income be determined as reflected on his income tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b68 Dr. Stephen Wagner, the parenting evaluator, recommended that the District Court appoint a parenting coordinator because the parties were having difficulty communicating with one another about parenting issues. The court agreed, but instead of directly appointing a coordinator, it appointed a third-party to select the parenting coordinator for the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b69 Dr. Wagner also recommended that Sarah provide \u2018brake up\u201d days for Tony to exercise visitation with the children to substitute for those days Tony missed while working out of town. The court declined, finding that this process would be disruptive to Sarah and the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b610 Tony appeals the District Court\u2019s determination of $90,000 as his annual income for child support purposes, from its appointment of a third-party to select the parenting coordinator, and from its denial of Tony\u2019s request for \u2018brake up\u201d time.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u00b611 We review findings of fact in child custody determinations to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Graham, </em>2008 MT 435, \u00b6 8, 347 Mont. 483, 199 P.3d 211. We review an award of child support for abuse of discretion. <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Albrecht v. Albrecht, </em>2002 MT 227, \u00b6 7, 311 Mont. 412, 56 P.3d 339). A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts \u201carbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 7. Because the trial court is in a superior position to weigh the evidence, we will not overturn a child custody determination absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6 8, (citing <em>Czapranski v. Czapranski, </em>2003 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>14, \u00b6 10, 314 Mont. 55, 63 P.3d 499).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by imputing $90,000 in annual disposable income to Tony for purposes of calculating his child support obligation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b613 Tony argues the District Court erred by failing to adopt his taxable income, as indicated on his tax returns, as his income for purposes of child support because that was the only \u201cobjective,\u201d documented evidence of his income offered at trial. Tony contends that the $90,000 amount, which the District Court obtained from the CSED proceeding, was determined by CSED solely from Sarah\u2019s unsupported contentions that the couple under-reported their income or over-reported business deductions. He argues the District Court abused its discretion by ignoring the parties\u2019 income tax returns, which reflected annual taxable income of between $11,000 and $26,000, the testimony of Tony\u2019s tax preparer substantiating the tax returns, and a \u2018ho action\u201d letter from the IRS declining to audit the former couple\u2019s 2007 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b614 Sarah answers that the imputation of $90,000 was correct. She argues that Tony failed in his duty to provide credible evidence of a proper calculation of his income for child support purposes. Sarah attacked the credibility of Tony\u2019s accountant, Judy Barnes, at trial, offering that she is a close personal friend of Tony\u2019s, assists Tony on the road selling his wares and that, in 2008, 45 to 50% of Barnes\u2019s income was derived from Tony and his businesses. In 2006, Sarah did the bookkeeping for Tony\u2019s businesses. In conflict with Barnes\u2019s testimony, Sarah offered exhibits at trial to support her contention that the parties netted $86,524 after subtracting business expenses from sales. Sarah testified about the lifestyle the parties lived together and that Tony continues to live, offering that they were never hurting for money and enjoyed a \u2018$90,000 per year lifestyle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b615  A \u201cparent\u2019s disposable income rather than taxable income\u201dis the proper figure for determining child support obligations. <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 17. \u201c[A] district court must apply its discretion in a realistic manner, taking into account the actual situation of the parties.\u201d <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 7 (citation and quotations omitted). \u2018Income for child support includes actual income, imputed income, or any combination thereof which fairly reflects a parent\u2019s resources available for child support.\u201dAdmin. R. M. 37.62.106(1). This regulation further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">(6) \u2018Imputed income\u2019 means income not actually earned by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>parent, but which will be attributed to the parent based on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">(a) the parent\u2019s earning potential if employed full-time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">(b) the parent\u2019s recent work history;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">(c) occupational and professional qualifications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">(d) prevailing job opportunities in the community and earning levels in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">(7) Income should be imputed whenever a parent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">(a) is unemployed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">(b) is underemployed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">(c) fails to produce sufficient proof of income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">(d) has an unknown employment status;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">Admin. R. M. 37.62.106.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">\u00b6 16 During trial, the District Court engaged Tony\u201d s counsel as follows: The Court: Mr. Smith, I would like you to address this ... it\u2019s fundamentally unbelievable that he makes $11,000 a year.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-15\">Mr. Smith: That is what he makes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-16\">The Court: Okay. Fine. Okay. I just thought there might be something that I\u2019m missing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">In its order, the District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-18\">Tony stubbornly suggests to the Court that his annual earnings are approximately $11,000. The Court finds this suggestion to be inherently not credible .... [Tony\u2019s] businesses require Tony to travel around the United States to various county fairs and other events selling various items. Tony is also engaged in various odd jobs .... The Court notes that since the parties\u2019 separation, Tony has traveled to Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands, and Mexico. Even Dr. Wagner, in his June 10, 2010 letter (Ex. 14), states that \u2018his [Tony\u2019s] report of $14,000 as his income seems questionable in view of his lifestyle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">\u00b617 The District Court further found that Tony\u2019s trial testimony was inconsistent with his earlier reporting of income and expenses, stating \u201cthe Court garners that it is inconceivable that Tony could pay his monthly expenses, whether they be $4,800 or $3,600 on an annual income of under $12,000.\u201d It noted that \u2018Tony is deducting various expenses that people who are not self-employed would be unable to deduct,\u201d making it \u201cextremely difficult for anyone to calculate Tony\u2019s real income.\u201d The Court concluded, \u201cone thing is sure and that is that his real annual income is not $11,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">\u00b618 The court then noted that Sarah was familiar with the bookkeeping and tax operations of Tony\u2019s businesses and accepted her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>testimony about Tony\u2019s \u2018teal income.\u201dFollowing the lead of CSED, the District Court likewise imputed income to Tony \u201cin the neighborhood of $90,000.\u201d Although employing a slightly different support calculation than employed by CSED, and after considering Sarah\u2019s income, the court continued the child support obligation at the amount of $394 per month per child for an initial three year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b619 Imputation of income is appropriate when there is a failure \u201cto produce sufficient proof of income.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(7)(c). The District Court, which must determine \u201cthe strength and weight of conflicting testimony,\u201d <em>In the Matter of J.R., </em>2011 MT 62, \u00b6 65, 360 Mont. 30, 252 P.3d 163 (citations and quotations omitted), determined that Tony\u2019s evidence lacked credibility and concluded that Tony had failed to sufficiently prove his income for child support purposes. The court chose to believe the testimony of Sarah regarding Tony\u2019s income, and we will not \u201csecond guess the district court\u2019s determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony.\u201d <em>In the Matter of J.R., </em>\u00b6 65 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b620 Tony also argues that the only objective and documented proof of his annual income is his tax returns, citing to Admin. R. M. 37.62.108(2), which provides, \u2018Income of the parents must be documented. This <em>may include </em>pay stubs, employer statements, income tax returns, profit and loss statements.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As indicated by the emphasized language, this list of documentation is not exhaustive, and other documents may also provide the necessary proof. Here, the District Court relied upon a profit and loss statement Sarah had prepared for Tony\u2019s businesses in 2006. The court found that \u201c[t]his document was prepared during the period when Sarah was the bookkeeper for the businesses. In that document, she calculated Tony\u2019s net income for 2006 as being $86,000.\u201d Contrary to Tony\u2019s assertion that the District Court \u201cignored\u201dhis income tax returns, the testimony of Barnes, and the \u2018ho action\u201d letter from the IRS, it is clear from the record that the District Court considered this evidence but found it to be lacking in credibility and accepted Sarah\u2019s evidence instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b621  Finally, Tony obj ects to the District Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]t appears that Tony did not file any objection to CSED\u2019s calculations,\u201d and the implication that the court was adopting CSED\u2019s income calculation because of this failure to object. Tony argues that an objection was unnecessary because the issue of child support was properly before the District Court in the dissolution proceeding. However, given the thorough review of the issue by the District Court, it is evident that the matter was decided on the basis of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>submitted to the court, and it is unnecessary for us address this argument further. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in imputing $90,000 of annual disposable income to Tony.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b622 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it delegated the duty to appoint a parenting coordinator ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b623 The District Court determined that a parenting coordinator was necessary because \u201cthe parties stubbornly refuse to cooperate with each other, despite the negative repercussions that flow to their children.\u201d Both parties submitted a list of proposed coordinators, but the court noted that \u201c[i]t is not surprising, given the level of nastiness in this case, that the parties cannot even agree on this.\u201dSarah testified that she could not afford to pay someone to oversee the parenting plan. One of the persons on Sarah\u2019s list was Brooke Dolan, to whom Tony objected because she was \u201ca friend and purported landlord of Sarah\u2019s.\u201d Noting that \u201cthe Court knows Dolan to be a very responsible and levelheaded individual,\u201d the District Court, although not appointing Dolan to be the coordinator, nonetheless appointed her \u201cto select a parenting coordinator who lives in Broadwater County.\u201d Dolan then appointed a local pastor, observing that the pastor had once accompanied Tony to a meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b624 Without citation to authority, Tony argues the District Court erred when it delegated its duty to select a parenting coordinator to Dolan. Further, in his opening brief, Tony expresses no objection to the appointment of the pastor as coordinator. Thus, Sarah answers that the issue is frivolous, because \u2018Tony\u2019s only objection\u201d is that Dolan made the selection. In his reply brief, Tony acknowledges that he \u201cdid not mention Pastor Dexter in the Opening Brief, but should have,\u201d and belatedly challenges the pastor\u2019s appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b625 However, a party may not raise an issue for the first time in a reply brief. <em>In re Estate of Bovey, </em>2006 MT 46, \u00b6 11, 331 Mont. 254, 132 P.3d 510 (citing <em>Pengra v. Sate, </em>2000 MT 291, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 276, 14 P.3d 499); <em>see </em>M. R. App. P. 12(3). Tony did not argue that any harm had been done by the appointment of the pastor until his reply brief, thus depriving Sarah of an opportunity to respond to this argument. We decline to address the issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b626 <em>3. Did the District Court err when it did not follow the recommendation of the parenting evaluator that Tony be allowed i(make up\u201dvisitation days for those days he missed visitation while working out of town?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b627 Lastly, Tony asserts that the District Court abused its discretion by rejecting the suggestion by the parenting evaluator that Tony be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>allowed \u201cmake up\u201d days for the days of visitation he misses with the children when he is away working. Tony argues there was no evidence before the court justifying the court\u2019s determination that \u201cmake up\u201d days were unnecessary, but provides no supporting authority for the assertion that the District Court\u2019s determination on this matter was error. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f) (parties are to support their arguments with citations to authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b628 In rejecting the recommendation, the District Court reasoned that \u2018Tony is a good father. However, he is on the road a lot due to his various businesses. Therefore, the Court finds it would be disruptive for Sarah and the children to provide him with make up time.\u201d Sarah testified that when the children are with her, they follow a routine. She also testified that she gives the kids to Tony as much as reasonably possible when he is in town, even if it is on her allotted day.</p>\n<p id=\"Ackc\">\u00b629  \u2018Child custody cases often present the court with difficult decisions. We must presume that the court carefully considered the evidence and made the correct decision.\u201d <em>In re the Parenting of </em>N.S., 2011 MT 98, \u00b6 18, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863 (citation omitted). The District Court found that an effort to make up lost days would be disruptive to Sarah and the children, a finding that Tony does not challenge. After reviewing the record, we conclude that Tony has not demonstrated that the District Court \u201cacted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice,\u201d <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 7, in denying the request for make-up days.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, NELSON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-14\"> Tony also formerly operated Pun Time Souvenirs, but this business is no longer is existence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
